<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This case concerns a number of parties. The
                    three plaintiffs (“the Plaintiffs”) are:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_a"></a>(a)     Yeo Boong Hua, also known as
                        “Johnny Yeo”;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_b"></a>(b)     Lim Ah Poh, also known as “Michael Lim”;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_c"></a>(c)     Teo Tian
                        Seng, also known as “Raymond Teo”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The 1st defendant, Turf Club Auto Emporium Pte
                    Ltd (“TCAE”) and the 4th defendant, Turf City Pte Ltd
                    (“TCPL”), are nominal defendants. The other defendants are:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_a"></a>(a)     the 2nd defendant, Singapore Agro
                        Agricultural Pte Ltd (“SAA”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_b"></a>(b)     the 3rd defendant, Koh Khong Meng (“Roger
                        Koh”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_c"></a>(c)     the 5th defendant, Tan Huat Chye (“Tan
                    Senior”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_d"></a>(d)     the
                        6th defendant, Ng Chye Samuel (“Samuel
                    Ng”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_e"></a>(e)     the 7th
                        defendant, Tan Chee Beng (“Tan CB”) who is the son of Tan
                        Senior; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_f"></a>(f)     the
                        8th defendant, Ong Cher Keong (“Ong CK”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>I will refer to these eight defendants collectively as
                        “the Defendants”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       This action may be described as the latest saga
                    in a longstanding dispute between two business groups of a joint venture. The
                    two groups have been engaged in legal tussles with each other for more than 12
                    years. The Plaintiffs make up one group. The five individual defendants
                        <em>viz</em>, Roger Koh, Tan Senior, Samuel Ng, Tan CB,
                    and Ong CK make up the other faction along with SAA which is a company. However,
                    Samuel Ng has not taken any substantive role in the present action. I will refer
                    to these five individual defendants collectively as the “SAA
                    Group”. TCAE and TCPL are companies incorporated under the joint
                        venture.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> More will be said later on the
                    background of these two groups as well as TCAE and TCPL, but suffice to say for
                    now, these two companies are the subject of the dispute between the two
                    groups.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The Plaintiffs’ primary relief is to set
                    aside a consent order which they had entered into with the 1st to 6th defendants
                    (“the Consent Order”) on 22 February 2006. The Consent Order
                    was meant to settle the minority oppression actions brought by the Plaintiffs
                    for various reliefs including an account of profits of the joint venture. As it
                    turned out, disputes arose over the implementation of the Consent Order, and
                    these disputes have brought the parties into the courtroom on a number of
                    occasions. In the present action, the Plaintiffs’ goal is to set aside the
                    Consent Order. If they succeed, they intend to reinstate the minority oppression
                    actions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background facts</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The formation of the joint venture</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The joint venture between the two groups
                    concerned the development and operation of a site known as Parcel A of the
                    former Bukit Timah Turf Club (“the Site”). The Site was a large
                    plot of land (roughly 557,000 m<sup>2</sup>)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> located in Bukit
                    Timah.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       On 5 January 2001, the Singapore Land
                    Authority (“SLA”), which was then known as the Singapore Land
                    Office, invited tenders for the lease of the Site. An advertisement of the
                    tender invitation was published in the Straits Times on 5 January 2001 and
                    in the Lian He Zao Bao on 9 January 2001. Amongst other information, the
                    following was stated in the advertisement:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Tender of the State Property for Parcel A at former Bukit Timah Turf Club
                        with use as Commercial, Institution/ Community, Sports &amp; Recreation,
                        Residential; 3+3+3 years Tenure</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       To facilitate the tender exercise, SLA also put
                    up a Tender Notice<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> which
                    contained general information of the tender. In the Tender Notice, the
                    “duration of period contract” was stated to be “(From) 1
                    September 2001 … (To) 30 August 2010 …”. Under a section
                    called “General Information”, the tenure was described to be
                    “3+3+3 years”. The “Guide Rent” was $380,000 per
                    month. The “3+3+3 years” tenure was repeated under a section
                    called “Property Description”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       When the tender exercise closed on 2 March
                    2001, SLA received only two bids. The first bid was submitted by the Plaintiffs
                    through their own joint venture vehicle named Bukit Timah Carmart Pte Ltd
                    (“BTC”). All of them are businessmen who at the material time were
                    in the used car trading business. They had their own businesses but the three
                    also had experience working with each other before. For instance, on
                    15 March 2000, they incorporated Leng Kee Carmart Pte Ltd, a used car
                    centre which sublets spaces to car dealers.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> Today, they are still in this
                    trade.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The SAA Group used SAA to submit a second bid,
                    pursuant to a joint venture between the five individuals in the SAA
                        Group.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     SAA had previously developed a farm-style mall
                    known as “Farmart Centre” located near Sungei Tengah. Tan CB and
                    Ong CK were directors<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>
                    and shareholders<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> of SAA. Tan Senior, who is the father
                    of Tan CB, used to be a shareholder and director of SAA until he sold his
                    shareholding to Tan CB and ceased to be a director on 23 February
                        2001.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> Tan Senior
                    and Ong CK had been business partners for over ten years.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> The other two individuals, Roger
                    Koh and Samuel Ng, were neither directors nor shareholders of SAA. However, they
                    were business partners with Tan Senior in a separate company called Kallang Auto
                    Centre Pte Ltd (“Kallang Auto”) which sublets spaces to car
                    dealers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The SAA Group’s initial plan was to rely
                    on their internal expertise in developing the Site. Architects Group Associates
                    Pte Ltd (“AGA”), an architectural consultancy firm, would be in
                    charge of the architectural aspects. Ong CK was an architect. He was a
                    shareholder and principal director<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> of
                        AGA.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span>
                    Goodland Development Pte Ltd (“Goodland”), a construction and
                    property development company in which Tan CB was a director and
                        shareholder,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> would be in charge of the
                    construction works. Tan CB was previously working as a civil engineer at the
                    Housing and Development Board.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The two bids were both submitted on the tender
                    closing date of 2 March 2001. The Plaintiffs submitted a bid of $260,000
                    rent per month while the SAA Group submitted a bid of $390,000 rent per month.
                    The submissions were to take place at the SLA office which was formerly located
                    at 8 Shenton Way, #24-01 Temasek Tower, Singapore 068811. There, the Plaintiffs
                    bumped into Tan Senior, Roger Koh and Tan CB. Tan Senior and Roger Koh had been
                    acquainted with Raymond Teo previously through the car trading
                        industry.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> It was during this encounter that each
                    group came to know that the other group had placed or was planning to place a
                    bid for the Site. The two groups commenced discussions about jointly developing
                    and operating the Site, although there was some disagreement as to whether the
                    discussions commenced before or after the bids were submitted.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     A consensus was reached that the two groups
                    would enter into a joint venture to develop and operate the Site (“the
                    Joint Venture”). A Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) was
                    signed on 8 March 2001 by the Plaintiffs and the SAA Group (“the
                    Eight Individuals”). It is common ground that before the MOU was signed,
                    SLA had already released information on the identity of the bidders and the bid
                    amounts but SLA had not yet awarded the tender to either bidder. Even though the
                    Eight Individuals signed the MOU, parties disputed as to whether Tan CB and Ong
                    CK signed the MOU in their personal capacity or whether they entered into the
                    MOU using SAA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The salient terms of the MOU may be summarised
                    as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_a"></a>(a)     a new joint venture company
                        (“New Company”) would be incorporated to develop and operate
                        the Site;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_b"></a>(b)     Johnny Yeo, Michael Lim and Raymond Teo would hold 37.5% of the
                        shareholding of the New Company, and the remaining 62.5% shareholding would
                        be collectively held by the other group;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_c"></a>(c)     only shareholders are deemed to be directors of
                        the New Company; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_d"></a>(d)     the development of the Site would be jointly headed by AGA and
                        Goodland.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The Plaintiffs’ case was that the terms
                    of the Joint Venture were not exhaustively contained in the MOU. Apart from the
                    MOU, they alleged that there were two separate oral agreements between the Eight
                    Individuals. The first was entered into on 2 March 2001 before the signing

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Eight Individuals who were party
                        to the Joint Venture would jointly exploit the lease of the Site in equal
                        shares of 12.5% each.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_b"></a>(b)     The lease of the Site would be held beneficially by the Eight
                        Individuals jointly so long as SLA continued to grant leases to either the
                        Plaintiffs or SAA.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_c"></a>(c)     Instead of the New Company, two newly incorporated Joint Venture
                        companies, TCAE and TCPL (“the JV Companies”), would develop
                        the Site. The previous name of TCAE was Turf Club Auto Megamart Pte
                            Ltd.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> The JV Companies would sublease the Site
                        from either BTC or SAA on identical terms as the lease between BTC/SAA and
                        SLA.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_d"></a>(d)     The
                        monthly rent of the sub-tenancies between SAA and the JV Companies would be
                        fixed at 3% above the tender rate payable by SAA to SLA.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     It was the Plaintiffs’ case that flowing
                    from the alleged oral agreements and the MOU, there was an understanding that so
                    long as a head lease was in place between SAA/BTC and SLA, the JV Companies
                    would be granted sub-tenancies on identical terms (“the Back-to-Back
                    Arrangement”). The Defendants disputed the existence of the two oral
                    agreements and the existence of the Back-to-Back Arrangement, but they agreed
                    that subsequent to the MOU there was an oral agreement to form two joint venture
                    companies instead of one.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> The
                    parties spent a significant part of the trial arguing about the existence of the
                    Back-to-Back Arrangement although the outcome of the present action does not
                    turn on whether this arrangement did in fact exist before the Consent Order was
                    recorded.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     It was not really disputed that the parties to
                    the Joint Venture agreed that the business model of the JV Companies was to
                    develop part of the Site into a used car centre and the areas known as the Main
                    and the North Grand Stands into a shopping mall (“the Project”).
                    TCAE would operate the used car centre and TCPL would operate the shopping
                        mall.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> The JV Companies would then rent or
                    license out individual lots or units to ultimate tenants or licensees. The rent
                    or license fees payable by the ultimate tenants/licensees would form the main
                    source of revenue for the JV Companies. The JV Companies would bear all costs of
                    developing and operating the Site as well as incidental costs. The JV Companies
                    would pay an aggregate monthly rent comprising the same amount as the head lease
                    rent plus 3% of its gross monthly rental income to the head leasee, which would
                    hold the head lease from SLA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     On 25 April 2001, SLA wrote to inform SAA
                    that its bid was accepted.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> The acceptance letter stated
                    that the term of tenancy would be three years with an option to renew for a
                    three-year term plus a further option for a three-year term. The grant of the
                    options was stated to be at the absolute discretion of the Collector of Land
                    Revenue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     On 10 July 2001, SLA and SAA formally
                    entered into a tenancy agreement (“the 2001 Head Lease”). A Draft
                    Tenancy Agreement previously attached to the Tender Notice dated 5 January
                    2001 was adopted for the 2001 Head Lease. The tenure of the 2001 Head Lease was
                    stipulated in two clauses. Clause 1(1) of the 2001 Head Lease stated that the
                    lease period was three years starting from 1 September 2001 at a monthly rent of
                    $390,000. Clause 1(3) stated that “[t]he Landlord may at his absolute
                    discretion grant a fresh tenancy for a further term of 3 years subject to new
                    terms and conditions and revision of rental upon the expiration of the term
                    hereby created.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     With the successful procurement of the head
                    lease, SAA entered into separate sub-tenancy agreements with TCAE and TCPL on
                    the same day for a period of three years less one day from 1 September 2001
                    to 30 August 2004 (“the 2001 STAs”). In line with the
                    business model outlined at [17], the multi-story carpark at 720 Dunearn Road,
                        Singapore<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> was
                    subleased to TCAE (under its previous name <em>viz</em>,
                    Turf Club Auto Megamart Pte Ltd) to be developed into a used car centre while
                    the Main and North Grandstands<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> were subleased to TCPL to be developed
                    into a shopping mall. TCAE and TCPL would each pay a gross monthly rent of
                    $195,000 to SAA (making a total of $390,000 rent per month) plus 3% of its gross
                    rent or license fee per month (instead of 3% of the rent payable by SAA to SLA).
                    Notably, the 2001 STAs contained an “Option to Renew” clause
                    (found in paragraph 7 of Schedule 1) which purportedly granted the JV Companies
                    two options to renew the three-year tenancy for a period of three years
                    each.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     In the meantime, renovation works began
                    shortly after SAA was notified that it was the successful bidder. In accordance
                    with the MOU, Goodland and AGA were appointed to be in charge of the
                    construction and architectural aspects of the Project respectively. On
                    14 June 2001, 26 October 2001 and 26 November 2001, TCPL
                    purportedly awarded Goodland contracts for $5m, $6.1m and $1.85m respectively
                    for Phases 1, 2 and 3 of the renovation works.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     On 25 June 2001, the Eight Individuals
                    were appointed as directors of TCPL.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> As for TCAE, Tan Senior and Ong CK

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     As the renovation works were being carried
                    out, disagreements arose between the Plaintiffs and the SAA Group. The
                    Plaintiffs raised concerns over the accounts and finances of the JV Companies.
                    On 17 April 2002, the Plaintiffs appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
                    (“PwC”) to review the accounts of the JV Companies to check
                    whether there was any irregularity.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> On 26 April 2002, Johnny Yeo made
                    a formal request to Ong CK by way of letter to inspect documents and accounting
                    records of the JV Companies.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> A similar request was made to

                    Plaintiffs, the Defendants put up many obstacles to prevent them from carrying
                    out a proper review of the JV Companies’ accounts and finances. Several
                    other disputes arose between the parties.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The disputes culminated in the commencement of
                    two minority oppression actions after the Plaintiffs were not re-elected to
                    TCPL’s Board of Directors on 16 August 2002.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> Raymond Teo was, however, still a director
                    of TCAE. On 15 November 2002, Johnny Yeo and Michael Lim commenced
                    Originating Summons No. 1634 of 2002/D (“OS 1634/02”) for various
                    reliefs including an order to restrain TCPL from amending its Articles of
                        Association.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span> TCPL, SAA, Tan Senior, Samuel Ng and
                    Roger Koh were named defendants in OS 1634/02. Raymond Teo was originally a
                        defendant<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span> in OS 1634/02 but was added as a plaintiff
                    on 28 May 2004.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     On or about 25 August 2004, the Plaintiffs
                    commenced Suit No. 703 of 2004/S (“S 703/04”) for various reliefs
                    including an account of profits involving TCAE.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span> TCAE, SAA and Roger Koh were named
                    defendants in S 703/04. OS 1634/02 and S 703/04 were consolidated on 28 January
                    2005 (“the Consolidated Suits”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> Tan CB and Ong CK were not sued by the
                    Plaintiffs in the Consolidated Suits.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     While the Consolidated Suits were ongoing,
                    Samuel Ng, Tan Senior and Ong CK were adjudged bankrupts on 25 April 2003, 29
                    August 2003 and 5 March 2004 respectively. Due to their bankruptcy the three
                    individuals could no longer hold onto their directorships in the JV Companies,
                    leaving Tan CB and Roger Koh as the ones formally in charge of the operations of
                    the JV Companies from 2004 onwards (save that Raymond Teo was a director of TCAE
                    until 15 November 2006 when he did not get re-elected<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span>). Following
                    the bankruptcy of Tan Senior, the Plaintiffs did not apply for leave to continue
                    the Consolidated Suits against him.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span>
                    This went on until 2009 when the Plaintiffs decided to reinitiate legal action
                    against him by naming him as one of the defendants in the present suit. As for
                    Ong CK, he was never named as a defendant in the Consolidated Suits to begin
                    with since the commencement of proceedings in 2002. It was only in the present
                    suit that he was named a defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Leases entered into in 2004</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     While the court proceedings were pending, the
                    2001 Head Lease and the 2001 STAs expired. On 10 September 2004, SLA granted SAA
                    another lease of the Site for a period of three years from 1 September 2004
                    (“the 2004 Head Lease”). The rent payable by SAA was reduced to
                    $260,000 per month because of poor economic conditions during the renewal. The
                    2004 Head Lease contained a “Renewal of Tenancy” clause as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b><u>Clause 2- Renewal of Tenancy</u></b>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Clause 2.1 is <em>in pari materia</em>

                    above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     On the same day of 10 September 2004, SAA
                    entered into sub-tenancy agreements with TCAE and TCPL respectively for a period
                    of three years less one day from 1 September 2004 to 30 August 2007
                    (“2004 STAs”). The 2004 STAs involved the same areas as the 2001
                    STAs. The monthly rent payable by TCAE and TCPL was $130,000 each (making a
                    total of $260,000 per month) plus 3% of each JV Company’s gross monthly
                    rental/license fee income. However, unlike the 2001 STAs, the 2004 STAs did not
                    include an “Option to Renew” clause. Raymond Teo – who was
                    still a director of TCAE then (until his removal on 15 November
                        2006)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span>

                    they were not shown the 2004 Head Lease and 2004 STAs because by then they were
                    no longer directors of TCPL although Raymond Teo was still a director of

<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>I will refer to
                        parties (b) to (g) as the “Defendants (CO)” instead of the
                        “Defendants” because Tan CB and Ong CK were neither defendants
                        in the Consolidated Suits nor parties to the Consent
                Order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The aim of the Consent Order was to settle the
                    Plaintiffs’ allegations made in the Consolidated Suits and put an end to
                    the Joint Venture by extricating the Plaintiffs or the SAA Group from the JV
                    Companies. Broadly speaking, a three-stage mechanism was embodied within the
                    Consent Order to achieve these goals: (1) an investigation of the
                    Plaintiffs’ allegations including whether various costs and expenses
                    incurred by the JV Companies in the course of renovating the Site were
                    reasonable; (2) a valuation of the JV Companies; and (3) a closed bidding
                    exercise.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     At the end of the bidding exercise, the higher
                    bidder would purchase the respective shares of the lower bidder (clause 9(d)).
                    The lower bidder would also resign from their directorship positions in the JV
                    Companies (clause 9(f)). An important clause, which I shall elaborate more upon
                    later, was that if the higher bidder were the Plaintiffs, the Defendants (CO),
                    in particular SAA, were to use their best endeavours to transfer SAA’s
                    head lease with SLA to the JV Companies (clause 9(g)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Two entities were appointed to implement the
                    Consent Order. KPMG Business Advisory Pte Ltd (“KPMG BA”) was in
                    charge of the investigation aspect while KPMG Corporate Finance Pte Ltd
                    (“KPMG CF”) was in charge of the valuation aspect. KPMG CF was
                    also to supervise the bidding exercise.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The Consent Order contained certain timelines.
                    Both the investigation and the valuation exercises were to be completed within
                    60 days of the date of appointment of KPMG BA (“the IV Date”)
                    unless parties agreed in writing to a different time period (clause 2). Within
                    one week from the IV Date, all decisions, findings and conclusions as determined
                    by KPMG CF in the conduct of the valuation exercise were to be contained in a
                    written report (“Valuation Report”) to be submitted to the Consent
                    Order Parties. Within 28 working days of the receipt of the Valuation Report,
                    the bidding exercise was to be carried out (clause 9). The bidding exercise
                    would be completed within two working days of receipt of each party’s bid
                    (if any) (clause 9(b)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Clauses 4, 6 and 11 were put in place to
                    facilitate a fair implementation of the Consent Order.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_a"></a>(a)     Clause 4 stated that the parties
                        “may refer any and all matters which they deem relevant to the
                        Independent Valuer for his consideration and
                    review”.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_b"></a>(b)     Clause 6 placed an obligation on both parties to provide KPMG BA and KPMG
                        CF “full access” to certain documents that they “may
                        require”. It also stated that KPMG CF was at liberty to engage an
                        independent Quantity Surveyor (“QS”) as it deemed necessary or
                        appropriate for the purposes of the Investigation and Valuation
                        Exercises.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_c"></a>(c)     Clause 11 imposed an obligation on both parties to preserve the value of
                        the JV Companies when the Consent Order was still in operation. Both parties
                        undertook not to do anything that would affect the assets and ongoing
                        liabilities of the JV Companies, including anything which would
                        “affect, vary and/or alter the status quo” of the JV
                        Companies, “including but not limited to doing anything to affect the
                        head lease between [SAA and SLA] and sub leases presently entered into
                        between [SAA and the JV Companies].”</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Implementation of the Consent Order</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     On 25 April 2006, both KPMG entities were
                    formally appointed by the Consent Order Parties to perform the tasks stipulated
                    under the Consent Order.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span>
                    Based on the timelines envisaged in the Consent Order, the IV Date was supposed
                    to be 25 June 2006. Consequently, the Valuation Report was to be submitted to
                    the Consent Order Parties by 2 July 2006. However, the investigation and
                    valuation exercises were delayed as parties were unable to agree on the fees of
                    appointing a second QS to replace the first QS who was no longer prepared to be
                    involved in the investigation exercise. The deadlock culminated in KPMG BA
                    writing to inform the Consent Order Parties on 3 August 2007 as
                        follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As we have not received any objection from both the Plaintiffs and
                        Defendants to complete the valuation exercise without the appointment of an
                        independent quantity surveyor and in order not to protract the matter
                        further, we will proceed to finalise the valuation report.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>KPMG CF proceeded to issue the Valuation Reports for TCPL and
                        TCAE on 10 August 2007. This was more than 13 months after the deadline
                        envisaged under the Consent Order. In both reports, TCAE and TCPL were
                        valued as at 31 May 2006.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     In the meantime, unknown to both KPMG entities
                    and the Plaintiffs,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span> SAA had procured an in-principal
                    renewal of the 2004 Head Lease with SLA as early as 8 September
                        2006.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_52" id="Ftn_52_1"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span> SAA then
                    formally entered into a tenancy agreement with SLA on 22 May 2007 for the
                    Site for a term of 3 years from 1 September 2007 (“2007 Head
                        Lease”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_53" id="Ftn_53_1"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span>
                    The monthly rent was $260,000. This time round, SAA did not grant corresponding
                    sub-tenancies to the JV Companies. The 2007 Head Lease was not disclosed by the
                    Defendants (CO) to the KPMG entities or the Plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     As a result of the above non-disclosure, the
                    Valuation Reports did not take into account any head lease or sub-tenancies for
                    the period between 1 September 2007 and 31 August 2010. Both Valuation
                    Reports stated at para 5.6 that “[a]s at [10 August 2007], [KPMG]
                    have not received any confirmation from [TCPL and TCAE] that the said lease
                    would be extended for another term of three years”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     On 17 August 2007, AsiaLegal wrote to
                    KPMG BA expressing shock over para 5.6 of the Valuation Reports as they had come
                    to understand that the head lease between SAA and SLA had actually been renewed
                    prior to the issuance of the Valuation Reports. They called for the Valuation
                    Reports to be reissued to take into account the renewal.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_54" id="Ftn_54_1"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     It was not until 23 August 2007 that
                    Rajah &amp; Tann disclosed to KPMG BA and the Plaintiffs about the existence of
                    the 2007 Head Lease and SAA’s non-renewal of the sub-tenancies with the JV
                    Companies. By way of a letter, Rajah &amp; Tann stated as follows, at paragraph
                        2:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_55" id="Ftn_55_1"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.    We are instructed that the Principal Tenancy

                            on the other hand, have not been renewed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Claiming that the non-renewal of the
                    sub-tenancies constituted a breach of clause 11 of the Consent Order, AsiaLegal
                    wrote to KPMG BA on 25 August 2007 seeking a confirmation from Rajah &amp;
                    Tann by 27 August 2007 that SAA would renew the sub-tenancies. Rajah &amp;
                    Tann replied to AsiaLegal on 29 August 2007, rejecting their request. They
                    disagreed that “the Consent Order extends to the renewal of the Principal
                    Tenancy Agreement”. They also disagreed that the Consent Order had placed
                    an obligation on SAA to renew the sub-tenancies with the JV
                        Companies.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_56" id="Ftn_56_1"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span>
                    Rajah &amp; Tann were against the reissuance of the Valuation Reports and
                    pressed for the bidding exercise to be conducted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     KPMG BA also responded to the disclosure made
                    by Rajah &amp; Tann on 23 August 2007. In a letter dated 29 August
                    2007, it recommended that the Valuation Reports be revised as the Valuation
                    Reports were done on the basis that the 2004 Head Lease might not be renewed.
                    However, in the light of the reluctance of the Defendant (CO) for the Valuation
                    Reports to be revised, it wrote to the parties again on 12 September 2007
                    to clarify that parties remained bound by the Valuation Reports until they were
                    able to reach an agreement for a new report to be issued.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Disputes over the implementation of the Consent Order</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Plaintiffs applied to court for the Consent Order to take into

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     By September 2007 it became clear that SAA
                    would not be granting corresponding sub-tenancies to the JV Companies. On
                    13 September 2007 the Plaintiffs filed Summons 4117 of 2007/X (“SUM
                    4117”) to apply for, <em>inter alia</em>, an order
                    that the Valuation Reports dated 10 August 2007 be revised and/or reissued
                    by KPMG CF taking into account the 2007 Head Lease.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_57" id="Ftn_57_1"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span>
                    SUM 4117 was heard by Justice Chan Seng Onn on 19 and 22 November 2007.
                    Chan J granted leave to the Plaintiffs to amend the application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The amended SUM 4117 (“SUM 4117
                    (amended)”) was filed on 25 January 2008.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_58" id="Ftn_58_1"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span> The
                    Plaintiffs asked for an order that the Consent Order be clarified and/or varied.
                    In particular, it asked for clause 9(g) to be amended to expressly provide that
                    SAA would assign the 2007 Head Lease to the JV Companies should the Plaintiffs
                    win the bidding exercise. In the event that SLA was not agreeable to the
                    transfer, SAA was to grant sub-tenancies to the JV Companies on identical terms
                    as the 2007 Head Lease and it was also to transfer all sub-tenancies and/or
                    licenses between SAA and the ultimate tenants to the JV Companies. It asked for
                    a revaluation exercise to be conducted based on these terms.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Choo J heard SUM 4117 (amended). On
                    23 June 2008, Choo J delivered a written judgment dismissing the
                    Plaintiffs’ application (<em>Yeo Boong Hua and others v
                        Turf City Pte Ltd and others and another suit</em> [2008] 4 SLR(R)
                        245).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_59" id="Ftn_59_1"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span> He was of the view that a preliminary issue was
                    whether the court had jurisdiction to hear the application and that any
                    allegation of a breach of the Consent Order ought to have been brought in a
                    separate claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The Plaintiffs’ failure in overcoming
                    the jurisdiction issue would have been sufficient grounds to dismiss the appeal.
                    Nevertheless, Choo J also discussed the allegations of breach of the Consent
                    Order and held that “upon a proper construction of the Consent Order
                    … [the] allegations are unfounded because no such obligations existed on
                    the part of the defendants” (at [11]). This holding relating to the
                    construction of the Consent Order (at [16]–[26]) features strongly in the
                    defence of Tan CB, Roger Koh and SAA in the present action. These defendants
                    argued that the Plaintiffs are precluded from re-litigating issues that had
                    previously been argued before and decided by Choo J.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The Plaintiffs did not appeal against Choo

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Both applications came before Choo J. On
                    12 January 2009, Choo J dismissed the Plaintiffs’ application and
                    ordered the bidding exercise to proceed. In his grounds of decision delivered on
                    12 February 2009 (<em>Yeo Boong Hua and Others v Turf City
                        Pte Ltd and Others and Another suit</em> [2009] SGHC 34), Choo J
                    explained that he was not persuaded by the reason given by the Plaintiffs to
                    substantiate why the bidding exercise could not be proceeded with. The
                    Plaintiffs’ reason was that they had commenced a fresh suit against the
                    Defendants. Choo J concluded that the Plaintiffs’ new cause of action
                    “should proceed independently” (at [2]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The Plaintiffs appealed against Choo J’s
                    decision of 12 January 2009 by way of Civil Appeal No. 6 of 2009/Z
                    (“CA 6/2009”). The appeal was allowed on 7 July 2009. The
                    Court of Appeal rescinded the bidding exercise which was supposed to be held on

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     As alluded to above, before SUM 4848 and SUM
                    5373 were heard by Choo J, the Plaintiffs separately commenced the present
                    action on 8 January 2009 to set aside the Consent Order on the grounds of
                    repudiatory breach, frustration and mistake. The inspiration for this move came
                    perhaps from Choo J’s earlier decision concerning SUM 4117 (amended),
                    where he mentioned that “[a]ny allegation of breach of the Consent Order
                    ought to be brought in a separate action” (at [11]) (see also [44]
                    above). In addition, the Plaintiffs claimed breach of fiduciary duties. The
                    Plaintiffs also claimed conspiracy and knowing assistance in depriving the
                    Plaintiffs of the benefit of the 2007 Head Lease.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_62" id="Ftn_62_1"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The Defendants applied to strike out the
                    action on the grounds that, <em>inter alia</em>, it
                    disclosed no reasonable cause of action. On 19 November 2009, AR Then Ling
                    (“AR Then”) struck out all of the Plaintiffs’ claims except
                    the claim based on frustration. The Plaintiffs filed an appeal against AR
                    Then’s decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     The appeal was heard by Choo J and it was
                    dismissed on 7 April 2010. For the second time, the Plaintiffs appealed
                    against Choo J’s decision. This was by way of Civil Appeal No. 71 of 2010
                    (“CA 71/2010”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_63" id="Ftn_63_1"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     By the time CA 71/2010 was ready to be heard,
                    the Plaintiffs’ newly appointed solicitors Central Chambers Law
                    Corporation (“CCLC”) wrote to the Registrar on 19 November 2010 to
                    seek leave from the Court of Appeal to use a revised version of the Statement of
                    Claim (Amendment No. 2) (“Revised SOC”). On 11 February 2011,
                    after hearing the parties, the Court of Appeal granted the Plaintiffs leave to
                    file and serve the Revised SOC. In other words, the Plaintiffs’ appeal was
                    effectively allowed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Summary dismissal of the action</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     The present suit was originally set down for a
                    15-day trial before Choo J. However, during a hearing held on 17 October
                    2012, Choo J gave the following directions:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Parties to agree facts and submit on first main issue – whether the
                        Consent Order is to be set aside</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">- from which point ie nature of setting aside</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Second main issue – what remedies if any do the plaintiffs have in
                        the event –</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a) the Consent Order is set aside</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b) the Consent Order is not set aside</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Further conduct of trial adjourned to after decision/directions regarding
                        setting aside of Consent Order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     The Plaintiffs filed their written submissions
                    on 23 October 2012 and the Defendants filed theirs on 30 October 2012.
                    On 2 November 2012, Choo J dismissed the Plaintiffs’ claim (refer to
                    his grounds of decision delivered on 12 November 2012 (<em>Yeo Boong Hua and others v Turf Club Auto Emporium Pte Ltd and
                        others</em> [2012] SGHC 227) for more details).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     For the third time, the Plaintiffs filed an
                    appeal against Choo J’s decision by way of Civil Appeal No. 156 of 2012
                    (“CA 156/2012”). The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal on
                    3 July 2013, directing the matter back to the High Court for trial before a
                    different judge. The Court of Appeal also said that “[p]arties are not
                    precluded, in the course of the trial, from raising <em>res
                        judicata</em> as one of the issues for the final determination of the
                    new judge.” No written grounds were issued by the Court of Appeal. It was
                    on this note that the parties came before me to have the present action
                    tried.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The parties’ claims</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The Plaintiffs’ main claim in the
                    present action is that the Consent Order should be set aside. The following
                    grounds were pleaded:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_64" id="Ftn_64_1"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_57-p2_a"></a>(a)     the Defendants (CO) had committed a
                        repudiatory breach of the Consent Order;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_57-p2_b"></a>(b)     the Plaintiffs’ claims in the Consolidated
                        Suits have not been compromised;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_57-p2_c"></a>(c)     the Consent Order had been frustrated;
                    and/or</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_57-p2_d"></a>(d)     the
                        Plaintiffs entered into the Consent Order operating under a mistake of
                        fact.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     From the Plaintiffs’ closing
                    submissions, it appears that they are no longer pursuing ground (d) – that
                    the Plaintiffs were operating under a mistake of fact. Their submissions also
                    did not specifically cover ground (c), the issue of frustration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Should the Consent Order be set aside, the
                    Plaintiffs also asked for the court to order that that they be at liberty to
                    proceed with the Consolidated Suits, with such directions as may be appropriate
                    (“the Consequential Orders”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_65" id="Ftn_65_1"><sup>[note: 65]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     In the event that the Consent Order is not set
                    aside, the Plaintiffs alternatively argued that the five individuals in the SAA
                    Group (namely, Tan CB, Roger Koh, Samuel Ng, Tan Senior and Ong CK) and SAA are
                    liable to account to the Plaintiffs for the profits made in breach of their
                    fiduciary duties owed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     The substantive defendants (<em>ie</em>, excluding the JV Companies and Samuel Ng) are represented by
                    three different sets of lawyers. SAA, Tan CB and Roger Koh are represented by
                    Rajah &amp; Tann and the lead counsel is Mr Kelvin Poon (“Mr
                    Poon”). I will refer to this group of defendants collectively as
                    “the R&amp;T Defendants”. Tan Senior is represented by Mr Sim
                    Chong (“Mr Chong”) of JLC Advisors LLP. Ong CK is represented by
                    Mr Khor Wee Siong (“Mr Khor”) of Khor Thiam Beng &amp; Partners.
                    From the discussions that follow, it will be apparent that the arguments put
                    forth by these three groups of defendants are quite different, although the
                    existence of the Back-to-Back Arrangement and the alleged oral agreements were
                    unanimously denied by all of them. Significantly, the R&amp;T Defendants have
                    also advanced a counterclaim against the Plaintiffs, asking for an order that
                    the bidding exercise be proceeded with.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     As a preliminary matter, it should be noted
                    that the dispute over the setting aside of the Consent Order is mainly between
                    the Plaintiffs and the R&amp;T Defendants. The main defence of Tan Senior and
                    Ong CK to the grounds advanced by the Plaintiffs to set aside the Consent Order
                    is straightforward – that they were not proper parties to the Consent
                    Order to begin with. For Tan Senior, even though he was originally named as a
                    party in the action leading to the Consent Order, he contended that he did not
                    participate in the negotiations leading to the Consent Order.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_66" id="Ftn_66_1"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span> His participation was not required as
                    after he became a bankrupt in 2003, the Plaintiffs did not seek leave to
                    continue proceedings against him in the Consolidated Suits. Ong CK argued that
                    he was never a party to the Consolidated Suits or to the Consent
                Order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     I proceed now to detail the arguments raised
                    by the parties with respect to the various claims and
                counterclaim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Repudiatory breach of the Consent Order</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Plaintiffs’ case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     According to the Plaintiffs, several
                    repudiatory breaches had been committed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     First, it was contended that SAA’s
                    refusal to grant a renewal of the sub-tenancies in 2007 despite having secured
                    the 2007 Head Lease from SLA amounted to a breach of clause 11 of the Consent
                    Order. Clause 11 prohibited parties from doing anything to alter the
                    “status quo” of the JV Companies. Even though SAA’s
                    purported obligation to renew the sub-tenancies was not expressly provided for
                    in clause 11, the Plaintiffs argued that this obligation nevertheless came
                    within the phrase “status quo” on the basis of, amongst other
                    things, the purported oral agreement between the parties. This Back-to-Back
                    Arrangement continued to be the status quo at the time the Consent Order was
                    entered into and SAA was required to preserve the status quo by continuing to
                    grant sub-tenancies to the JV Companies. When it failed to do so, SAA had
                    disrupted the “status quo”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     The Plaintiffs also made the related argument
                    that SAA had further disrupted the “status quo” by
                    misappropriating the JV Companies’ “assets and/or benefits”.
                    It had done so by transferring to itself some of the sub-sub-tenancy agreements
                    that the JV Companies had with the ultimate tenants. The ultimate tenants’
                    cash deposits held by the JV Companies were also transferred to SAA. In
                    addition, it took over the JV Companies’ renovation structures. SAA
                    received these benefits without paying the JV Companies anything for them. Not
                    only did these developments affect the “assets and/or benefits” of
                    the JV Companies, they denuded the JV Companies’ of any value. This
                    amounted to a breach of clause 11 of the Consent Order. This argument is also
                    contingent upon a finding that a Back-to-Back Arrangement falls within the ambit
                    of clause 11.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Alternatively, the Plaintiffs averred that by
                    securing the 2007 Head Lease from SLA and failing to grant the renewal of the
                    sub-tenancies to the JV Companies, the Defendants had appropriated the benefit
                    of the 2007 Head Lease. This was in breach of an implied term of the Consent
                        Order.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_67" id="Ftn_67_1"><sup>[note: 67]</sup></a></span> It was illogical for SAA to insist that it
                    would need to transfer the 2004 Head Lease only, but not the 2007 Head Lease, if
                    the Plaintiffs won the bidding exercise since TCPL and TCAE already held the
                    2004 STAs. There was therefore nothing of value to transfer in relation to the
                    2004 Head Lease. If the winner of the bidding exercise was not meant to have the
                    benefit of the 2007 Head Lease, there would have been no need for clause 9(g) of
                    the Consent Order.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_68" id="Ftn_68_1"><sup>[note: 68]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     The Plaintiffs also claimed that clause 5 of
                    the Consent Order was breached when the Defendants allegedly hid material facts
                    from the KPMG entities. Clause 5 stated that the parties “undertake not
                    to … do anything to … hinder [KPMG CF]’s discharge of [its]
                    duties in respect of the Valuation Exercise”. Clause 5 imposed an
                    obligation on the parties not to hide material facts from the KPMG entities as
                    doing so would hinder KPMG CF’s conduct of the Valuation
                        Exercise.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_69" id="Ftn_69_1"><sup>[note: 69]</sup></a></span> The failure and/or refusal to disclose the
                    2007 Head Lease had materially affected the valuation of the JV Companies since
                    the Valuation Reports were prepared on the basis that there was no confirmation
                    on the renewal of the 2004 Head Lease.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Lastly, the Plaintiffs argued that clause 6 of
                    the Consent Order was breached when the Defendants (CO) did not provide KPMG BA
                    “full access” to all the documents that it may require for the
                    Valuation Exercise.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_70" id="Ftn_70_1"><sup>[note: 70]</sup></a></span> KPMG BA was supposed to investigate
                    contracts between the JV Companies and Goodland as well as services performed by
                    AGA. The Defendants (CO) failed to give KPMG BA “full access” to
                    the contracts and architectural drawings required to conduct a proper
                    investigation and valuation exercise. For instance, a number of QSes approached
                    by KPMG BA were unable to verify the works done as the available information was
                    insufficient. As a result, the investigation exercise in relation to the
                    Plaintiffs’ allegations in the Consolidated Suits was not properly carried
                    out. In addition, they also claimed that the Defendants (CO) obstructed the KPMG
                    entities’ efforts in appointing a QS by unreasonably refusing to pay their
                    share of the additional fees quoted by a replacement QS.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The R&amp;T Defendants’ case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     With respect to the allegation that SAA had
                    breached the Consent Order in failing to renew the JV Companies’
                    sub-tenancies in 2007, the R&amp;T Defendants argued that the Consent Order did
                    not impose such an obligation on SAA. The existence of the “Back-to-Back
                    Arrangement” was strenuously disputed. They argued that there was no oral
                    agreement save that parties agreed to incorporate two joint venture companies
                    instead of one.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_71" id="Ftn_71_1"><sup>[note: 71]</sup></a></span>
                    There was an agreement to jointly develop and operate the Site, but such an
                    agreement did not extend to sharing the beneficial ownership of the head lease
                    between SLA and SAA.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_72" id="Ftn_72_1"><sup>[note: 72]</sup></a></span> The R&amp;T Defendants argued that
                    SAA had the discretion to decide whether to renew the JV Companies’
                    sub-tenancies after the initial three-year term.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_73" id="Ftn_73_1"><sup>[note: 73]</sup></a></span> SAA also retained proprietary ownership of its
                    head lease with SLA at all times.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_74" id="Ftn_74_1"><sup>[note: 74]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     As for the argument that SAA had further
                    disrupted the “status quo” by misappropriating the JV
                    Companies’ “assets and/or benefits” without providing
                    valuable consideration for them, the R&amp;T Defendants argued that this
                    allegation was not even pleaded. In any case, they argued that the JV Companies
                    would no longer have any more ultimate tenants once the 2004 STAs had expired.
                    The JV Companies could not complain of conversion when the assets SAA took did
                    not belong to them in the first place.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     With respect to the point that an implied term
                    of the Consent Order had been breached, the R&amp;T Defendants argued that it
                    was always contemplated that the entire bidding process under the Consent Order
                    would be completed well before the 2004 Head Lease expired. At the time the
                    Consent Order was entered into, there were no guarantees that the Government
                    would grant the 2007 Head Lease and therefore clause 9(g) of the Consent Order
                    was never meant to enable the winner of the bidding exercise to have the benefit
                    of a renewed term of the Head Lease.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_75" id="Ftn_75_1"><sup>[note: 75]</sup></a></span> The R&amp;T Defendants also
                    averred that there was no gap that needed to be filled through the implication
                    of a term. Clauses 9(g) and 11 were clear in that they were meant to only refer
                    to the 2004 Head Lease. This was therefore not a case of implication of terms
                    but one of interpretation. The R&amp;T Defendants further submitted that even if
                    there was a gap, no term should be implied as the Consent Order retains its
                    efficacy and the officious bystander test would fail.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     With respect to the Plaintiffs’ point
                    that clause 5 of the Consent Order had been breached, the R&amp;T Defendants
                    argued that there was nothing in the Consent Order that required SAA to disclose

                    addition, reliance was placed on Choo J’s judgment in SUM 4117 (amended)
                    in that this issue had already been decided in favour of the Defendants (at
                    [24]) and therefore, the Plaintiffs were precluded from rearguing this
                        point.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_77" id="Ftn_77_1"><sup>[note: 77]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     Regarding the Plaintiffs’ claim that
                    there was no full disclosure of information required by KPMG BA to carry out a
                    proper investigation, the R&amp;T Defendants argued that this was not pleaded.
                    In addition, little weight should be given to the fact that several QSes were
                    unable to do the task due to incomplete information since there was one QS, DLS
                    Contract Advisory &amp; Dispute Management Services Pte Ltd
                    (“DLS”), which was able do it based on the same information. As
                    for the failure to pay their share of the QS fees, the R&amp;T Defendants denied
                    the existence of any obligation on their part to agree to the costs of
                    appointing a QS.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_78" id="Ftn_78_1"><sup>[note: 78]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Claims in the Consolidated Suit have not been compromised </p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Plaintiffs’ case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     The Plaintiffs contended that KPMG BA and KPMG
                    CF did not meet the standard required under the Consent Order in conducting the
                    investigation and valuation exercise.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_79" id="Ftn_79_1"><sup>[note: 79]</sup></a></span> Based on
                    the disclaimers and cursory write-up in the Valuation Reports, it was evident
                    that KPMG CF simply relied on figures provided by the Defendants instead of
                    conducting an independent investigation into the JV Companies’ finances
                    and accounts. Their pleaded case was that a proper investigation of the
                    Plaintiffs’ claims in the Consolidated Suits was the main consideration
                    the Plaintiffs were supposed to derive from having entered into the Consent
                    Order. As KPMG BA did not carry out a full investigation, their claims were not
                    fully compromised.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     Another allegation was that KPMG BA should
                    have appointed a QS to assist it in determining whether the contracts awarded to
                    Goodland and AGA were of fair value. KPMG BA could not have been able to do this
                    by itself without a QS.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     The Plaintiffs also claimed that it was
                    inappropriate for KPMG CF to have adopted the Net Asset Valuation
                    (“NAV”) methodology to value the JV Companies’
                        shares.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_80" id="Ftn_80_1"><sup>[note: 80]</sup></a></span> The valuation figures provided were
                    inaccurate. KPMG CF should have used the “pro-forma revenue”
                    method instead that can be found in a report submitted by the Plaintiffs’
                    expert witness, Timothy James Reid.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_81" id="Ftn_81_1"><sup>[note: 81]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     Related to the above argument on methodology
                    is the point that KPMG CF should have taken into account the revenue receivable
                    by the JV Companies from the period of September 2007 to September
                        2010.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_82" id="Ftn_82_1"><sup>[note: 82]</sup></a></span> But because of SAA’s failure to
                    disclose the 2007 Head Lease, it was unable to do so. This materially affected
                    the valuation of the JV Companies since their potential to earn revenue was
                    directly related to whether there was a head lease.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     Further, although it was initially pleaded as
                    a claim of “frustration”,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_83" id="Ftn_83_1"><sup>[note: 83]</sup></a></span> the Plaintiffs in their
                    closing submissions appeared to have re-characterised the 13.5-month delay in
                    the issuance of the Valuation Reports as evidencing that the claims in the
                    Consolidated Suit had not been compromised.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The R&amp;T Defendants’ case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     The R&amp;T Defendants argued that the
                    Plaintiffs did not plead with sufficient clarity the claim of there being no
                    independent investigation conducted by the KPMG entities.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_84" id="Ftn_84_1"><sup>[note: 84]</sup></a></span> Even if it were pleaded, they
                    argued that the Plaintiffs had failed to discharge their burden of proving that
                    the investigation conducted by the KPMG entities was inadequate.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_85" id="Ftn_85_1"><sup>[note: 85]</sup></a></span> In any event, they argued that KPMG CF
                    enjoyed “unfettered and absolute discretion” in conducting the
                    investigation and valuation exercise (clause 5).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_86" id="Ftn_86_1"><sup>[note: 86]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     As for the alleged deficiencies in the
                    valuation exercise, the R&amp;T Defendants argued that they were not properly
                        pleaded.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_87" id="Ftn_87_1"><sup>[note: 87]</sup></a></span> In any
                    event, the R&amp;T Defendants averred that since KPMG CF would have unfettered
                    and absolute discretion in the valuation exercise, there was no basis for the
                    Plaintiffs to argue that the valuation exercise was deficient.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Consequential Orders</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     If the Plaintiffs succeed in setting aside the
                    Consent Order, they argued that they should be allowed to bring the minority
                    oppression claim against Tan CB and Ong CK in their personal capacity. In this
                    regard, they argued that both Tan CB and Ong CK were parties to the Joint
                    Venture in their personal capacity and not through SAA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     Tan CB and Ong CK both disputed this claim.
                    They argued that SAA was the vehicle they had used to enter into the Joint
                    Venture and therefore SAA should be named as defendants, not them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     Ong CK additionally raised the defence of
                    laches and estoppel by conduct. He claimed that he had never been a party to the
                    Consolidated Suits since 2002. He was only joined as a defendant to the present
                    suit in 2009. The delay of seven years has prejudiced him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     As for Tan Senior, he argued that the
                    doctrines of abuse of process, estoppel by conduct and waiver precluded the
                    Plaintiffs from suing him again in 2009 in the present action. After he became
                    bankrupt in 2003, the Plaintiffs did not seek leave to continue the Consolidated
                    Suits against him.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_88" id="Ftn_88_1"><sup>[note: 88]</sup></a></span> In fact, the Plaintiffs stopped or
                    abandoned all litigation against him since his bankruptcy until they commenced
                    the present action in 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Counterclaim by the R&amp;T Defendants: whether the bidding exercise
                should be proceeded with</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     The R&amp;T Defendants filed a counterclaim
                    against the Plaintiffs for an order that the bidding exercise be proceeded with.
                    The Plaintiffs’ main defence to the counterclaim are the same as those
                    canvassed in their claim. Further and in the alternative, the Plaintiffs argued
                    that the Valuation Reports dated way back in 31 May 2006 (or even 10 August
                    2007) could no longer serve its purpose of informing the bidding exercise. In
                    addition, the JV Companies were practically worthless today and therefore it
                    would be pointless to bid for them.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Plaintiffs’ residual claim: breach of fiduciary duties and
                conspiracy</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     In the event the Plaintiffs do not succeed in
                    setting aside the Consent Order,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_89" id="Ftn_89_1"><sup>[note: 89]</sup></a></span> they argued that in the alternative, the five
                    individuals from the SAA Group (namely, Tan CB, Roger Koh, Samuel Ng, Tan Senior
                    and Ong CK) and SAA are liable to account to the Plaintiffs for the profits made
                    including but not limited to the 2007 Head Lease.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_90" id="Ftn_90_1"><sup>[note: 90]</sup></a></span> They are relying on the same
                    Back-to-Back Arrangement to say that these Defendants owed them fiduciary duties
                    under the Joint Venture. In not renewing the sub-tenancies to the Joint Venture
                    Companies in 2007, they had breached their fiduciary duties. Further and in the
                    alternative, they had conspired with each other to breach the fiduciary
                    duties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     However, when SAA did not renew the JV
                    Companies’ sub-tenancies in 2007, both Tan Senior and Ong CK were no
                    longer directors of SAA and the JV Companies. Tan Senior<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_91" id="Ftn_91_1"><sup>[note: 91]</sup></a></span> and Ong CK<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_92" id="Ftn_92_1"><sup>[note: 92]</sup></a></span> claimed that
                    they were no longer involved in the management of SAA and the JV Companies upon
                    the cessation of their respective directorships. Nevertheless, the
                    Plaintiffs’ basis for proceeding against these two individuals was that
                    they had masterminded the scheme to deprive the Plaintiffs of the benefits under
                    the 2007 Head Lease (“Mastermind Allegation”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     In their defence, Tan CB, Roger Koh, Samuel
                    Ng, Tan Senior, Ong CK and SAA all argued that there had been no oral agreement
                    that the parties would share the beneficial interest of the head lease between
                    SLA and SAA. Therefore, there were no fiduciary duties owed by them to the
                    Plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     Tan Senior claimed that the Mastermind
                    Allegation was fabricated by the Plaintiffs in order to drag him back into
                    litigation. Until the present suit commenced in 2009, the Plaintiffs had
                    abandoned all proceedings against him after he became a bankrupt in 2003. They
                    did not seek leave to continue OS 1634/02 against him. They also did not sue him
                    in S 703/04.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     Ong CK raised the defence of laches against
                    these claims.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     I would also add that with respect to these
                    residual claims, the Plaintiffs have indicated that they would subsume these
                    claims under the Consolidated Suits, should the Consent Order be set aside and
                    the Consolidated Suits be reinstated.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_93" id="Ftn_93_1"><sup>[note: 93]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     The broad overarching issue that arose in the
                    present dispute was whether the Consent Order should be set aside. This raised
                    the following questions in respect of the Consent Order:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_93-p2_a"></a>(a)     Whether the Consent Order imposed an
                        obligation on SAA to pass on the benefit of the 2007 Head Lease to the JV
                        Companies by way of the granting of sub-tenancies (“the Non-Renewal
                        Issue”).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_93-p2_b"></a>(b)     Whether the Consent Order imposed an obligation on SAA to disclose the
                        procurement of the 2007 Head Lease to the KPMG entities (“the
                        Non-Disclosure Issue”).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_93-p2_c"></a>(c)     Whether the investigation and valuation exercises
                        required of the KPMG entities were properly carried out (“the
                        Investigation and Valuation Issue”).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_93-p2_d"></a>(d)     Whether the Defendants obstructed efforts to
                        appoint a QS and whether the failure to appoint a QS enables the Plaintiffs
                        to set aside the Consent Order (“the QS
                Issue”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     Should the Consent Order be set aside, the
                    Consequential Orders requested for by the Plaintiffs raise two questions:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_94-p2_a"></a>(a)     Whether Tan CB and Ong CK were
                        proper parties to the Joint Venture.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_94-p2_b"></a>(b)     Whether Tan Senior and Ong CK could rely on the
                        Plaintiffs’ delay in bringing them back into litigation to avoid being
                        named as defendants in the reinstated Consolidated
                Suits.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">My decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Preliminary considerations</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     Before I proceed to assess the merits of the
                    various claims, I address two logically anterior questions which deserve some
                    discussion. First, I consider the principles which should be applied in
                    interpreting the Consent Order and secondly, I consider whether Choo J’s
                    previous decision in <em>Yeo Boong Hua and others v Turf City Pte
                        Ltd and others and another suit</em> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 245 (“Choo
                    J’s Decision”) gives rise to issue estoppel.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Principles applied in interpreting Consent Order</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     There are two types of consent orders. In
                    determining whether a consent order may be set aside or varied, the court would,
                    as a preliminary matter, examine the type of consent order in question. This was
                    discussed by MPH Rubin J in <em>CSR South East Asia Pte Ltd
                        (formerly known as CSR Bradford Insulation (S) Pte Ltd) v Sunrise Insulation
                        Pte Ltd</em> [2002] 1 SLR(R) 1079 (“<em>Sunrise

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">8    The nature and
                            concept of the phrase “by consent” had received
                            considerable judicial attention over the years. Lord Denning MR, in
                                <em>Siebe Gorman &amp; Co Ltd v Pneupac
                                Ltd</em> [1982] 1 All ER 377 (CA), after a brief survey of the
                            earlier decisions, observed at 380<em>a</em>–380<em>g</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">It should be clearly understood by the profession that, when an order
                            is expressed to be made ‘by consent’, it is ambiguous. There
                            are two meanings to the words ‘by consent’. That was
                            observed by Lord Greene MR in <em>Chandless-Chandless v
                                Nicholson</em> [1942] 2 All ER 315 at 317; [1942] 2 KB 321 at
                            324. <em>One meaning is this: the words ‘by
                                consent’ may evidence a real contract between the parties. In
                                such a case the court will only interfere with such an order on the
                                same grounds as it would with any other contract.</em> The
                            other meaning is this: the words ‘by consent’ may mean
                            ‘the parties hereto not objecting’. In such a case there is
                            no real contract between the parties. The order can be altered or varied
                            by the court in the same circumstances as any other order that is made
                            by the court without the consent of the parties. In every case it is
                            necessary to discover which meaning is used. Does the order evidence a
                            real contract between the parties? Or does it only evidence an order
                            made without obligation?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     It is common ground that the Consent Order in
                    the present case falls under the first category referred to in <em>Sunrise Insulation</em>. It is a contract between the parties
                    and it is undisputed that the Consent Order may only be set aside on the same
                    grounds as would apply to an ordinary contract. I therefore approach the
                    question of whether the Consent Order may be set aside with reference to
                    prevailing contractual principles.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Issue estoppel </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     With respect to the question of issue
                    estoppel, I note that the Non-Renewal Issue and the Non-Disclosure Issue had
                    previously been discussed in Choo J’s Decision.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_94" id="Ftn_94_1"><sup>[note: 94]</sup></a></span> This
                    raises the question of whether I am thereby precluded from revisiting the same
                    issues in this judgment. It is the R&amp;T Defendants’ case that I am not
                    allowed to do so because the views expressed in Choo J’s Decision allow
                    the invocation of the doctrine of issue estoppel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     To examine whether the R&amp;T Defendants are
                    entitled to raise the doctrine of issue estoppel, it is necessary to discuss
                    whether the requirements of issue estoppel have been met. The requirements of
                    issue estoppel are as follows (see <em>Lee Tat Development Pte
                        Ltd v Management Corporation of Strata Title Plan 301</em> [2005] 3
                    SLR(R) 157 (“<em>Lee Tat</em>”)):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_99-p2_a"></a>(a)     There must be a final and conclusive
                        judgment on the merits.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_99-p2_b"></a>(b)     The previous judgment must be of a court of competent
                        jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_99-p2_c"></a>(c)     There must be identity between the parties to the two actions that are
                        being compared.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_99-p2_d"></a>(d)     There must be an identity of subject matter in the two
                    proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    The fourth requirement was subsequently
                    expounded on by Menon JC (as he then was) in the oft-cited local case of
                        <em>Goh Nellie v Goh Lian Teck and others</em> [2007] 1
                    SLR(R) 453 (“<em>Goh v Goh</em>”) to
                    encapsulate three further sub-requirements:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_100-p2_a"></a>(a)     The issues in the prior decision
                        must traverse the same ground as the subsequent proceedings and the facts
                        and circumstances giving rise to the earlier decision must not have
                        changed.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_100-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
                        previous determination in question must have been fundamental and not merely
                        collateral to the previous decision so that the previous decision could not
                        stand without that determination.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_100-p2_c"></a>(c)     The issue in question should be shown in fact to have
                        been raised and argued.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    There is no disagreement between the parties
                    that requirements (b) and (c) in <em>Lee Tat</em> have been
                    satisfied in respect of Choo J’s decision. The bone of contention centres
                    on requirements (a) and (d) in <em>Lee Tat</em>, <em>viz</em>, whether Choo J’s holding with respect to the
                    allegations of breach of the Consent Order was “final and
                    conclusive” and whether there was an identity of subject matter in the
                    two proceedings. The Plaintiffs’ arguments, in this regard, are that Choo
                    J did not intend to preclude subsequent proceedings and that his decision does
                    not give rise to issue estoppel because his observations made with respect to
                    the proper construction of the Consent Order were collateral findings which were
                    not fundamental to his decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    Before examining the validity of the
                    arguments raised by the parties, it is worth understanding the background of the
                    matter before Choo J. As I have alluded to earlier, SUM 4117 (amended) concerned
                    the Plaintiffs’ application to vary the Consent Order. The application was
                    filed pursuant to the Plaintiffs’ belated discovery that SAA had failed to
                    pass on the benefit of the 2007 Head Lease to the JV Companies and as a result
                    the benefit was not properly taken into account in the valuation reports issued
                    by KPMG CF. Consequently, the Plaintiffs applied to court for an order that a
                    fresh valuation exercise be conducted on the basis that the 2007 Head Lease
                    should be taken into account as an asset of the JV Companies which would then
                    fall within the pool of assets that the parties would be bidding
                for.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    The Plaintiffs’ application was
                    dismissed by Choo J. He held that the court’s jurisdiction to hear the
                    application was not invoked insofar as it was asked to make further substantive
                    orders to vary the Consent Order. He was of the view that the circumstances
                    under which a court may interfere with a Consent Order were exceptional, and the
                    arguments raised by the Plaintiffs in relation to the non-renewal of the
                    sub-tenancies and the failure to disclose the procurement of the 2007 Head Lease
                    did not fall squarely within the “exceptional circumstances” that
                    would ordinarily warrant the making of further substantive orders.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    It must be borne in mind that the order
                    sought by the Plaintiffs was for the Consent Order to be varied and for the
                    purposes of making this determination, allegations that the Consent Order had
                    been breached were irrelevant. The failure on the part of the Plaintiffs to
                    satisfy the stringent criteria required to invoke the court’s jurisdiction
                    for the purposes of <em>varying</em> a Consent Order would
                    have been sufficient for Choo J to dispose of the matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    Nevertheless, as the R&amp;T Defendants have
                        argued,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_95" id="Ftn_95_1"><sup>[note: 95]</sup></a></span> Choo J went on to
                    examine the merits of several allegations of <em>breach</em> made by the Plaintiffs on the <em>assumption</em> that the proper cause of action, <em>ie</em>, breach of Consent Order, had been pleaded, and he held that
                    there was no breach.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    I am of the view that while there is some
                    merit in the R&amp;T Defendants’ reliance on Choo J’s holdings as a
                    basis for arguing issue estoppel, there is no issue estoppel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    With respect to requirement (a) of the
                        <em>Lee Tat</em> test, I am of the view that this
                    requirement has not been made out – Choo J’s holding on the proper
                    construction of the Consent Order was not meant to be final and conclusive. It
                    was observed in <em>Goh v Goh</em> at [28], “whether
                    the decision in question is a final and conclusive judgment on the merits may be
                    ascertained from the intention of the judge”. In <em>Alliance Entertainment Singapore Pte Ltd v Sim Kay Teck</em> [2006] 3
                    SLR(R) 712, Andrew Ang J noted (at [23]) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">That, in this respect, the intention of the judge is critical can also be
                        seen in <em>Setiadi Hendrawan v OCBC Securities Pte
                            Ltd</em> [2001] 3 SLR(R) 296. In that case, Woo Bih Li JC (as he
                        then was) had to decide whether the plaintiff was estopped from bringing a
                        second action against the defendants by reason of an earlier action between
                        the same parties having been struck out after counsel for the plaintiff
                        unsuccessfully sought leave to discontinue. The plaintiff argued that as his
                        claim in the first action had not been dismissed he was not precluded from
                        re-litigating it. Woo JC went through the trial judge's notes of the
                        proceedings in chambers on the plaintiff's application for leave to
                        discontinue and concluded that, in refusing the plaintiff's application and
                        ordering a striking out of the action, the trial judge had intended to
                        preclude any fresh action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    I turn now to consider if Choo J intended
                    for his judgment to be final and conclusive on the merits when he rendered his
                    decision. At [11] of Choo J’s Decision, he stated that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The plaintiffs argued that the amendments are necessary to remedy
                        the following breaches of the Consent Order by the defendants:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Any allegation of breach of the Consent Order ought to be brought in a
                        separate action. Nonetheless, it will become apparent upon a proper
                        construction of the Consent Order that both allegations are unfounded
                        because no such obligations existed on the part of the defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>It was not clear from [11] of Choo J’s Decision whether
                        the views he expressed in relation to the Plaintiffs’ allegations of
                        breaches of the Consent Order were <em>obiter</em>. It
                        may be that they were <em>obiter</em> in that he wanted
                        to show the Plaintiffs that there would be no purpose in commencing a fresh
                        action based on the allegation of breaches which were bound to fail.
                        Conversely, he could have intended his views to be final and conclusive in
                        that he was prepared to make a binding decision even though the
                        Plaintiffs’ allegations of breach ought to have been brought in a
                        separate action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    Interestingly, the R&amp;T Defendants appear
                    to have accepted that his views were <em>obiter</em>. In
                    [368] of their closing submissions, they said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… Choo J accepted the Plaintiffs’ submission that he had
                        jurisdiction to vary the Consent Order. <em>Choo J however
                            declined to do so</em> because any allegation of breach of Consent
                        Order had to be brought in a separate action. Nonetheless, he considered and
                        rejected the Plaintiffs’ argument that the Consent Order had been
                        breached. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The R&amp;T Defendants therefore appear to affirm the position
                        that Choo J had declined to vary the Consent Order because he was of the
                        view that allegations of breach should have been ventilated in a separate
                        action. This would mean that his observations with respect to the
                        construction of the Consent Order were <em>obiter</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    There is another point in favour of the
                    contention that Choo J did not intend his views to be final and binding. It will
                    be recalled that subsequent to his decision in SUM 4117 (amended), the R&amp;T
                    Defendants had applied in SUM 4848 for the bidding to be held on 15 December
                    2008. This was met by the Plaintiffs’ application in SUM 5373 for an order
                    that the bidding cannot be held by reason of non-compliance with the Consent
                    Order. Choo J granted the application for the bidding to proceed and dismissed
                    the opposing application. In Choo J’s grounds of decision for both these
                    summonses (see <em>Yeo Boong Hua and Others v Turf City Pte Ltd
                        and Others and Another suit</em> [2009] SGHC 34), he said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2    The plaintiff thus applied to set aside the consent
                            order or a re-valuation of the shares. This was disallowed by the High
                            Court and the decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal. The defendant
                            then applied for the consequential order that the bidding process be
                            ordered to proceed. The plaintiff applied for a stay of that application
                            on the ground that they had commenced a fresh suit against the
                            defendant. I dismissed the plaintiff’s application for stay and
                            granted the defendant’s application to proceed with the bidding
                            process for the shares. The defendant’s present application was a
                            formal end to a long dispute. <em>The plaintiff’s
                                alleged new cause of action should proceed independently</em>.
                            I therefore granted an order in terms to proceed with the bidding
                            process. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    Before I continue, I should mention a number
                    of clarifications. In respect of [2] of Choo J’s grounds of decision, I
                    assume that his reference to the Plaintiffs’ application to set aside the
                    Consent Order was to SUM 4117 (amended). However, as elaborated above (see
                    [102]), the Plaintiffs' application was not actually to set aside the Consent
                    Order, but was instead for a variation of the terms of the Consent
                Order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    Secondly, the Plaintiffs did not appeal
                    against Choo J’s decision to dismiss SUM 4117 (amended).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    Thirdly, as regards Choo J’s reference
                    to the Plaintiffs’ application for a stay, this would presumably be a
                    reference to SUM 5373 which was not couched in terms of a stay but rather for an
                    order that the bidding exercise cannot be held. Choo J may have construed that
                    application as a stay because he was informed during arguments on
                    12 January 2009 that the Plaintiffs had issued a fresh writ of summons in
                    Suit 27 of 2009 (<em>ie</em>, the present
                action).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    I now come to why I am of the view that Choo
                    J did not intend for his decision in SUM 4117 (amended) to be final and binding.
                    As quoted above, Choo J said that the alleged new cause action (<em>ie</em>, the present action) <em>should
                        proceed independently</em> even though the R&amp;T Defendants argued
                    that it covered the same substance as SUM 4848. There was no qualification by
                    Choo J that the Plaintiffs’ continuation of that action was subject to the
                    decision he had already rendered in SUM 4117 (amended).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    Choo J’s unqualified statement that
                    the Plaintiffs’ new cause of action should proceed independently
                    reinforced the Plaintiffs’ contention that there was no <em>res judicata</em>, in particular, that he did not intend the views he
                    expressed in SUM 4117 (amended) on the Plaintiffs’ allegations of breaches
                    to be final and conclusive.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    The burden of proof ultimately rests on the
                    R&amp;T Defendants to establish issue estoppel and I am of the view that they
                    had not discharged this burden.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    Having decided that requirement (a) of the
                        <em>Lee Tat</em> test has not been fulfilled, it is not
                    necessary for me to consider whether requirement (d) has been made out. However,
                    for completeness, I would state that in the light of my above conclusion that
                    Choo J’s Decision <em>vis-à-vis</em> the
                    Plaintiffs’ allegations of breach was not final and conclusive,
                    requirement (d) is similarly not fulfilled.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    In <em>Goh v Goh</em>,
                    it was observed that for there to be an identity of subject-matter, one key
                    consideration is whether the previous determination in question was fundamental
                    to the previous determination:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">35    The second idea
                            which is contained within the requirement of an identity of
                            subject-matter is that <b><em>the previous determination in
                                question must have been fundamental and not merely collateral to the
                                previous decision so that the decision could not stand without that
                                determination</em></b>: see <em>The Doctrine of Res
                                Judicata</em> at para 201. The author of <em>The Doctrine of Res Judicata</em> traces the authorities for
                            this principle back to the decision of Holt CJ in <em>Blackham’s Case</em> (1709) 1 Salk 290; 91 ER 257, but

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    As I have concluded above, Choo J’s
                    decision to reject the Plaintiffs’ application in SUM 4117 (amended)
                    ultimately rested on his lack of jurisdiction. His observations with respect to
                    the Plaintiffs’ allegations of breach of the Consent Order were not
                    fundamental to his decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    I therefore reject the R&amp;T
                    Defendants’ defence of issue estoppel and will proceed to construe the
                    Consent Order afresh. This is not to say, however, that Choo J’s
                    observations with respect to whether there was a breach of the Consent Order are
                    irrelevant. In the course of reaching my own conclusion, as and when applicable,
                    I will refer to Choo J’s observations.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Non-Renewal Issue: whether a repudiatory breach arose from
                SAA’s failure to grant the JV Companies sub-tenancies arising out of the 2007
                Head Lease </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    The issue of whether the Defendants were
                    obliged to grant sub-tenancies which arose out of the 2007 Head Lease to the JV
                    Companies (“the Renewal Obligation”) turns on two separate
                    questions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    The first question is the proper
                    construction of clause 11 of the Consent Order, which is the provision which the
                    Plaintiffs relied on, and whether its wording captures the Renewal
                    Obligation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    According to the Plaintiffs, clause 11
                    captures the Renewal Obligation. Clause 11 states as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Plaintiffs and the Defendants undertake not to do anything or cause
                        anything to be done which would in any way <b>affect, vary
                            and/or alter the status quo of the Companies</b>, both in terms
                        of on-going liabilities/obligations to which the Companies are subject to,
                        and <b>assets and/or benefits which the Companies
                            </b><b><em>presently </em></b><b>enjoy</b>, including but not limited to doing anything to affect
                        the <b>head lease</b> between the 2nd Defendants and
                        the Singapore Land Office and sub leases <b><em>presently
                            </em></b><b>entered into</b> between the 2nd
                        Defendants and the Companies. In particular, the Plaintiffs and Defendants
                        undertake that in respect of the respective <b>sub leases
                            </b><b><em>presently </em></b><b>entered into</b> between the Companies and the 2nd Defendants,
                        the Plaintiffs and Defendants and/or their agents and/or employees and/or
                        servants shall not do anything that would alter or affect the said sub
                        leases including doing anything to effect, procure or cause the termination
                        of the said agreements.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in bold and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    The Plaintiffs averred that the Back-to-Back
                    Arrangement formed part of the “status quo” of the JV Companies
                    which the Defendants were prohibited from altering or disrupting.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    The R&amp;T Defendants, on the other hand,
                    argued that there was no Back-to-Back Arrangement and therefore the Renewal
                    Obligation was not captured by the terms of the Consent Order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    The second question is if clause 11 does not
                    capture the Renewal Obligation, whether such an obligation arises from an
                    implied term of the Consent Order.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Proper construction of clause 11 of the Consent Order</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    Both parties’ arguments on clause 11
                    of the Consent Order centre on the existence of the Back-to-Back Arrangement. A
                    significant time at trial was spent on proving this fact. However, as alluded to
                    earlier (at [16]), the construction of clause 11 does not turn on this fact. I
                    am of the view that whether or not a Back-to-Back Arrangement did exist prior to
                    the entering of the Consent Order is not determinative in concluding what the
                    parties intended when they used the phrase “status quo” in clause
                    11 of the Consent Order. This conclusion is supported by the context in which
                    the Consent Order was entered into.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    When parties entered into the Consent Order,
                    it was with a view to settling the disputes which arose in the Consolidated
                    Suits. One of the issues raised in the dispute was that the 2004 sub-tenancies
                    granted to the JV Companies were on terms which were inconsistent with the 2004
                    Head Lease between SAA and SLA in that the 2004 sub-tenancies did not have an
                    option to renew clause.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_96" id="Ftn_96_1"><sup>[note: 96]</sup></a></span> As
                    highlighted by the R&amp;T Defendants, the very existence of the Back-to-Back
                    Arrangement was already hotly contested in the Consolidated Suits that
                    engendered the Consent Order.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_97" id="Ftn_97_1"><sup>[note: 97]</sup></a></span> I note that in Choo J’s Decision at
                    [18], Choo J placed great emphasis on the fact that the exact words used in
                    clause 11 was that parties would not affect the status quo in terms of
                    “benefits which the Companies <em>presently</em>
                    enjoy” (emphasis added). The word “presently” formed the
                    basis on which he concluded, albeit <em>obiter</em>, that
                    clause 11 did not impose an obligation on the Defendants to pro-actively renew
                    the sublease upon its expiry. In other words, Choo J was of the view that clause
                    11 applied only to the 2004 sub-tenancies and not to future sub-tenancies. Even
                    if the Back-to-Back Arrangement existed, this would only kick in again in 2007
                    and was not a right which the JV Companies enjoyed at the time which the Consent
                    Order was entered into.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    The Plaintiffs’ reliance on clause 11
                    was premised on the existence of the Back-to-Back Arrangement before the Consent
                    Order was entered into and that this arrangement was encapsulated within the
                    words “status quo” and “presently enjoy”. As
                    mentioned, the existence of such an arrangement was hotly contested before the
                    Consent Order was entered into. When the Consent Order was entered into, it was
                    open to the parties to agree either to include or to exclude the Back-to-Back
                    Arrangement as part of the resolution of their dispute. Therefore, even if there
                    was a Back-to-Back arrangement before the Consent Order, the parties could have
                    agreed to exclude it from the Consent Order. Conversely, even if there was no
                    such arrangement before the Consent Order, the parties could have agreed to
                    include it as part of the Consent Order. Accordingly, a finding that there was
                    such an arrangement before the Consent Order was entered into would not
                    necessarily mean that clause 11 encapsulates the Back-to-Back
                    Arrangement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    Since it will not assist in the
                    interpretation of clause 11, I make no conclusion as to the existence of a
                    Back-to-Back Arrangement before the Consent Order was entered
                into.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    However, it is regrettable that although the
                    Back-to-Back Arrangement was such a contested subject before the Consent Order
                    was entered into, the lawyers who drafted the Consent Order did not address this
                    arrangement specifically one way or the other in the Consent Order itself.
                    Consequently, parties were left to argue whether the Consent Order did or did
                    not contain the Back-to-Back Arrangement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132    In the meantime, notwithstanding my above
                    views, since both the Plaintiffs and the Defendants (CO) expended much effort to
                    establish or deny the existence of the Back-to-Back Arrangement prior to the
                    entering of the Consent Order and since the evidence they rely on is not
                    entirely irrelevant to the issues I have to grapple with and may also become
                    relevant in other proceedings, I will set out the various pieces of evidence
                    relied upon by them.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">Evidence supporting the existence of the Back-to-Back
                Arrangement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a>133    The source of the Back-to-Back Arrangement,
                    as argued by the Plaintiffs, was OA1 and OA2 (see above at [15]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a>134    Apart from OA1 and OA2, the Plaintiffs
                    relied on several other alleged facts to establish the existence of the
                    Back-to-Back Arrangement.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_134-p2_a"></a>(a)     The parties had the commercial
                        expectation that the lease from SLA to SAA would be for
                        “3+3+3” years. According to the Plaintiffs, this was evident
                        from several pieces of evidence:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_134-p2_a-p3_i"></a>(i)       The advertisement
                            published by SLA in the Straits Times and in the Lian He Zao Bao stated
                            that a lease of the Site was available for tender for a “3+3+3
                            years Tenure”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_98" id="Ftn_98_1"><sup>[note: 98]</sup></a></span></p>

                        and OA2, the Plaintiffs averred that there was other objective evidence to
                        support this conclusion:</p>

<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_134-p2_b-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       Tan CB had also stated in a memo titled

<p class="Judg-Heading-4">Evidence against the existence of the Back-to-Back
                Arrangement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_135"></a>135    The R&amp;T Defendants’ main
                    contention against the existence of the Back-to-Back Arrangement was that OA1
                    and OA2 did not in fact take place. Much emphasis was placed on the various
                    inconsistencies present in the Plaintiffs’ witnesses’
                    testimonies.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_135-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, the Plaintiffs had to
                        correct their evidence several times in relation to the sequence of the
                        terms contained in OA1 and OA2.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_105" id="Ftn_105_1"><sup>[note: 105]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_135-p2_b"></a>(b)     Secondly, the Plaintiffs’ attempt to
                        change the sequential order of certain terms in OA1 and OA2 effectively
                        resulted in the transplantation of certain terms from OA1 onto OA2. Such a
                        transplantation exercise, according to the R&amp;T Defendants was untenable
                        because the terms sought to be transplanted envisaged only <em>one</em> joint venture company whereas OA2 envisaged
                            <em>two</em> joint venture companies.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_106" id="Ftn_106_1"><sup>[note: 106]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_135-p2_c"></a>(c)     Thirdly, it was strenuously argued by the
                        R&amp;T Defendants that one of the terms agreed upon in OA1, <em>viz</em>, SAA would grant sub-tenancies on identical
                        terms as the head lease between SAA and SLA (see [15(c)] above), is directly
                        contradicted by one of the terms agreed upon in OA2, <em>viz</em>, the rent payable by the JV Companies is fixed at a
                        nominal rate of 3% above the rent payable by SAA to SLA (see [15(d)])
                        above). It could not be said that the terms are “identical”
                        when the rent payable by the JV Companies and the rent payable under the
                        head lease are not identical.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_107" id="Ftn_107_1"><sup>[note: 107]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_135-p2_d"></a>(d)     Fourthly, the R&amp;T Defendants argued that it was
                        impossible for SAA to feature in OA2 because at the time OA2 allegedly took
                        place of 8 March 2001, SAA had not yet been announced as the winner of the
                        bidding exercise conducted by SLA.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_108" id="Ftn_108_1"><sup>[note: 108]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_135-p2_e"></a>(e)     Fifthly, the R&amp;T Defendants argued that it did not
                        make sense for parties to sign the MOU which envisaged the incorporation of
                        only one joint venture company and then immediately afterwards agree to form
                        two joint venture companies. According to the Plaintiffs, OA2 was entered
                        into on the same day the MOU was signed. If it was indeed the case that
                        parties had orally agreed at the time the MOU was signed that there would be
                        two joint venture companies, the MOU would have reflected this new
                            position.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_109" id="Ftn_109_1"><sup>[note: 109]</sup></a></span> For the
                        same reason, the MOU should also have been amended to include the other
                        terms of OA2.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_110" id="Ftn_110_1"><sup>[note: 110]</sup></a></span> I would
                        observe at this juncture that eventually, two joint venture companies were
                        in fact formed and therefore it is not entirely clear how this argument
                        advances the R&amp;T Defendants’ position.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_135-p2_f"></a>(f)     Sixthly, until the commencement of
                        the present action, there had been no mention of the oral agreements in the
                        litigation history between the parties. For instance, in SUM 4117 (amended),
                        the Plaintiffs’ attempt to claim a stake in the head lease was made by
                        way of an allegation that the head lease was held by SAA on trust for the JV
                        Companies. This, according to the R&amp;T Defendants, was quite different
                        from the present allegation that SAA was to renew the JV Companies’
                        sub-tenancies so long as SLA renews the head lease.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_111" id="Ftn_111_1"><sup>[note: 111]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>These inconsistencies, according to the R&amp;T Defendants,
                        militated against the finding that a Back-to-Back Arrangement
                        existed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_136"></a>136    The R&amp;T Defendants also highlighted that
                    in all the Head Leases, 2001 STAs and sub-sub-tenancies, the option to renew
                    clause was caveated by clauses indicating that the lessor would have the
                    absolute discretion to determine if a renewal should be granted. According to
                    them, this evidenced that there was never any agreement between SLA and SAA, and
                    accordingly between SAA and the JV Companies, that the leases would be for the
                    tenure of “3+3+3” years.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_112" id="Ftn_112_1"><sup>[note: 112]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137"></a>137    As I have alluded to earlier, I make no
                    conclusion as to whether the evidence establishes the existence of the
                    Back-to-Back Arrangement prior to the entering of the Consent Order.
                    Notwithstanding this, I am of the view that by appropriating the benefit of the
                    2007 Head Lease for themselves, the Defendants (CO) had altered the
                    “status quo”. This is in breach of clause 11 of the Consent Order,
                    the terms of which are stated in [123] above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a>138    I note that this conclusion differs from the
                    one reached by Choo J. In his decision, Choo J placed emphasis on the fact that
                    the words in clause 11 such as “presently enjoy” and
                    “status quo” meant that only the 2004 Head Lease fell within the
                    ambit of clause 11. The words in clause 11, however, should not be viewed in
                    isolation but must be considered with reference to the other provisions in the
                    Consent Order. In my view, clause 9(g) of the Consent Order evidences that the
                    “status quo” under clause 11 of the Consent Order did encapsulate
                    the benefit of the 2007 Head Lease. Clause 9(g) states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Further, in the event that the Sole Bidder or Higher Bidder are the
                        Plaintiffs, the Defendants, in particular the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                        Defendants, shall use its best endeavours to facilitate and procure the
                        assignment / transfer / novation of the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                        Defendants’ head lease with the Singapore Land Office, to the
                        Companies (subject always to the consent, if required, of Singapore Land
                        Office).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a>139    It seems to me that the envisaged assignment
                    of the 2004 Head Lease from the Defendants to the Plaintiffs under clause 9(g)
                    would carry with it the assignment of all the benefits under the 2004 Head Lease
                    which includes, <em>inter alia</em>, the benefit under
                    clause 2 of the 2004 Head Lease:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b><u>Clause 2 - Renewal of Tenancy</u></b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.1    The Landlord may at his absolute discretion grant
                            a fresh tenancy for a further term [of] <b><u>3
                                YEARS</u></b> subject to new terms and conditions and revision of
                            rental upon the expiration of the term hereby created.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_140"></a>140    I note that the R&amp;T Defendants have
                    sought to argue that clause 2.1 of the 2004 Head Lease gives the landlord
                    absolute discretion to grant a fresh tenancy to SAA and therefore cannot be
                    characterised as an “option to renew” clause. While I do agree
                    that clause 2 is not strictly an “option to renew”, it
                    nevertheless carries value as it puts the holder of the 2004 Head Lease in an
                    advantageous position to acquire the 2007 Head Lease. Such a position was in
                    fact taken by the R&amp;T Defendants themselves in their submissions before Choo
                    J prior to the parties entering into the Consent Order. These submissions were
                    meant to address certain questions posed by Choo J to the parties which arose
                    from the Draft Consent Order. Their submissions noted that:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_113" id="Ftn_113_1"><sup>[note: 113]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… Currently, the Head Lease has a remaining term of approximately 1
                        ½ year [<em>sic</em>]. In addition, it can hardly
                        be disputed that the 2nd Defendant, as the present tenant of the Bukit Turf
                        Club site, will be able to renegotiate for a fresh lease with the Singapore
                        Land Officer. These factors have commercial value, and an appropriate
                        commercial value ought to be ascribed to them by professional valuers. It is
                        untenable for the Plaintiffs to insist upon the Head Lease being transferred
                        for 'nominal' consideration. After all, the head lease is an asset belonging
                        to the 2nd Defendant, which value stands to be determined properly and in
                        accordance with legitimate valuation principles. If it is required to
                        transfer its interest in the Head Lease to the Companies, it is only proper
                        that the Companies should pay adequate consideration to the 2nd Defendant
                        for the same</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>It is evident that the Defendants (CO) themselves acted on the
                        basis that the holder of the head lease has the right to “renegotiate
                        for a fresh lease with the Singapore Land Officer” and that this
                        right has commercial value.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_141"></a>141    Clause 2.1 of the 2004 Head Lease may
                    therefore be effectively characterised as a right of first refusal <em>vis-à-vis­</em> the 2007 Head Lease. In my view, parties were
                    always operating under the understanding that barring any exigency, SLA would
                    offer the tenancy of the Site to SAA for a period of “3+3+3”
                    years. This is evident from several objective facts which the Plaintiffs had
                    relied upon to establish the existence of the Back-to-Back Arrangement (see
                    above at [134(a)]). In particular, I find that Tan CB’s testimony and Ong
                    CK’s business plan clearly reflect this understanding whether or not there
                    was the Back-to-Back Arrangement before the Consent Order was entered
                    into.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_142"></a>142    Neither party has disputed that the 2004
                    Head Lease forms part of the “status quo” under clause 11 which
                    cannot be altered. Since the right to negotiate for the 2007 Head Lease is one
                    of the benefits under the 2004 Head Lease, the Defendants (CO) had altered the
                    status quo and had therefore breached clause 11 of the Consent Order when they
                    acquired the 2007 Head Lease for themselves. In my view, if the Plaintiffs had
                    won the bid, the JV Companies would have been entitled to the 2007 Head Lease
                    (which would have made the 2007 sub-tenancies from SAA academic) or at the very
                    least, fresh 2007 sub-tenancies from SAA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_143"></a>143    I note that Choo J did consider the
                    construction of clause 9(g) and concluded that clause 9(g) focuses on the
                    assignment of the 2004 Head Lease (see Choo J’s Decision at [19]). I agree
                    with this view. However, Choo J went on to conclude that the assignment of the
                    2004 Head Lease did not go so far as to prohibit the Defendants (CO) from
                    entering into the 2007 Head Lease or mandate a pro-active renewal of the
                    sub-tenancies to the JV Companies. It is on this point that I respectfully reach
                    a different conclusion from Choo J. It appears that Choo J had overlooked the
                    previous submission of the Defendants (CO) before the terms of the Consent Order
                    were settled <em>viz</em>, that there was commercial value
                    in the 2004 Head Lease in the form of the benefit of negotiating for the 2007
                    Head Lease.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_144"></a>144    I would also clarify that this submission of
                    the Defendants (CO) was to persuade Choo J to include an express term in the
                    Consent Order that the valuation to be undertaken by KPMG BA had to assign a
                    specific value for the benefit of negotiating for the 2007 Head Lease. The
                    Plaintiffs did not dispute that there was such a benefit but argued that no such
                    express term was necessary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_145"></a>145    Therefore, although Choo J did not include
                    the express term in the Consent Order that the Defendants (CO) were seeking,
                    this did not mean that the 2004 Head Lease no longer had that
                benefit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_146"></a>146    Indeed, under cross-examination in the trial
                    before me, Tan CB reinforced the previous submission of the Defendants (CO) when
                    he reluctantly accepted that the party holding the 2004 Head lease would have
                    the benefit of negotiating for the 2007 Head Lease and that it could not be that
                    one side would hold the 2004 Head Lease and the other side the 2007 Head Lease.

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_147"></a>147    I add that although Tan CB sought to change
                    his evidence the next day on 26 September 2014, he still accepted that the
                    2004 Head Lease had value because the one who holds it will be able to negotiate
                    for the 2007 Head Lease and that it cannot be that one party will hold the 2004
                    Head Lease and another the 2007 Head Lease.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_115" id="Ftn_115_1"><sup>[note: 115]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_148"></a>148    I add also that the Defendants (CO) had
                    relied on the evidence of a lawyer, one Mr Ernest Balasubramaniam (“Mr
                    Balasubramaniam”). His evidence-in-chief was that he had advised Tan CB
                    that there was no option to renew in the 2004 Head Lease since SLA had the
                    absolute discretion whether to grant the 2007 Head Lease. In late 2006, Tan CB
                    had asked whether SAA was obliged to issue fresh sub-tenancies to the JV
                    Companies since SAA was obtaining the 2007 Head Lease. Tan CB had said that he
                    was concerned that the JV Companies might be liquidated and if so, this would
                    have an impact on the sub-tenants and licensees of the JV
                Companies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_149"></a>149    Mr Balasubramaniam advised Tan CB that there
                    was no option to renew in the 2004 sub-tenancies which SAA had granted to the JV
                    Companies and that his reading of the Consent Order was that there was no
                    obligation on SAA to grant fresh sub-tenancies to the JV Companies if SAA had
                    obtained the 2007 Head Lease. He said that his view was consistent with Choo
                    J’s Decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_150"></a>150    I found this piece of evidence interesting.
                    First, there was no evidence that the JV Companies would be liquidated. On the
                    contrary, the disputing parties were intending to bid for shares in the JV
                    Companies and carry on with the business of the JV Companies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_151"></a>151    Secondly, the real question was whether
                    clause 11 and/or clause 9(g) of the Consent Order imposed an obligation on SAA
                    to assign the 2007 Head Lease to the JV Companies if the Plaintiffs were
                    successful in their bidding. If so, it was irrelevant whether the JV Companies
                    might be liquidated by the Plaintiffs. The purported concern of Tan CB for the
                    ultimate sub-tenants and licensees appeared to be a sham.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_152"></a>152    Thirdly, it was Rajah and Tann who had acted
                    for the Defendants (CO) in the negotiation of the terms of the Consent Order. If
                    Tan CB had really wanted to know the extent of the obligation of the Defendants
                    (CO) under the Consent Order, he should have consulted Rajah and Tann and not Mr
                    Balasubramaniam. It also did not escape my attention that the R&amp;T Defendants
                    preferred to call Mr Balasubramaniam rather than a lawyer from Rajah and Tann
                    who was involved in the negotiation for the terms of the Consent Order to give
                    evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_153"></a>153    I did not find Mr Balasubramaniam’s
                    evidence on the interpretation of the Consent Order to be of any assistance. In
                    so far as he was of the view that the 2004 Head Lease did not have an option to
                    renew, strictly speaking, since SLA had the absolute discretion whether to grant
                    the 2007 Head Lease, this was not in dispute. That, however, did not mean that
                    the 2004 Head Lease had no value and no bearing on the 2007 Head Lease as I have
                    elaborated above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_154"></a>154    Therefore, Mr Balasubramaniam’s
                    evidence did not assist the Defendants (CO) on the Non-Renewal
                Issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Implied term of the Consent Order</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_155"></a>155    Apart from the allegation that SAA had
                    breached clause 11 of the Consent Order by failing to grant sub-tenancies which
                    arose out of the 2007 Head Lease, the Plaintiffs also alleged as an alternative
                    that the Defendants had breached an implied term of the Consent Order by
                    appropriating the benefit of the 2007 Head Lease for themselves. This was on the
                    basis that there was an implied term in the Consent Order that SAA would not
                    “alter the status quo and in particular … [not] appropriate for
                    themselves the benefit of the Head Lease (and any potential renewal, extension
                    or regrant thereof) pending full performance of the Consent
                        Order”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_116" id="Ftn_116_1"><sup>[note: 116]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_156"></a>156    Before I proceed to consider the merits of
                    this argument, I note that it is arguable from the Revised SOC that this point
                    appears to be subsumed within the Plaintiffs’ allegations that there had
                    been a breach of clause 11 of the Consent Order.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_117" id="Ftn_117_1"><sup>[note: 117]</sup></a></span> However, I am of the view
                    that while the pleadings could have been better drafted, this was a separate
                    point from the allegation that clause 11 of the Consent Order had been breached.
                    This is evident from the fact that in the Revised SOC, this point was phrased as
                    one that was “[f]urther or in the alternative”. The Defendants
                    have also not appeared to dispute that this point had been pleaded
                        separately.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_118" id="Ftn_118_1"><sup>[note: 118]</sup></a></span> I therefore turn now
                    to consider the merits of this point.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_157"></a>157    In the event that my above interpretation of
                    clause 11 is incorrect, I am of the view that there was indeed an implied term
                    in the Consent Order that pending full performance of the Consent Order, the
                    Defendants would not appropriate the benefit of the 2007 Head Lease for
                    themselves.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_158"></a>158    In <em>Sembcorp Marine Ltd v
                        PPL Holdings Pte Ltd and another and another appeal</em> [2013] 4 SLR
                    193 at [101], the Court of Appeal expounded a three-step test for determining
                    whether a term is to be implied into a contract (“the three-step
                    test”):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    The first step is to ascertain how the gap in the
                            contract arises. Implication will be considered only if the court
                            discerns that the gap arose because the parties did not contemplate the
                            gap.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    At the second step, the court considers whether it
                            is necessary in the business or commercial sense to imply a term in
                            order to give the contract efficacy.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(c)    Finally, the court considers the specific term to
                            be implied. This must be one which the parties, having regard to the
                            need for business efficacy, would have responded "Oh, of course!" had
                            the proposed term been put to them at time of the contract. If it is not
                            possible to find such a clear response, then, the gap persists and the
                            consequences of that gap ensue</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">The first step</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_159"></a>159    The gap in the Consent Order that arises
                    here is the absence of any provision which sets out the parties’
                    obligations in the event that the bidding exercise is not carried out within the
                    timelines laid down in the Consent Order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_160"></a>160    The Plaintiffs have averred that this gap
                    was not contemplated as it was not envisaged by the parties that the bidding
                    exercise would take place after the 2004 Head Lease had expired.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_119" id="Ftn_119_1"><sup>[note: 119]</sup></a></span> This was not disputed by the Defendants. In
                    fact, in their closing submissions, the R&amp;T Defendants affirmed Choo
                    J’s construction of the Consent Order,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_120" id="Ftn_120_1"><sup>[note: 120]</sup></a></span> where he noted at [19] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Clause 11 of the Consent Order was drafted in this manner because parties
                        had envisaged that the valuation reports would be ready by May 2006. At the
                        time the Consent Order was negotiated, both parties knew full well that the
                        2004 Head Lease was expiring in September 2007. It did not strike parties at
                        that time to make provision for the expiry of the 2004 Head Lease since the
                        expiry was only <em>due more than a year</em> later in
                        September 2007. … [emphasis in original].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_161"></a>161    I am in agreement with Choo J that the
                    parties did not envisage a 13.5 month delay in the issuance of the Valuation
                    Reports and I agree that they did not contemplate that the bidding exercise
                    would take place after the 2004 Head Lease had expired.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">The second step</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_162"></a>162    In my view, it is necessary in the business
                    or commercial sense to imply a term to give the Consent Order efficacy where the
                    bidding exercise had not yet been carried out although the 2004 Head Lease had
                    expired. If a term is not implied to fill the gap mentioned above, and the
                    Defendants are allowed to appropriate the benefit of 2007 Head Lease (which they
                    did do in the present case), the Plaintiffs would effectively be deprived of the
                    entire benefit of the Consent Order. At the time that the Consent Order was
                    entered into, the benefit that was available to the parties were the remaining
                    tenure of the 2004 Head Lease and the right to negotiate for the 2007 Head
                    Lease. As alluded to earlier (at [140]-[141]), and as affirmed by the R&amp;T
                    Defendants, the latter right is of significant value.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_163"></a>163    To render the Consent Order efficacious
                    after the 2004 Head Lease had expired, there must therefore be the implication
                    of a term which would allow the parties to still be able to meaningfully bid for
                    the JV Companies. The sub-tenancies were the JV Companies’ lifeblood. The
                    JV Companies were in the business of collecting rent and license fees and its
                    business would effectively ground to a halt when it could no longer let or
                    license out individual units on the Site to third parties. Without the
                    implication of a term to fill the above gap, the bidding exercise under the
                    Consent Order would be rendered nugatory as the Plaintiffs would essentially be
                    bidding for an empty shell.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_164"></a>164    This conclusion is further reinforced when
                    one considers clause 9(g) of the Consent Order, which provides that where the
                    Plaintiffs are the higher bidder, the Defendants (CO) shall use their best
                    endeavours to transfer the head lease with SLA to the JV Companies. As I have
                    elaborated above, the parties acted on the basis that the 2004 Head Lease,
                    carried with it the right to negotiate for the 2007 Head Lease.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_165"></a>165    The R&amp;T Defendants have sought to argue
                    that the Consent Order is still efficacious without the implied term because
                    parties can still achieve the purpose of the Consent Order by proceeding with
                    the bidding exercise because the purpose of the Consent Order was to end the
                    Joint Venture.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_121" id="Ftn_121_1"><sup>[note: 121]</sup></a></span> I am
                    unable to agree. In my view, the purpose of the Consent Order was not simply to
                    end the Joint Venture. If that was its only purpose, the JV Companies could have
                    been sold to third parties or liquidated. Rather, the purpose was to end the
                    joint venture by allowing either side to carry on with the business of the JV
                    Companies. That aspect was no longer available as there was no more business to
                    continue on the facts if the R&amp;T Defendants were correct. The R&amp;T
                    Defendants are essentially saying that having the Plaintiffs bid for something
                    valueless would be efficacious. This is a wholly untenable position. As argued
                    by the Plaintiffs in their further reply submission, the purpose of the Consent
                    Order was to end the Joint Venture and separate the warring shareholders
                        <em>in an equitable manner</em>.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_122" id="Ftn_122_1"><sup>[note: 122]</sup></a></span> In my view, the mechanism of the bidding
                    exercise was meant to ensure that the party who values the JV Companies more
                    would be able to gain control over them and the party who values the JV
                    Companies less would receive in monetary terms a greater sum than what it
                    ascribes to the JV Companies. This would have resulted in a win-win situation
                    which was the essence of the compromise reached in the Consent
                Order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_166"></a>166    Therefore, for the Consent Order to retain
                    its efficacy after the expiry of the 2004 Head Lease, a term had to be implied
                    to prevent either party from appropriating the benefit of the 2007 Head Lease
                    before the bidding exercise had concluded and indeed to preserve the right to
                    negotiate for the 2007 Head Lease or to the 2007 Head Lease
                itself.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">The third step</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_167"></a>167    In the circumstances, if the officious
                    bystander asked the parties whether the Defendants (CO) should be prohibited
                    from appropriating the benefit of the 2007 Head Lease pending the performance of
                    the Consent Order, would the parties have responded “Oh, of
                    course!”?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_168"></a>168    In my view, the answer must be in the
                    affirmative. If this were not the case, the Plaintiffs would effectively be put
                    in a position where they were to bid for something which is bereft of value.
                    That could not have been something which the parties would have agreed
                    to.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_169"></a>169    Therefore, I conclude that there is an
                    implied term in the Consent Order that the Defendants are obligated to refrain
                    from appropriating the benefit of the 2007 Head Lease pending the full
                    performance of the Consent Order. The Defendants (CO), in securing the 2007 Head
                    Lease for themselves and refusing to grant corresponding sub-tenancies to the JV
                    Companies, have failed to do so and have therefore breached this implied
                    term.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_170"></a>170    Having found that this implied term has been
                    breached, the next question is whether the breach is repudiatory. Only
                    repudiatory breaches would entitle the innocent party to terminate the contract
                    (or treat the contract as discharged) (<em>RDC Concrete Pte Ltd v
                        Sato Kogyo (S) Pte Ltd and another appeal</em> [2007] 4 SLR(R) 413
                        (“<em>RDC Concrete</em>”) at [90]).
                    Whether a breach is considered repudiatory in turn depends on the seriousness of
                    the breach.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_171"></a>171    I note that the R&amp;T Defendants did not
                    dispute that if the appropriation of the 2007 Head Lease was a breach of the
                    Consent Order, it would amount to a repudiatory breach. In any event, I am of
                    the view that SAA’s failure to renew the sub-tenancies of the JV Companies
                    would constitute a repudiatory breach as it “[deprived] the innocent
                    party of substantially the whole benefit that it was intended that the innocent
                    party should obtain from the contract” (<em>RDC
                        Concrete</em> at [107]). The purpose of the Consent Order was for one
                    of the two parties to buyout the shareholding of the other party through a
                    bidding exercise. As I have said, depriving the JV Companies of the benefit of
                    the 2007 Head Lease had made the bidding exercise meaningless. There was simply
                    no longer any point for the Plaintiffs to bid for the JV
                Companies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_172"></a>172    The repudiatory breach committed by SAA gave
                    the Plaintiffs the right to bring the Consent Order to an end, and I find that
                    the Plaintiffs had formally elected to end this contract by the commencement of
                    the present suit on 8 January 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Non-Disclosure Issue: whether any repudiatory breach arose from
                SAA’s failure to disclose the renewal of the head lease with SLA for the third
                tranche</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_173"></a>173    The Plaintiffs’ success with the
                    Non-Renewal Issue, which embodied the primary claim mounted by the Plaintiffs,
                    would have been sufficient to achieve its overarching goal of setting aside the
                    Consent Order. For completeness, however, I will move on to deal with several
                    other fall-back claims raised by the Plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_174"></a>174    The first fall-back claim was SAA’s
                    failure to disclose its procurement of the 2007 Head Lease. As a preliminary
                    matter, it may be noted that the Plaintiffs’ claim of non-disclosure was
                    initially advanced as a breach of an implied term in their
                        pleadings.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_123" id="Ftn_123_1"><sup>[note: 123]</sup></a></span> In their closing submissions, they
                    appear to have shifted away from this approach to rely on clause 5 of the
                    Consent Order instead,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_124" id="Ftn_124_1"><sup>[note: 124]</sup></a></span> which stated as
                        follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_125" id="Ftn_125_1"><sup>[note: 125]</sup></a></span></p>

                            absolute discretion in conducting the Valuation Exercise as he deems fit

                                Valuation Exercise</em>. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The italicised portion of clause 5 is relied upon by the
                        Plaintiffs to advance their non-disclosure argument.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_175"></a>175    The Plaintiffs’ argument is that
                    SAA’s failure or refusal to disclose to the KPMG entities that it had
                    secured the 2007 Head Lease “hindered” the investigation exercise
                    which KPMG BA was supposed to undertake, thereby violating clause 5 of the
                    Consent Order. The issue arising from the Plaintiffs’ contention therefore
                    is whether SAA was hindering or preventing the KPMG entities from discharging
                    its duties when it did not disclose the existence of the 2007 Head
                Lease.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_176"></a>176    It should first be noted that the duties in
                    question relied upon by the Plaintiffs to support their contention of the
                    non-disclosure complaint was the KPMG entities’ duty to value the JV
                    Companies’ assets and liabilities for the purposes of informing the
                    parties’ decision on a fair amount to submit in the bidding exercise that
                    would ensue. As the Plaintiffs argued, the KPMG entities would no longer be able
                    to value the JV Companies’ accurately when “a material fact”
                    such as the 2007 Head Lease was hidden from them. To justify his decision not to
                    disclose this matter, Tan CB explained that the 2007 Head Lease was a property
                    that properly belonged to SAA and therefore it had no reason to disclose it to
                    the KPMG entities; it did not fall within the pool of assets which the JV
                    Companies were supposed to value. By now, it should be clear that this argument
                    does not hold water as I have held that the right to negotiate or the right to
                    the 2007 Head Lease itself was one of the benefits which the parties were
                    bidding for under the Consent Order. Indeed, it was an important benefit given
                    that there was only about one and a half years left under the 2004 Head Lease if
                    the bidding exercise was carried out in accordance with the anticipated
                    timelines. The 2007 Head Lease should therefore have been disclosed to the KPMG
                    entities for the purposes of carrying out the valuation exercise and thereby the
                    bidding exercise.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_177"></a>177    In failing to disclose the 2007 Head Lease,
                    the Defendants (CO) had “hindered” the valuer’s discharge of
                    its duties and had thereby breached clause 5 of the Consent
                Order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_178"></a>178    In my view, this amounts to a repudiatory
                    breach of the Consent Order as well. The failure to disclose the existence of
                    the 2007 Head Lease is inextricably linked to the above conclusion that the
                    Defendants (CO) had breached the Consent Order by misappropriating the benefit
                    of the 2007 Head Lease for themselves.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Investigation and Valuation Issue: whether the investigation and
                valuation exercises required of the KPMG entities were properly carried
                out</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_179"></a>179    The Non-Renewal Issue and the Non-Disclosure
                    Issue thus far concerned the JV Companies’ claim for a stake in the
                    benefit of the 2007 Head Lease. The Investigation and Valuation Issue, which I
                    will now turn to, touches upon the KPMG entities’ duties and
                    responsibilities under the Consent Order. In this regard, the Plaintiffs argued
                    that the investigation and valuation aspects were not properly carried out by
                    the KPMG entities.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The investigation exercise</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_180"></a>180    The main thrust of the Plaintiffs’
                    allegations under this claim can be described as a dissatisfaction with the
                    investigation findings made by KPMG BA. However, before delving into the
                    parties’ substantive arguments, I make a short comment on the way this
                    point was couched in legal terms by the Plaintiffs. In the Revised SOC, it was
                    alleged that the Consent Order suffers from a total failure of consideration as
                    the Plaintiffs’ allegations in the Consolidated Suits were not properly
                    compromised. This ground was relied upon in the Revised SOC to support the
                    Plaintiffs’ overarching attempt to set aside the Consent Order. However,
                    there appears to have been a departure from this stance in the Plaintiffs’
                    closing submissions. The same complaint was no longer developed in the context
                    of “a total failure of consideration”. Instead, the Plaintiffs
                    appeared to have characterised the KPMG entities’ efforts in implementing
                    the Consent Order as a “breach” of the Consent Order.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_126" id="Ftn_126_1"><sup>[note: 126]</sup></a></span> The latter submission rested on an
                    assumption that a non-party is capable of breaching a contract. This struck me
                    as an intriguing proposition for, as the R&amp;T Defendants quickly pointed out
                    in their closing submissions,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_127" id="Ftn_127_1"><sup>[note: 127]</sup></a></span> the Plaintiffs did not explore in greater
                    detail the legal principles behind the assumption they were making.
                    Nevertheless, I find that there are other cogent reasons why the
                    Plaintiffs’ complaint against the KPMG entities is unfounded and it is to
                    this that my analysis now turns to.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_181"></a>181    The Plaintiffs cast various aspersions
                    against the KPMG entities, but the gist of it can be summarised as follows. They
                    alleged that KPMG BA did not conduct an independent investigation into both the
                    JV Companies’ cost and expenses as well as its revenue stream. In this
                    regard, they tried to persuade me that all KPMG BA relied on to do its job was
                    the audited accounts. The Plaintiffs relied on section 1.1 of the Valuation
                    Reports for both TCAE and TCPL which stated as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In performing this assignment, [KPMG CF]:</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">-    has not independently investigated or verified the

                            of the financial statements provided by the Parties to the
                            Action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_182"></a>182    In particular, emphasis was placed on the
                    failure to verify the reasonableness of the monies paid to Goodland and
                        AGA,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_128" id="Ftn_128_1"><sup>[note: 128]</sup></a></span> both of which were
                    entities related to some of the Defendants. The Plaintiffs contended that this
                    association warranted a closer scrutiny from KPMG BA. Further, KPMG BA did not
                    appear to have given sufficient weight to the revenue that was allegedly
                    generated from the landfill activity which it claimed to have amounted to about
                        $5m.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_129" id="Ftn_129_1"><sup>[note: 129]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_183"></a>183    While I am able to sympathise with the
                    Plaintiffs’ concerns that the Valuation Reports did appear to be slightly
                    cursory in its findings, I do not find it appropriate for me to make a
                    conclusive finding on whether or not KPMG BA had carried out a proper
                    investigation. It is true that on a purposive reading of the Consent Order, KPMG
                    BA was under a duty to conduct a thorough investigation of the Plaintiffs’
                    allegations so as to give a meaningful closure to the parties’ dispute in
                    the Consolidated Suits. Even the R&amp;T Defendants’ expert, Andrew
                    Grimmett, agreed on cross-examination that the investigation was supposed to be
                    fairly rigorous, and that the standard expected of the investigation should
                    match that of an audit, if not more stringent.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_130" id="Ftn_130_1"><sup>[note: 130]</sup></a></span>
                    But my ability to resolve this issue is nevertheless circumscribed by two
                    considerations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_184"></a>184    First, neither of the KPMG entities were
                    called to give evidence on what exactly was done or not done insofar as the
                    investigation exercise was concerned. Thus, while the Plaintiffs contended that
                    a valuer would be obliged to the court to show the basis on which it had arrived
                    at the valuation, it would be unfair, in this particular instance, to the KPMG
                    entities if I were to jump to conclusions without giving them an opportunity to
                    respond to the allegations the Plaintiffs were making. After all, amongst all
                    the parties and witnesses involved in this action, they are probably the ones in
                    the best position to shed light on the tasks they had performed under the
                    Consent Order. In the absence of this critical piece of evidence from the
                    overall picture, I do not find it wise to make a ruling on this
                issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_185"></a>185    The second consideration I have in mind is
                    the way the Consent Order was drafted. Clause 5 clearly stipulated that the KPMG
                    entities had <em>absolute discretion</em> in carrying out
                    the investigation and valuation exercise. This suggests that great latitude
                    would be accorded to the KPMG entities in determining the appropriate manner to
                    carry out the investigation and valuation exercise. That being the case, I find
                    it difficult for the Plaintiffs’ to go back on what they have expressly
                    agreed to by now attempting to prescribe a higher normative standard on the KPMG
                    entities. In this regard, I find the following words of Rajah JA in <em>Zurich Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd v B-Gold Interior Design &amp;
                        Construction Pte Ltd</em> [2008] 3 SLR(R) 1029 poignant in describing
                    the limits of the courts’ powers when it is asked to interpret the express
                    terms of a contract (at [132(f)]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A court should always be careful to ensure that extrinsic evidence is used
                        to explain and illuminate the written words, and not to contradict or vary
                        them. Where a court concludes that the parties have used the wrong words,
                        rectification may be a more appropriate remedy …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_186"></a>186    Before I move on from this topic, I will
                    address one of the defences mounted by the R&amp;T Defendants, which is that the
                    investigation issue was not sufficiently pleaded.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_131" id="Ftn_131_1"><sup>[note: 131]</sup></a></span> They argued that the Plaintiffs’
                    pleaded case has always been that there were no investigations at all conducted
                    by KPMG BA, and not that investigations were not properly conducted. This is not
                    how I understood the Plaintiffs to have pleaded the matter. The relevant portion
                    in the Revised SOC at paragraph 41(a), which was in relation to the claim that
                    “the Plaintiffs’ claims in the Consolidated Suits have not been
                    compromised”, is as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    there has not been an investigation by [KPMG BA]
                            pursuant to clauses 2 and 5 of the Consent Order …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_187"></a>187    Based on the phrase “pursuant to
                    clauses 2 and 5 of the Consent Order”, it seems clear to me that
                    Plaintiffs were claiming that KPMG BA had fallen below the standards required of
                    them under the two clauses in question, although I would add that it would
                    certainly have benefited the Plaintiffs had they worded the claim in more
                    precise terms. But given that the message it sought to convey was not as unclear
                    as the R&amp;T Defendants purported, I do not think drawing such fine
                    distinctions in the wording would do much to bolster their case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The valuation exercise</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_188"></a>188    What was discussed in the previous section
                    relates to the Plaintiffs’ dissatisfaction with the investigatory aspect
                    of KPMG BA’s work. I now turn to examine whether there is any merit in the
                    Plaintiffs’ complaint over the valuation aspect of KPMG CF’s
                    work.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_189"></a>189    Under this section, the Plaintiffs’
                    complaints can be further classified into two sub-categories. The first is that
                    the NAV (Net Asset Valuation) methodology adopted by KPMG CF was inappropriate.
                    To that, I reiterate my comments made earlier, that the KPMG entities should
                    have been called to give the best evidence. Suffice to say, in choosing this
                    methodology KPMG CF may very well have been motivated by its assumption that the
                    2004 STAs were about to expire in August 2007 and there would be no subsequent
                    renewals. If this was a valid assumption made by KPMG CF, the alternative method
                    proposed by the Plaintiffs’ expert witness, Timothy James Reid, that is to
                    value the JV Companies based on its prospective revenue receivable, may not
                    necessarily be superior.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_190"></a>190    The second point appears to be more
                    significant. The Plaintiffs contended that because the Valuation Reports were
                    issued so late – 13.5 months after its expected due date based on the
                    timelines stipulated in the Consent Order – the bidding exercise had been
                    rendered meaningless.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_132" id="Ftn_132_1"><sup>[note: 132]</sup></a></span> While the
                    R&amp;T Defendants argued that the delay was not unexpected as the timelines
                    were subject to variation by consent, this does not detract from the fact that
                    the valuation figures contained in the Valuation Report were way out of date.
                    The outdated valuation date set by the KPMG entities of 31 May 2006 coupled
                    with the fact that the parties were asked to bid for the JV Companies much later
                    in August 2007, gave rise to the inexorable conclusion that the valuation
                    figures were no longer capable of serving the purpose originally intended, which
                    is to inform the parties accurately of the value of the JV Companies so that
                    commercially sensible and realistic bids can be submitted. Even Tan CB agreed on
                    cross-examination that it is paramount for valuation figures to be accurate and
                    up to date for them to assist him in the bidding exercise and that the value of
                    the JV Companies could have changed between 31 May 2006 and August
                        2007.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_133" id="Ftn_133_1"><sup>[note: 133]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_191"></a>191    I am of the view that although the Valuation
                    Reports were issued so late, and that even if the bidding exercise had indeed
                    been rendered meaningless, it cannot be said that the KPMG entities had breached
                    the Consent Order. As alluded to earlier, the question of whether a non-party
                    can be found to be in breach of contract was not canvassed fully before
                    me.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_192"></a>192    However, what this shows is that even if I
                    am wrong that there had been a repudiatory breach of the Consent Order committed
                    by the Defendants, I cannot order the bidding exercise to be proceeded with.
                    This is because there is nothing left to bid for. At this point in time, both
                    the 2004 and 2007 Head Leases have already run their course.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_193"></a>193    As mentioned earlier (see above at [165]),
                    the purpose of the Consent Order cannot be myopically viewed as simply a
                    mechanism to bring the Joint Venture to an end with no regard to the interests
                    of the parties. If the R&amp;T Defendants’ position is correct, it would
                    be akin to saying that the purpose of the Consent Order can be met by the
                    Defendants (CO) bidding a nominal sum and in so doing, gaining control over the
                    JV Companies and keeping all the benefits of the 2004 Head Lease and the 2007
                    Head Lease. This would essentially leave the Plaintiffs with absolutely nothing.
                    I am unable to agree that this is what the Consent Order was meant to achieve.
                    While it would not make a difference in the ultimate analysis, I would also add
                    that the Defendants (CO) are not even offering to account to the Plaintiffs the
                    revenue that was generated from the JV Companies during the period of the 2004
                    STAs if the Plaintiffs were to win the bid or the remainder of such a period, if
                    the bidding exercise was carried out in accordance with the anticipated
                    timelines under the Consent Order. This exemplifies a lack of <em>bona fides</em>. The Defendants (CO) are seeking to gain everything
                    for nothing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_194"></a>194    In <em>Hoban Steven Maurice
                        Dixon and another v Scanlon Graeme John and others</em> [2007] 2
                    SLR(R) 770 (“<em>Hoban</em>”), the trial
                    judge had resolved a minority oppression action by ordering that there be a
                    valuation of the company’s shares with a view to a buy-out by one party of
                    the other party’s shares. The court-appointed expert valued the shares at
                    ‘nil’ value. The appellants requested that the trial judge adjust
                    the valuation of the share but the trial judge refused to intervene. The Court
                    of Appeal declined to interfere with the trial judge’s decision to affirm
                    the ‘nil’ valuation but went on to hold that the ‘nil’
                    valuation rendered the buy-out order “inoperative” (at
                    [42]–[43]). The Court of Appeal then made the consequential order that
                    parties be restored to the <em>status quo ante</em>, as if
                    the buy-out order had never been made (at [46]). I find <em>Hoban</em> to be on point. It makes clear that the court can set
                    aside an order on the basis that it is rendered inoperative. From my
                    observations above, I am of the view that the Consent Order has indeed been
                    rendered inoperative, much like the case in <em>Hoban</em>.
                    I am accordingly unable to order for the bidding exercise to be proceeded
                    with.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_195"></a>195    Therefore, apart from the repudiatory
                    breaches committed by SAA in not renewing the sub-tenancies for the third
                    tranche, I will also set aside the Consent Order on the basis that the Consent
                    Order has been rendered inoperative. This is so even if Choo J’s Decision
                    constitutes <em>res judicata</em> on the Plaintiffs’
                    allegations about the repudiatory breaches. The <em>res
                        judicata</em> argument does not extend to the question of whether the
                    Consent Order has been rendered inoperative. Indeed it will be recalled that
                    although Choo J also decided in another application that the parties to the
                    Consent Order were to carry on with the bidding exercise, the Court of Appeal
                    had set aside that decision (see [49] above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_196"></a>196    The R&amp;T Defendants argued that the
                    Plaintiffs did not plead that the valuation reports were useless because they
                    were issued almost one year after the valuation date.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_134" id="Ftn_134_1"><sup>[note: 134]</sup></a></span> I am unable to agree. The claim of
                    frustration still exists in the Revised SOC although not elaborated as such in
                    the Plaintiffs’ arguments. It is clear that in both the Plaintiffs’
                    case and the R&amp;T Defendants’ case, the bidding exercise was to be
                    undertaken so that if the Plaintiffs won the bid, they would get the benefit of
                    operating the JV Companies for at least the remainder of the 2004 sub-tenancies
                    even if the JV Companies and the Plaintiffs were not supposed to get the benefit
                    under the 2007 Head Lease as well. By the time the valuation reports were issued
                    on 10 August 2007, there was less than a month left on the 2004 sub-tenancies. I
                    therefore find that this point had been sufficiently pleaded by the
                    Plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The QS Issue: whether the Defendants obstructed efforts to appoint a
                QS and whether the failure of appoint a QS enables the Plaintiffs to set aside the
                Consent Order</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_197"></a>197    The Investigation and Valuation Issue in the
                    previous section discusses the duties of the KPMG entities under the Consent
                    Order and whether they had fallen below the standards expected of them. I now
                    come to an ancillary issue that also touches upon certain aspects of the
                    investigation exercise, but the allegations cast by the Plaintiffs were directed
                    more towards certain obstructions put up by the Defendants to hinder the
                    investigation exercise as opposed to the KPMG entities’ inadequacies
                        <em>per se</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_198"></a>198    I begin by noting that clause 6 of the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_199"></a>199    Suffice it to say for now, as the story
                    unravelled, the KPMG entities did not manage to appoint a QS. Notwithstanding
                    this, the KPMG entities proceeded to finalise the investigation and valuation
                    exercise. The Plaintiffs relied on the failure to appoint a QS as an additional
                    plank to attack the integrity of the Valuation Reports. The assistance of a QS,
                    they argued, was a cornerstone to any meaningful implementation of the
                    investigation exercise for without which KPMG BA would not be able to
                    investigate the reasonableness of the construction costs paid by the JV
                        Companies.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_135" id="Ftn_135_1"><sup>[note: 135]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_200"></a>200    The factual matrix concerning this issue may
                    be summarised briefly. The first QS appointed, Goh Tiak Chua &amp; Co Pte Ltd
                    (“GTCCPL”), withdrew itself because the drawings made available to
                    it were inadequate for the purposes of verifying the costs of renovation work
                    done for the JV Companies. Subsequently, after several QSes had refused to take
                    up the verification works (<em>ie</em>, George Low Co and
                    T.J. Chiam Surveyors Pte Ltd), DLS (see above at [74]) agreed to carry out the
                    works although its quoted fee was $16,750 more than the fee quoted by GTCCPL.
                    AsiaLegal wrote to KPMG BA insisting that the additional costs of appointing DLS
                    should be borne by the JV Companies since the previous QS was unable to perform
                    the verification works due to the JV Companies’ failure to provide the
                    required information/drawings. After protracted negotiations, AsiaLegal
                    subsequently informed KPMG BA that the Plaintiffs would make payment of their
                    share of DLS’ fees purely to expedite matters and that the payment was
                    made strictly under protest. Rajah &amp; Tann then informed KPMG BA that the
                    Defendants (CO) were not agreeable to paying their share of DLS’ fees, and
                    that they were prepared for KPMG CF to prepare the Valuation Reports without
                    engaging a QS.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_136" id="Ftn_136_1"><sup>[note: 136]</sup></a></span>
                    Eventually, KPMG BA wrote to the Consent Order Parties informing them that as
                    they had not received any objection from the Consent Order Parties to complete
                    the Valuation Exercise without the appointment of a QS and in order not to
                    protract the matter further, they would proceed to finalise the Valuation
                    Report.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_201"></a>201    Against this factual backdrop, the
                    Plaintiffs blamed the Defendants for causing the investigation work to be done
                    without a QS. The allegations made were two-fold. First, the Plaintiffs averred
                    that the Defendants had hidden important documents required by the QS to carry
                    out its work. Secondly, when KPMG BA finally found a QS (<em>ie</em>, DLS) that was willing to perform the task, the Defendants
                    (CO) threw yet another spanner in the works by refusing to pay their share of
                    the additional fees required by DLS. Cumulatively, these two moves obstructed
                    KPMG from appointing a QS.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_137" id="Ftn_137_1"><sup>[note: 137]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_202"></a>202    I need not conclude whether these
                    allegations have been made out because there is a fundamental reason why the
                    Plaintiffs’ claim would ultimately fail even assuming there was any merit
                    in their allegations. It was strenuously argued by the Plaintiffs that the QS
                    formed an integral part of the investigation and valuation exercises and any
                    attempt to detract from the goal of appointing a QS cannot be condoned with.
                    However, while the appointment of a QS might have been important, the Plaintiffs
                    appeared willing not to insist on such an appointment. The Plaintiffs did not
                    voice any objection when KPMG BA wrote to the parties on 24 July 2007
                    informing them that the Valuation Reports would be issued without engaging a QS
                    unless parties object otherwise. Their silence on this matter gave rise to an
                    irresistible inference that they were amenable to the dispensation of a QS. This
                    led to KPMG BA writing to the parties on 3 August 2007 informing them that they
                    would proceed to finalise the Valuation Report without engaging a QS as there
                    had been no objection from the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_203"></a>203    The Plaintiffs averred in their reply
                    closing submissions that even though there was no written objection, they had
                    made an objection over the phone to Bob Yap, a director of KPMG BA. I find this
                    account of events improbable for several reasons. First, Johnny Yeo testified on
                    the stand that he could not even remember whether such a conversation took place
                    between the critical period of 24 July 2007 and 3 August 2007.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_138" id="Ftn_138_1"><sup>[note: 138]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_204"></a>204    Secondly, consistent with Johnny Yeo’s
                    murky testimony on this point, Michael Lim also did not unequivocally testify
                    that the objection was made to Bob Yap. When pressed for the contents of the
                    objection, he replied it was Bob Yap who said that engaging a QS would be
                    preferable. His evidence did not show that the Plaintiffs had insisted on
                    appointing a QS.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_139" id="Ftn_139_1"><sup>[note: 139]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_205"></a>205    Thirdly, if there had been a verbal
                    objection between 24 July 2007 and 3 August 2007, KPMG BA would surely
                    not have issued the letter dated 3 August 2007 (see [202]) to notify the
                    parties that it had not received any objection from the parties. Furthermore, if
                    the letter dated 3 August 2007 was issued by mistake as the Plaintiffs have
                    contended, then the logical thing to do would be for them to write to KPMG BA
                    immediately to correct them. They continued to remain silent even after
                    receiving the 3 August 2007 letter from KPMG BA even though they were
                    represented by lawyers at the material time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_206"></a>206    Fourthly, in a letter issued to Rajah and
                    Tann by the Plaintiffs’ lawyers, AsiaLegal, dated 23 July 2007, it
                    was stated in unequivocal terms that the Plaintiffs themselves were prepared to
                    proceed without a QS so as to expedite matters:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… We are instructed that unless the said sum of S$10,468.75 is paid
                        to [KPMG CF] by close of business on Wednesday, 25 July 2007, our clients
                        reserve the right to take such appropriate steps as they deem fit, including
                        but not limited to <em>making an application to Court and/or
                            requesting [KPMG CF] to proceed with the valuation without engaging a
                            [QS] if [KPMG CF] deems it to be fit</em> …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>During the trial, Michael Lim tried to explain away this
                        letter by claiming that AsiaLegal had sent it against their
                            instructions.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_140" id="Ftn_140_1"><sup>[note: 140]</sup></a></span> I do not find
                        this explanation to be credible as this letter was copied to the Plaintiffs
                        and it was not corrected by them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_207"></a>207    Fifthly, and crucially, in the
                    Plaintiffs’ written submissions in SUM 4117 (amended), they conceded that
                    “the Plaintiffs had no option but to reluctantly agree to dispense with
                    the engagement of a surveyor so as to expedite matters”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_141" id="Ftn_141_1"><sup>[note: 141]</sup></a></span> This shows clearly
                    that the Plaintiffs were ultimately willing for the valuation exercise to
                    proceed without the appointment of a QS.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_208"></a>208    Before I conclude this issue, a fall-back
                    argument mounted by the Plaintiffs merits a brief discussion. The Plaintiffs
                    contended that even if the parties had agreed to dispense with the use of a QS,
                    there was an overriding duty on KPMG BA’s part to ensure it would utilise
                    a QS in performing the investigative work.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_142" id="Ftn_142_1"><sup>[note: 142]</sup></a></span> I am unable to agree. Clauses 5 and 6, when
                    read together, gave rise to no such obligation. In fact, both clauses indicated
                    that the appointment of a QS was never fundamental to the investigation and
                    valuation exercise. It was always at the discretion of the KPMG entities to
                    appoint a QS as they deem fit. This is borne out by clause 6, which stated that
                    KPMG CF “shall be <em>at liberty</em> to engage a
                    [QS] … as [it] deems necessary or appropriate …” [emphasis
                    added]. Consistent with clause 6, clause 5 gave KPMG CF “unfettered and
                    absolute discretion in conducting the Valuation Exercise as [it] deems fit
                    …” It was ultimately the KPMG entities’ judgment call
                    whether a QS should be appointed to assist them and it was within their rights
                    to dispense with the need for a QS. In any event, it is not open to the
                    Plaintiffs to say that KPMG BA had such an overriding duty when they had
                    themselves, by conduct, waived this requirement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The R&amp;T Defendants’s counterclaim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_209"></a>209    Having decided above that the Consent Order
                    is to be set aside, either on the basis of a repudiatory breach or that the
                    Consent Order had been rendered inoperative, I dismiss the R&amp;T
                    Defendants’ counterclaim for the bidding exercise to be proceeded
                    with.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Consequential Orders</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_210"></a>210    Having set aside the Consent Order, I turn
                    now to consider the Consequential Orders requested by the Plaintiffs (<em>ie</em>, for leave to continue with the Consolidated Suits
                    with the appropriate directions) (see [59] above). With the Consent Order having
                    been set aside, it follows that the Consolidated Suits are allowed to be
                    reinstated. Tan CB, Ong CK and Tan Senior have, however, raised certain
                    objections to being named in the Consolidated Suits. This gives rise to two
                    questions. The first question is whether Tan CB and Ong CK were parties to the
                    Joint Venture. The answer to this question would determine whether the
                    Plaintiffs have a legal basis to name these two individuals as defendants in the
                    Consolidated Suits. The second question is whether Ong CK and Tan Senior may
                    avoid being named as defendants in the Consolidated Suits, but for reasons
                    different from the first question. They contended that because they had not been
                    named as defendants in the Consolidated Suits for a significant number of years,
                    it was unfair to now drag them back into the litigation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether Tan CB and Ong CK were proper parties to the Joint
                Venture</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_211"></a>211    As alluded to in the background facts, when
                    the Consolidated Suits were commenced in 2002 and 2004, the Plaintiffs did not
                    name Tan CB and Ong CK as defendants. In the present suit, the Plaintiffs are
                    applying for these two individuals to be added to the list of defendants in the
                    underlying Consolidated Suits which have now been reinstated pursuant to the
                    setting aside of the Consent Order. Unsurprisingly, Tan CB and Ong CK did not
                    want the Plaintiffs to drag them into the Consolidated Suits, claiming that they
                    were never parties to the Joint Venture in their personal capacity. Instead,
                    they had used SAA as the corporate vehicle to represent them in the Joint
                    Venture, and this was reflected in the Plaintiffs’ election to sue SAA in
                    the Consolidated Suits. The question that arises for my determination is
                    therefore whether Tan CB and Ong CK were parties to the Joint
                Venture.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_212"></a>212    The MOU, being the primary document
                    containing the terms of the Joint Venture, is an appropriate starting point to
                    examine this question. The first page of the MOU clearly stated that SAA was a
                    party to the Joint Venture. Tan CB and Ong CK were not named.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_213"></a>213    However, the second page of the MOU stated
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This memorandum of understanding is made between the following <em>joint venture parties</em> … [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Tan CB’s and Ong CK’s names and signatures were
                        penned down below that sentence. The two individuals contended that they
                        were signing as directors on behalf of SAA but SAA’s name is not
                        stated in the second page as one of the joint venture parties and there was
                        no indication in the second page that they were signing on behalf of SAA.
                        Furthermore, the two names and signatures were not side by side or one below
                        the other. This gave rise to the impression that they were signing in their
                        individual capacities and not for a joint purpose.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_214"></a>214    As for evidence other than the express words
                    in the MOU itself, the closing submissions from Rajah and Tann pointed out (at
                    para 124) that the Plaintiffs had themselves asserted in earlier pleadings and
                    other court documents that SAA was a party to the MOU.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_215"></a>215    On the other hand, as Johnny Yeo
                        explained,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_143" id="Ftn_143_1"><sup>[note: 143]</sup></a></span> the allocation of the shares
                    in the Joint Venture was based on 12.5% for each of the Eight Individuals with
                    Tan CB and Ong CK being two of the Eight Individuals. That is why the three
                    Plaintiffs had a combined shareholding of 37.5% only. If there were only seven
                    shareholders with SAA being one shareholder instead of Tan CB or Ong CK, then
                    how did the Plaintiffs come to hold only 37.5% of the shares? This was not
                    adequately explained by the SAA Group. It was not sufficient for Tan CB to
                    simply assert that the SAA Group wanted to be in the majority as that
                    explanation did not address the actual percentages held by the parties.
                    Furthermore, as Johnny Yeo explained,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_144" id="Ftn_144_1"><sup>[note: 144]</sup></a></span> it was
                    because there were eight persons to the Joint Venture that Tan CB and Ong CK
                    signed the second page of the MOU without any indication on the page that they
                    were signing on behalf of SAA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_216"></a>216    I reiterate that it was Ong CK who drafted
                    the MOU. He could not give a satisfactory explanation as to why SAA was named as
                    a contracting party in the first page of the MOU but yet Tan CB and he signed on
                    the second page without any indication that they were signing on behalf of SAA.
                    I also draw an adverse inference against Ong CK under the <em>contra proferentem</em> rule.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_217"></a>217    On a balance of probabilities, I am of the
                    view that the factors in favour of the Plaintiffs’ contention outweigh
                    those in favour of the contention of Tan CB and Ong CK.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_218"></a>218    All things considered, I conclude that Tan
                    CB and Ong CK did enter into the Joint Venture in their personal capacities and
                    it was they, and not SAA who were parties to the Joint Venture. SAA may have
                    been the vehicle used by Tan CB and Ong CK to hold their shares in the JV
                    Companies. I therefore grant the Plaintiffs leave to join Tan CB and Ong CK as
                    defendants in the reinstated Consolidated Suits.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether Tan Senior and Ong CK could rely on the Plaintiffs’
                delay in bringing them back into litigation to avoid being named as defendants in
                the reinstated Consolidated Suits </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_219"></a>219    Although Tan Senior was named as a party in
                    the Consolidated Suits, the Plaintiffs did not continue such action against him
                    after he became bankrupt. Since he is no longer a bankrupt, the Plaintiffs seek
                    to continue such actions against him. As for Ong CK, the Plaintiffs wish to add
                    him and Tan CB as defendants as discussed above. Both Tan Senior and Ong CK
                    pleaded a number of defences to bar the Plaintiffs from pursuing them in the
                    reinstated Consolidated Suits, namely, laches, estoppel by conduct and waiver by
                    election.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">Doctrine of laches and doctrine of estoppel by conduct</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_220"></a>220    It is not disputed that there was a long
                    delay before the Plaintiffs joined Tan Senior and Ong CK to the present action
                    in January 2009. For Tan Senior, the Plaintiffs did not seek leave from the
                    court to continue the Consolidated Suits against him after he fell into
                    bankruptcy on 29 August 2003, giving rise to a delay of about five
                        years.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_145" id="Ftn_145_1"><sup>[note: 145]</sup></a></span> For Ong CK, he was never
                    named as a defendant in the Consolidated Suits to begin with since its
                    commencement in 2002. The delay in Ong CK’s case was therefore about seven
                    years.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_221"></a>221    Insofar as the doctrines of laches and
                    estoppel are concerned, “prejudice” or “detriment”
                    is a common element embodied in both doctrines that has to be satisfied before
                    the defendant can successfully rely on either of them to defeat a
                    plaintiff’s claim (see <em>Management Corporation Strata
                        Title Plan No 473 v De Beers Jewellery Pte Ltd</em> [2002] 1 SLR(R)
                    418 at [33] for elements of doctrine of laches and <em>Chai Cher
                        Watt (trading as Chuang Aik Engineering Works) v SDL Technologies Pte Ltd
                        and another appeal</em> [2012] 1 SLR 152 (“<em>SDL Technologies</em>”) at [33] for elements of estoppel by
                    conduct). In <em>Dynasty Line Ltd (in liquidation) v Sia Sukamto
                        and another</em> [2013] 4 SLR 253, Lai Siu Chiu J rejected the first
                    defendant’s reliance on the doctrine of laches because he was unable to
                    show he had suffered “significant prejudice” (at [37]). Here,
                    similarly, neither Ong CK nor Tan Senior has adduced any evidence of them having
                    suffered such prejudice. In Ong CK’s case, repeated bare assertions of
                    having suffered a detriment from the delay of seven years were made without any
                    attempt to furnish evidence or even details of the so-called
                        detriment.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_146" id="Ftn_146_1"><sup>[note: 146]</sup></a></span> Both Ong CK and Tan Senior also claimed to
                    have lost certain “documents”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_147" id="Ftn_147_1"><sup>[note: 147]</sup></a></span> However, no effort was made to
                    elaborate on what exactly was lost that could have caused them prejudice. It
                    goes without saying that claims of “prejudice” must be proved;
                    bare assertions of suffering prejudice could not avail them of the defences.
                    While Ong CK did allude to having lost his diaries, he did not sufficiently show
                    how this was a source of prejudice to him. Furthermore, SAA should have its own
                    records or documents which Ong CK and Tan Senior can rely on.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">Waiver by election</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_222"></a>222    Tan Senior raised the doctrine of waiver by
                    election as an additional plank to bolster his defence.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_148" id="Ftn_148_1"><sup>[note: 148]</sup></a></span> While the doctrine of waiver by
                    election, unlike estoppel by conduct, does not require the defendant to prove
                    that he has suffered “detriment” or “prejudice”, the
                    defendant nevertheless must show that the abandonment of a right was
                    communicated in “clear and unequivocal terms” to him (see
                        <em>Motor Oil Hellas (Corinth) Refineries SA v Shipping Corp
                        of India (The “Kanchenjunga”)</em> [1990] 1
                    Lloyd’s Rep 391 at 397–399, endorsed by the Court of Appeal in
                        <em>SDL Technologies</em> at [33]). In the present
                    case, the Plaintiffs’ failure to apply for leave to continue proceedings
                    was equivocal at best as to whether they had abandoned their right to sue him.
                    It seems to me that the Plaintiffs had only suspended any step they could have
                    taken against him in the light of his bankruptcy. It does not amount to a
                    representation that was “clear and unequivocal”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">Abuse of process</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_223"></a>223    Tan Senior cited the case of <em>Morris v Wentworth-Stanley</em> [1999] 1 QB 1004
                        (“<em>Morris</em>”) which he claimed to
                    stand for the proposition that a plaintiff who has removed a defendant from
                    proceedings commenced previously cannot, without at the time reserving the right
                    to sue him/her later, bring a claim against the same person in a fresh set of
                    proceedings later on. To do so, he claimed, would amount to an abuse of
                        process.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_149" id="Ftn_149_1"><sup>[note: 149]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_224"></a>224    In response, the Plaintiffs argued that
                        <em>Morris</em> can be distinguished from the present
                    case on the basis that, the plaintiff in that case actively deleted the name of
                    the person whom the plaintiff sought to commence fresh proceedings against.
                    Here, no such active steps were taken by the Plaintiffs and when they eventually
                    realised that they could continue litigation against Tan Senior despite his
                    bankruptcy, they proceeded to do so.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_150" id="Ftn_150_1"><sup>[note: 150]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_225"></a>225    I agree with the Plaintiffs that the case of
                        <em>Morris</em> is distinguishable on the facts. In
                        <em>Bradford &amp; Bingley Building Society v
                        Seddon</em> [1999] 1 WLR 1482 at 1493, Auld LJ observed that there
                    must be an “additional element” apart from
                    “re”–litigation before an abuse of process can be found. He
                    went on to observe that in the case of <em>Morris</em>,
                    Potter LJ had described the plaintiff’s election to remove the defendant
                    from the earlier proceedings and subsequent attempts to commence further action
                    as being fraudulent. That was the “additional element” present in
                        <em>Morris</em>. In the present case, I can find no
                    “additional element” to justify a conclusion that there has been
                    an abuse of process.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_226"></a>226    For the reasons stated in the foregoing
                    discussion, I dismiss the defences raised by Tan Senior and Ong CK to avoid
                    being named as defendants in the underlying Consolidated Suits that have now
                    been reinstated. Put another way, the Plaintiffs have the right to name them as
                    defendants in the Consolidated Suits.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_227"></a>227    I summarise the orders that I have made in
                    the preceding sections:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_227-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Consent Order is set aside on
                        the basis of two repudiatory breaches committed by the Defendants
                        (CO):</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_227-p2_a-p3_i"></a>(i)       a breach of clause 11 of
                            the Consent Order or alternatively a breach of an implied term of the
                            Consent Order by misappropriating the benefit of the 2007 Head Lease;
                            and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_227-p2_a-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       a breach of clause 5 of the Consent Order by failing to disclose that
                            they had acquired the 2007 Head Lease.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_227-p2_b"></a>(b)     Even if there was no repudiatory
                        breach committed by the Defendants (CO) or the judgment of Choo J in SUM
                        4117 (amended) is <em>res judicata</em> on the issues
                        of the repudiatory breaches, the Consent Order is still set aside on the
                        basis that it is inoperative.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_227-p2_c"></a>(c)     The R&amp;T Defendants’ counterclaim that the
                        bidding exercise is to be proceeded with is dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_227-p2_d"></a>(d)     As a result of the Consent Order
                        being set aside, the Consolidated Suits are reinstated.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_227-p2_e"></a>(e)     Tan CB and Ong CK were parties to the
                        Joint Venture.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_227-p2_f"></a>(f)     The Plaintiffs are not precluded from naming Tan Senior and Ong CK as
                        defendants in the Consolidated Suit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_228"></a>228    I should also add that in the light of my
                    decision to set aside the Consent Order, there is no need for me to decide on
                    the residual claim advanced by the Plaintiffs (<em>ie</em>,
                    claim of breach of fiduciary duty and conspiracy). As mentioned earlier, the
                    Plaintiffs have indicated in their closing submissions that they would subsume
                    the residual claim under the Consolidated Suits should they be
                    reinstated.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Costs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_229"></a>229    I will hear the parties on
                costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Concluding remarks</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_230"></a>230    Several important lessons may be gleaned
                    from the obstacles the Plaintiffs have had to overcome just to put themselves
                    back in the same position as they were ten years ago when the minority
                    oppression actions (<em>ie</em>, the Consolidated Suits of
                    OS 1634/02 and S 703/04) were mounted against the Defendants. In these ten
                    years, multiple actions were filed by both sides over disputes flowing from the
                    implementation of the Consent Order. It is somewhat ironic that what was
                    supposed to be a peaceful and cost-efficient way of resolving the parties’
                    differences has become the subject of a series of acrimonious and costly legal
                    battles. These legal battles have, thus far, gone up to the Court of Appeal a
                    total of three times before the delivery of this judgment. But even then, this
                    is not the end of the Plaintiffs’ struggles as there remain thorny issues
                    that need to be resolved if the Plaintiffs wish to obtain any meaningful reward
                    from their endeavours in the courtroom.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_231"></a>231    In summary, the legal battles expended over
                    the last ten years were largely a result of the MOU which was poorly drafted and
                    of the Consent Order which was also not well drafted even though it was drafted
                    by solicitors. However, the true reason for the disputes was a lack of <em>bona fides</em> on the part of the Defendants (CO), and of
                    Tan CB and Ong CK.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_232"></a>232    I add that in the course of the trial, Tan
                    CB had said that it was the JV Companies who had paid for the renovations to the
                    premises at the Site. Yet in Suit No 51 of 2012, which was an action between a
                    new master tenant, SH Cogent Logistics Pte Ltd against SAA, Tan CB had alleged
                    that it was SAA who had paid for the renovations. When Tan CB was asked about
                    this contradiction, he was evasive.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_151" id="Ftn_151_1"><sup>[note: 151]</sup></a></span> It seems clear that he had perjured himself,
                    one way or another.</p>
