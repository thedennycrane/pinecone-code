This raises questions as to whether the court should grant an extension of time for the application to be made, and what principles the court should apply in such circumstances.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background facts</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The construction contract </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The applicant is an owner of a property situated at Jalan Sedap in Singapore (“the property”).

</div>  Since clause 12(1) of the SIA Conditions permits the architect to sanction all variations previously carried out by the contractor, the arbitrator found that the alleged discrepancies were in fact variations that had been sanctioned by the architect.  Accordingly, save for the one item of work which had not been sanctioned by the architect, for which the arbitrator awarded the applicant S$156.25, the arbitrator found that the respondent was not liable for the other alleged discrepancies between the respondent’s completed works and the works specified in the contract.

On the whole, the arbitrator was more inclined towards the evidence of the respondent’s quantum expert, Mr Stanley Wong, than that of the applicant’s quantum expert, Mr Amos Teo (“Mr Teo”).

</div>  This was because he found Mr Teo’s evidence to be less reliable.  Just as an example, Mr Teo had provided a separate amount for scaffolding for a single item of hairline crack, even though scaffolding was already provided for under the section of “Preliminaries”.  According to the arbitrator, this separate provision for scaffolding was not logical, unless Mr Teo was suggesting that for “ten such areas of defects, the [applicant] is going to appoint ten different contractors … and each individual contractor must install its own scaffold” to make good the defects.

In this regard, the arbitrator considered that the evidence showed that the applicant’s intention at all times was to sell, rather than rent, the property. In any case, there was no proof that her inability to rent out the property was due to the alleged defects.  Furthermore, the loss of rental was too remote a loss, as it was not within the reasonable contemplation of parties at the time of the signing of the contract that there would be a claim for loss of rental in the event that there were defects.

While Mr Goh’s evidence supported the valuation of S$7m, the arbitrator found that Mr Goh’s valuation appeared to have been arbitrary and significantly higher than the other transactions concluded around the same time in the vicinity of the property, as shown by the records of property transactions maintained by the Urban Redevelopment Authority.

</div> the arbitrator also found that the applicant had not proven that the defects were the cause of the property’s loss in value (if any).  This was because there had been two offers from prospective buyers for the property.  Although these two offers were lower than the applicant’s expected price of S$7m, the applicant failed to show that the alleged defects were the cause of the lower prices offered by the prospective buyers.    Thus, it could very well have been that the applicant’s inability to sell the property at S$7m was caused by the fact that the expected price of S$7m was simply unrealistic, and not because of the alleged defects.

</div>  The applicant argues that this is a purposive interpretation of the words in s 50(3) of the Act because the parties can only decide if the arbitrator made a mistake, and hence whether they wish to appeal against questions of law arising from the award, after they received the award and reviewed the grounds on which the arbitrator had come to his decision.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 This submission is wholly without merit.  In <span class="font-italic">Hong Huat Development Co (Pte) Ltd v Hiap Hong &amp; Co Pte Ltd </span>[2000] 1 SLR(R) 510 (“<span class="font-italic">Hong Huat</span>”), the Court of Appeal considered a similar argument with respect to an earlier version of the Arbitration Act (Cap 10, 1985 Rev Ed) (“the 1985 Act”).  Under the 1985 Act, O 69 r 4(2) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R5, 1997 Rev Ed) (“ROC”) provided that in respect of an appeal against an arbitral award made pursuant to s 28(2) of the 1985 Act, the notice had to be served and the appeal entered within 21 days after the award was made and published to the parties.  An issue before the court in <span class="font-italic">Hong Huat </span>was thus what “after the award has been made and published to the parties”, as set out in O 69 r 4(2) of the ROC, meant.  As observed, since <span class="font-italic">Brooke v Mitchell </span>(1840) 9 LJ Ex 269, “it has been accepted that an award is made and published when the arbitrator gives notice to the parties that the award is ready for collection” (“the notice rule”) (<span class="font-italic">Hong Huat </span>at [22]).  This notwithstanding, it was argued that “made and published” occurred only when the parties had notice of the actual contents of the award, and not when the arbitrator gave notice to the parties that the award was ready for collection (<span class="font-italic">Hong Huat </span>at [22]).  This argument was firmly rejected by the Court of Appeal, which held at [25]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The appellants further argued that delay cannot be an adequate reason for adopting the notice rule. They said that <span class="font-italic">unless the parties have actual knowledge of the contents of the award, they would not be in a position to challenge the award</span>. Furthermore, the notice rule would be too rigid as it would not be able to take into account different circumstances, such as, the parties were away when the notice was given or a party might be incapacitated at the time. In our opinion, the <span class="font-italic">notice rule is to be preferred as it ensures prompt action and does not depend on the will of the parties</span>. To hold otherwise would be inconsistent with the <span class="font-italic">legislative policy underlying the reference to arbitration, namely, the expeditious resolution of arbitrated disputes and the need for finality</span>. In a case where extenuating circumstances exist, the parties are at liberty to apply for an extension of time. Obviously, whether extension should be granted in a particular case would have to depend on how meritorious the grounds are. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 In <span class="font-italic">Hong Huat</span>, there were two reasons for preferring the interpretation that time is to run from the moment parties are notified that the award is ready for collection, rather than when parties have notice of the actual contents of the award.  First, this ensures prompt action, and does not depend on the will of the parties.  Second, this accords better with the legislative policy underlying the reference to arbitration, which is the expeditious resolution of disputes that are subject to arbitration and the need for finality.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 When the 1985 Act was subsequently amended, the earlier phrase of “made and published to the parties” in O 69 r 4(2) of the ROC was replaced by “date of the award”.

</div>
</div> explains that this change was a considered one.  As stated at paragraph 2.39.2 of the AGC Report, it was considered that the phrase “made and published to the parties” could be argued “to mean that for so long that a party has not received the award, time might not run for the purposes of an appeal”.  Hence, at paragraph 2.39.3 of the AGC Report, it was proposed that the “date of the award” should be inserted into what is s 50(3) of the Act today, replacing the phrase “made and published to the parties”.  This, it was explained, “provides a certain and incontrovertible date for reckoning of time set for appeal.  To compensate for any time loss (<span class="font-italic">sic</span>) in the making and collection of the award, the time limit for appealing against an award is increased from the present 21 days to 28 days after the date of the award.”  Hence, I find that the “date of the award” refers literally to the date which the arbitrator has dated the award.  This will usually be when the arbitrator notifies the parties that the award is ready for collection.  Of course, in a case where the arbitrator has dated the award well before he informs the parties that the award is ready for collection, and as a consequence thereof, parties have too little time to consider the award and file the application for leave to appeal, that would be the kind of situation where the court may grant an extension of time for parties to file their application.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 The words “date of the award” found in s 50(3) of the Act may be contrasted with s 48(2) of the Act, which relates to applications to set aside an arbitrator’s award.  Section 48(2) of the Act provides that “[a]n application for setting aside an award may not be made after the expiry of [three] months from the date on which the party making the application had <span class="font-italic">received the award</span>…” [emphasis added].  Both parties’ counsel were in agreement that this meant actual receipt of the award.  If I were to adopt such an interpretation as correct, then had it truly been the intention that time under s 50(3) of the Act was to run from the time parties <span class="font-italic">collected </span>or <span class="font-italic">received </span>the award, the provision could have been drafted to follow the wording in s 48(2) of the Act.  Yet, s 50(3) of the Act refers solely to the “date of the award”, without any additional words to indicate that this is in relation to the date on which the parties <span class="font-italic">receive </span>the award.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 As such, it is clear to me that the application under s 49(3) of the Act is out of time.  The last date by which the application could have been made was 28 days after 25 July 2017, which is the date that the parties had been notified that the award would be ready for collection and which is also in fact the date which the award is dated.

</div>  Given that the award is dated 25 July 2017, the last day for the applicant to have filed her application for leave to appeal against the award was 22 August 2017.  The application was only filed on 14 June 2018, which is nine months and 23 days late.  By any measure, such a delay of over nine and a half months is very substantial.  In fact, in <span class="font-italic">Progen Engineering Pte Ltd v Winter Engineering </span><span class="font-italic">(S) Pte Ltd </span>[2006] SGHC 224 (“<span class="font-italic">Progen</span>”) at [16], V K Rajah J (as he then was) had described a delay of 49 days past the statutory time limit as not marginal but very substantial.

This was due to the fact that the parties in that case had, prior to bringing an application for leave to appeal against the award, been in discussions on a possible settlement, notwithstanding that the award was ready for collection.  Further, the respondents did not deny that their solicitors had informed the appellants’ solicitors that the time for bringing an application for leave could be extended by agreement.  In the court’s view, it would thus be reasonable to infer that there was an understanding that time would not begin to run for the purpose of filing an application for leave to appeal while parties were in the midst of discussions.  In addition to the adequate reasons provided for the delay, the court further considered that there was a question of law that could substantially affect the appellant’s rights, and that no prejudice would be caused to the respondent if the application was granted since interest would continue to run on the sums outstanding under the award.  In the circumstances, an extension of time to apply for leave to appeal was granted. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Hence, given the substantial delay of over nine and a half months in this case, it is important to consider the three other factors, in particular the reasons for the delay, to determine whether the applicant can sufficiently justify the grant of an extension of time.

There, the applicant had been notified that the tribunal’s award would be ready for collection upon full payment of the costs of arbitration on 23 December 2008.  On 26 December 2008, the applicant paid his share of the arbitration fees, but the respondent only paid its share on 13 January 2009.  The applicant was then notified on 15 January 2009 that the award could be collected, and he thus collected the award on the same day.  On 3 February 2009, the applicant applied to appeal against the award.  This was 14 days after the applicant’s time for filing an application for leave to appeal had expired.  The applicant made much of the fact that he had only five days between the date of collection of the award and the last day for filing an application for leave to appeal, since he only collected the award on 15 January 2009.  It was also alleged that such delay was occasioned by the respondent’s, rather than the applicant’s, tardiness in making payment of its share of the costs.  Judith Prakash J (as she then was) (“Prakash J”) rejected this argument, and observed at [35] of her judgment that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">There would have been no prejudice to the applicant in paying the respondent’s share of costs as well since he would have known that the respondent was a solvent company which would be able to reimburse him without difficulty. There was no evidence of any financial difficulty on the part of the applicant that would have prevented him from taking this course. Therefore the applicant’s own conduct had to an extent contributed to the truncation of the available period in which to file an application under s 49.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 In other words, given that the respondent was a solvent company, the applicant in <span class="font-italic">Tay Eng Chuan </span>ought to have paid the respondent’s share of the costs first, and seek reimbursement from the respondent thereafter.  This would have allowed the applicant more time to consider whether to file an application to appeal against the arbitrator’s award.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 In our case, the applicant submits that there was uncontroverted evidence that the respondent was in dire financial circumstances.  Hence, unlike the applicant in <span class="font-italic">Tay Eng Chuan</span>, it would have been potentially prejudicial to her had she paid the respondent’s portion of the arbitrator’s fees.

</div>  She might not have been able to recover such fees from the respondent if there was a costs order in her favour in the award.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 I am unable to accept this submission.  This is a case where the applicant made a deliberate decision not to make the necessary payment to the arbitrator in order to secure the release of the award.  In my view, the onus is on both parties to the arbitration to make the full payment due to the arbitrator so that they can obtain a copy of the award.  As Article 16.1 of the SIA Rules (set out at [19] above) makes clear, both parties are jointly and severally liable to the arbitrator for his fees and expenses.  So, if the respondent was unable to make payment of its outstanding share of the fees and expenses, whether for reasons of insolvency or otherwise, the applicant would be obliged to make such payment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 In response, the applicant asserts in her affidavit that she could not pay the full sum of S$57,929.17 which remained outstanding to the arbitrator.  This was because she had stopped working in 2009, and thus had no income.  To compound matters, she had spent a significant sum paying the respondent to re-build the property, which she has been unable to rent or sell due to the alleged defects.  Furthermore, she has incurred significant legal fees, both in pursuing the arbitration proceedings against the respondent, and in acrimonious matrimonial proceedings in Hong Kong against her husband, which has been ongoing since 2013.

</div>
</div>  Till date, the applicant has not paid her share of the arbitrator’s fees and expenses, suggesting that the respondent’s previous impecuniosity had nothing to do with the applicant’s non-payment of the arbitrator’s fees and expenses.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In the circumstances, I find that the applicant did not have a good reason to refuse to pay the arbitrator’s fees and expenses to secure the award once she had been notified that it was ready for collection.  Such refusal to pay the arbitrator’s fees and expenses has not been accepted by the courts as a proper excuse justifying the grant of an extension of time to apply for leave to appeal.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 In <span class="font-italic">Progen</span>, the arbitrator had releaseed his award subject to the payment of his fees by the parties.  The plaintiff, which filed its notice of appeal some 49 days after the statutory limited date to appeal against the award, asserted that the delay was not attributable to them, but rather the arbitrator’s insistence that the release of the award was contingent on his fees being paid.  The Court found that such an excuse was “entirely unconvincing” (<span class="font-italic">Progen </span>at [13]), and rejected the application for an extension of time to file an appeal against the award.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 As Hobhouse J explained in <span class="font-italic">International Petroleum Refining &amp; Supply Sdad Ltd v Elpis Finance S.A. </span>[1993] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 408 (“<span class="font-italic">The Faith</span>”) at 411:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is not open to a party to argue … that they were waiting for the other party to take up the award; that they did not know that there was any point they wanted to raise on the award.  They have to take that decision for themselves.  The position is, in a sense, a stark one: a party who wishes to reserve his right to take the matter to the Court either by way of appeal … must ensure that the award is taken up in time to enable the application to be made.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Hence, the onus is on the parties, who are usually jointly and severally liable for the fees of the arbitrator, to ensure that the terms of release of the award are promptly complied with, so that parties have sufficient time to file an appeal (if necessary) within the statutory time limit under s 50(3) of the Act.  If parties fail to act promptly, in the absence of good reason for justifying their non-payment of the arbitrator’s outstanding fees or otherwise, it would be simply insufficient, in seeking an extension of time, to assert that the delay was caused by the other party’s non-payment of the arbitrator’s fees.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Thus, in <span class="font-italic">S v A and B</span>, the court rejected the seller’s argument, in seeking an extension of time, that the buyers had delayed in the payment of their share of the tribunal’s fees.  The judge, referring to the above passage in <span class="font-italic">The Faith</span>, held that this “carries little, if any weight” (<span class="font-italic">S </span><span class="font-italic">v A and B </span>at [37]).  Similarly, in <span class="font-italic">Rollitt</span>, the claimant sought to attribute blame for the delay in filing the application to appeal on the defendant’s refusal to pay any of the arbitrator’s fees, causing the arbitrator to delay the release of the award pending full payment of the outstanding fees.  The judge considered that the arbitrator’s terms and conditions of appointment expressly stated that the parties would be jointly and severally liable for his fees and expenses, and that payment would be required for the release of the award.  Thus, it did not lie in the claimant’s mouth to rely on the defendant’s refusal to pay as a reason for the delay (<span class="font-italic">Rollitt </span>at [32]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Similarly here, given that the parties were jointly and severally liable for the arbitrator’s fees, the applicant cannot rely on the respondent’s non-payment of the arbitrator’s fees to justify her delay in filing the application to appeal against the arbitrator’s award.  This is especially as I have found that the applicant did not provide any other good reason for not paying the arbitrator’s outstanding fees.  Her allegation of her inability to pay the respondent’s share of the fees is but a belated assertion that is contradicted by evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 In my judgment, the applicant made a calculated call not to make the necessary payment to secure the release of the award.  In such circumstances, given that she must know that the time for her to make an application for leave to appeal would run from the date of the award which she knew to be ready for collection on 25 July 2017, I find that the applicant made a considered decision to take the risk that she might be out of time in any application for leave to appeal against the award.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 As such, I find that the applicant has not provided valid reasons for the delay in her application.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The chances of the appeal succeeding </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The third factor to be considered relates to the chances of the applicant’s appeal succeeding.  In relation to this factor, the court in <span class="font-italic">Lee Hsien Loong v Singapore Democratic Party </span>[2008] 1 SLR(R) 757 observed at [19]–[20] that this limb does not require the court to go into a full-scale examination of the merits of the appeal, and serves simply to weed out hopeless appeals, in which case an extension of time ought not to be granted, even if the delay was very short:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… In our view, it is significant that of the four factors, the emphasis, in the first instance at least, is invariably on the first two, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, the length of delay and the reasons for the delay. This is not surprising because the third factor (<span class="font-italic">viz</span>, the chances of the appeal succeeding if time for appealing were extended), whilst of equal importance relative to the other three factors, is set at a <span class="font-italic">very low threshold </span>in fairness to the applicant – namely, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">whether the appeal is “hopeless”</span> … Indeed, as this court put it in <span class="font-italic">Aberdeen Asset Management Asia Ltd v Fraser &amp; Neave Ltd</span> [2001] 3 SLR(R) 355 … (at [43]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">As to the question of merits, it is <span class="font-italic">not</span> for the court at this stage to <span class="font-italic">go into a full-scale examination</span> of the issues involved. <span class="font-italic">Neither is it necessary for the applicant to show that he will succeed in the appeal</span>. The threshold is lower: the test is, is the appeal hopeless? … Unless one can say that there are no prospects of the applicant succeeding on the appeal, this is a factor which ought to be considered to be neutral rather than against him.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">20 This third factor nevertheless becomes of signal importance where the appeal is a truly hopeless one. In such a situation, notwithstanding even a very short delay, an extension of time will generally not be granted by the court simply because to do so would be an exercise in futility, resulting in a waste of time as well as resources for all concerned.… </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Requirements for leave to appeal</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Before I turn to consider whether the applicant’s intended appeal is hopeless or bound to fail, the requirements for leave under s 49 of the Act must be emphasised.  This is because, even if an extension of time is granted, the applicant must then persuade the Court to grant leave to appeal against the award.  The grant of leave to appeal is a necessary precursor to the applicant’s appeal succeeding, and it is fruitless to consider whether the substantive appeal will be hopeless without first considering whether the application for leave to appeal is hopeless in the first place.  As Prakash J phrased the question in <span class="font-italic">Tay Eng Chuan </span>at [41]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Taking the issue in the context of arbitration proceedings what I had to consider was not whether the appeal itself would be hopeless but <span class="font-italic">whether the application for leave to appeal could be said to be “hopeless”.</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 In this regard, it is noted that the Court of Appeal observed in <span class="font-italic">Hong Huat </span>at [39] that “[i]t seems to us clear that in relation to the question of ‘prospect of success’ that must be in relation to the success of the appeal and not just the success of obtaining an extension of time to file an application for leave. Otherwise, it would make no sense. The object of the extension of time is not to obtain leave <span class="font-italic">per se</span> but to appeal.”  This may be taken to mean that the court need only to consider the prospects of success of an eventual appeal against the award, rather than the prospects of the applicant obtaining leave to appeal against the award.  However, a closer reading of the decision in <span class="font-italic">Hong Huat </span>shows that this is not the approach which the court adopted.  Section 28(4) of the 1985 Act, which was under consideration in <span class="font-italic">Hong Huat</span>, required first that a question of law was raised, and second that the determination of the question of law concerned could substantially affect the rights of one or more of the parties to the arbitration before leave of court could be granted to appeal against an award.  Before granting the extension of time sought in that case, the court considered both of the above conditions (<span class="font-italic">Hong Huat </span>at [39]–[52]), showing that the consideration of all requirements which are relevant for obtaining leave to appeal is necessary at this stage.  In determining whether an extension of time ought to be granted, it is insufficient to simply conclude that the substantive appeal itself is not hopeless, since this necessarily presumes that the application for leave to appeal is not hopeless, when such may not be the case at all.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Therefore, in considering the third factor of the applicant’s prospects of success, I adopt Prakash J’s formulation in <span class="font-italic">Tay Eng Chuan </span>at [41], and consider whether the application for leave to appeal could be said to be hopeless.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 In summary, the court must be satisfied that the following conditions are met before leave to appeal will be granted:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the appeal must be on a question of law (s 49(1) of the Act);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the determination of that question will substantially affect the rights of one or more of the parties to the arbitration (s 49(5)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Act);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the question was one which the arbitrator was asked to determine (s 49(5)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Act);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) on the basis of the findings of fact in the award, the decision of the arbitrator on the question is obviously wrong, <span class="font-italic">or</span> the question is one of general public importance and the decision of the arbitral tribunal is at least open to serious doubt (s 49(5)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Act); and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) despite the agreement of the parties to resolve the matter by arbitration, it is just and proper in all the circumstances for the Court to determine the question (s 49(5)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the Act).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Let me say a little about these requirements in s 49 of the Act.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1)  Question of law</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 A question of law is distinct from an error of law, and relates specifically to a “point of law in controversy”.  It does not extend to errors in the <span class="font-italic">application </span>of the law.  As the Court of Appeal explained in <span class="font-italic">Northern Elevator </span><span class="font-italic">Manufacturing Sdn Bhd v United Engineers (Singapore) Pte Ltd </span>[2004] 2 SLR(R) 494 (“<span class="font-italic">Northern </span><span class="font-italic">Elevator</span>”) at [18]–[19]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…. in <span class="font-italic">Ahong Construction (S) Pte Ltd v United Boulevard Pte Ltd</span> [1993] 2 SLR(R) 208 … G P Selvam JC (as he then was) stated at [7]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… A question of law means a <span class="font-italic">point of law in controversy</span> which has to be resolved after opposing views and arguments have been considered.

If the question is, however, not one of general public importance, for instance, because the question raised is only a “one-off” point, the threshold remains that it must be shown that the arbitral tribunal was “obviously wrong”:  s 49(5)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)(i) of the Act; see also <span class="font-italic">Northern Elevator </span>at [23] and <span class="font-italic">Engineering Construction </span>at [45], [52] and [53].  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(5) Just and proper for the court to determine the question, despite parties’ agreement to arbitrate</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Finally, even if the other conditions above are met, leave to appeal against an award will only be granted if the court is satisfied that “despite the agreement of the parties to resolve the matter by arbitration, it is just and proper in all the circumstances for the Court to determine the question” of law posed (s 49(5)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the Act).  This means that it may be insufficient to show that the other requirements for leave to appeal have been satisfied, without going further to show<span class="font-italic"> </span>that judicial intervention is warranted on the facts of the particular case.  For example, the court might refuse leave to appeal if it can be shown “that the parties wished speed and finality to prevail even if the tribunal decided a question of law in a way which was obviously wrong, or at least open to serious doubt” (<span class="font-italic">Prestige Marine Services Pte Ltd v Marubeni International Petroleum (S) Pte Ltd </span>[2012] 1 SLR 917 (“<span class="font-italic">Prestige </span><span class="font-italic">Marine</span>”) at [68], citing Michael Mustill and Stewart Boyd, <span class="font-italic">Commercial Arbitration</span> (Butterworths, 2nd Ed, 2001) at pp 357–358).  In this respect, if parties have agreed to a clause stipulating that the arbitral award shall be final and binding, this will indicate that the parties did not contemplate becoming involved in litigation over the arbitral award, such that the court should lean towards giving effect to the stated intention of the parties for such finality: <span class="font-italic">Prestige Marine</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [69]–[70], citing <span class="font-italic">Gold and Resource Developments (NZ) Ltd v Doug Hood Ltd</span> [2000] NZCA 131 at [54].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 With these principles in mind, I move now to consider, in a broad fashion, the applicant’s various questions of law for which she seeks leave to appeal.

The first deals with the applicant’s claim in the arbitration for damages for delay, the second deals with the applicant’s claim for loss of rental from the property, and the third deals with the applicant’s claim for the loss in value of the property.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 I will consider these three categories of questions in turn.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Delay and liquidated damages</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) The first question    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 The first question raised by the applicant is as follows: whether the arbitrator erred in law when he decided that, just because there was no valid delay certificate, the applicant was not entitled to recover from the respondent liquidated damages or any general damages as a result of its delay in completing the works.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 On this first question posed by the applicant, I have some difficulty with the applicant’s submission that it is a question of law, rather than an allegation that the arbitrator had committed an error of law.  In other words, I find that the allegation is that the arbitrator erred when he decided that the applicant was not entitled to liquidated damages or general damages for delay just because the delay certificates were not valid.   This alleged error would have followed from an erroneous application of the law, and does not in fact raise a question of law, especially since the applicant’s counsel confirmed that the arbitrator’s interpretation of clause 31(6) of the SIA Conditions is not being disputed.  As explained in <span class="font-italic">Northern Elevator</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [18]–[19], an error in the application of law does not entitle an aggrieved party to appeal; a question of law, which means a point of law in controversy, must be raised.  The same point was made in <span class="font-italic">Chua Aik Kia </span>at [29].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 But, be that as it may, even if I were to accept that this is a question of law, this was not a question that the parties had presented to the arbitrator for his determination.  The arbitrator’s remit is defined by the pleadings in the arbitration and the parties’ submissions to him.  As I have explained in my judgment issued in OS 1010/2018, the applicant’s claim in the arbitration in respect of delay was for liquidated damages of S$58,500 only.  There was no alternative claim for general damages, nor for any lower sum of liquidated damages in the applicant’s statement of case for the arbitration, or in her opening and closing submissions in the arbitration proceedings.

</div>  That being the case, the claim for damages at the agreed rate of S$300 per day of delay can only be sustained if there is a valid delay certificate.  The applicant did not point me to any alternative clauses, whether in the contract or the SIA Conditions, to suggest that liquidated damages could be determined in any other way.  As a result, given that the arbitrator had rejected the applicant’s claim for liquidated damages on the basis that the delay certificates were both invalid, it cannot be said that the arbitrator was wrong, or that the applicant has shown even a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case that he had been mistaken in deciding as he did.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 Given this, the intended application for leave to appeal against this “question of law” cannot satisfy the conditions set out in ss 49(5)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and 49(5)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Act and it is bound to fail.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) The second question</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 The second question raised by the applicant is this: whether the arbitrator erred in law when he decided that it was not necessary for him to deal with and decide on the following questions or issues which were raised in the arbitration proceedings: (i) whether the respondent was in delay in completing the works; and (ii) whether the respondent was entitled to an extension of time to complete the works.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 This second “question” suffers from the same difficulties as the first one.  It does not raise any question of law, in that the errors raised do not relate to any findings of law that the arbitrator had made, for which the court may consider on appeal.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 It also proceeds on the fallacious argument that the arbitrator is obliged to decide issues which are not presented to him for decision, or which are not necessary for him to decide.  As explained above, on the applicant’s claim for delay in the arbitration, she only sought liquidated damages based on the second delay certificate issued by the architect.  The architect found that delay certificate to be invalid.  He also found that the first delay certificate was flawed, as admitted by the architect.  Given these findings, the inevitable conclusion must be that the liquidated damages claim would fail.  It was not necessary for the arbitrator to decide whether the respondent was in delay, how long such delay was or whether the respondent was entitled to any extension of time.  This was because there was no alternative claim for general damages for delay.  An arbitrator only has to decide the essential issues which are necessary for him to decide the dispute and the claims made by the parties (<span class="font-italic">TMM Division </span>at [72]–[73]).  As such, the arbitrator did not have to deal with these non-essential issues.  It cannot thus be said that the arbitrator had been obviously wrong in deciding not to make any findings on the issues raised under this second question.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 When pressed at the hearing, counsel for the applicant in fact accepted that this complaint about the arbitrator not having decided the length of delay and extension of time were more relevant to the applicant’s application in OS 1010/2018 to set aside the award because the arbitrator had failed to decide the issues that had been presented to him for determination.

</div>  In both questions, the applicant alleges that the arbitrator had erred in law, first in holding that loss of rental could not be claimed during the period when the respondent was making good the defects (the third question), and second in holding that the loss of rental was too remote to be claimed for (the fourth question).  As the arbitrator’s findings in this regard were closely intertwined, I will consider both questions together.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 As summarised above at [10], the arbitrator found that the applicant had not adduced sufficient evidence to show that she intended to rent out the property.  Instead, the evidence before him showed that the applicant’s intention at all times was to sell, rather than rent the property.  In any case, it was not shown that the defects had caused her to be unable to rent out the property.  The arbitrator also found that the loss was too remote, as it was not within the reasonable contemplation of parties at the time of the signing of the contract that there would be a claim for loss of rental in the event that there were defects.

</div>  Put another way, the arbitrator found that the applicant had not discharged her burden of proof to succeed on her claim for the loss of rental.  This is a finding of fact by the arbitrator which led to the applicant’s claim for loss of rental being dismissed.  As explained in <span class="font-italic">Chua Aik Kia </span>at [16], the arbitrator’s findings of facts are conclusive, and in an application for leave to appeal, the court must decide any question of law on the basis of an unqualified acceptance of the arbitrator’s findings of fact.  Since the third and fourth questions relate solely to alleged erroneous findings of fact by the arbitrator, it is clear that no questions of law have been raised that fall within the ambit of s 49(1) of the Act.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 In any event, the resolution of either question is not one what will substantially affect the rights of the parties.  Even if it is determined that the applicant <span class="font-italic">could </span>claim for loss of rental while the respondent was rectifying the defects <span class="font-italic">or </span>that the applicant’s loss of rental was a reasonably contemplated head of loss, and the arbitrator had erred in this regard, there is another insuperable obstacle in the way of the applicant’s claim.  This is the arbitrator’s finding of fact that the applicant had not discharged her evidential burden of proving that she had tried to rent out the property, or that the defects were the cause of her being unable to rent out the property.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Given the arbitrator’s findings of fact on the issue of causation, I find that the arbitrator’s decision on the alleged errors raised in the third and fourth questions ultimately did not alter the result arrived at by the arbitrator in relation to the loss of rental issue.  Regardless of his findings in relation to the alleged errors, the applicant’s claim for loss of rental would inevitably have failed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 For completeness, even assuming that questions of law have been raised, I should add that this is not a case where one could say that the arbitrator’s decision on this issue of remoteness was obviously wrong.  Further, it cannot be sensibly argued that the question relating to remoteness is one of general importance, given the established principles in this regard.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 For the above reasons, I find the intended application for leave to appeal against the third and fourth questions, relating to the applicant’s claim for loss of rental, to be hopeless and bound to fail.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Loss in value of the property</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 To recapitulate, the applicant’s claim for loss in value of the property arises in the following manner.

</div>  There was a period that followed where the respondent was carrying out rectification works on the property due to defects.  The applicant claims that she was prevented from selling the property in October 2012, when the property market was rising, because of the defects in the works.  Her claim for loss of value was for the amount of S$1.2m.  This S$1.2m was the difference between what she alleged was the market value of the property when the market hit its high in April 2013 (S$7m) and the market value of the property in May 2016 (S$5.8m),

In the course of discussing the issue of the mitigation of damages, the arbitrator had noted the undisputed fact that the applicant had chosen to leave the defects in the works un-rectified.  The arbitrator, who is an architect by profession, thus observed that it was “well-known” that leaving defects, such as water seepage and external plaster cracks, un-rectified would worsen the damage to the house over time, given Singapore’s weather and humidity.

Rather, the issue here is whether the arbitrator should have relied on this “well-known fact” in coming to his view that the applicant failed to mitigate her loss.  This is a question of whether the arbitrator had conducted the hearing in a procedurally fair manner.  The applicant knows very well that this is her true complaint.  That is why she has commenced a separate application in OS 1010/2018.  There, she alleges that the arbitrator breached natural justice by making a finding based on this “well-known fact” without first giving the parties an opportunity to deal with this point.

</div>  In an application for leave to appeal, this finding of fact must be accepted without qualifications: <span class="font-italic">Chua Aik Kia </span>at [16].  Therefore, the answer to this proposed question, which deals only with the issue of mitigation, will not alter the outcome of the arbitrator’s decision to dismiss the applicant’s claim for loss of value.  The rights of the parties would not be substantially affected.  Therefore, apart from not raising any question of law, any application for leave to appeal on the fifth question would be hopeless since any finding in this regard would not substantially affect the award, or her rights.  This problem also plagues the seventh and eight questions, which likewise relate to the issue of mitigation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 The seventh question is this: whether the arbitrator had erred in law in holding that due to the applicant’s failure to mitigate the loss by failing to rectify the defects and allegedly allowing them to deteriorate, the arbitrator could therefore disregard all the defects claimed for by the applicant.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 This question posed by the applicant is a most curious one.  This is because it is not apparent from the award that the arbitrator had come to such a conclusion.  From my review of the award, the arbitrator had considered the various allegations of defects and made findings on each of them.  After going through all the alleged defects, the arbitrator allowed some of the claims but disallowed others.  The applicant had claimed the sum of approximately S$374,305 as rectification costs of the alleged defects.  The arbitrator had allowed the claim in the amount of S$42,979.06.

It is quite clearly an attempt to challenge the findings of facts by the arbitrator on what are defects and what are not, and also on the amount of rectification costs required to make good these defects.

What defects that were present in October 2012 is a question of evidence and the arbitrator’s findings in this regard cannot be attacked in an application under s 49 of the Act.  Hence, leave to appeal under s 49 of the Act would clearly be refused for this question posed by the applicant.  Nonetheless, I must say a bit more about this in relation to a particular submission made by the applicant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 Pursuant to leave that I granted, the applicant and respondent were permitted to file further written submissions on various points in contention.  In these post-hearing written submissions, the applicant belatedly made the point that there was a building surveyor report from Glenfield Design Consultants (“GDC”) that detailed the defects in the works pursuant to inspections that were carried out on 19 and 20 May 2012 (“the GDC report”).  It was argued that this was in evidence in the arbitration proceedings and, even though no representative from GDC was called to give evidence, the contents of the report were probative of the fact that there were defects in the works that were evident in 2012.  Hence, the criticism was that the arbitrator had failed to take into account such evidence and erred in coming to the view that the costs of the rectification would have been minimal in October 2012.

It suffices for me to say that the arbitrator decided that the applicant could not rely on the GDC report if the maker of the report was not being called to give evidence.  In fact, the applicant’s counsel made clear representations to the arbitrator that, apart from the photographs in the GDC report, which were incorporated into the report of one Mr Chin Cheong, the applicant was not relying on the GDC report.

Nonetheless, I will consider the questions briefly.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 As regards the eleventh question, I have reviewed [841] of the award.  I am unable to agree with the applicant that, in that portion of the award, the arbitrator had actually accepted the evidence of Mr Goh.  Quite the contrary, the arbitrator appeared to me to be criticising Mr Goh’s evidence for being arbitrary and he was explaining why that was the case.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 This also answers the thirteenth question.  Given that the arbitrator provided sound reasons for rejecting Mr Goh’s evidence (see [112] above), it did not matter that the respondent did not adduce any expert evidence to challenge Mr Goh’s valuation; the onus was on the applicant to produce sufficient evidence to prove her loss.  Furthermore, the arbitrator was not bound to accept Mr Goh’s evidence simply because the respondent had not called an expert of its own to counter Mr Goh’s evidence.  As the Court of Appeal explained in <span class="font-italic">PPG Industries</span> <span class="font-italic">(Singapore) Pte Ltd v Compact Metal Industries Ltd </span>[2013] SGCA 23 at [10], the opinions of experts “will always remain as opinions and do not bind the court concerned.”  It is thus entirely within the remit of the arbitrator, as the finder of fact, to determine whether Mr Goh’s <span class="font-italic">opinion </span>on the valuation of the property ought to be accepted as properly reflecting the property’s value.  On reviewing Mr Goh’s opinion, the arbitrator did not think so, and he was well within his rights to reject his evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 Thus, I find that the intended application to appeal on the eleventh and thirteenth questions would also be hopeless.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(6) The twelfth question</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 Finally, the twelfth question raised by the applicant is as follows:whether the arbitrator was wrong in law in holding that, because the applicant’s claim for loss in value of the property was based on the defects to the property, this loss was too remote.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 The arbitrator had considered the decision in <span class="font-italic">Sunny Metal</span><span class="font-italic"> &amp; Engineering Pte Ltd v Ng Khim Ming Eric </span>[2007] 3 SLR(R) 782 at [56] as standing for the proposition that remoteness limits the defendant’s liability if the plaintiff’s loss was not reasonably foreseeable.

Instead, and as already mentioned, the arbitrator had rejected the applicant’s claim for the loss in value as he found that there was no proper valuation to justify her alleged claim that the property was worth S$7m, and that it had not been proven that the loss in value was caused by the alleged defects.

</div>  But, up to today, the applicant has not made any payment.  While the respondent has obtained an order of court to enforce the award, it has been unable to act on the order to enforce because the applicant has taken an application to set aside the leave granted because she alleges that there have been breaches of natural justice in the making of the award (OS 1010/2018).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 Whether there will be prejudice will depend on the facts of each case.  In <span class="font-italic">S v A and B</span>, it was held at [39] that “there is always at least some irremediable prejudice when a commercial party is being kept out of its money”.  In <span class="font-italic">Squibb</span>, recognising the importance of the finality of arbitrated disputes, the court found that the following circumstances constituted prejudice to the respondent (at [28]–[29]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">28 … [The respondent] submits that [it] would suffer substantial prejudice if [the applicant] were granted an extension of time to challenge the Award.  [The respondent] is a modest company with a turnover of £400,000 approximately in comparison with [the applicant], a company with a turnover of £40 million approximately.  [The applicant’s] claim in the arbitration was for outstanding invoices in the sum of just over £100,000 … The Award is for the modest sum of £97,620.19…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">29  The general principles of the [Arbitration Act 1996 (UK)] … are that parties to arbitration should have autonomy and finality in the determination of their disputes.  Those principles are reflected in the <span class="font-italic">short time limits for any party to raise a challenge to an award</span>.  I am satisfied that <span class="font-italic">any delay in receiving payment of the sum awarded an</span><span class="font-italic">d any additional expense incurred in enforcing the Award would cause irremediable prejudice</span> to [the respondent].  That is a very significant factor in this case.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 I accept that there will be a degree of prejudice suffered by the respondent if an extension of time is granted to the applicant to apply for leave to appeal.  It will protract matters further.  It bears noting that that one of the factors which the court is required to take into account in considering whether to grant leave to appeal under s 49 is whether it is just and proper to do so, notwithstanding parties’ agreement to fully and finally settle matters by arbitration.  This suggests that, when the court has to consider whether to grant an extension of time for a party to apply for leave to appeal, the court must always bear in mind that the parties had agreed to arbitration as the mode of settlement of their disputes.  An attempt by the unsuccessful party to challenge the merits of the award must be carefully scrutinised because it delays the successful party’s rights to the fruits of its success in the agreed mode of dispute resolution.  This would be inconsistent with the legislative policy with regard to arbitration, namely, the expeditious resolution of arbitrated disputes and the need for finality: <span class="font-italic">Hong Huat </span>at [25].  In my judgment, the respondent in this case will suffer prejudice that is more than in the usual case because of the length of delay by the applicant in bringing this application.  That is a significant consideration for the court.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 On a holistic assessment of all the factors relevant to the application to extend time, I find that this is not an appropriate case where time should be extended.  All the factors weigh heavily against the applicant, as I have explained above.  No good reason has been provided by the applicant for her substantial delay in applying for leave to appeal against the award.  Additionally, a careful consideration of the alleged questions of law framed by the applicant shows that most of the questions raised are not “questions of law” or would not substantially affect the rights of the parties even if such questions are answered by the court.  The applicant’s application for leave to appeal against the award is hopeless and is bound to fail.  To allow such a frivolous application would militate against the principle of finality, which is fundamental for the efficient and effective resolution of disputes, a key attraction of arbitration.  This is why leave to appeal against an arbitral tribunal’s award will not be lightly granted, as seen by the various requirements that must be fulfilled under s 49 of the Act.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 In an application for leave to appeal against an award under the Act, arguments as to the correctness of the arbitral tribunal’s findings must directly relate to the questions of law that are raised.  The merits of the award will not be reviewed in its entirety as if it is a rehearing.  This is more than a theoretical proposition – it carries very real consequences.  Parties must understand that arbitration, with the efficiency and finality it allows, carries with it the potential serious downside that there exists limited recourse against errors in law and fact that are committed by the arbitrator(s) (<span class="font-italic">Chua Aik Kia </span>at [29] and [34]).  This must form part of the basket of considerations that parties weigh when deciding which mode of dispute resolution best suits their needs.  Having chosen arbitration, it would not be permissible for a dissatisfied litigant to challenge findings of fact and errors in the application of correct legal principles to the facts by masquerading such challenges as appeals against questions of law that arise from the arbitral award. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 For the foregoing reasons, I decline to grant an extension of time.  Even if such an extension of time were granted, given my findings that the prospects of the applicant succeeding in an application for leave to appeal is hopeless, such leave to appeal would also have been denied.  Therefore, I dismiss Originating Summons 730 of 2018 in its entirety.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 I will hear parties separately on the question of costs.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Ang Cheng Hock <br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Koh Choon Guan Daniel, Lim Khoon and Ang Minghao (Eldan Law LLP) for the applicant;<br/>Por Hock Sing Michael and Li Jiaxin (Michael Por Law Corporation) for the respondent.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-List text-justify"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
