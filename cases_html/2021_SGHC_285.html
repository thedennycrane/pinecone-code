By relying on these representations as well as Form C, TOCPL suffered loss, damage and harm in now having to shut down its social media platforms as a result of the IMDA’s suspension of TOCPL’s services and activities on the same. Had TOCPL known that the class licence also covered its social media platforms, it would not have registered for a class licence and would have altered its business model to rely solely on social media.

In addition, the doctrine of substantive legitimate expectations is irrelevant in this case because the issues of whether TOCPL’s class licence suspension applied to its Chinese website and social media platforms are purely questions of law to be determined by the court.

In any event, there is no <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case of reasonable suspicion in favour of granting the orders sought by TOCPL.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Regulation of licensable broadcasting services</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The automatic licensing regime and the registration regime</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 The present case necessitates a close examination of the licensing regime under the Act and the Broadcasting (Class Licence) Notification (GN No S 306/1996, 2004 Rev Ed) (“the Notification”) made thereunder. The starting point in analysing the statutory scheme that regulates the provision of licensable broadcasting services is s 8(1) of the Act, which provides that “[n]o <span class="font-italic">person</span> shall provide any licensable broadcasting service in or from Singapore without a broadcasting licence granted by the [IMDA]” [emphasis added]. The term “licensable broadcasting services” includes “[c]omputer on-line services” (item 20 of the Second Schedule to the Act). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 The Act also provides for a <span class="font-italic">class</span> licensing regime. Under s 9(1) of the Act, the IMDA “may, by notification published in the <span class="font-italic">Gazette</span>, determine a class licence … for the provision of such subscription broadcasting services and other licensable broadcasting services as the [IMDA] may specify”. Paragraph 3 of the Notification then states that the provision of certain specified licensable broadcasting services, including “computer on-line services that are provided by Internet Content Providers and Internet Service Providers” (para 3(<span class="font-italic">f</span>)), is subject to a class licence. The terms “Internet Content Provider” (“ICP”) and “Internet Service Provider” (“ISP”) are defined in para 2 of the Notification. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 The apparent breadth of these provisions is curtailed by para 1(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) of the Broadcasting (Exemption) Order (GN No S 307/1996, 2004 Rev Ed). That provision exempts any person providing computer on-line services <span class="font-italic">other than computer on-line services subject to a class licence under the Notification </span>from ss 8 and 9 of the Act. Thus, the licensing regime under ss 8 and 9 of the Act effectively only applies where the computer on-line services in question are provided by ICPs or ISPs. However, in such cases, the design of the statutory scheme is such that the provision of computer on-line services by all ICPs and ISPs is <span class="font-italic">automatic</span><span class="font-italic">ally </span>subject to a class licence. Class licences need not be applied for by these ICPs or ISPs; instead, they are “determine[d]” by the IMDA under s 9(1) of the Act, as has been done <span class="font-italic">via </span>the Notification. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 This leads me to the crucial distinction to be drawn between the two distinct regulatory regimes contained in the Act and the Notification: a licensing regime and a registration regime. The provision of computer on-line services by an ICP is subject to a class licence <span class="font-italic">by operation of law</span> under para 3(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) of the Notification. All such ICPs providing “computer on-line services” are automatically class licensees. Where the ICP in question is (or is determined by the IMDA to be) “a body of persons engaged in the propagation, promotion or discussion of political or religious issues relating to Singapore” through the Internet, the ICP is <span class="font-italic">additionally</span> required to register with the IMDA within 14 days after the commencement of its service. This is pursuant to condition 4 of the Schedule to the Notification, which sets out the conditions <span class="font-italic">of class licences</span> under para 3 of the Notification.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 The automatic nature of the class licensing scheme, as distinct from the registration scheme under the Schedule to the Notification, was confirmed in Parliament in the Minister’s oral answers to questions regarding the criteria for registration under the Broadcasting (Class Licence) Notification framework in January 2014 (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report </span>(20 January 2014) vol 91 (Lawrence Wong, Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information):   </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">There are three forms of licences for ICPs under MDA's licensing framework: (i) an individual licence; (ii) an <span class="font-italic">automatic</span> class licence; and (iii) an automatic class licence with the requirement to register with the MDA. Let me elaborate on these three categories.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">First, the individual licences are issued to content providers which offer a television service through the Internet. … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">The second category of licensing applies to the rest of the ICPs which are regulated under the Automatic Class licensing regime that has been in place since 1996. These licensees do not need to apply to MDA for individual licences, but they are automatically class-licensed once they operate their websites. </span>This remains the primary route through which the vast majority of websites on the Internet are licensed.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Finally, the third category would apply to certain types of ICPs to which class licences are granted automatically, but with the condition that they register with the MDA. Paragraphs three to five of the Schedule of the Broadcasting (Class Licence) Notification spell out the types of ICPs that need to register with MDA. They include ICPs who are political parties registered in Singapore providing any programme through the Internet, and ICPs who are “a body of persons engaged in the propagation, promotion or discussion of political or religious issues relating to Singapore through the Internet”.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">So, these are provisions already provided for and spelt out clearly in the Schedule. <span class="font-italic">The need to move from automatic class licence to class licence by registration only occurs when an individual or body meets these criteria which are spelt out in the Schedule.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 More recently, the Minister for Law confirmed the automatic nature of the licensing regime in his remarks on the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Bill (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report </span>(7 May 2019) vol 94 (K Shanmugam, Minister for Law)):

In that sense, the statutory scheme is such that the licensing and registration regimes are asymmetric.

In contrast, only <span class="font-italic">some</span> ICPs and ISPs are required to register with the IMDA. Furthermore, pursuant to condition 6 of the Schedule to the Notification, ICPs which are required to register shall register “in such form and manner as the [IMDA] may determine”, and shall “provide the [IMDA] with such particulars and undertakings as the [IMDA] may require in connection with the provision of the [ICP’s] service”. The regulator, in this framework, is not enjoined to regulate the registration of all computer on-line services that an ICP operates, but rather, to require registration “in such form and manner” as it sees fit. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">“Computer on-line services”</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 The central question in determining which services provided by an ICP are subject to a class licence is, therefore, whether they are “computer on-line services”.

The IMDA therefore submits, with reference to the dictionary definitions of “computer” and “online”, that the ordinary meaning of “computer on-line services” is wide enough to include <span class="font-italic">services provided </span>via<span class="font-italic"> an electronic device (or system of electronic devices) </span>by a person, business or organisation engaged in creating content for publication on the Internet or content accessible or made available by connection to a central processor or network.

</div> TOCPL’s argument is that it is not challenging the IMDA’s decision <span class="font-italic">to suspend or cancel </span>its class licence, but rather the IMDA’s interpretation that such cancellation would affect TOCPL’s other services and activities, such as the operation of its Chinese website and social media platforms.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 TOCPL’s argument arises out of its interpretation of the scope of its class licence, and therefore the scope of the cancellation. However, the present application arises out of the cancellation of TOCPL’s class licence, as communicated to TOCPL by the IMDA’s Letter, and it remains the cancellation of the class licence that is the essential issue. On a proper understanding of the statutory scheme for the regulation of licensable broadcasting services, TOCPL would have needed to appeal against the suspension and cancellation of its class licence in order to challenge the <span class="font-italic">legal </span><span class="font-italic">effect</span> of this cancellation on its Chinese website and social media platforms. TOCPL is therefore “a person aggrieved by any decision of the [IMDA] under [s 12]”, and the appeal procedure in s 12(2) of the Act is an alternative remedy which TOCPL ought to have exhausted.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Appeal under s 59(1)(</span><span class="font-weight-bold">b</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">)</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> of the Act </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Section 59 of the Act provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Appeal to Minister</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">59.</span>—(1)  Any licensee aggrieved by —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)  any decision of the Authority in the exercise of any discretion vested in it by or under this Act; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) <span class="font-italic">anything contained in any </span>Code of Practice or<span class="font-italic"> direction issued by the Authority</span>,</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">may appeal to the Minister.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(4)  The decision of the Minister in any appeal shall be final.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Within the schema of the Act, s 59(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) comes after many provisions setting out the various powers exercisable by the IMDA, and provides a wide remedy for an aggrieved licensee to appeal to the Minister against “<span class="font-italic">anything </span><span class="font-italic">contained in any … direction issued</span> by the [IMDA]” [emphasis added]. This provision is much more broadly worded than s 12(2) and would cover the acts of the IMDA that TOCPL seeks to challenge. TOCPL did not address the applicability of s 59(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) in its written submissions. When invited to respond to the IMDA’s submissions on this provision during the hearing, counsel for TOCPL made arguments which focused on s 59(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Act, instead of s 59(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>).

</div>
</div> Such an argument was roundly rejected at [30] of <span class="font-italic">Borissik</span>, where s 22(7) of the Planning Act (Cap 232, 1998 Rev Ed) provided that “[t]he decision of the Minister shall be final and shall not be challenged or questioned in any court”. In that case, the court stressed that the existence of such a clause was not a valid reason for failing to appeal to the Minister, who was required to accord the applicant a fair hearing under the statutory process. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 In <span class="font-italic">Borissik</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>Tan Lee Meng J made the point that s 22(7) of the Planning Act  showed that “the legislature intended that the courts should not interfere with issues of planning permission as these involve interrelated considerations of fact, law, degree and policy, which are better dealt with by an appeal procedure to the Minister” (<span class="font-italic">Borissik</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [29]). This reasoning is equally applicable to the present case. The regulation of broadcasting services, similar to the issue of planning permission, concerns wider issues of policy and its implementation and administration. In a statutory appeal to the Minister, all matters, whether substantive or procedural, would be fully and fairly considered. In the present case, parties did not discuss the scope of the court’s power on judicial review on the proper construction of ss 12(2) and 59(4) (see, for instance, the discussion in <span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran</span><span class="font-italic"> a/l K Dharmalingam v Public Prosecutor and another appeal </span>[2019] 2 SLR 216 at [43], [47] and [73], and <span class="font-italic">Per Ah Seng Robin and another v Housing and Development Board and another </span>[2016] 1 SLR 1020 at [64]–[65]). Such an assessment is not necessary at the leave stage. Whatever the scope of judicial review might be, the point remains that <span class="font-italic">Borissik</span> at [29] gives insight into why the statutory regime gives good order to the reconsideration of any decision. A statutory appeal ensures that the full merits are considered by the relevant Minister who is charged with the policy in issue. An aggrieved person is not well served by ignoring such a route for reconsideration save in exceptional circumstances which justify such a course.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on the threshold issue</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 I therefore find that, by not appealing to the Minister under s 12(2) or s 59(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Act, and by not adducing any exceptional circumstances to justify its omission to do so, TOCPL failed to exhaust its alternative remedies prior to invoking the court’s judicial review jurisdiction. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Prima facie </span><span class="font-weight-bold">case of reasonable suspicion</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 I turn now to the substantive question of whether the materials before the court disclose a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case of reasonable suspicion in favour of granting the remedies sought by TOCPL. The burden of proof “lies squarely on the applicant” to satisfy the court that this requirement is met: <span class="font-italic">AXY v Comptroller of Income Tax </span>[2018] 1 SLR 1069 at [33]. Moreover, while the threshold of proof is “very low”, this does not mean that the evidence and arguments placed before the court can be either skimpy or vague, and bare assertions will not suffice: <span class="font-italic">Gobi a/l </span><span class="font-italic">Avedian and another v Attorney-General and another appeal </span>[2020] 2 SLR 883 at [54].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether TOCPL’s Chinese website and social media platforms are “computer on-line services”</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 The main issue in dispute between the parties is the scope of TOCPL’s class licence, and thus the scope of the IMDA’s suspension and cancellation of the same.

</div> The effect of the statutory scheme, as I have explained above, is that TOCPL’s provision of <span class="font-italic">all </span>of its “computer on-line services” is subject to a class licence by operation of law, and that the suspension and cancellation of its class licence would bar TOCPL from providing all such services. The question for the court is therefore whether <span class="font-italic">only </span>the services provided on TOCPL’s main English websites are “computer on-line services” whose provision is subject to the class licence (as TOCPL argues); or whether (as the IMDA contends) the services provided by TOCPL on its Chinese website and social media platforms are <span class="font-italic">also</span> “computer on-line services” subject to the class licence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Applying the interpretation of “computer on-line services” that I have set out at [24]–[25] above, the services provided on TOCPL’s Chinese website and social media platforms clearly fall within the meaning of this term, as their primary purpose is undoubtedly to entertain, educate or inform all or part of the public. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 TOCPL makes two arguments to the contrary. First, TOCPL contends that it is fallacious to suggest that its class licence covered its social media platforms because “[n]o social media user in Singapore has had to be licensed by the [IMDA]”.

</div> Related to this is the argument that if TOCPL had known that its class licence covered its social media platforms, it would not have “registered with [the IMDA] for a [c]lass [l]icence” for its main English websites and would instead have altered its business model to rely purely on social media.

</div> The wording used in Annex B1 to Form C1 that I have reproduced above does not, on a plain reading, purport to define “computer on-line services” as including only websites. The more natural reading of those words is that the specific website being registered is simply the relevant <span class="font-italic">type </span>of computer on-line service for the purposes of Form C.

Indeed, the Press Statement explained that the Media Development Authority had “assessed that the TOC website engages in the propagation, promotion or discussion of political issues relating to Singapore”, and that its registration requirement “seeks to uphold the principle that politics must remain a matter for Singapore and Singaporeans alone”.
