In Suit No 1196 of 2018, (“this Suit”) the Plaintiff is claiming from his younger brother both movable and immovable properties that were part of the estate of their late mother. The siblings’ father Lim Seng Giap (“the Father”) passed away on 12 September 2010 while their mother Chew Ah Moy (“the Deceased”) passed away intestate on 9 February 2013. The siblings were the only children of the Father and the Deceased. The Plaintiff is now 48 years old while the Defendant is four years younger. The Defendant is far better educated than the Plaintiff being an engineer with post-graduate qualifications while the Plaintiff holds an “O” levels certificate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 In this Suit, the Plaintiff alleges that substantial cash sums that he handed over the years to the Deceased prior to her demise are held by the Defendant. He requires the Defendant to account for those monies as well as to give the Plaintiff his 49.5% share in a Housing &amp; Development Board (“HDB”) flat situated at Block 22, Ghim Moh Link #39-204, Singapore 271022 (“the Flat”), which the Plaintiff requests to be sold. The Flat previously belonged to the Deceased and is currently occupied by the Defendant and his family.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 Whilst the parties broadly agreed on the general sequence of events (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the chronology of major events that led to the present dispute), the Plaintiff and the Defendant offered very different slants in their respective affidavits of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC(s)”). In this section, I will canvass the salient facts whilst going through the parties’ contrasting characterisations of the various key events.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Plaintiff’s characterisation of key events in his AEIC</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The basis of the Plaintiff’s claim goes back to 2008 when the siblings’ parents lived at another HDB flat situated at Block 12A, Ghim Moh Road #14-28, Singapore 271012 (“the old flat”). The HDB acquired the old flat for selective en-bloc redevelopment and in its place, the HDB offered the parents the Flat. Payment for the Flat’s purchase price of S$342,086.05 was made as follows:</div><table class="table table-sm table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Item</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Amount</span></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Proceeds from the sale to HDB of the old flat</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">S$254,004</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Cash contribution from the Plaintiff</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">S$12,833.35</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Contributions withdrawn from the Deceased’s CPF account</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">S$21,684</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">The Defendant’s CPF withdrawals</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">S$54,564.70</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The total sum paid was S$343,086.05 (which was S$1,000 more than the purchase price of the Flat). The purchase of the Flat was completed on 19 October 2011. In addition to his contribution towards the purchase price of the Flat, the Plaintiff claimed he paid in November 2011 another S$82,385 towards the interior design and renovation cost of the Flat. As will be made clear, the Flat was at the heart of the disagreement between the parties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The Father passed away in 2010. Upon his death, the Father’s share in the old flat passed to the Deceased presumably, under the right of survivorship in a joint tenancy. The Deceased and the Defendant moved into the Flat in or about December 2011.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 According to the Plaintiff, he went to work in foreign exchange companies in Russia starting from 1995.  Over the years, the Plaintiff continued working in the foreign exchange industry, first in Russia, then in Japan (Tokyo), Indonesia, Cambodia, Myanmar and finally in Vietnam where he is currently based.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 It was while he was working in Vietnam in 2006 that the Plaintiff met one Tran Thi Ngo Thanh, a Vietnamese lady who was his girlfriend at that point. They returned to Singapore together in 2007 and got married. With his wife, the Plaintiff has had a daughter and a son. The Plaintiff deposed in his AEIC

</div> The Defendant testified the Plaintiff had to rent a flat to house his family. The Plaintiff’s son was born in January 2013 after he acquired his own HDB flat in 2009.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 While working overseas, the Plaintiff claimed he made and lost a lot of money. When he made money, he said he would pass to the Deceased 30% of his salaries for safekeeping, starting in 2008. The first sum the Plaintiff handed to the Deceased was S$100,000 followed by S$28,000 which the Plaintiff deposed was used by his parents to repay the outstanding HDB loan on the old flat. It was also the Plaintiff’s case that he doted on his younger brother so much that he gave the Defendant S$30,000 to help the latter buy a motor vehicle without the need to take out a car loan.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 On 9 April 2008, the Plaintiff won S$1m (“the lottery winnings”) from S$500 worth of 4D lottery tickets that he bought. He received the cheque for S$1m issued by Singapore Pools the next day and immediately deposited it into his POSB account number xxx-xxxxx-9 (“the Plaintiff’s POSB account”). Upon the cheque’s clearance, he said he transferred S$800,000 therefrom to the Deceased’s DBS account on 12 April 2008. However the evidence produced in court showed that the Deceased placed into four deposits in her DBS joint fixed deposit account number xxx-xxxxxx-17 (“the DBS joint fixed deposit account”), which she held jointly with the Defendant, only S$700,000, comprising three deposits of S$200,000 each and one deposit of S$100,000. The Plaintiff deposed in his AEIC that he did not know what the Deceased did with the remaining S$100,000 from the S$800,000 he gave to her, and postulated that she might have placed it “in another bank account, as she thought fit and proper”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 In March 2009, the Plaintiff purchased a HDB flat at Block 7, Ghim Moh Road #13-267, Singapore 270007 (“the Plaintiff’s Flat”) at a price of S$594,527.60; completion of the purchase was scheduled for July 2009. The Plaintiff requested the Deceased to return his money to enable him to pay for the Plaintiff’s Flat. The Deceased liquidated her various fixed deposits and transferred S$595,000 to the Plaintiff’s POSB account.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 The Plaintiff deposed he would give to the Deceased sums of money amounting to either “$10,000 or $20,000 or $30,000” in cash to hold on trust and left it to her to decide what she would do with his money. Although he deposed he did not keep track of the various sums of money he passed to the Deceased over the years until her demise, the Plaintiff nevertheless claimed he could recall roughly how much he had passed to her over the years. He deposed

</div>
</div> the Plaintiff asserted that the total entrusted funds with the Deceased should be S$550,302.89.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 The Plaintiff further claimed that as at the date of her demise, the POSB joint alternate account had a balance of S$140,183.80; he claimed he was entitled to 50% of this balance, amounting to S$70,091.90. As for the Deceased’s POSB sole account, the balance was S$20,352.11 of which he claimed S$10,176.06.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 As for the Flat, the Plaintiff claimed that the manner of holding of the HDB lease by way of a tenancy in common with 99% held by the Deceased and 1% held by the Defendant showed that the Deceased did not intend that whatever she possessed or inherited from the Father, or the money she held on trust for him, should devolve to the Defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 As the Deceased died intestate and the Plaintiff was often away from Singapore traveling to Cambodia and Vietnam, he renounced his right and entitlement to letters of administration of the Deceased’s estate on 4 July 2013 with the result that the Defendant became the sole administrator of her estate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 The Defendant applied to the State Courts on 4 July 2013 for letters of administration to the Deceased’s estate. The grant of letters of administration was issued to the Defendant on 24 July 2013. The only asset declared for the Deceased’s estate was the Flat with the value stated to be S$594,000.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 The Plaintiff deposed that on 21 December 2013, he transferred to the Defendant, in consideration of natural love and affection, his (the Plaintiff’s) interest in the Flat (amounting to 49.5%) that devolved to him from the 99% interest the Deceased had in the Flat. The Plaintiff’s version of events was that he had reached an oral agreement with the Defendant in or about December 2013. Under this agreement, the Plaintiff would transfer to the Defendant free of consideration the Plaintiff’s share in the Flat. Subsequently, when the Plaintiff requested, the Defendant would sell the Flat and divide the net sale proceeds equally between them, in accordance with the Intestate Succession Act (Cap 146, 2013 Rev Ed).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 The Plaintiff alleged that the Defendant gave the following reasons for the transfer of the Plaintiff’s interest in the Flat to him to be free of consideration:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the Defendant needed the Flat as he was getting married (which he did on 10 November 2013);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the Defendant did not have sufficient funds and/or CPF monies to purchase a HDB flat;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) even if the Defendant had sufficient funds to purchase the Plaintiff’s interest in the Flat, the Defendant would still have to pay stamp duty; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) as the Flat was a family home, it would be better for the siblings to hold it in memory of their late parents for a while before it was sold in the open market.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The Plaintiff also deposed that the Flat could not be sold in the open market after the letters of administration of the Deceased’s estate were extracted as the minimum occupation period (five years) had not yet been fulfilled.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 The Defendant on the other hand asserted that he paid the Plaintiff S$325,000 on or about 16 June 2013 to buy over the Plaintiff’s 49.5% interest in the Flat. This sum comprised S$294,030, representing 49.5% of the estimated value of the Flat, and an extra S$30,970 which was for the Defendant to show his appreciation for the Plaintiff’s financial support over the years. This was not the only aspect where the Defendant’s account of events materially deviated from that of the Plaintiff’s. In fact, in his AEIC, the Defendant’s version of other major events was completely different from that given by the Plaintiff, as can be seen from the paragraphs set out below.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Defendant’s characterisation of key events in his AEIC</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 According to the Defendant, when the Plaintiff started working in Russia in 1995, he would only return to Singapore every two or three years and would voluntarily give the Deceased about US$20,000 each time – the Deceased never asked the Plaintiff for this money. Sometime in 2000, the Plaintiff ran into some financial trouble in Russia. The Plaintiff asked the Father for help as he would not have been able to return to Singapore if he did not resolve his financial issues.  The Father thus used about S$200,000 of his pension money (from working as a police officer for almost 30 years until 1998) to bail out the Plaintiff who subsequently returned to Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Between 2001 and 2004, the Plaintiff conducted business in Russia remotely, from Singapore. Then in 2004, the Plaintiff ventured into business in Vietnam. He returned to Singapore occasionally and would hand to the Deceased sums of between S$5,000 and S$20,000 without being asked; the money was meant for housekeeping expenses.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 As for the purchase of the Flat, the Defendant deposed in his AEIC that the Deceased included his name as purchaser as she intended for him to inherit the property upon her demise. This was around the time the Father passed on, in 2010. The Plaintiff’s Flat had already been purchased by then.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 When he, the Plaintiff and the Deceased visited the HDB’s office in 2011 and they wanted to include the Defendant’s name as co-owner, the Defendant was unaware of the differences between a joint tenancy and a tenancy in common. The HDB officer who was attending to them did not explain the differences either. The Plaintiff immediately told the HDB officer that 99% of the Flat would be held by the Deceased and 1% by the Defendant. Consequently, the Flat came to be held by the Deceased and the Defendant as tenants in common in the aforementioned ratio. The Defendant’s usage of his CPF contributions of S$54,564.70 towards the purchase price of the Flat was disproportionate in comparison; his contribution amounted to about 16% (S$54,565.70 ÷ S$342,086.05) of the price of the Flat, whereas he owned only 1% of the Flat.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 After the passing of the Deceased and her funeral, the Defendant contacted the HDB to inquire about transferring the Deceased’s share in the Flat to himself. To his surprise, a HDB officer, one Mr Seah Bin Seng (“Mr Seah”), informed him that he would not inherit the Deceased’s share as the lease was a tenancy in common. The Defendant was told to engage a lawyer to obtain either letters of administration (if there was no will) or a grant of probate (if there was a will) of the Deceased’s estate. Mr Seah also informed the Defendant that the Flat would have to be divided equally with the Plaintiff in the event of intestacy.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The Defendant appointed a lawyer to apply for letters of administration of the Deceased’s estate. He deposed that in order to save costs, he agreed with the Plaintiff that only the Flat would be listed as an asset of the Deceased’s estate and they would distribute the rest of her assets amongst themselves (gold and monies in the Deceased’s POSB sole account), which they did. Further discussions the Defendant held with the Plaintiff resulted in the following oral agreement:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the Defendant would be the sole administrator of the Deceased’s estate; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the Plaintiff would renounce all his rights and title to letters of administration of the Deceased’s estate.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 As regards the Flat, the Defendant told the Plaintiff that they could either:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) sell the Flat in the open market and divide the sale proceedings equally between them; or</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) transfer the Flat to the Defendant as the Deceased intended in exchange for the Defendant’s payment of S$325,000.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">(collectively “the Proposal”)</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Before 17 June 2013, the Plaintiff reverted to the Defendant to accept para (b) of the Proposal but only on the condition that the Defendant was married. If the Defendant was not married by then, the Plaintiff required the Flat to be sold. The Defendant agreed as he and his girlfriend had already planned to get married in mid-2013 but postponed the wedding because of the demise of the Deceased. The Defendant then arrived at a second oral agreement with the Plaintiff in that regard. He paid the Plaintiff S$325,000 instead of half the declared value of the Deceased’s share of the Flat, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 49.5% of the Flat’s value amounting to S$294,030 (S$594,000 x 0.495) on 16 June 2013 because the Defendant wanted to compensate the Plaintiff for whatever monetary contributions the Plaintiff had made towards the Flat. The source of the Defendant’s payment was “fixed deposit bank accounts held jointly by [the Deceased] and [the Defendant]”, which monies devolved to him upon her passing – it was unclear, at the portion of the Defendant’s AEIC where he asserted this, whether this was a reference to the DBS joint fixed deposit account (see [9] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 On 6 August 2013, after the Defendant obtained the grant of letters of administration of the Deceased on 18 July 2013, he contacted Mr Seah of the HDB office to inquire as to the steps to be taken to transfer the Flat to his name. With Mr Seah’s guidance, the Defendant applied for the transfer for which HDB granted its approval on 24 October 2013.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 On 21 December 2013, both siblings attended at HDB’s office to sign the transfer documents. With Mr Seah’s assistance, the Defendant drafted for the Plaintiff’s signature the following document:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I, LIM YOUNG CHING (LIN YANZHENG), NRIC No. xxxxxxxxx, hereby give up my shares of the estate Blk 22 Ghim Moh Link #39-204 Singapore 271022 to LIM TAI CHING (LIN TAIZHENG), NRIC No. xxxxxxxxx.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The Plaintiff raised no objections to signing either the transfer or the above document.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Thereafter, the siblings pursued their respective careers while meeting regularly (they were close) until the Plaintiff began experiencing financial problems. The Defendant became aware of the Plaintiff’s financial troubles sometime in February 2016. The Defendant understood from the Plaintiff that the Plaintiff’s business in Cambodia was doing badly and his family was in financial difficulties. The Plaintiff said he wanted to venture into Myanmar for which he needed a sum of S$450,000 which he wanted to borrow from the Defendant. The Defendant told the Plaintiff he did not have such a huge sum to lend to him, whereupon the Plaintiff suggested that the Defendant sell the Flat. The Defendant reminded the Plaintiff that the Flat had been passed down to him (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Defendant), and he had no intention of selling it. The Plaintiff then suggested that the Defendant mortgage the Flat.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The Defendant felt obliged to assist the Plaintiff even though he was reluctant to mortgage the Flat. However, when he made inquiries, he found out that HDB flats cannot be mortgaged. He thus informed the Plaintiff that he could not lend him S$450,000. The Plaintiff then asked if the Defendant could lend him some money from the latter’s savings. The Defendant’s wife was then due to deliver their daughter in May 2016 and although he needed money for his wife’s delivery and the baby’s expenses, he nevertheless agreed to and did lend the Plaintiff S$71,300 in five tranches between March 2016 and January 2017.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 After the Defendant had transferred the first four tranches of money to the Plaintiff, which amounted to S$65,000, the Plaintiff again requested for money. Between October 2016 and January 2017, the Plaintiff informed the Defendant of his difficulties in doing business in Myanmar. He requested the Defendant to lend him more money so that he could send some money to his family. The Defendant refused as his savings were depleted and he had to ensure that his family’s needs were covered.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 However, the Defendant still wanted to help the Plaintiff. He did so by selling the Deceased’s jewellery on two occasions in January 2017 for S$6,250. He then transferred S$6,300 to the Plaintiff on 8 January 2017; that was the last of the five advances he made to the Plaintiff totalling S$71,300.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The Plaintiff did not stop there. He sent the Defendant multiple WhatsApp messages between 3 May and 11 May 2017, which the Defendant exhibited in his AEIC. In these messages, the Plaintiff asked the Defendant to lend him even more money.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Specifically, on 11 May 2017, the Plaintiff again raised the issue of selling the Flat. He informed the Defendant that he was in financial trouble and had incurred debts of S$450,000. That day, beyond asking the Defendant for more money, the Plaintiff in fact changed his tune: he claimed that he had a share in the Flat and he wanted to take back what was his. On that basis, he demanded that the Flat be sold. The Defendant rejected the Plaintiff’s request, reminding him of the oral agreements that they had as set out at [28(b)] and [29(b)] above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 As an alternative to selling the Flat, the Plaintiff proposed that the Defendant give to the Plaintiff’s wife a monthly sum of S$2,500 for household expenses. The Defendant declined the proposal as he could not see how that arrangement would help to pay the Plaintiff’s debts. Moreover, in May 2017, the Defendant’s wife had stopped working and he was the sole breadwinner in his family. According to the Defendant, the Plaintiff then gave him an ultimatum: the Defendant was either to allow the Plaintiff to move into the Flat, or he was to find money amounting to half the current<span class="font-italic"> </span>value of the Flat (as at May 2017) and give it to the Plaintiff. The Defendant did not reply to this ultimatum – neither option was acceptable to him. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 As a result, the Plaintiff became increasingly unhappy and continued to press the Defendant to sell the Flat. Things between the siblings came to a head on 22 May 2017 when the Plaintiff visited the Flat that night to try to resolve matters with the Defendant. The Plaintiff allegedly raised his voice and became increasingly agitated. The Defendant feared the Plaintiff may resort to violence. The Defendant thus ultimately relented that day and offered to sell the Flat to assist the Plaintiff with his debts. He agreed to try to sell the Flat by Chinese New Year 2018. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 The Defendant qualified his agreement to sell the Flat with two conditions. First, he insisted that <span class="font-italic">he</span> would decide when he would sell the Flat and it would certainly not be at a loss. By then, the Flat was worth about S$900,000, and selling it would have netted the Plaintiff around S$450,000 (half of the sale price, as per his demands), which would have enabled the Plaintiff to clear his debts. Second, the Defendant would sell the Flat only after he had found a flat for his family to move to. The Defendant’s conditions were captured in his WhatsApp messages to the Plaintiff on 23 May 2017</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Unfortunately, the Defendant’s agreement to sell the Flat made the Plaintiff even more eager to get it sold. He kept hounding the Defendant by sending WhatsApp messages, chasing him to make the sale. The Defendant was in no hurry to sell the Flat, and insisted on his conditions, as stated above, being met prior to any sale. The Plaintiff chased the Defendant on the following occasions:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The Plaintiff sent a Whatsapp message to the Defendant on 10 June 2017 asking about whether there had been progress with the sale. The Defendant responded by saying he would sell no earlier than in 2018, and the Plaintiff should inform his creditor(s) who lent him money. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) That response earned the Defendant some respite from the Plaintiff who did not chase the Defendant again until 5 July 2017 via a WhatsApp message. The Defendant did not reply to this message.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) On 10 July, the Plaintiff asked again whether there was progress with the sale. The Defendant replied saying he had received offers below the market price of about S$980,000 at that point in time. He also had difficulty finding a suitably priced alternative flat for his family. In response, the Plaintiff accused the Defendant of “delay tactics”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 A further exchange of WhatsApp messages between the siblings from July 2017 to September 2017 did not resolve the impasse or differences between the siblings. During this period, the Defendant gradually got tired of the Plaintiff’s antics – despite the Defendant’s best efforts in searching for a suitable buyer for the Flat, and despite having done the above with his brother’s interests in mind, the Plaintiff simply accused the Defendant of “wanting to take his share of the Flat”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 On the night of 24 September 2017, the Plaintiff met the Defendant at the void deck of the Flat’s block. The Defendant claimed the Plaintiff was insistent and demanded that he sell the Flat. When the Defendant refused, the Plaintiff became even more agitated. Despite being reminded by the Defendant that he had been transferred S$325,000 by the Defendant in exchange for his share of the Flat, the Plaintiff repeatedly insisted that half of the Flat still belonged to him. The parties did not reach an agreement that night. After the Plaintiff left, the Defendant received a WhatsApp message from him stating he would look for the Defendant the following day.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The Plaintiff returned to the Flat on the night of 25 September 2017 but the Defendant refused to open the door to allow him entry. The Defendant’s conduct infuriated the Plaintiff who shouted at the Defendant and caused a ruckus, prompting the Defendant to call the police. The Plaintiff only left the scene after the police arrived. The Defendant lodged a police report against the Plaintiff on 1 November 2017

</div> as he felt threatened by the Plaintiff.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 After first sending two letters of demand to the Defendant dated 10 October 2017 and 20 October 2017 respectively (the first of which the Defendant ignored on his lawyers’ advice), the Plaintiff issued the Writ of Summons on 25 November 2018.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The pleadings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 The Plaintiff’s lengthy Statement of Claim (Amendment No 1) was almost a repeat of his AEIC and it serves little purpose to set out his pleadings.  In his AEIC, he referred repeatedly to the Statement of Claim as well as the Defence and Counterclaim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The Defence also mirrored the Defendant’s AEIC but not to the extent of the Plaintiff’s AEIC and the Statement of Claim. The Defendant largely denied the Plaintiff’s allegations and put him to strict proof in respect of his many claims, in particular the alleged oral agreement set out at [20] above. Apart from admitting that the Plaintiff won a lottery of S$1m, the Defendant denied the Plaintiff’s other allegations. The Defendant:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) asserted that he is not obliged to account to the Plaintiff for any monies held in any joint bank accounts of the Defendant and the Deceased;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) averred that the Plaintiff was well aware that the monies in the Deceased’s POSB sole account had been divided between the Plaintiff and the Defendant after the death of the Deceased;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) denied that any monies held in any joint bank accounts of the Defendant and the Deceased were held on trust for the Plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) pointed out that any monies given by the Plaintiff to the Deceased were gifts from the Plaintiff and that included the renovations of the Flat that the Plaintiff paid for.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The Defendant averred that in making a claim for half of 99% of the Flat after transferring his legal interest in the same to the Defendant, the Plaintiff was in effect stating that he remained the beneficial owner of a 49.5% interest in the Flat and that this interest was held by the Defendant on trust for him. The Defendant relied on ss 51(8) and 51(9) of the Housing &amp; Development Board Act (Cap 129, 2004 Rev Ed) (“HDA”) to deny the existence of such a trust, and to argue that such a trust would be null and void.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 The Defendant admitted that the Plaintiff was entitled under the estate of the Deceased to a half share of 99% of the Flat but contended that he had purchased the Plaintiff’s half share for S$325,000.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The Defendant counterclaimed from the Plaintiff the sum of S$71,300 referred to earlier at [34].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The evidence at trial</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The Plaintiff and the Defendant were the only witnesses for their respective cases.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Plaintiff’s case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 The main points of the Plaintiff’s AEIC have been set out earlier at [4] to [21] above. I turn to the evidence that was adduced from him during cross-examination. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Notwithstanding the fact that he only had an “O” levels certificate, the Plaintiff testified that he started working at 23 years of age as a forex consultant in Russia after the country started to open its economy in 1989. Apparently, he was recruited by a Hong Kong company and went to Russia to train the people there on how to trade in foreign exchange.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The Plaintiff clarified he was not looking for a return of the S$28,000 he paid to HDB to redeem the outstanding loan on the old flat, nor the renovation cost of the Flat. He corrected his AEIC to say he could not remember small sums of money he gave to the Deceased but he could remember if the sums were S$20,000 and above.

There were no details furnished as to when he gave the Deceased the S$100,000 and no evidence whatsoever was produced in support of the claim.

However, the DBS joint fixed deposit account at [9] above showed that the Deceased placed into four fixed deposits on 12 April 2008 a total of S$700,000. Apart from his say-so, there was no evidence that the Plaintiff handed to the Deceased S$800,000 instead of S$700,000.

Then, at [15], I had set out the three amounts which the Plaintiff claimed the Deceased had in fixed deposits (the two sums differed) and then what the Plaintiff claimed she held on trust for him namely S$550,302.89. The result is that the court has no idea what was/were the actual amount(s) the Plaintiff claims he “entrusted” to the Deceased. For this reason as well as the court’s observations in [13] and [85], the court was not impressed with the Plaintiff’s veracity. The Defendant’s evidence was to be preferred.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 Assuming <span class="font-italic">arguendo</span>, that there was indeed a trust created over the large sums (more than S$100,000 according to the Plaintiff) that the Plaintiff had handed over to the Deceased for safekeeping, the undisputed evidence showed that the total sum was likely only S$700,000. It is common ground that the Deceased returned to the Plaintiff S$595,000 for the purchase of the Plaintiff’s Flat. In addition, taking the Plaintiff’s evidence (at [62]) at face value, that it was his own money (S$150,000) that the Father remitted to him in Russia to get him out of trouble, the two sums total S$745,000 (S$595,000 + S$150,000). The Deceased had effectively returned to the Plaintiff all the money that she allegedly safe-kept for him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 There is no conclusive evidence of how much the Plaintiff handed over to the Deceased over the years in small amounts whenever he returned from Russia (which the court accepts was once every two to three years as the Defendant testified and not once every year as the Plaintiff claimed). Even if the sums were as substantial as S$35,000, it is the court’s finding that those sums were gifts from a son to his mother, to help her pay for the family’s upkeep as well as to meet the outgoings of the old flat and, subsequently, the Flat.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 The Plaintiff’s position was that he was the sole source of the Deceased’s fixed deposits.

The Court of Appeal held that on the facts, the presumption of advancement was rebutted and the monies in the bank accounts were held on a resulting trust for the deceased’s estate. At [47], Chan Sek Keong CJ said:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…The proper principle to apply in relation to rebutting the presumption of advancement was that the more readily the presumption may be inferred from the relationship, the greater was the evidence needed to rebut it and, conversely, the less readily the presumption was inferable, the lesser was the evidence needed to rebut it…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 Applying the principles extracted from <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>and <span class="font-italic">Low Gim Siah</span>, the court finds that the evidence in this case clearly points to the Deceased’s intention to leave the monies in the POSB joint alternate account and the DBS joint fixed deposit account to her younger son, the Defendant.

The Defendant also placed his own monies in the aforementioned accounts. Separately, he and the Deceased maintained POSB accounts in their individual names. The burden was on the Plaintiff to rebut such evidence pointing to the Deceased’s intention to allow the Defendant, as her joint account holder, to retain the benefit of the funds in the said accounts upon her demise.

Even if he could not control his spending, he could have opened joint or fixed deposit accounts (based on alternative mandates) with the Deceased and let her keep the passbook(s), the ATM card(s) and/or fixed deposit receipts (if applicable).

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify"> Based on the Defendant’s pleaded case at para 10(e) of the Defence.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 The court does not view the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">SCT Technologies</span> as of any assistance for the Plaintiff’s argument that the burden of proof should be reversed in this case as can be seen from the facts set out in the decision. There, the appellant sued the respondent to recover a fixed sum owing under three partially unpaid invoices. The respondent’s defence was that the claimed amount had been paid in full relying on bank statements that recorded certain payments that had been made to the appellant. However, the bank statements did not record the purpose for which the payments were made and none of the bank statements recorded payments of amounts which mirrored the total value of any of the three invoices dollar for dollar.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 The Court of Appeal reversed the High Court’s finding that the burden of proof was on the appellant to prove the purpose of the undisputed payments.  It held that the burden remained on the respondent to prove that the bank statements showed it had paid the appellant’s three invoices which it failed to discharge.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 In this case, it is common ground that the Defendant paid and the Plaintiff received S$325,000 on 16 June 2013. What is in issue and which the court has to determine is, what was the purpose of that payment – whose version of the purpose of the payment should the court accept? There is no reversal of the burden of proof to the Defendant in such a scenario.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 On the evidence, I am persuaded by the Defendant’s case on this issue. I accept that the S$325,000 was intended to be consideration for the Plaintiff’s share in the Flat. It was highly improbable, given the circumstances, that that payment would have been intended as repayment to the Plaintiff for sums he allegedly handed to the Deceased prior to her passing.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Evidence showing that the S$325,000 payment was intended to be consideration for the Plaintiff’s 49.5% share in the Flat</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 It is the court’s finding on a balance of probabilities that the S$325,000 payment to the Plaintiff was made by the Defendant to buy over the Plaintiff’s 49.5% share in the Flat. As a starting point, and as mentioned at [95] above, the presumption of advancement applied in favour of the Defendant to whatever sums left by the Deceased in the DBS joint fixed deposit account and POSB joint alternate account (including the alleged S$350,000) held with the Defendant. The Defendant had the right to these monies. Even if the Defendant had decided not to return the Plaintiff whatever balance monies the Deceased held which purportedly originated from the Plaintiff, it does not change the legal position – the right of survivorship allows the Defendant to retain the monies his late mother left in their joint accounts. They were his to deal with, and he chose to use them to purchase the Plaintiff’s 49.5% share in the Flat.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 Pursuant to the oral agreement reached between the siblings (at [30]) upon the Plaintiff’s acceptance of para (b) of the Proposal (see [29(b)] above), the Defendant paid the Plaintiff the sum of S$325,000 in exchange for the latter’s share in the Flat. The circumstances support the Defendant’s claim that such an agreement existed. There was relative temporal proximity between the transfer of the S$325,000 (in June 2013) and the transfer of the Plaintiff’s share in the Flat (the paperwork for which was done between August and December 2013). There is thus evidence of a nexus between the sum of S$325,000 and the transfer of the share in the Flat. In contrast, not a shred of evidence has been adduced showing that the transfer of S$325,000 had anything to do with repayment for the sums the Plaintiff purportedly handed the Deceased. There were no WhatsApp or text messages to this effect. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 In fact, there is no evidence that there was still any outstanding sum owed to the Plaintiff by the Deceased that would call for any repayment. As mentioned at [88], the court is of the view that the only clear evidence adduced showed that the Plaintiff gave S$700,000 to the Deceased. By mid-2013, he had in effect been repaid S$745,000. The sum of S$325,000 could therefore not have been partial repayment (as the Plaintiff claimed) of the Plaintiff’s monies.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 The Plaintiff now belatedly asserts that the sum of S$325,000 is an undervalue for the Plaintiff’s half share. This assertion does not aid him for two reasons. First, the Plaintiff’s claim on the value of the Flat is unbelievable. It is noteworthy that at the material time, the Plaintiff did not complain, did not ask the Defendant for the basis of the Flat’s valuation being S$594,000 and did not ask for a proper valuation to be carried out to ascertain its true or correct value. He was happy to accept S$325,000 from the Defendant and he should not be allowed to resile from that position. Indeed, in any event, the court had earlier (at [74]) commented that there was no reliable evidence that the Flat was worth S$868,000 (or any other value) in mid-2013. Second, even if the court accepts that the Flat was worth more, it does not change the fact that the S$325,000 would still have been a part payment reflecting a portion of the value of the Flat, pursuant to the oral agreement (at [30]). A different Flat value does not change the nature of or intention behind the payment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 To reinforce his contention that the S$325,000 was a refund of his money, the Plaintiff then pointed to the fact that the transfer of his share in the Flat to the Defendant was stated to be for “natural love and affection”. The short answer to this argument is that the transfer for “natural love and affection” meant no <span class="font-italic">ad varolem</span> stamp fees were payable on the Transfer instrument. The siblings simply wanted to save money. The label of “natural love and affection” did <span class="font-italic">not</span> mean that the sum of S$325,000 was not consideration for the Plaintiff’s share in the Flat.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 The Plaintiff’s submissions also placed great emphasis

The suggestion is that the sum of S$325,000 could not have been consideration for the Plaintiff’s share of the Flat given that the Defendant subsequently admitted that the Plaintiff still held a share in the same. What the court notes is that the Plaintiff was pressing the Defendant relentlessly between May and September 2017 for money to the tune of S$450,000. It seems to the court that, in order to stop the Plaintiff from hounding him further, the Defendant (foolishly I would add) agreed to give the Plaintiff his “share”.

</div> That amount, together with the subsequent S$325,000 that the Defendant transferred to the Plaintiff, equated the sum of S$350,000 that the Defendant withdrew from the five fixed deposits the Deceased had at the date of her demise. The Defendant transferred the sum of S$350,000 to his own POSB account on 21 May 2013.

</div> that the S$350,000 he paid the Plaintiff was repayment of the funds entrusted by the Plaintiff to the Deceased. On the other hand, the Plaintiff was not cross-examined or challenged on his testimony regarding the sum. Hence, citing the principle in <span class="font-italic">Browne v Dunn</span> (1893) 6 R 67, the Plaintiff submitted that his testimony on the S$25,000 being part repayment of his monies was neither challenged nor contradicted and must therefore be accepted. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 In the court’s view, the Plaintiff’s repeated emphasis on this point is tenuous and does not advance his case on the issue of the nature of the S$325,000 payment. There are three critical reasons why.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 First, and most critically, the Plaintiff would be unjustly enriched if he were to be awarded judgment in relation to the sum of S$350,000. I earlier found that there is no sum outstanding from the Deceased to the Plaintiff (see [104] above). As noted, the Plaintiff has only succeeded in proving that he passed the Deceased S$700,000; he also acknowledged that he received S$745,000 from the Deceased and the Father (see [88] above). Adding the sum of S$350,000, the Plaintiff would have received $1,095,000, far more than any amount he has proven to have given the Deceased. In fact, this exceeds even the amount the Plaintiff <span class="font-italic">claims</span> to have given the Deceased on his own case (which was S$800,000 + S$100,000 + $100,000 = $1m; see [77] to [79] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 Second, while the Plaintiff has not been seriously challenged in cross-examination on this point, the Defendant has, at the least, denied that the S$25,000, as part of the larger sum of S$350,000, was intended to be repayment to the Plaintiff. That being the case, there are but bare assertions emanating from both sides, and the burden of proof remains on the Plaintiff, who alleges the fact, to prove his case. The Plaintiff must prove a nexus between the S$25,000 and the funds allegedly entrusted to the Deceased by him, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that the former was intended to be part repayment of the latter. The court struggles to see any evidence to this effect.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 Third, assuming <span class="font-italic">arguendo</span> that I accept the Plaintiff’s assertion that the S$25,000 was a repayment to him for sums he had passed to the Deceased, this would at best suffice as proof of a further S$25,000 amount owed (by the Deceased to the Plaintiff). It does not necessarily follow that the sum of S$325,000 must likewise have been intended as a repayment; the circumstances suggest they were urelated transfers. The transfers were on different days in June 2013. If they were meant to, together, be a lump sum repayment to the Plaintiff amounting to S$350,000, I struggle to understand why they were not transferred together in a single transaction. At that point, the Defendant had the entire S$350,000 sum in his own bank account. He could have easily transferred the entire sum in one tranche; he did not.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 On the evidence, therefore, it is clear on multiple counts that the S$325,000 was in fact not repayment to the Plaintiff, but consideration for the Plaintiff’s share in the Flat.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">(e) Do the oral agreements between the parties at [28] and [29] amount to the creation of a trust in the Flat in favour of the Plaintiff?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 In light of [103] and [104], the court finds that there was no trust created in favour of the Plaintiff. I would add that the Plaintiff, in his closing submissions, sought to say that the Plaintiff was not asserting a trust over his share that of the Flat but only a contractual right that when the Defendant sells the Flat, he is contractually obliged to pay the Plaintiff his 49.5% share. This submission is untruthful as in the Statement of Claim, at para (a)(iii) of the reliefs, the Plaintiff has prayed for:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">an order that the defendant to sell the HDB Flat within seven (7) days from the date of Judgment;</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The Plaintiff wants the court to grant him an order to force the Defendant to sell the Flat and pay him his alleged share – the court will not do so.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">(f) If a trust was indeed created, would ss 51(8), 51(9) and 51(10) of the HDA render the trust void?  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 If the court’s finding in [115] is erroneous and there was indeed a trust created in favour of the Plaintiff by the oral agreement referred to in [30], the provisions in s 51 of the HDA would render the trust void. The relevant subsections of s 51 read as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(8)  No trust in respect of any protected property [ie a HDB flat]  shall be created by the owner thereof without the prior written approval of the Board.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(9)  Every trust which purports to be created in respect of any protected property without the prior written approval of the Board shall be null and void.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(10)  No person shall become entitled to any protected property (or any interest in such property) under any resulting trust or constructive trust whensoever created or arising.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 The two cases cited by the Plaintiff on s 51 of the HDA, namely <span class="font-italic">Teo Ai Hua (alias Teo Jimmy) and another v Teo Mui Mui</span> [2011] 3 SLR 935, and <span class="font-italic">Philip Antony Jeyaretnam and another v Kulandaivelu Malayaperumal and others</span> [2020] 3 SLR 738 are not relevant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 The Plaintiff has also quoted out of context the extract from <span class="font-italic">Tan Chui Lian v Neo Liew Eng</span> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 265 (at [10]) set out at para 25 of his reply submissions.

In my judgment, having regard to the mischief underlying the section, the provision was not intended to have any application where the parties concerned were already entitled to some interest in the property and therefore no issue could arise as to their eligibility to such entitlement. In such circumstances, the parties concerned would not be claiming to <span class="font-italic">become </span>entitled to own an interest in the flat by virtue of the implied trust and there would be no concern of their bypassing the eligibility criteria set by the HDB from time to time.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">It is clear from the extract he cited that his ownership of the Plaintiff’s Flat would have rendered him ineligible to have any interest in the Flat under the provisions of the HDA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 The court in <span class="font-italic">Low Heng Leon Andy v Low Kian Beng Lawrence (administrator of the estate of Tan Ah Kng, deceased)</span> [2013] 3 SLR 710 said very much the same thing (at [18]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">(g) Is the Defendant entitled to his counterclaim from the Plaintiff?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 The Defendant’s evidence on his transfer of S$71,300 to the Plaintiff via five tranches (see [34] above) has not been seriously challenged.
