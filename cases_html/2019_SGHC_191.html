Once the sentencing band, which defines the range of sentences which may <span class="font-italic">usually </span>be imposed for an offence with those features, is identified, the court has to go on to identify precisely where within that range the present offence falls in order to derive an “indicative starting point”. In exceptional cases, the court may decide on an indicative starting point which falls outside the prescribed range, although cogent reasons should be given for such a decision.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b)   The sentencing bands prescribe ranges of sentences which would be appropriate for contested cases and are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(i) Band 1 comprises cases at the lower end of the spectrum of seriousness which attract sentences of ten to 13 years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane. Such cases feature no offence-specific aggravating factors or are cases where these factors are only present to a very limited extent and therefore have a limited impact on sentence.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(ii) Band 2 comprises cases of rape of a higher level of seriousness which attract sentences of 13–17 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane. Such cases would usually contain two or more offence-specific aggravating factors (such as those listed at [44] above).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(iii) Band 3 comprises cases which, by reason of the number and intensity of the aggravating factors, present themselves as extremely serious cases of rape. They should attract sentences of between 17–20 years’ imprisonment and 18 strokes of the cane.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c)   At the second step, the court should have regard to the aggravating and mitigating factors which are <span class="font-italic">personal to the offender</span> to calibrate the sentence. These are factors which relate to the offender’s particular personal circumstances and, by definition, <span class="font-italic">cannot</span> be the same factors which have already been taken into account in determining the categorisation of the offence. One of the factors which the court should consider at this stage is the value of a plea of guilt (if any). The mitigating value of a plea of guilt should be assessed in terms of (i) the extent to which it is a signal of remorse; (ii) the savings in judicial resources; and (iii) the extent to which it spared the victim the ordeal of testifying. Thus under our proposed framework, while for the first step an uncontested case will proceed in the same way as a contested case, it is at the second step that the appropriate discount will be accorded by the court for the plea of guilt by the offender.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d)   The court should clearly articulate the factors it has taken into consideration as well as the weight which it is placing on them. This applies <span class="font-italic">both</span> at the second step of the analysis, when the court is calibrating the sentence from the indicative starting point <span class="font-italic">and </span>at the end of the sentencing process, when the court adjusts the sentence on account of the totality principle. In this regard, we would add one further caveat. In a case where the offender faces two or more charges, and the court is required to order one or more sentences to run consecutively, the court can, if it thinks it necessary, further calibrate the individual sentence to ensure that the global sentence is appropriate and not excessive. When it does so, the court should explain itself so that the individual sentence imposed will not be misunderstood.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 The Prosecution’s position was that both the 2nd and 4th Charges against Ridhwan and Faris respectively fell in the middle of Band 2 as there were two offence-specific aggravating factors, namely the Complainant’s vulnerability due to intoxication and the severe harm that she suffered.

When the victim subsequently became inebriated, the accused took advantage of the opportunity to sexually assault her.

Applying the <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span> framework, the accused’s conduct in raping the victim fell within Band 1 with an indicative sentence of 12 or 13 years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane (<span class="font-italic">Pram Nair</span> at [140]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Similar to <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair</span>, the single offence-specific aggravating factor was that Ridhwan and Faris took advantage of the Complainant’s vulnerability.

As I understood it, Faris’ point was that this delay prevented him from being sentenced under the framework in <span class="font-italic">P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor v NF </span>[2006] 4 SLR(R) 849 (“<span class="font-italic">PP v NF</span>”), which was the sentencing framework adopted at the time the offence was committed and before the <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>framework. To my mind, the fact that the applicable sentencing framework changed between the date of offence and sentencing would not ordinarily constitute a mitigating factor. In fact, the issue of prospective overruling was expressly canvassed in <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>and rejected by the Court of Appeal (at [74]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">74 In deciding on the operative date for the application of this framework, we have regard to the considerations set out in <span class="font-italic">PP v Hue An Li </span>[2014] 4 SLR 661 at [124], where the court discussed the doctrine of prospective overruling. After careful consideration, we are of the opinion that this is not a case in which the doctrine should apply. Our reasons are as follows. First, the Revised Framework does not effect a radical change in the sentencing benchmarks. For the most part it seeks only to rationalise existing judicial practice to promote a more systematic, coherent, consistent and transparent approach towards sentencing in this area… Secondly, as will be seen later, applying the Revised Framework to the present case would not give rise to a higher punishment to be imposed on the Appellant. In our judgment, the Revised Framework should take effect immediately…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 It is clear from the Court of Appeal’s judgment that it intended for the <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span> framework to apply retroactively. Even if the doctrine of prospective overruling were invoked in <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span>, the <span class="font-italic">PP v NF </span>framework would not have applied to Faris as he was sentenced after the date on which the <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>framework was promulgated: <span class="font-italic">Adri Anton Kalangie v Public Prosecutor </span>[2018] 2 SLR 557 at [71(b)]. Thus, any delay preventing Faris from being sentenced under the <span class="font-italic">PP v NF</span> framework did not constitute a mitigating factor.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 I now turn to the common mitigating factors raised by Ridhwan and Faris (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, their youth and lack of prior antecedents).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 I was of the view that on the facts of the case, Ridhwan and Faris’ youth and lack of prior antecedents were only neutral factors.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 The Prosecution seemed to accept that the young age of Ridhwan and Faris (<span class="font-italic">ie, </span>below 21 years of age) was an offender specific mitigating factor although the Prosecution argued that this was outweighed by other factors.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 I first address the issue of youth. The Defence mentioned the young age of Ridhwan and Faris as a mitigating factor, but did not elaborate on this point or cite any precedents to support the argument. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 I considered some cases dealing with the relevance of an offender’s youth in sentencing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 In <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Mohammad Al-Ansari bin Basri</span> [2008] 1 SLR(R) 449 (“<span class="font-italic">Ansari</span>”), the High Court said at [28] that where the accused person is a young offender who has committed a serious offence, the principles of rehabilitation and deterrence must form the prime focus of the court’s attention. That was said in the context of an accused person who was apparently below 21 and was charged for committing robbery with accomplices. Another charge of intentionally using criminal force on the victim was taken into consideration. The court was considering whether to sentence him to probation or reformative training.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 In <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Wang Jian Bin </span>[2011] SGHC 212, the High Court mentioned that it had taken into consideration the youth of the accused person, who was 23 at the time of the offence. However, in the totality of the circumstances pertaining to the rape of a girl under 14 years of age and taking into account two other serious charges, the court was of the view that a custodial sentence of 13 years was nonetheless warranted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 In <span class="font-italic">Haliffie bin Mamat v Public Prosecutor and other appeals </span>[2016] 5 SLR 636, the accused was apparently around 23 years of age at the time of the commission of rape and robbery. The Court of Appeal mentioned at [82] that the accused’s relative young age was a mitigating factor. It appears that the Prosecution there accepted that this was a mitigating factor.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 <span class="font-italic">In Pram Nair</span>, the accused was 23 years of age at the time of the offences but no discount was given for his relative youth (see <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair</span> at [140]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In <span class="font-italic">A Karthik v Public Prosecutor </span>[2018] 5 SLR 1289 (“<span class="font-italic">Karthik</span>”), the accused was charged with two counts of abetting by conspiracy the cheating of two motor insurance companies. At the time of the commission of the offences, he was 17 years of age. By the time he pleaded guilty to the charge, with the other being taken into consideration, and was sentenced, he was 22 years of age. In the High Court, Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon mentioned at [36] that rehabilitation should be the dominant sentencing consideration when dealing with youthful offenders. This was for two reasons, which Menon CJ referred to as the retrospective rationale and prospective rationale (at [37]). Menon CJ acknowledged at [45] that where the accused was below 21 at the time of the offence but above 21 at the time of the sentence, the prospective rationale would not apply as strongly, if at all, while the retrospective rationale would continue to be relevant. On the exceptional factors before the court, the court sentenced the accused to probation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 In the present case, Ridhwan and Faris were 20 years of age at the time of the commission of the offences on 26 January 2014. At the time of sentencing in August 2019, they were about 25 years of age. This meant that the prospective rationale identified by Menon CJ in <span class="font-italic">Karthik</span> did not apply to them as strongly.  Bearing in mind the gravity of the offences and the fact that Ridhwan and Faris were just under 21 years of age at the time of the commission of the offences, I did not think that the retrospective rationale or their youth was a mitigating factor. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 As for the lack of prior antecedents, I did not think that this constituted a mitigating factor due to the gravity of the offences committed by Ridhwan and Faris.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 The authorities are not consistent as to whether the lack of prior antecedents is a mitigating factor in the case of serious sexual offences. In <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair</span>, the Court of Appeal at [140] agreed with the trial Judge’s view that there were no significant mitigating factors even though the accused person in that case had no prior antecedents (see<span class="font-italic"> Public</span><span class="font-italic"> Prosecutor v Pram Nair </span>[2016] 5 SLR 1169 at [48]–[49]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 In contrast, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Haliffie </span>at [82(b)] took the view that the accused person’s lack of prior antecedents was a mitigating factor.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 It appeared to me that whether an accused person’s lack of prior antecedents was a mitigating factor depended on the unique facts of each case. Here, I was satisfied that given the serious sexual offences committed on a vulnerable victim, Ridhwan and Faris’ lack of prior antecedents should not be regarded as a mitigating factor.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Turning to the offender-specific aggravating factors, the Prosecution raised several aggravating factors, which it contended outweighed any mitigating value arising from Ridhwan and Faris’ youth and lack of antecedents:

The fact that Ridhwan and Faris committed the offence against a vulnerable victim was already accounted for in the first stage as an offence-specific aggravating factor. To take this into account at the second stage would result in the same factor being giving double weight. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Second, the Prosecution provided no reasons to support its argument that Faris had demonstrated no remorse. It appeared that the Prosecution’s contention was that Faris’ decision to claim trial constituted an aggravating factor. This could not have been correct. An accused person is entitled to claim trial and his decision to do so cannot constitute an aggravating factor. While the decision to plead guilty may in certain circumstances have mitigating value, the absence of a mitigating factor could not constitute an aggravating factor.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 As for Ridhwan, I did not think that the conduct of his counsel during cross-examination of the Complainant went so far as to show an evident lack of remorse. It is clear from the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>that a relatively high threshold must be met for this to be an offender-specific aggravating factor, such as where the accused conducts his defence in an extravagant and unnecessary manner or makes scandalous allegations in respect of the victim (<span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span> at [64(c)]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Third, I did not think that the mere fact that an accused had committed multiple offences in the course of a single transaction necessarily amounted to an aggravating factor leading to an enhancement of the individual sentence. In the case of Ridhwan, two of the three sentences would run consecutively as provided under the law. Bearing in mind the totality principle, I saw no reason to enhance the individual sentences.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Given the absence of any significant mitigating or aggravating offender-specific factors, I was of the view that an appropriate sentence would be 12 years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane for both the 2nd and 4th Charges.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 I would add that the Prosecution also submitted that the sentence for both the 2nd and 4th Charges ought to be higher than those meted out to Muhammad Fadly Bin Abdull Wahab (“Fadly”).

</div>
</div> The Defence took the position that the sentence should be lower than the ten years’ imprisonment and six months of the cane which the accused in <span class="font-italic">Chua Hock Leong </span>received as Asep’s actions were less culpable.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Application of the Pram Nair framework to digital-anal penetration offences</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Dealing first with the 1st Charge (digital-anal penetration), I did not agree with the Prosecution that the <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span>framework should be calibrated downward because digital-anal penetration was the least severe form of the penetration offences. A careful perusal of the decision in <span class="font-italic">BMD</span> makes it clear that Tay J’s comments did not state that digital-anal penetration was less severe than digital-vaginal penetration. Rather, his comments sought to compare digital-anal penetration specifically against penile-vaginal penetration, fellatio and penile-anal penetration. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 I was of the view that there was no valid reason to draw any distinction between digital-anal and digital-vaginal penetration as both acts involve a similar violation of the victim’s bodily integrity. I was thus of the view that the <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span>framework should be applied to digital-anal penetration without modification.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 I also understood that in <span class="font-italic">BPH v Public Prosecutor </span>(Criminal Appeal No 29 of 2018), the Court of Appeal expressed the view that there was no material distinction between digital-vaginal and digital-anal penetration in terms of the severity of each offence. While the Court of Appeal indicated that written grounds for that case would eventually be issued, they were not available as of the date of my sentencing decision in these proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 I have already set out my reasons (see [21]–[28] above) for disagreeing with the Prosecution’s submissions that the physical and emotional harm caused to the Complainant was an offence-specific aggravating factor (this also applies to the 6th Charge below). At the first stage of the <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span>framework, Ridhwan’s actions thus fell in the middle to upper range of Band 1, with an indicative sentence of eight to nine years’ imprisonment and four strokes of the cane. Since there were no aggravating or mitigating factors to be taken into account at the second stage of the <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span>framework (see [30]–[58] above), I was of the view that an appropriate sentence for the 1st Charge would be eight years’ imprisonment and four strokes of the cane (digital-anal penetration).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Application of the Pram Nair framework to fellatio offences</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Turning to the 6th Charge (fellatio), I disagreed with the Defence’s suggestion that the <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span>framework was inapplicable to fellatio offences following the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Chua Hock Leong</span>. The Court of Appeal did not rule out the applicability of the benchmarks laid down in <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span>to fellatio offences, but rather mentioned that it did not find the case to be an appropriate one to deal with the issue (<span class="font-italic">Chua Hock Leong </span>at [10]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 However, I also found the Prosecution’s submission, that the sentencing bands in <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair</span> should be adjusted upward to reflect the relative severity of fellatio offences, not entirely consistent with other High Court decisions on the same issue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 In <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Tan Meng Soon Bernard </span>[2019] 3 SLR 1146 (“<span class="font-italic">Bernard Tan</span>”), Valerie Thean J considered the applicability of the <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span>framework to fellatio offences and concluded that the sentencing bands in <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span>were a useful point of reference and that it was unnecessary to recalibrate the sentencing bands for different sexual penetration offences (<span class="font-italic">Bernard Tan</span> at [36]). After considering the post-2008 amendments to the Penal Code, which grouped various types of non-consensual sexual penetration together and prescribed a single sentencing range in s 376 of the Penal Code, Thean J opined that it may be less practical to have multiple sentencing frameworks for different sexual penetration offences within s 376 of the Penal Code, and that it might be more useful to recognise the <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span>bands as broadly applicable (<span class="font-italic">Bernard Tan</span> at [25]–[27], [31]). The seriousness of a particular sexual penetration offence was a factor which could be considered as part of the offence-specific aggravating and mitigating factors in a case, with “the harm, and therefore the sentence, in each case, [depending] on the full context, of which the specific sexual act [was] only one aspect” (<span class="font-italic">Bernard Tan</span> at [30]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Thean J’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Bernard Tan </span>was cited with approval by Hoo Sheau Peng J in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v BVZ </span>[2019] SGHC 83 (“<span class="font-italic">BVZ</span>”) (at [52]).  The accused in <span class="font-italic">BVZ </span>had, amongst other things, committed fellatio offences against one of the victims in the case. Hoo J agreed with the view of Thean J in <span class="font-italic">Bernard Tan</span> and proceeded to apply the <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span>framework to the fellatio offences. However, Hoo J found that the humiliating nature of forced fellatio and the risk of the victim contracting sexually transmitted diseases were offence-specific aggravating factor at the first stage of the <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span>framework (<span class="font-italic">BVZ</span> at [56]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 In other words, both Thean J and Hoo J were not using the severity of a particular sexual offence to adjust the sentencing bands in <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair</span>. Rather, they took into account the severity as an aggravating factor, where appropriate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 I agreed with the view of Thean J in <span class="font-italic">Bernard Tan</span> that the sentencing bands in <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span>were still a useful reference point in determining the appropriate sentence for sexual penetration offences under s 376 of the Penal Code which did not involve digital-vaginal penetration. Given the considerable number of ways in which sexual penetration offences may manifest, it did not seem appropriate to have different sentencing bands for each type of sexual penetration offence. Rather, the severity of a particular sexual penetration offence should be taken into account at the first stage of the <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span>framework as an offence-specific aggravating factor.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 Applying the <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span>framework, at the first stage, I was of the view that there were two offence-specific aggravating factors in relation to the 6th Charge (fellatio). The first was the fact that the Complainant was a vulnerable victim (see [27]–[28] above). The second related to the nature of the sexual penetration offence committed against the Complainant. Asep’s actions, in forcing the Complainant to fellate him, were both humiliating and further exposed the Complainant to the risk of contracting sexually-transmitted diseases. This placed Asep’s conduct at the higher end of Band 1 or the lower end of Band 2 within the <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span>framework, with an indicative sentence of ten years’ imprisonment and between four and eight strokes of the cane.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 This indicative sentence was in line with <span class="font-italic">BVZ</span>, the only other case applying the <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair</span> framework to fellatio offences under s 376(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and punishable under s 376(3) of the Penal Code.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 In <span class="font-italic">BVZ</span>, the accused person committed two separate fellatio offences against a 14-year-old victim under s 376(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Penal Code. In addition to the humiliating nature of the offence and the risk of sexually-transmitted diseases (mentioned above at [76]), other aggravating factors included that of a vulnerable victim, abuse of a position of trust, premeditation, and use of force (in respect of one of the offences). The offences were found to fall within Band 2 of the <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span>framework with an indicative sentence of 12 years’ imprisonment and eight strokes of the cane. After taking into account the accused person’s plea of guilt, he was sentenced to ten years’ imprisonment and eight strokes of the cane for each fellatio offence. The sentence was upheld by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">BVZ v Public Prosecutor</span> (Criminal Appeal No 19 of 2019). I understand that written grounds will eventually be issued by the Court of Appeal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 The offences in <span class="font-italic">BVZ </span>were clearly more aggravated than in the present case where there were only two offence-specific aggravating factors. This justified the lower indicative sentence of ten years’ imprisonment and between four and eight strokes of the cane.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 At the second stage of the <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span>framework, Asep raised three mitigating factors generally: (a) his youth

With respect to the degree of sexual exploitation, I agreed with the Prosecution that the present case was more aggravated than <span class="font-italic">Kunasekaran</span>. In <span class="font-italic">Kunasekaran</span>, there was no skin-to-skin contact with the victim’s private parts. This was in contrast to the present case where Ridhwan sucked on the Complainant’s nipples. To my mind, this was a higher degree of sexual exploitation which, taken together with the Complainant’s intoxication, placed Ridhwan’s actions in the higher end of Band 2 or lower end of Band 3 under the <span class="font-italic">Kunasekaran </span>framework. An appropriate indicative sentence would be 15 months’ imprisonment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 There was also the issue of whether caning ought to be imposed for the 3rd Charge.

In view of the lack of offender-specific aggravating or mitigating factors (see [83]–[87] above), I concluded that a sentence of six years’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane would be appropriate for the 7th Charge.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Sentences</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 At the sentencing hearing on 14 August 2019, I was informed that each of the accused persons was in remand for a period of time before being released on bail:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Ridhwan   -   47 days</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Faris       -   42 days</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Asep      -     2 days</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 Their respective sentences were thus adjusted downwards to take the remand period into account. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 The sentences for Ridhwan were as follows:</div><table class="table table-sm table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Charge</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Offence</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Sentence</span></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">1st Charge</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Sexual assault by penetration – s 376(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) punishable under s 376(3) Penal Code (digital-anal penetration).</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">•  8 years’ imprisonment.</div><div class="Table-Text text-left">•  4 strokes of the cane.</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">2nd Charge</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Rape – s 375(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) punishable under s 375(2) Penal Code.</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">•  11 years’ 10 months’ and 13 days’ imprisonment. </div><div class="Table-Text text-left">•  6 strokes of the cane.</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">3rd Charge</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Outrage of modesty – punishable under s 354(1) Penal Code.</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">•  15 months’ imprisonment. </div><div class="Table-Text text-left">•  3 strokes of the cane.</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 Since Ridhwan was convicted of three charges, I was bound to order at least two of the sentences to run consecutively under s 307 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed).
