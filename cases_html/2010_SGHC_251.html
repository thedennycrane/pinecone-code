        Choo Han Teck J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       In <em>Rockline Ltd and another v
                        Silverlink Holdings Ltd and another</em> [2010] SGHC 127
                    (“the Main Judgment”) I found in favour of the plaintiffs on the
                    failure of the defendants to issue the “SAP Notes”. Subsequently,
                    parties were ordered to submit on the appropriate remedies and reliefs. This is
                    my decision on the question of the reliefs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The plaintiffs sought an order for the Rockline
                    Note to be issued directly to Rockline, and for the Superon Note to be issued
                    directly to Superon. The plaintiffs also submitted that the effective interest
                    was 5.07% for the SAP Notes, which should be capitalised as principal. It was
                    also contended that the redemption premium was 20.28%. Further, the plaintiffs
                    took the position that the Rockline Note and Superon Note ought to have been
                    issued on 17 August 2003 and 27 November 2002 respectively. Apart from
                    the above, the plaintiffs argued that the Debenture and Share Pledge Agreement
                    (“the Security Documents”) should be declared as security for the
                    SAP Notes, and that AVL should be declared as holding the security as trustee
                    for the plaintiffs prior to its assignment to Overseas Holding Limited
                    (“OHL”). In this connection, the plaintiffs submitted that the
                    court ought to declare that the novation of the security was wrongful, and that
                    OHL was not a bona fide purchaser for value without notice. It followed that OHL
                    must be declared to hold the security on trust for the plaintiffs. Lastly, the
                    plaintiffs claimed damages from the defendants for, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, costs of enforcement, loss of chance to exit its investment
                    in Silverlink in November 2007, and damages arising from the loss of rights
                    pertaining to the non-issuance of the SAP Notes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The plaintiffs contended that the Rockline and
                    Superon Notes should have been issued on 17 August 2003 and
                    27 November 2002 respectively. The defendants’ case was that
                    SAP’s advisors had acquiesced to the deferment of the issuance of the SAP
                    Notes when negotiations on the Debenture Pledge Agreement (“DPA”)
                    were ongoing. They submitted that the interest as well as the redemption premium
                    should therefore have commenced after 4 November 2003 when the negotiations
                    failed. In any event, the defendants contended that Superon tendered its shares
                    in Argent only in June 2003, and an encumbrance on the said shares was cleared
                    only on or about 15 July 2003.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       In the Main Judgment (at [14]), I expressed my
                    doubts as to whether advisors to transactions such as the present one had the
                    authority to bind their principals. Looking at the evidence (or lack of it), I
                    am not convinced that the SAP entities (as opposed to their advisors) had
                    acquiesced to the deferment. However, I agree with the defendants that the
                    earliest date for Superon to tender its indirect interest in Silverlink would be
                    after the resolution of the encumbrance issue. In the circumstances, I find that
                    the Superon Note ought to have been issued on 15 July 2003, and the
                    Rockline Note on 17 August 2003. Accordingly, interest and redemption
                    premium would run from those dates.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       In the Participation Agreement involving SVAPF
                    and Argent, it was agreed that Silverlink would be allowed to block
                    SVAPF’s conversion notice provided that both Silverlink’s board and
                    shareholders had given their approval. In that event, the repayment date of the
                    SVAPF Note would be extended by two years from 30 June 2008 to 30 June
                    2010, and the annual redemption premium would be doubled from 10% to 20%.
                    Counsel for the plaintiffs submitted that the variations made in the
                    Participation Agreement ought to apply to the SAP Notes as well as the SVAPF
                    Note. I do not think so. First, the claims for enhanced benefits were not
                    pleaded in the present suit. Secondly, the amendments were made by way of a
                    separate agreement to which SAP was not a party.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>
                    Under the Rockline Repurchase Agreement (“RRA”), the Note to be
                    issued to Rockline was to be “a secured convertible note to be issued by
                    the Purchaser in substantially the form and substance of the [SVAPF] Note with
                    necessary amendments but otherwise ranking pari passu with the [SVAPF]
                    Note”. In my view, this meant that the SAP Notes were to be identical to
                    the SVAPF Note as at the time of the RRA. In the absence of any tag-along
                    rights, I could not see how the plaintiffs could have the benefit of someone
                    else’s side agreement to which they were not parties to and with which
                    they had no contractual right to tag-along. As for the plaintiffs’
                    submissions that Mr Thadani had confirmed on the witness stand that the
                    plaintiffs had been wrongfully denied the enhanced benefits and that the varied
                    rights were supposed to apply to the SAP Notes as well,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> the evidence in fact showed that
                    neither Mr Thadani nor Silverlink had taken any position in this
                respect.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Next, the plaintiffs argued that they could have
                    prevented the blocking of the conversion notice since one of the sub-conditions
                    to Condition 9 of the SAP Notes required their prior written consent before the
                    passing of any Silverlink shareholder’s resolution (which under condition
                    10.2 of the Participation Agreement is required to block a conversion). However,
                    I do not think that this could have assisted the plaintiffs. Being in a position
                    to prevent a conversion and being entitled to a binding variation are distinct
                    propositions. Further, I do not accept the plaintiffs’ claim that its
                    right to convert had any connection with the expiry date of the SAP Notes, the
                    two being separate considerations. The interest provided for under the SAP Notes
                    was on an “actual/360 basis” (see condition 4(C) of the Notes).
                    The plaintiffs submitted that this meant that the actual payable interest would
                    be 5.07%, and that the redemption premium ought to be 10.14%. Since the
                    plaintiffs’ pleaded case was for 5% and 10% respectively, they cannot now
                    ask for a higher effective rate of interest or redemption premium. Lastly, the
                    plaintiffs contended that interest ought to be capitalised. This was also not
                    pleaded. Apart from pointing out the obvious defect, the defendants also pointed
                    to the fact that no evidence had been put forward to show that the plaintiff
                    would have given a capitalisation notice to Silverlink if the SAP Notes had been
                    issued. Although this might have been an academic issue (as the SAP Notes were
                    never issued), silence and inaction cannot discharge the burden of proof. The
                    plaintiffs ought to have prayed for and proven their case for capitalised
                    interest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       I had found that AVL did agree to hold the SAP
                    Notes as nominee for SAP although there was no agreement on SVAPF Control. This
                    finding was necessary from an issue that arose at trial (see prayer 1 of the
                    Third Party Notice <em>i.e</em>. whether “it was
                    agreed [that]... Anchor Victory would hold and control the Superon Note and the
                    Rockline Note...”). The plaintiffs now seek a declaration that AVL held
                    the Security Documents as trustee for them. In this respect, the
                    defendants’ position was aligned with the plaintiffs as the former also
                    took the view that the plaintiffs “are protected by the security created
                    by the Debenture and Share Pledge Agreement”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> However, as pointed out by counsel
                    for the third parties, AVL’s involvement in these proceedings was limited
                    only to the Third Party Notice and the Statement of Claim filed by the
                    defendants. In other words, AVL had not been subject to any claim(s) by the
                    plaintiffs. In the circumstances, I agree with counsel that the declaratory
                    relief sought for by the plaintiffs should not be granted as that would
                    prejudice the third parties. It follows that there is no necessity for me to
                    decide on the substantive defences raised by AVL in its written
                    submissions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       OHL was a non-party to the action who had been
                    accorded “liberty to address the court on terms as the court may direct
                    at the end of trial”. In view of the latter directions, I was prepared to
                    hear OHL as to the appropriate remedies and relief. OHL, through its counsel,
                    made no submissions. In the plaintiffs’ written submissions, the latter
                    sought a declaration that OHL was not a <em>bona fide</em>
                    purchaser (of the security) for value without notice and as such, presently
                    holds the Debenture and Share Pledge Agreement on trust for the plaintiffs. In
                    this regard, it should also be recalled that the plaintiffs had opposed
                    OHL’s application to intervene in the action. It also follows that as in
                    the case of AVL, OHL had not been subject to any claims by the plaintiffs. For
                    the same reasons, no orders ought to be made against it. In any case, the
                    substantive defences raised by AVL must first be determined before any liability
                    on OHL’s part could arise.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The plaintiffs contended that they had suffered
                    damage that was beyond the value of the SAP Notes even if the principal,
                    interest and redemption premium due were eventually repaid. Their claims for
                    damages can be grouped under three broad categories: (i) Loss of security; (ii)
                    Loss of chance to exit their investment in Silverlink; and (iii) Loss of rights
                    under the SAP Notes.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">i.   Loss of security</p>
<p>The plaintiffs’ original (and pleaded) case was that Silverlink failed
                    to take steps to ensure that the SAP Notes would be secured by the Security
                    Documents (see para 49(c)). They now contend that Silverlink had breached
                    condition 10(A) of the SAP Notes by agreeing to the novation of the Security
                    from AVL to OHL, causing them to lose the security. The plaintiffs claimed for
                    costs of enforcement which they would now have to incur for having lost the
                    Debenture and Share Pledge Agreement as security<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>. The said condition 10(A) provided as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Company may not assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of all or any
                        part of its rights or obligations under the Note without the prior written
                        consent of the Noteholder.</p>
<p>In my view, the submission advanced by the plaintiffs was predicated
                    on the assumption that AVL held the Security Documents for the benefit of the
                    SVAPF Note as well as the SAP Notes. As I have indicated earlier, this issue was
                    beyond the court’s jurisdiction because AVL had not been subject to any
                    claim from the plaintiffs. While it appeared that the Security Documents were
                    intended to cover both the SVAPF Note and the SAP Notes, the questions of
                    whether the documentation in fact provided for them (which AVL disputes) and
                    whether AVL had agreed to hold the Security as trustee for the plaintiffs were
                    not issues in this action. In view of the aforesaid, I make no finding as to
                    whether the defendants are liable for wrongful novation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">ii.   Loss of chance to exit the investment</p>
<p>The plaintiffs sought damages arising from their loss of chance to exit
                    their investment in Silverlink together with SVAPF and Lee Hing in November
                    2007. They averred that SVAPF would not have been able to sell the SVAPF Note to
                    OHL without SAP’s consent to the novation, and SAP could have made it a
                    condition of their consent that OHL purchase the SAP Notes at face value and
                    buy-out Asia Atlas’ and Rockline’s shares in Silverlink. The
                    plaintiffs claim herein was essentially one for the loss of chance to sell their
                    shares (or those of entities related to them) in Silverlink. In <em>Auston International Group Ltd and another v Ng Swee Hua</em>
                    [2009] 4 SLR(R) 628, the Court of Appeal reaffirmed <em>Allied Maples Group Ltd v Simmons &amp; Simmons</em> [1995]
                    1 WLR 1602 in relation to loss of chance. In my opinion, the
                    plaintiffs’ claim for loss of chance failed as no evidence was led on the
                    issue, notwithstanding the fact that the plaintiffs already had the benefit of
                    counsel at the point OHL appeared. This strongly suggested that the
                    “chance” was a speculative one (as opposed to a substantial
                    one).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">iii.   Loss of rights under the SAP Notes</p>
<p>There was no doubt that the SAP Notes conferred a range of rights to their
                    holder. The plaintiffs averred that the loss of the general undertakings had
                    rendered them “financially blind”, while the loss of the veto
                    rights denied them the opportunity to influence Silverlink’s business
                    decisions and to protect their investment in Silverlink. Damages were also
                    sought for the loss of conversion rights. The loss of a right or undertaking
                    does not in itself entitle a party to substantial damages. One must prove, on a
                    balance of probabilities, that he or she had suffered damage as a result of the
                    breach. For instance, the loss of conversion rights must be attended by proof
                    that the plaintiffs would have exercised those rights if not for the breach, and
                    have incurred a loss for not being able to do so. Likewise, the loss of
                    “veto rights” resulting in an inability to influence business
                    decisions must also be matched with evidence of actual damage. As in the claim
                    for loss of chance, the plaintiffs did not lead any evidence to prove that they
                    had incurred any damage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     There was, however, an instance of loss of an
                    undertaking which entails greater attention. This relates to the US$40m pro-rata
                    rights issue at US$1 per share. It is the plaintiffs’ case that they have
                    the right to veto any Silverlink rights issue by virtue of Condition
                    9(B)(ii)(dd) of the SAP Notes, which essentially required the plaintiffs’
                    prior written consent. The plaintiffs submitted that they had been massively
                    diluted and that the defendants ought to pay damages on the basis that their
                    Silverlink shares were worth US$10 apiece (which was the price OHL paid earlier)
                    if not for the rights issue. The plaintiffs’ claim in this respect was
                    essentially one for minority oppression masquerading as a claim for loss of veto
                    right. It is clear that a separate claim ought to have been filed in which the
                    plaintiffs ought to have explained, <em>inter alia</em>,
                    why they did not take up their entitlement of the pro-rata rights. As far as the
                    SAP entities <em>qua</em> creditors (<em>viz</em> the SAP Notes) were concerned, the rights issue was no doubt
                    a positive development as US$40m had been injected into Silverlink by way of
                    additional share capital, thereby improving the prospects of recovery for all
                    creditors. No loss could possibly have flown from the rights issue to SAP in its
                    capacity as creditor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     For the above reasons, I find that that the
                    plaintiffs’ losses have not been proved, and they did not suffer any
                    damages beyond the value of the principal, interest and redemption premium. They
                    are each therefore entitled to only nominal damages of $100.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The last substantive issue pertains to whether
                    the defendants should be ordered to issue the SAP Notes. Specific performance is
                    an equitable remedy that is usually granted only when damages would not be
                    adequate. In the present instance, the plaintiffs contended that without the SAP
                    Notes, it would, <em>inter alia</em>, be difficult for them
                    to enforce the Security as a court is “not likely to be able to interpret
                    the provisions of the Debenture and Share Pledge Agreement”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> The plaintiffs also claimed that
                    without the SAP Notes, they remained unsecured creditors of
                Silverlink.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     First there was no reason to suggest that the
                    Security Documents could not be understood without the SAP Notes. Secondly, the
                    plaintiffs’ assertion that they would be rendered unsecured without the
                    SAP Notes was not consistent with the position they had taken against the third
                    parties. Their position against AVL was that the latter held the Security
                    Documents as trustee for the plaintiffs, notwithstanding that it was common
                    ground among all parties that the SAP Notes had never been issued. As such,
                    based on the plaintiffs’ own case, I saw no necessity in making any orders
                    in relation to the SAP Notes. Lastly, it had emerged that the defendants had
                    made an offer to pay the plaintiffs the principal sums on the SAP Notes as well
                    as furnish a bank guarantee for the contractual interest and redemption premium.
                    If the plaintiffs had accepted the defendants’ offer of security and
                    part-payment, which appeared wholly reasonable, the issue of security today
                    would largely be moot.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Pre-judgment interest (see s 12 of the
                    Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed)) and post-judgment interest (see
                    O 42 r 12 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev
                    Ed)) are at the discretion of the court. The defendants submitted that
                    pre-judgment interest (from 30 June 2008 onwards) should not be awarded as
                    they had earlier offered to pay the plaintiffs the outstanding principal sums as
                    well as furnish a bank guarantee for the interest and redemption premium. The
                    utility of bank guarantees in relation to pre-judgment interest was somewhat
                    limited as a party would still be kept out of his or her monies. However, the
                    offer to pay the principal sums upfront should entail a significant reduction on
                    the pre-judgment interest. In the circumstances, it would be fair to fix
                    pre-judgment interest for the principal sums at 2% per annum computed from
                    1 July 2008 to the day immediately prior to this judgment (based on a rough
                    estimate of the average 6-month US$ LIBOR from July 2008 to July 2010).
                    Pre-judgment interest for the contractual interest and redemption premium shall
                    be fixed at 5.33% per annum for the same stated period, while post-judgment
                    interest shall stand at 5.33%.</p>
