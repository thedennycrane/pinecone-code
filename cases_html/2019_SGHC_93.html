This was the reason why the accused agreed to assist Bai in collection of contraband cigarettes. The accused had believed Bai that it was about the collection of cigarettes. Bai had told the accused that a Malaysian man (who turned out to be the Malaysian man) would deliver to him two and a half cartons of contraband cigarettes.

When the accused went there to wait, the Malaysian man made the delivery. He passed to the accused a green plastic bag containing some brown bundles. The accused did not check how many brown bundles there were, and did not give the Malaysian man any money. The accused then went to Mei Ling Street, where an unknown Malay male (the “Malay man”) boarded his car, took the green plastic bag and passed him $200 as “coffee money”.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Defence’s Reply Submissions (“DRS”) at para 3.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> As asserted by the Defence, the accused was acquainted with Bai since 2008. The accused claimed that he believed and trusted Bai’s information because (a) Bai had previously informed him that he dealt in the business of contraband cigarettes; (b) Bai did not insist that the accused pay his debts due to him; and (c) Bai was a friend of the accused and his cousin, and the accused’s cousin had told him that Bai could be trusted. As a result of the accused’s belief and trust in Bai, the accused did not have any suspicion that the orange plastic bag contained anything else other than contraband cigarettes, so much so that he neither opened nor touched the bag to verify its contents for himself. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 However, these matters provided weak support for the accused’s strong claim of trust in Bai. During cross-examination, the accused admitted that he did not know basic details such as Bai’s actual name or his address. The accused only knew bare details such as Bai being known as “Azabhai”, Bai being a Singaporean who married in Batam, and Bai living somewhere in Bedok. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 In fact, the accused agreed that he was not close friends with Bai whether while in prison, at the turf club or between January and June 2016 (being the estimated period between the accused and Bai meeting at a wedding and when they next interacted during the <span class="font-italic">Ramadan </span>month). Viewed in this context, the fact that the accused conversed with Bai more frequently than with other prisoners in 2008 meant little. While at the turf club in 2014, the accused’s relationship with Bai was largely that of a customer and his (illegal) bookmaker. In 2016, the accused simply had once chance encounter with Bai in January, followed by an online interaction in the <span class="font-italic">Ramadan</span> month. Between these bouts of interaction, the accused lost contact with Bai. In other words, the accused’s interaction with Bai consisted of little more than what was borne out of circumstance, unlawful transactions and chance. It was doubtful that the accused trusted Bai to the degree he claimed he did.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 While the accused accepted that he did not know much about Bai at all, one key fact the accused <span class="font-italic">did</span> know about Bai was that Bai had a history of involvement in various illegal activities, ranging from money-laundering, illegal bookmaking and smuggling of contraband cigarettes. Despite this, the accused claimed that he never contemplated that Bai could also be involved in drugs trafficking. Nevertheless, the point is that the accused had the knowledge that Bai was a man who frequently resorted to illegal activities, and there were grounds for the accused to proceed with caution in his dealings with Bai. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 I turn to the accused’s other two reasons for his trust in Bai – that Bai did not insist on repayment of the accused’s debt, and that the accused’s cousin had known Bai since the 1990s and told him that Bai could be trusted. The former reason was illogical. While it might result in the accused feeling gratitude towards Bai, it did not explain any purported trust. As for the latter, I fully address it below, but for now it suffices to say that it was insufficient to explain the accused’s trust in Bai. Even if we disregard the fact that the Defence omitted to call the accused’s cousin to give evidence on the issue, the accused still failed to provide any reason why the accused could trust his cousin’s assurance that Bai could be trusted. The mere fact that his cousin knew Bai since the 1990s, without more, was inadequate. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Failure to mention important aspects of his defence in statements </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 At the outset, I must acknowledge that the accused maintained that he was informed that the bundles contained cigarettes, from the recording of his contemporaneous statement and throughout the investigative process. However, the accused omitted to mention the following points, which he raised for the first time at trial: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) During the first occasion, the recipient of the green plastic bag had allegedly confirmed that the bag contained cigarettes before accepting receipt; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) On the first occasion, another reason why the accused believed that the green plastic bag contained only cigarettes was that he had previously purchased contraband cigarettes which were packed in a similar brown packaging; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) One factor contributing to the accused’s trust in Bai was the fact that the accused’s cousin had known Bai since the 1990s and told the accused that Bai could be trusted; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The different reasons as to why the accused agreed to assist Bai on the first and second occasions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 It was unsatisfactory that the accused would omit to add these details in his statements, given their importance in explaining his belief that the delivery involved cigarettes, and his trust in Bai’s information. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Pieces of evidence that the accused relied on as confirmation of the truth of Bai’s information, namely the points at [28(a)] and [28(b)], were omitted. The accused explained under cross-examination that he had not mentioned the point at [28(a)] because he “[found] it not important because [he knew] Bai, but [he did] not know [the Malay] man”.

</div> However, it should have been apparent to the accused that these two points would have corroborated Bai’s alleged information – whether through verification of such information with the Malay man who received the green plastic bag, or with his past experience of purchasing contraband cigarettes packed in a similar brown packaging. They were therefore pieces of information that he should have raised in his defence to explain why he trusted Bai. I further note that the point at [28(b)] was also raised even more belatedly, at the cross-examination stage.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 As for the point at [28(c)] above, the accused explained that his omission to mention his cousin was because he was not asked about it, and he was not sure if it was relevant.

</div>
</div> it was still important for the accused to mention this aspect of his defence. Indeed, the recording officer would not know to ask about the accused’s cousin. The fact that these points were not mentioned in the accused’s previous statements, even though they were important to his defence, reveals a degree of embellishment involved in his evidence in court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 As for [28(d)], the accused’s evidence seemed to be inconsistent with the contents of his statements on why he assisted Bai on the two occasions. In court, he had claimed that the delivery on the first occasion was a pure favour for Bai, with no consequent offset of his debt. As for the second occasion, Bai agreed to offset some of the accused’s debt, but the accused did not know the quantum of the offset. The accused simply intended to ask Bai about the quantum after the delivery was complete. However, in his statement, it was not clearly stated that Bai said that he would offset some of the accused’s debt only in relation to the second occasion, and not for both occasions.

</div>
</div> Also, the accused did not mention why he agreed to help Bai on the first occasion. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 In any case, the accused’s account in court was unlikely. Even taking the accused’s account at its highest, on the first occasion, it defied logic that the accused would assume the risk of criminal punishment for delivering contraband cigarettes for nothing in return. This is especially since the accused and Bai were not close friends. As for the second occasion, it should have been important to the accused to agree with Bai on the quantum to be offset from his debt before embarking on any work, so as to ensure that any risk he took was worthwhile.  In fact, the accused admitted that it was important to him that his debt be offset.

</div> However, the accused did not ask Bai about this. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Given all of the above, I found his defence hard to believe.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Contradiction of key aspect of evidence    </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Moreover, I noted that the accused’s account was contradicted by SSSgt Tay’s evidence on one key aspect.

He thus never had sight of the three bundles within the orange plastic bag, and the first time he discovered that they were contained within the orange plastic bag was when CNB officers searched his vehicle.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 This account ran contrary to the clear evidence of SSSgt Tay.

</div> Upon being recalled as a witness, SSSgt Tay elaborated that since the orange plastic bag was separate from the three bundles, he had marked them as B1 and B2 respectively. This is in contrast with the contents of the orange plastic bag, the “Lexus” box, which he marked as “B1A” – to indicate that the box was within the orange plastic bag marked as B1.

</div>
</div> I found no reason to disbelieve SSSgt Tay’s evidence, and accepted that the three bundles were in fact located outside the orange plastic bag when they were found by SSSgt Tay. This is a significant matter. As the three bundles were left exposed on the floorboard, the accused would have caught sight of their appearance. Their round and irregular shape should have aroused suspicion that they contained something else besides cartons of cigarettes.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 When confronted with the possibility that he had seen the round shape of the three bundles, the accused insisted that he would still believe that they contained cigarettes, as it was possible that the cigarettes were repacked into smaller packets. This claim was not tenable. The accused had been given specific instructions from Bai to expect receipt of <span class="font-italic">two and a half</span> <span class="font-italic">cartons</span> of cigarettes. If the accused then caught sight of the three bundles, which he could not visually verify as being the expected two and a half cartons, I did not believe that the accused would still have proceeded to blindly accept receipt of the items while simultaneously relinquishing the $7,000 contained in the envelope to the Malaysian man.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Having reviewed the evidence in totality, I found that the accused failed to show any unique circumstances justifying the high level of trust in Bai, and I was unpersuaded that he relied on the information allegedly given by Bai. I should add that this finding was made in the context of the highly suspicious nature of the transaction involved. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 First, the envelope of $7,000, a substantial sum, was transmitted to the accused in a covert manner. Bai chose not to pass it directly to the accused, but instead arranged for it to be left in his letterbox. Next, the transaction that the accused was asked to assist in was one with some degree of complexity. Instead of getting the Malaysian man to deliver the “cigarettes” straight to the recipient at Mei Ling Street, Bai involved the accused in the process. The extent of trouble that Bai took to effect this delivery should have triggered the accused’s suspicion as to the value and nature of the goods involved. Third, as set out above at [36], the round and irregular shape of the three bundles would have raised concerns whether they contained cartons of cigarettes. For all these suspicious circumstances to be overlooked, and for the accused not to take any steps to enquire further into the nature of the contents of the three bundles, a high degree of trust in Bai would have had to be found. However, it was a degree of trust which was not borne out by the evidence of this case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 By the foregoing, I found that the accused did not successfully rebut the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA on a balance of probabilities. Accordingly, I found that the charge against the accused had been established beyond a reasonable doubt, and I convicted the accused.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Decision on sentence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Turning to the decision on sentence, the prescribed punishment under s 33(1) read with the Second Schedule of the MDA is death. However, the alternative sentencing regime in s 33B(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA provides the court with the discretion to impose a mandatory term of life imprisonment and not less than 15 strokes of the cane where (i) the offender satisfies the court that his acts fall within s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i)–(iv) of the MDA, and (ii) the Public Prosecutor certifies that the offender has substantively assisted the CNB in disrupting drug trafficking activities within or outside Singapore under s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 I found on a balance of probabilities that the accused’s role in the drug transaction was restricted to that of a courier, and fell within s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA. His involvement was limited to delivering the drugs. This was undisputed by the Prosecution.
