</div>
</div> I ordered the claimant, W. Power Group EOOD (“<span class="font-weight-bold">the </span><span class="font-weight-bold">Claimant</span>”), to provide security for the defendant’s costs up to the commencement of trial in the amount of $70,000.

SIC/SUM 13/2023 (“<span class="font-weight-bold">SUM </span><span class="font-weight-bold">13</span>”) is the Defendant’s application for the Claimant to provide security for the Defendant’s costs up to the commencement of the trial and the salient background facts are set out at [2]–[7] of the Judgment. I further ordered the security be provided by 6 October 2023.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The Claimant failed to provide that security and did not seek any extension of time to do so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 On 13 October 2023, the Claimant’s lawyers wrote to the Court indicating that they wished to make further arguments in respect of SUM 13 pursuant to O 21 r 15 of the Singapore International Commercial Court Rules 2021 (“<span class="font-weight-bold">SICC Rules</span>”) and s 29B of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1969 (2020 Rev Ed) (“<span class="font-weight-bold">the SCJA</span>”). The Claimant’s letter stated that it wished to make further arguments “on the issue of lack of evidence from the face of the materials before the Court that the Claimant has a good chance of succeeding hence the Court's finding that the parties' respective [cases] were not evenly balanced.”

</div> On 20 October 2023, I rejected the request for further arguments. I noted that the Claimant had ample opportunity to adduce any arguments on the issues raised in the request and in fact did so. There was nothing in the request that seemed to raise any new arguments or anything that could not have been raised at the hearing. I also directed the Claimant to provide its written submissions as to the quantum of the Defendant’s costs in respect of SUM 13 within seven days and also to provide submissions as to why I should not exercise my power under O 1 r 11(6) of the SICC Rules to dismiss the proceedings in SIC/OA 2/2023 if the security was not supplied by 6 November 2023.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Costs of SUM 13</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The Claimant filed submissions on 27 October 2023.

The submissions, whilst acknowledging that the Defendant had filed a supporting witness statement 119 pages long, a reply witness statement of 22 pages and that the Court had been referred to in excess of 15 authorities, stated the matter was relatively simple.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 It was not disputed that the Court ordered at the time of the transfer of the proceedings from the General Division of the High Court to the Singapore International Commercial Court (“<span class="font-weight-bold">the </span><span class="font-weight-bold">SICC</span>”) on 7 March 2023 that the costs incurred post-transfer would be determined on the SICC regime of costs (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, pursuant to O 22 of the SICC Rules). Where costs in the SICC are concerned, the principal underlying consideration is a commercial one of ensuring that a successful litigant is not unfairly put out of pocket for sensibly prosecuting its claim or mounting its defence (<span class="font-italic">BCBC Singapore Pte Ltd and another v PT Bayan Resources TBK and another </span>[2023] SGCA(I) 8 at [6]). As observed by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Senda International Capital Ltd v Kiri Industries Ltd </span>[2023] 1 SLR 96 (at [56]), O 22 r 3(1) of the SICC Rules makes clear the subjective basis on which costs are assessed in proceedings in the SICC. Order 22 r 3(1) provides: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">3</span>.—(1)  Without affecting the scope of the Court’s discretion in Rule 2(1), and subject to any provisions to the contrary in these Rules, a successful party is entitled to costs and the quantum of any costs award will <span class="font-italic">generally reflect the costs incurred by the party entitled to costs</span>, subject to the principles of proportionality and reasonableness.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Order 22 r 3(2) further provides an illustrative list of “all relevant circumstances” which a Court may have regard to in considering “proportionality and reasonableness” for the purposes of O 22 r 3(1).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 Although I agree the matter was not particularly complex, it seems to me in all the circumstances the Defendant’s submission that costs should be affixed at $6,000 inclusive of disbursements should be accepted. I note in that regard that Appendix G of the Supreme Court Practice Directions 2021 states the cost range for applications on normal list listings lasting 45 minutes or longer is between $4,000 and $11,000. Having regard to the work done by the Defendant in this matter and taking into account that the matter was heard in the SICC where a different cost regime applies in any event, I am of the view that the sum of $6,000 is reasonable.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Discretion under O 1 r 11(6) of the SICC Rules</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 The Claimant in its submission submits that I should not exercise my discretion to exercise my power under O 1 r 11(6) of the SICC Rules to make an order dismissing the proceedings unless the security is paid because it intended to file a request for further arguments and may appeal if the Court rejects its request.

Power Group EOOD (“WPG”) provides security of S$70,000 for Ming Yang Wind Power (International) Co. Ltd’s (“Ming Yang”) costs up to the commencement of trial in accordance with Order 1 of the judgment delivered on 29 September 2023 in SIC/OA 2/2023 (SIC/SUM 13/2023) (“SUM 13”), the proceedings are dismissed.

The defendant, Ming Yang, was a Chinese wind turbine manufacturer engaged in the design, manufacture, construction, sales and services of wind turbines in the global market. WPG and Ming Yang had entered into a joint venture agreement to establish a joint venture company for the purpose of developing two wind farm projects. In SIC/OA 2/2023 (“OA 2”) WPG claims Ming Yang breached its obligations under the joint venture agreement essentially by failing to secure financing for one of the two projects (the “second project”) and by withdrawing a performance guarantee for the same project. Ming Yang’s defence broadly speaking stated that certain changes to the legal and regulatory regime introduced by the Bulgarian government had negatively affected renewable energy projects such as the second project. Consequently, the second project was no longer viable and the parties had agreed not to proceed with it sometime in 2012.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">2. Ming Yang applied in SUM 13 for WPG to provide security for its costs of the proceedings. By a judgment delivered on 29 September 2023 the Singapore International Commercial Court (“the SICC”) ordered WPG to provide security for Ming Yang’s costs up to the commencement of trial in the amount of $70,000. The SICC further ordered the security be provided by 6 October 2023. </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">3. WPG failed to provide security and did not seek any extension of time to do so. </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">4. On 13 October 2023, WPG’s lawyers wrote to the court indicating that they wished to make further arguments in respect of SUM 13. On 20 October 2023, the court rejected the request for further arguments, noting that WPG had had ample opportunity to adduce any arguments on the issues raised in the request and in fact did so. The court also directed the parties to provide written submissions as to the quantum of Ming Yang’s costs in respect of SUM 13 and also to provide submissions as to why the court should not exercise its power under O 1 r 11(6) of the Singapore International Commercial Court Rules 2021 (“SICC Rules”) to dismiss the proceedings in OA 2 if the security was not supplied by 6 November 2023.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">The court’s decision </span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">5. This being a case transferred to the SICC, the court ordered at the time of the transfer that the costs incurred post-transfer would be determined on the SICC regime of costs under O 22 of the SICC Rules: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">5]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">6. While the court agreed that the matter in SUM 13 was not particularly complex, having regard to the work done by Ming Yang in this matter and taking into account that the matter was heard in the SICC, the court took the view that the sum of $6,000 inclusive of disbursements was reasonable: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">6]</span>. </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">7. WPG submitted that the court should not exercise its discretion under O 1 r 11(6) of the SICC Rules to make an order dismissing the proceedings unless the security is paid because it intended to file a request for further arguments and may appeal if the court rejects its request.
