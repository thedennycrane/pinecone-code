Edmund and Patty were the major shareholders. Edmund was then running an architectural firm, Metropolitan Office Experimental (“MOX”), while Patty ran an interior design company, Suying Design Pte Ltd (“SDPL”). Patty was planning to retire by 2012 or 2013 and the plan was for Edmund to continue to run the business. Unfortunately, the joint enterprise did not last long. The disputes that arose became intense and personal and resulted in the present proceedings in which both Edmund and Patty have made numerous allegations against each other. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 On 24 August 2015, Edmund commenced this action against SMSPL (the 1st defendant), SDPL (the 2nd defendant) and Patty. Edmund’s main claim was that of minority oppression against Patty, pursuant to s 216 of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the Act”). As against SMSPL, Edmund sought certain orders in relation to, among other things, the director’s fees and dividends that he had received as well as those that were outstanding. Edmund also sought orders requiring SDPL and Patty to, among other things, pay certain sums of money back to SMSPL. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 SMSPL counterclaimed against Edmund for, among other things, repayment of director’s fees and dividends received by Edmund, breach of director’s duties, and breach of duties of good faith and fidelity. SMSPL’s counterclaim also included conspiracy claims against Edmund and MOX (the 2nd defendant in the counterclaim), and against Edmund and Ms Chong Chin Fong (“Jazz”) (the 3rd defendant in the counterclaim). Jazz is Edmund’s wife and was, until the disputes started, a close friend of Patty.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 Initially, Patty’s counterclaim was for an order to authorise proceedings in SMSPL’s name or on behalf of it, against Edmund. After Patty filed her defence and counterclaim, SMSPL amended its defence to include its counterclaim against Edmund. Patty’s counterclaim is therefore moot save that Patty counterclaims for the costs of having had to raise her counterclaim.

A third meeting was held later, also in December 2011, in the presence of Mr Lim Chai Boon (“Chai Boon”), an architect and partner in another architectural company, Swan &amp; Maclaren Pte Ltd (“Swan &amp; Maclaren”). A fourth meeting was held in early January 2012 between Edmund, Patty, Chai Boon, and Ms Anita Chui (“Anita”), who owned an interior design firm, Chiu Design Associates Pte Ltd (“Chiu Design”). Anita and Chai Boon were long-time friends of Patty, and were invited to invest in SMSPL.

On 7 July 2014, Chai Boon’s shares (which had been paid for by Patty by then) were transferred to one Mr Shawn Lim (“Shawn”) who was then a director and an employee of SMSPL. Shawn resigned as an employee on 4 August 2014 and ceased to be a director of SMSPL on 13 August 2014. His 5% shareholding was transferred to Patty on 21 August 2014 and on 24 March 2015, Patty transferred 5% of her shareholding in SMSPL to Ms Martinez Gejane Siman (“Ane”), a former employee of SDPL.

Following the incorporation of SMSPL, all the employees of MOX and SDPL were transferred to SMSPL. Foreign staff nominally continued to be employed by MOX and SDPL as their employment passes were not transferrable. Chiu Design had ceased operations before SMSPL was incorporated.

In these proceedings, SMSPL and Patty alleged that the director’s fee paid to Edmund for 2012 was a loan and that it was agreed on 22 June 2015 that with respect to Edmund’s director’s fee for 2013, the outstanding amount of $265,000 would be loaned to SMSPL as working capital.

The dispute was over the treatment of amounts received by MOX and SDPL from pre-incorporation projects. Edmund alleged that all such amounts received by MOX and SDPL, pursuant to invoices dated after the Incorporation Date, were to be transferred to SMSPL (after deducting expenses incurred). Patty’s version was that MOX and SDPL would continue to own the revenue from all their respective pre-incorporation projects, but they had to reimburse SMSPL for any use of its resources (primarily manpower).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 During his oral testimony, Edmund clarified that there was no discussion on whether work that had been completed before the Incorporation Date but invoiced only after the Incorporation Date, should be treated differently.

There were no timesheets. Choon Geok testified that she would look at emails from and drawings by SMSPL employees, as well as the jobs they were working on, and estimate the amount of time spent on each job.

The difficulty in trying to compute the reimbursement amounts only testifies to the importance of keeping proper records of the use of SMSPL’s manpower if Patty’s version were true. The absence of such records testifies to the improbability of Patty’s version of the Oral Agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 In fact, not only were there no records kept of the use of SMSPL’s resources, Patty’s evidence showed that her version of the Oral Agreement was unlikely to be true. Patty testified that what SDPL and MOX had to reimburse SMSPL for were just the CPF contributions, salaries and bonuses of SMSPL’s employees who worked on MOX’s and SDPL’s pre-incorporation projects. This does not make commercial sense because then, SMSPL would be bearing SDPL’s and MOX’s shares of overheads, operational expenses and general office expenses, all of which Patty conceded were paid for by SMSPL.

I find it unbelievable that Patty, with all her experience, would have tried to assess whether SMSPL needed funds by merely looking at the incoming funds and expenses list, without considering what SMSPL’s cash balances were. In any event, assuming her evidence to be true, Patty was merely trying to balance the expenses against the incoming funds. Clearly, the question of whether SMSPL was short of funds or whether its cash buffer needed topping up, could not have been in her mind since she did not even look at SMSPL’s cash balances.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Further, if Patty’s evidence about maintaining a cash buffer is to be believed, one would expect the timing of the loans to correspond to times when the cash buffer was insufficient.

</div> A single cheque could have been issued for Edmund’s and Patty’s joint signature. Edmund was in the office then; Patty even claimed that he was within earshot. Since the withdrawal was for Patty’s gratuity and pay adjustment and Edmund had allegedly agreed to both, there was no reason for Patty to issue 24 cheques in order that Patty could sign the cheques without requiring Edmund’s signature.

</div> Clearly, if there had been an agreement to pay Patty $600,000 as gratuity or bonus, there would have been no need for the resolution to be backdated and neither would there have been any reason not to have asked Edmund to sign the same. Even if Patty wanted to backdate the resolution because the gratuity had already been paid, there was no reason to backdate it to 30 December 2014 which is some six months earlier than the alleged agreement to pay her the gratuity. Patty alleged that the resolution was suggested in late July by Ms Karen Ng (“Karen”) from M/s Karen Ng and Associates which provided book-keeping services to SMSPL.

Neither was there any agreement to pay her any pay adjustment. I agree with Edmund’s submission that after Edmund gave notice of his resignation, Patty moved quickly to withdraw $1,164,580 from SMSPL without Edmund’s knowledge. Patty achieved this by instructing Nisha to break the amount into 24 cheques each specifically drawn for an amount not exceeding her single cheque signing authority. Patty’s explanations about her gratuity and pay adjustments, as well as her reason for repaying $$492,580 to SMSPL, were all nothing more than afterthoughts. Patty had to repay the sum of $492,580 to SMSPL because she could not come up with any other reason to justify the payment of that amount to her.

</div> I reject Patty’s explanations. Accordingly, I find that these payments were also payments by SDPL of fees collected from its post-incorporation projects.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 Clearly therefore, not all of the debit notes were in respect of loans from SDPL to SMSPL. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 The amounts which Patty alleged to have been included by Nisha by mistake, add up to $243,212.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 In my view, the Debit Notes were just excuses for Patty to withdraw moneys from SMSPL’s account following Edmund’s resignation. As discussed above, only three of the Debit Notes related to loans from SDPL. Payment on the remaining six of the Debit Notes was therefore wrongful. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 As for the deductions for “drafting services” in the debit notes, I have found in favour of Edmund’s version of the Oral Agreement. There was therefore no basis for these deductions. In my view, the deductions for drafting services were just attempts by Patty made after the fact to support her allegation that under the Oral Agreement, SDPL and MOX were to reimburse SMSPL for use of SMSPL’s resources. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Denial / obstruction of access to SMSPL’s financial documents</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 I accept Edmund’s evidence that he was denied and/or obstructed from having access to SMSPL’s financial documents. First, it is clear that Patty did not welcome Edmund’s requests for SMSPL’s accounts. In her email dated 8 August 2015 to Edmund, she said “we do not understand why you are requesting to see [SMSPL’s] accounts. In the last three (3) years, you never manage[d] the accounts at all”.

Edmund’s requests to adjourn the directors’ meeting and the EGM were not acceded to. Edmund then sought and obtained an injunction to restrain SMSPL and Patty from removing him as a director.

</div> Patty argued that the word “advanced” meant it was a loan. In my view, this argument was contrived and unmeritorious. The payment voucher referred to a “director fee”. There was simply no reason why it could not have been described as a loan if it was intended to be a loan. Further, under cross-examination, Anita  explained that this was not a loan but a director’s fee, paid to Edmund earlier than Patty or herself.

</div> The evidence given by Patty and Mr Shen Jia Jun (“Shen”) (SD (Shanghai)’s financial controller) was not all that clear and at times seemed conflicting. Nevertheless, in my view, the more important point is that under the Oral Agreement, only fees invoiced after the Incorporation Date were to be paid to SMSPL. The invoices in Annex C1 were internal invoices from SDPL to SD (Shanghai). Therefore, Edmund has not discharged his burden of proving that the amounts in Annex C1 were in respect of invoices issued after the Incorporation Date. Accordingly, SDPL has no obligation to pay the amounts stated in Annex C1 to SMSPL pursuant to the Oral Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">170 As for Annex C2, this merely sets out a list of eight projects and their respective contract amounts.

</div> Shin was not cross-examined on this aspect of his evidence. I find therefore that the erroneous entries for the loan and the repayment were not because of any instructions given by Patty.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">202 In conclusion, Patty has not done anything wrong with respect to the loan from SMSPL in connection with her Bedok property, and was not responsible for the accounting entries in respect of the loan and the repayment.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Summary of findings of fact in Edmund’s s 216 claim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">203 The relevant findings are as follows: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Patty wrongfully paid herself the sum of $1,164,580 by way of 24 cheques, without Edmund’s knowledge. There was no agreement reached as to Patty’s gratuity of $600,000 or her pay adjustment for January to June 2015 amounting to $72,000. Although Patty has returned $492,580 to SMSPL, her retention of $672,000 was wrongful.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) With respect to the Debit Notes,</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) three debits notes (DN-001, DN-002 and DN-004) represented loans from SDPL to SMSPL. Payment to SDPL on these three debit notes was proper; </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) there was no basis for the remaining six debit notes to be issued to SMSPL. Patty wrongfully caused SMSPL to pay SDPL on these six debit notes; and</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) there was no basis for the deductions for “drafting services” and these deductions were just attempts by Patty made after the fact to support her version of the Oral Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Patty wrongfully denied Edmund access, and/or obstructed Edmund from having access, to SMSPL’s financial documents.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Patty had no basis to ask Edmund to repay his director’s fee of $200,000 for 2012 or to refuse, or cause SMSPL to refuse, to pay Edmund the sum of $265,000 being the unpaid balance of his director’s fee for 2013. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Patty’s reliance on the pleaded grounds for the adjustments to SMSPL’s accounts for 2012 and 2013, was not justified save for two adjustments to the 2012 accounts. In the circumstances, Patty did not act in good faith when she insisted that Edmund returned the dividends received by him for 2012 and 2013. However, whether Edmund (and the other shareholders) ultimately needs to return any of the dividends, received by him (and them) for 2012 and 2013, to SMSPL will depend on the adjustments to SMSPL’s accounts to give effect to the findings in this case. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) Patty wrongfully caused SMSPL to deny Edmund his salary of $4,063.35 for October 2015.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) Patty wrongfully excluded Edmund’s from decision-making in SMSPL.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(h) With respect to Annex A, SDPL has to pay $1,320,586.67 to SMSPL pursuant to the Oral Agreement. Patty breached the Oral Agreement by wrongfully refusing or failing to cause SDPL to pay this amount.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(i) With respect to Annex B, SDPL has to pay SMSPL the amounts of $1,545,904 (items 1–16, excluding items 4, 9 and 14) and $36,272.89 (as admitted by Patty for item 17) pursuant to the Oral Agreement. Patty breached the Oral Agreement by wrongfully refusing or failing to cause SDPL to pay these amounts.  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(j) With respect to Annexes C1 and C2, Edmund has not proved that SDPL is liable, under the Oral Agreement, to pay SMSPL any of the amounts in those Annexes.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(k) With respect to Annex D, Patty did not act wrongfully in causing SMSPL to incur GST.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(l) With respect to Annexes F1–F3 and G, Patty did not instruct Shin to accrue the amounts in those Annexes to her director’s account. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(m) The payment of $40,664 by SMSPL to SDPL as consultancy fee on 20 March 2013 was not wrongful. However, SDPL is liable to pay SMSPL the sum of $1,388 that SDPL has admitted was wrongly paid to it, and the sum of $48,333.72 being salaries that SDPL and Patty have admitted were wrongly billed to SMSPL.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(n) SMSPL’s payment of SDPL’s income tax and GST liabilities was with Edmund’s knowledge and approval. However, SDPL remains liable to repay SMSPL the total amount of $169,507.67 which was paid by SMSPL on its behalf. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(o) Patty wrongfully caused SMSPL to write off the sum of $194,290.08 in December 2014. SDPL remains liable to SMSPL for this amount.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(p) Edmund has not proved that there were wrongful set offs of purchases in advance against consultancy fees and collections from sales.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(q) The additional expenses incurred by SMSPL for rent, overheads and salaries after April 2016 were not wrongfully incurred.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(r) Patty has not done anything wrong with respect to the loan from SMSPL in connection with her Bedok property, and was not responsible for the accounting entries in respect of the loan and the repayment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">204 The question is whether the findings in (a), (b)(ii), (c)–(i) and (o) above are sufficient grounds upon which to grant Edmund relief under s 216 of the Act.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether Edmund’s s 216 claims are based on personal wrongs</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">205 Section 216 of the Act provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">216.</span>—(1)  Any member or holder of a debenture of a company or, in the case of a declared company under Part IX, the Minister may apply to the Court for an order under this section on the ground — </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)   that the affairs of the company are being conducted or the powers of the directors are being exercised in a manner oppressive to one or more of the members or holders of debentures including himself or in disregard of his or their interests as members, shareholders or holders of debentures of the company; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)  that some act of the company has been done or is threatened or that some resolution of the members, holders of debentures or any class of them has been passed or is proposed which unfairly discriminates against or is otherwise prejudicial to one or more of the members or holders of debentures (including himself).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2)  If on such application the Court is of the opinion that either of such grounds is established the Court may, with a view to bringing to an end or remedying the matters complained of, make such order as it thinks fit and, without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, the order may —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)  direct or prohibit any act or cancel or vary any transaction or resolution;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) regulate the conduct of the affairs of the company in future;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) authorise civil proceedings to be brought in the name of or on behalf of the company by such person or persons and on such terms as the Court may direct;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) provide for the purchase of the shares or debentures of the company by other members or holders of debentures of the company or by the company itself;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) in the case of a purchase of shares by the company provide for a reduction accordingly of the company’s capital; or </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) provide that the company be wound up. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">206 As a fundamental proposition, acts complained of under s 216 must affect the member as a member: Margaret Chew, <span class="font-italic">Minority Shareholders’ Rights and Remedies</span> (LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2017) at para 4.202. This is clear from the language used in s 216(1). A distinction has been drawn between acts which are wrongs against the company (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, corporate wrongs) and acts which are wrongs against the complainant shareholder (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, personal wrongs). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">207 The Court of Appeal has clarified the position under s 216. First, s 216 should not be used to vindicate wrongs which are in substance wrongs committed against a company and which are thus corporate rather than personal in nature. Second, in dealing with a s 216 claim that contains features of both personal and corporate wrongs, the key question is whether a plaintiff who brings an oppression action under s 216 instead of seeking leave to commence a statutory derivative action under s 216A, is abusing the process. In answering this question, the court is to consider the remedy sought, and the injury complained of and for which the remedy is sought. The appropriate analytical framework is as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Injury</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) What is the real injury that the plaintiff seeks to vindicate?</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) Is that injury distinct from the injury to the company and does it amount to commercial unfairness against the plaintiff?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Remedy</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) What is the essential remedy that is being sought and is it a remedy that meaningfully vindicates the real injury that the plaintiff has suffered?</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) Is it a remedy that can only be obtained under s 216?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">See <span class="font-italic">Ho Yew Kong v Sakae Holdings Ltd and another appeal</span><span class="font-italic"> and other matters</span> [2018] SLR 333 (“<span class="font-italic">Ho Yew Kong</span>”) (at [93] and [115]–[116]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">208 Where a s 216 action is based on conduct that constitutes both personal as well as corporate wrongs, the remedy should also address the corporate wrongs in order to bring an end to the matters complained of. Hence, it is usual to find claims for restitutionary orders in such cases. Where the <span class="font-italic">essential</span> remedy sought is one under s 216 (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, a buyout order or a winding up order), the existence of restitutionary claims in the s 216 action does not mean that the action is an abuse of the process. This is because any benefit that accrues to the company from the s 216 action is purely incidental to the essential remedy sought, which is to bring to an end the matters complained of on the fairest terms possible. See <span class="font-italic">Ho Yew Kong</span> at [128].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">209 As for the making of restitutionary orders, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Ho Yew Kong </span>noted (at [118]) that it has a wide discretion to fashion such relief as it considers just under s 216. This extends to making orders for the errant shareholders or directors concerned to make restitution to the company of moneys that they have wrongfully diverted from the company.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">210 Although the Court of Appeal referred to “errant shareholders or directors”, in principle, there is no reason why restitutionary orders may not be made against third parties. I note also that one of the cases cited by the Court of Appeal was <span class="font-italic">Lowe v Fahey and others </span>[1996] 1 BCLC 262 at 268, where the court held that </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…where for example the unfairly prejudicial conduct involves the diversion of company funds, a petitioner is entitled as a matter of jurisdiction to seek an order under s 461 for payment to the company itself not only against members, former members or directors allegedly involved in the unlawful diversion, but also against <span class="font-italic">third parties</span> who have knowingly received or improperly assisted in the wrongful diversion. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[<span class="font-italic">Emphasis added</span>.]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">211 Obviously, the claims against the third parties must be incidental to the essential remedy sought and the third parties must also be parties to the action. Most, if not all, of the facts supporting the restitutionary claims (whether against errant shareholders or directors, or third parties) would be the same facts relied upon as grounds for the s 216 action. Findings on those facts would have to be made regardless, and it is therefore appropriate that the restitutionary claims should be dealt with and orders made (f the claims are established) in the same action. It would be a waste of resources to leave such claims to separate proceedings to be commenced by or in the name of the company. In addition, dealing with such incidental claims in a s 216 action would, as the Court of Appeal recognised in <span class="font-italic">Ho Yew Kong</span> at [128], obviate the risk of multiple claims as well as the risk of prejudice to the shareholders and creditors of the company.    </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Applying the law to the facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">212 In my view, the following claims by Edmund are clearly in respect of personal wrongs and are therefore appropriate claims under s 216:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) That Patty wrongfully denied/obstructed his access to SMSPL’s financial documents.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) That Patty had no basis to ask Edmund to repay his director’s fee for 2012 to SMSPL and that Patty refused or caused SMSPL to refuse to pay Edmund the unpaid balance of his director’s fee for 2013.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) That Patty did not act in good faith when she insisted on Edmund returning the dividends received by him for 2012 and 2013.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) That Patty wrongfully caused SMSPL to deny Edmund his salary for October 2015.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) That Patty wrongfully excluded Edmund from decision-making in SMSPL.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">213 The following claims however contain features of both corporate and personal wrongs (“the overlap claims”):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) That Patty wrongfully refused or failed to cause SDPL to pay the amounts found to be payable to SMSPL, in relation to Annexes A and B. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) That Patty wrongfully paid herself the sum of $1,164,580 and subsequently wrongfully retained $672,000 after repaying SMSPL $492,580.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) That Patty wrongfully caused six of the Debit Notes to be issued by SDPL to SMSPL and that Patty wrongfully caused SMSPL to pay SDPL on the six debit notes.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) That Patty wrongfully caused SMSPL to write off the sum of $194,290.09 in December 2014.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In my view, the above constitute breaches by Patty of her duties as a director of SMSPL. As for SDPL, it was clearly controlled by Patty and Patty’s knowledge would be attributed to it. SDPL was therefore a knowing recipient of the monies that Patty wrongfully caused SMSPL to pay to it.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">214 In applying the analytical framework in <span class="font-italic">Ho Yew Kong </span>to the overlap claims above, the analysis is similar to that in <span class="font-italic">Ho Yew Kong</span>:  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The injury which Edmund seeks to vindicate is the injury to his investment in SMSPL caused by Patty’s breaches. In each of the overlap claims, Patty has misappropriated monies belonging to SMSPL, to either herself or her company, SDPL. These actions are in breach of Edmund’s legitimate expectation as a shareholder that SMSPL’s funds would not be siphoned away, and have a direct impact on Edmund’s interests as a shareholder in SMSPL. Patty also breached the Oral Agreement by wrongfully causing payment to be made to SDPL on the six debit notes. It would be commercially unfair to Edmund if the breaches are not remedied; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The essential remedy sought by Edmund is to exit SMSPL.

</div>
</div> The restitutionary orders sought against Patty and SDPL are necessary to ensure a fair value exit for Edmund. Any restitution received would go to SMSPL and increase the value of all the shareholders’ shares in SMSPL. Any benefit that accrues to SMSPL from Edmund’s s 216 action is purely incidental to the essential remedy which Edmund seeks, which is to bring to an end the matters that it complains of on the fairest terms possible.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">215 In my view, it was not an abuse of process for Edmund to pursue his oppression claims by way of an action under s 216. I also see no reason why restitutionary orders should not be made against both Patty and SDPL where the claims have been established.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether Edmund’s oppression claims satisfy the test of fair dealing</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">216 The common element in s 216(1) is that of unfairness: <span class="font-italic">Over &amp; Over Ltd v Bonvests Holdings Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> and another </span>[2010] 2 SLR 776 (“<span class="font-italic">Over &amp; Over</span>”) at [70]. The common test is that of “a visible departure from the standards of fair dealing and a violation of the conditions of fair play which a shareholder is entitled to expect”: <span class="font-italic">Over &amp; Over </span>at [77]. The standards of fair dealing or fair play that a shareholder is entitled to expect are not confined to observance of legal rights as enshrined in a company’s constitution or in shareholder’s agreements. Informal understandings and assumptions between shareholders may also be taken into account in determining whether the minority has been unfairly treated; such understandings may arise regardless of whether there is a quasi-partnership: <span class="font-italic">Over &amp; Over </span>at [84]; <span class="font-italic">Lian Hwee Choo Phebe</span><span class="font-italic"> and another v Maxz Universal Development Group Pte Ltd and others and another suit </span>[2010] SGHC 268 at [61].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">217 There can be no doubt that on the facts of this case, Patty’s actions have violated the standards of fair dealing and fair play that Edmund is entitled to expect. Patty breached the Oral Agreement; Edmund was entitled to expect Patty to comply with it. In addition, upon Edmund’s announcement of his resignation, Patty took steps to siphon off monies from SMSPL to herself/SDPL, issued multiple cheques so that Edmund’s joint signature would not be required, concocted a tale of project-linked loans, made baseless claims in an attempt to claw-back Edmund’s director’s fees and dividends, and denied Edmund access to SMSPL’s financial documents. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Order in respect of Edmund’s s 216 claim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">218 Edmund therefore succeeds in his claim under s 216.

</div> Patty’s services for 22 Dunbar Walk were rendered after SMSPL had been formed. In my view, Patty would have been more inclined to not charge Jazz after SMSPL was formed, given that Edmund had a 35% stake in the company and the plan was for Edmund to take over from Patty. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">346 Second, it is telling that despite the amount involved, Patty did not issue a fee proposal until 9 September 2015, after the commencement of this action. Not surprisingly, Jazz did not sign the proposal. The invoice itself was dated 9 July 2015, two months before the date of the fee proposal. Even then, the invoice was backdated; Jazz received the invoice in September 2015. Patty’s explanation that she held back on invoicing Jazz as she was waiting for Edmund to account for his involvement on the project, rings hollow.
