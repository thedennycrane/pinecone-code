In its natural and ordinary meaning, Statement 1 plainly states that the plaintiff had bullied the defendant by forcing the defendant to “do illegal deals” with her. This not only impugns the character and integrity of the plaintiff, but also indicates that the plaintiff is knowingly involved in illegal dealings and, further, forced the defendant to participate in these illegal dealings. Without a doubt, such allegations would tend to lower the plaintiff in the estimation of right-thinking members of society generally, especially because the plaintiff is a member of the legal profession, which Statement 1 itself takes pains to highlight. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Second, Statement 1 also explicitly identifies the plaintiff, stating her full name “Diana Foo” and the law firm that the plaintiff practises at, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, “Tan See Swan &amp; Co.”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Third, there is no question that Statement 1 was published as it took the form of a public post or review on LSS’ Google page.

The first “deal” refers to a 2017 investment agreement involving the transfer of US$80m from the defendant’s business acquaintance, a Mr Liao Cheng Wei (“Mr Liao”), into a Singapore escrow account opened in the parties’ joint names. In consideration for payment of the sum of US$80m, one Ms Encarnado Maria Cornelia (“Ms Cornelia”), a Filipino national who claimed to own 105 MT Gold (AU) Bullion held in a HSBC Singapore bank account, would transfer the gold to Mr Liao.

First, the defendant has not met her burden of proof to show that the Gold Deal was illegal. Second, even if the Gold Deal was illegal, the defendant has not proved that the plaintiff was aware of the illegality, or that the plaintiff forced the defendant to partake in the illegality. Third, the evidence before me indicates that on the balance of probabilities, it is more likely that it was the defendant and not the plaintiff who initiated and introduced the Gold Deal to the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 First, the defendant does not plead or particularise the illegal nature of the Gold Deal. At best, the defendant states that “the [d]efendant and Mr Liao realised that the investment agreement was <span class="font-italic">potentially </span>and/or actually a fraudulent arrangement and/or a scam [emphasis added]” because they were allegedly informed by a staff member from HSBC that HSBC does not maintain or operate any accounts holding gold bullion.

</div> The use of the word “potentially” is telling – even on the defendant’s own account, the defendant cannot be sure whether the Gold Deal was a fraudulent arrangement and thus illegal. I therefore ask rhetorically: how, then, can the defendant prove that the substance or gist of the offending words in Statement 1 is true? </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Further, the defendant led no evidence, apart from a bare assertion, that a HSBC officer Mr Ivan Ho had allegedly told the defendant and Mr Liao that “the Filipinos had no gold account in Singapore and that HSBC does not have a licence to deal with gold”, coupled with a copy of Mr Ivan Ho’s name card.

</div> For someone who expressed in no uncertain terms that “[the plaintiff] force[d] [the defendant] to do illegal deals with her” in Statement 1, the defendant’s admission is damning and, in my view, makes it difficult to accept that the substance or gist of the offending words in Statement 1 is true.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Second, even if the Gold Deal was illegal, the defendant has not proved that the plaintiff was even aware of such illegality, much less that the plaintiff forced the defendant to partake in the illegality. Again, the defendant led no evidence which even remotely suggests that the plaintiff was aware of the alleged fraudulent arrangement and/or scam, in that Ms Cornelia did not actually own any gold in a HSBC Singapore bank account. On the contrary, the evidence suggests that the plaintiff knew no more than the defendant did in relation to the gold allegedly owned by Ms Cornelia. On the defendant’s own account, it was not the plaintiff who had ties with and introduced Ms Cornelia to the defendant, but a man named Mr Steven Goh, who apparently introduced ”some Filipinos” to <span class="font-italic">both</span> the plaintiff and the defendant.

</div> The defence of qualified privilege recognises that there are circumstances where the law allows an individual to make statements which may be <span class="font-italic">ex facie </span>defamatory without incurring legal liability when there is a need for a particular recipient to receive frank and uninhibited communication of particular information from a particular source: <span class="font-italic">Peter Lim </span>at [163]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The categories of communications enjoying qualified privilege include the following: (a) statements made between parties who share a common or mutual interest in the subject matter of the communication; (b) statements made in the discharge of a legal, social or moral duty; (c) statements made in the protection of one’s own self-interest; and (d) fair and accurate reports of certain proceedings: <span class="font-italic">Peter Lim </span>at [164]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 The privilege is said to be qualified (as opposed to absolute) as the defence can be defeated where the plaintiff can show that the defendant was actuated by malice or has exceeded the privilege the law has granted: <span class="font-italic">Peter Lim </span>at [165]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The defendant would be regarded as having acted with malice if the defendant (a) was actuated by an improper or ulterior motive; or (b) did not believe that the statement was true or was reckless as to the truth of the statements: <span class="font-italic">Chan Cheng Wah Bernard and others v Koh Sin Chong Freddie and another appeal </span>[2012] 1 SLR 506 at [90]; <span class="font-italic">The Law of Torts in Singapore </span>at p 572. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether Statement 2 enjoys qualified privilege </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 I turn first to consider if the assertions made in Statement 2 would qualify as a communication that would enjoy qualified privilege.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 LSS is the body that regulates lawyers in Singapore and investigates complaints relating to the conduct of lawyers in Singapore. Therefore, as between the defendant and LSS, I am of the view that there exists a common or mutual interest in the subject matter of Statement 2, namely the plaintiff’s alleged professional misconduct in the course of the alleged solicitor-client relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant. As such, Statement 2 is capable of enjoying qualified privilege.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether the defence of qualified privilege is defeated by malice </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 In my judgment, Statement 2 was actuated by malice on the defendant’s part. Accordingly, I find and hold that the defence of qualified privilege is defeated. Let me elaborate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 The plaintiff and the defendant have had an acrimonious and litigious relationship since 2018, due in large part to the defendant’s failure to repay in full the loans given by the plaintiff and/or the judgment debt due to the plaintiff (see [5]–[6] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 In 2018, the defendant posted Statement 1 on LSS’ Google page, stating, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, that the plaintiff had forced the defendant to partake in illegal deals with her (see [7] above). I have found Statement 1 to be defamatory of the plaintiff. I have also concluded that the defendant could not show that the substance or gist of the offending words in Statement 1 is true (see [33] and [43] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 This is the factual context within which Statement 2 was made on 3 March 2020. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 In respect of paras 20–21 of Statement 2 (see [9] above), I am of the view that the defendant could not possibly have believed in the truth of her allegations, namely that the plaintiff had made unwanted<span class="font-italic"> </span>sexual advances towards the defendant and that the defendant had “rebuffed these advances”. I find it unnecessary to examine or comment on the nature of the relationship, if any, between the plaintiff and the defendant. However, I note that the contemporaneous evidence by way of text messages exchanged between the plaintiff and defendant shows that the defendant addressed the plaintiff as “dear”, “darling”, and “baby”, and both parties had exchanged similarly affectionate messages with each other.

</div>
</div> In light of the history of acrimony between the parties, I find that the only plausible explanation behind the defendant’s allegation against the plaintiff in relation to the assertion of unwanted sexual advances (and the underlying implication of “homosexual tendencies”), addressed to LSS, is that the defendant’s motive was to injure the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 The other allegations in Statement 2 (see [49(a), (b) and (d)] above) must also be seen in light of the context established above (at [62]–[63]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 In respect of paras 14–15, it is undisputed that the plaintiff and the defendant were friends when these loans were advanced by the plaintiff to the defendant.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> Therefore, it is not surprising that these loans were not recorded in any formal manner. In my view, the fact that the defendant has chosen to take issue with this only after their relationship has soured reinforces the finding that the defendant sent the complaint in Statement 2 to LSS with the motive of injuring the plaintiff, in retaliation for the legal actions that the plaintiff had instituted against the defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 With respect to para 18 of Statement 2 where the defendant states that the plaintiff had asked her to assist in a deal in Vietnam to “move money”, I note that this was not one of the specific issues raised by the defendant to LSS at para 30 of Statement 2 (see [59] above). The words “move money” connote that this was an <span class="font-italic">illegal</span> transaction with an element of possible money laundering (see [49(b)] above). Given the lack of relevance of this allegation to the investigation request made of LSS by the defendant as well as the defendant’s choice of words, this reinforces my finding above that the defendant sent the complaint in Statement 2 to LSS with the motive of injuring the plaintiff. That motive was malicious.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 As for the allegation in para 30 of Statement 2 that the plaintiff had used vulgarities against the defendant, this is true from the evidence adduced in the proceedings. Vulgarities were indeed frequently used by the plaintiff in her interactions with the defendant and the plaintiff also admitted that she did utter vulgarities during the telephone conversation between her and the defendant ([42] above). However, Statement 2 must be seen as a whole. In order to accurately ascertain the defendant’s motivations in sending the letter of complaint to LSS, Statement 2 should not be sliced and diced into separate and distinct allegations. In my view, this specific complaint by the defendant is <span class="font-italic">but one</span> of the manifestations of the defendant’s personal grievances against the plaintiff. I find that the raising of this allegation against the plaintiff was also actuated by malice on the defendant’s part to seek to maximise the injury or damage to the plaintiff’s career as an advocate and solicitor. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Finally, underlying the complaint in Statement 2 is the premise that the defendant was at the material time the client of the plaintiff. I find that on a balance of probabilities, the defendant could not possibly have honestly believed this to be true. This is apparent from the exchange between the defendant and the LSS Review Committee:

Thus, the motive behind Statement 2 was, in my judgment, one actuated by malice – as a form of retaliation against the plaintiff.
