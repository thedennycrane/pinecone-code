<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       In his Opening Statement, the plaintiff
                    interestingly characterised his claim as a case about “an investor, his
                    fair-weather bank and the bank’s broken promises”. However, as the
                    trial progressed, it became clear that the case by the investor was merely an
                    attempt to transfer the losses which he had suffered as a result of market
                    movements onto the bank. The plaintiff amended his case several times as to
                    where the fault of the bank lay and was still undecided how to run the case
                    until the trial began.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Essentially, the plaintiff alleged that the
                    defendant made a wrong margin call on 10 October 2008 when it required him
                    to clear the margin shortfall within the same day of the notice. The action was
                    initially commenced with several pleaded causes of action. However, on the first
                    day of the trial, the plaintiff obtained leave before me to amend his pleadings.
                    At the same time, he abandoned all his pleaded causes of action except for the
                    remaining claim for wrongful closure of his FX positions. It was the
                    plaintiff’s original pleaded case (prior to the amendment on the first day
                    of trial) that by reason of his margin shortfall, the defendant was entitled to
                    and ought to have closed his account three days earlier, on 7 October 2008.
                    In spite of his amendment, the plaintiff confirmed both in his Affidavit of
                    Evidence-in-Chief (“AEIC”) as well as on the witness stand under
                    cross-examination, that the defendant was indeed entitled to close his account
                    on 7 October 2008. In these circumstances, can the plaintiff maintain a
                    claim against the defendant for wrongfully closing his account on
                    10 October 2008 when it is his own evidence that the defendant’s
                    right to do so had accrued on 7 October 2008? Was this more than a
                        <em>“</em>margin of error” by the
                    plaintiff in bringing a claim against the defendant for allegedly making a wrong
                    margin call?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The plaintiff started his career as a lawyer. He
                    was a sophisticated and successful investor and by 1994, he had retired from his
                    law practice after having amassed a fortune in excess of United States Dollars
                    (“USD”) 70m from his investments. In the Account Opening form, the
                    plaintiff described himself as a “professional investor”. He came
                    across to the defendant as an “extremely savvy and knowledgeable client
                    who knows precisely what he wants”. He even gave the defendant
                    instructions on specific times for communication purposes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       In November 2007, the plaintiff opened two
                    separate accounts with the defendant, namely a Private Wealth Management Account
                    (“Advisory Account”) which held the plaintiff’s deposits and
                    loans in various foreign currencies and a Foreign Exchange (“FX”)
                    Gem Account which provided a platform for the plaintiff to trade in FX options.
                    Chin Mei Lin (“Cynthia Chin”) was the relationship manager of the
                    defendant servicing the plaintiff from January 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       In the Advisory Account, the plaintiff was
                    active in FX trades, particularly in “Carry Trade Investment
                    Strategy”. Under this strategy, an investor would typically borrow
                    currencies which offer low interest rates and convert them into other currencies
                    which offer higher deposit interest rates. In this way, the investor would make
                    a profit from the difference in the interest rates. This strategy is of course
                    subject to the inherent risks of currency fluctuations which could be to the
                    benefit or detriment of the investor. Early in the relationship, the defendant
                    had warned the plaintiff of the risks of over exposure to Carry
                Trades.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The plaintiff moved his deposits from accounts
                    he held with the other banks to the Advisory Account. By 11 September 2008,
                    the plaintiff had remitted a total of New Zealand Dollars (“NZD”)
                    120,101,937.38 and USD 3,040,000 to his Advisory Account with the defendant. A
                    total of Japanese Yen (“JPY”) 4,168,423,696 and Swiss Francs
                    (“CHF”) 36,027,548.42 in loans were transferred from the
                    plaintiff’s accounts with Overseas Chinese Banking Corporation and BNP
                    Paribas Private Bank respectively to the defendant. The plaintiff’s
                    deposits and loans in foreign currencies under the Advisory Account are
                    collectively referred to herein as “FX positions”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The plaintiff’s Advisory Account with the
                    defendant was healthy until early October 2008 when the exchange rates started
                    to move against him which resulted in a margin shortfall. The Advisory Account
                    entered into an “account shortfall” of around USD 610,000 on
                    7 October 2008. This meant that the Collateral Value assigned to the
                    plaintiff’s deposits (which is less than the actual market value of the
                    deposits) fell below the market value of the plaintiff’s liabilities. The
                    term “account shortfall” was used interchangeably with
                    “margin shortfall” by the parties. “Collateral
                    Value” is the value of the plaintiff’s collateral as determined by
                    the defendant. “Total Exposure” is the total sum of the
                    plaintiff’s liabilities under all the facilities extended to the plaintiff
                    by the defendant. The margin shortfall deteriorated to around USD 2.3m on
                    8 October 2008 and later in the same day to around USD 4m. While there
                    was a margin shortfall, the account was still in “positive equity”
                    which meant that the mark to market value of the plaintiff’s liabilities
                    was less than the market value of his assets. On 10 October 2008, the
                    margin shortfall deteriorated to around USD 5,460,370.02 which placed the
                    Advisory Account into “negative equity”. This meant that the mark
                    to the market value of the plaintiff’s liabilities exceeded the market
                    value of his assets under the Advisory Account. The plaintiff was duly appraised
                    of the margin shortfall at all material times.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The plaintiff informed the defendant that he was
                    unable to/or unwilling to deliver additional collateral to clear the margin
                    shortfall. On 10 October 2008, the defendant liquidated the
                    plaintiff’s FX positions by executing the following margin call
                    transactions:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">NZD 42,251,287.42 sold at a rate of 58.34

<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(e)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">USD 1,135,239.43 sold at a rate of 98.80 for
                            JPY 112,161,656</div>
<p class="Judg-1">As the Advisory Account was in “negative equity”, the
                    proceeds from the above transactions were not sufficient to cover the
                    plaintiff’s liabilities. On 13 October 2008, the defendant wrote to
                    the plaintiff claiming that a sum of USD 1,135,239.43 remained outstanding
                    from the plaintiff after the execution of the margin call transactions and
                    requested for payment of this sum. The plaintiff did not respond to this request
                    for payment at all.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Amendments to the plaintiff’s claims</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On 11 November 2008, the plaintiff
                    commenced the present action against the defendant to recover the losses he
                    suffered following the margin call transactions:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, the plaintiff claimed that he
                        had instructed Cynthia Chin on or about 23 September 2008 to proceed
                        with a conversion of NZD 50m to USD at a then favourable rate of 0.6920.
                        However, the defendant allegedly failed to proceed with the
                        plaintiff’s instructions. As a result, the plaintiff suffered an
                        alleged shortfall of USD 5,460,370.02 between the Collateral Value
                        provided to the defendant and the plaintiff’s Total Exposure in his
                        Advisory Account.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_b"></a>(b)     Secondly, the plaintiff also alleged that the defendant had
                        wrongfully closed out his FX positions in breach of the notice requirement
                        under the defendant’s terms and conditions as well as the grace period
                        which was purportedly promised to him. He claimed that the margin call was
                        only made on 10 October 2008 when the defendant required him to clear
                        his margin shortfall within the same day even though he was entitled to one
                        clear business day under the defendant’s terms and conditions
                        (cl 2.6 of the Master Agreement) and/or to a 48-hour grace period as
                        promised. The plaintiff informed the defendant that he was unable and/or
                        unwilling to remit additional collateral to clear the shortfall.
                        Accordingly, the defendant closed out the plaintiff’s FX positions at
                        the close of 10 October 2008 which resulted in the loss of all his
                        deposits with the defendant (estimated to be in excess of NZD 30m) and a
                        further sum of USD 1,135,239.43 due and owing to the defendant which forms
                        the subject matter of the defendant’s counterclaim.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_c"></a>(c)     Thirdly, the plaintiff alleged that the
                        defendant, in breach of its duty of care, provided an inaccurate or
                        unreliable computation of the margin shortfall in its letter dated
                        10 October 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Subsequently, on 24 February 2009, the
                    plaintiff amended his Statement of Claim. The plaintiff added details to his
                    claim that Cynthia Chin had failed to respond to his instructions on
                    23 September 2008. According to the plaintiff, on 23 September 2008,
                    he had sent an email to Cynthia Chin on a NZD transaction he wanted to carry
                    out. He wanted to convert NZD to USD in light of the general downward trend of
                    the NZD at that time. He issued an instruction to convert NZD 10m to USD if
                    the rate of 0.6933 could be reached. Cynthia Chin failed to respond and the
                    NZD/USD rate deteriorated throughout the day on 23 September 2008. The
                    plaintiff claimed that in view of the defendant’s expertise and resources
                    to monitor the currency market, the defendant had a duty to advise the plaintiff
                    that it was impractical or imprudent to hold on to the NZD/USD dollar order at
                    the rate of 0.6933.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The plaintiff also included an additional
                    ground against the defendant. The plaintiff alleged that upon the margin
                    shortfall on 7 October 2008, the defendant was entitled to and ought to
                    have closed the plaintiff’s Advisory Account so as to limit his
                    liabilities to the defendant. Additionally, since the plaintiff was a customer
                    with very substantial cash deposits with the defendant, the defendant had an
                    implied duty to monitor and manage the plaintiff’s Advisory Account
                    properly and to act to mitigate the potential loss to the plaintiff. The
                    plaintiff, however, deleted his claim based on cl 2.6 of the Master
                    Agreement though the claim under the 48-hour grace period was
                retained.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Subsequently, the plaintiff decided to revive
                    his claim based on cl 2.6 of the Master Agreement once again and on
                    1 December 2009 after having obtained leave before me , the plaintiff filed
                    Statement of Claim (Amendment No 2). The plaintiff deleted his claim based
                    on the defendant’s failure to close the plaintiff’s Advisory Account
                    on 7 October 2008 to limit his liability to the defendant and relied on
                    cl 2.6 of the Master Agreement to claim that the closure of the Advisory
                    Account and the consequent margin call transactions were
                unauthorised.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     On the first day of the trial, the plaintiff
                    abandoned the following pleaded causes of action against the defendant:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">alleged failure to act on his instructions of
                            23 September 2008 to convert NZD 50m into USD;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">alleged breach of duty in providing inaccurate
                            and unreliable computation of his margin shortfall on 10 October

<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">alleged failure by the defendant to advise him
                            not to maintain his order to sell NZD to USD at the exchange rate of
                            0.6933.</div>
<p class="Judg-1">The trial therefore proceeded only on the plaintiff’s sole
                    remaining cause of action <em>i.e</em>. the margin call
                    made by the plaintiff on 10 October 2008 was wrongful by reason of
                    cl 2.6 of the Master Agreement and/or the 48-hour grace
                period.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">When was the first margin call made by the defendant</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     This is a crucial issue for determination. The
                    plaintiff’s case that the defendant made a wrong margin call is entirely
                    premised on proof that the only valid margin call made by the defendant was by
                    way of a letter dated 10 October 2008 sent at about 11.15am. On this basis,
                    the plaintiff submitted that the defendant was not entitled to close out his FX
                    positions under the Advisory Account on 10 October 2008 because:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">he was entitled to 48 hours to “respond to
                            a margin call” as promised by the defendant;
                        and/or</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">he was entitled to at least one business day
                            notice to deliver the additional collateral as stipulated under
                            cl 2.6 of the Master Agreement.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     If the only valid margin call by the defendant
                    occurred on 10 October 2008 (which was a Friday) as alleged by the
                    plaintiff, then the earliest the defendant was entitled to close out the
                    plaintiff’s FX positions would be either first thing in the morning of
                    13 October 2008 (if the 48-hour grace period applies) or after 11.15am on
                    13 October 2008 (if cl 2.6 applies).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     However, if the defendant had made an earlier
                    valid margin call on either 7 or 8 October 2008, the plaintiff’s
                    submission would be rendered moot because even if either or both the 48-hour
                    grace period or cl 2.6 had applied, the FX positions which were closed out
                    at 8.00pm on 10 October 2008 would have been validly closed in any
                    event.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     It is the defendant’s case that it made
                    the following valid margin calls:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">by a fax dated 7 October 2008 wherein the
                            defendant informed the plaintiff that his “Collateral
                            Availability” under the Advisory Account had fallen into a
                            “negative of USD 610,000”;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">by a fax dated 8 October 2008 wherein the
                            defendant informed the plaintiff that his margin shortfall had increased
                            to USD 2,300,000; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">by letter dated 10 October 2008 wherein the
                            defendant required the plaintiff to restore the margin shortfall of
                            USD 5,460,370.02 in the Collateral Value by 5.00pm Singapore time
                            on the same day.</div>
<p class="Judg-1">From the above, it is self-evident that the plaintiff’s margin
                    shortfall had deteriorated from USD 610,000 on 7 October 2008 to
                    USD 5,460,370.02 on 10 October 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The plaintiff claimed that the only valid
                    margin call made by the defendant was by way of the letter dated 10 October
                    2008. The plaintiff submitted that the earlier communication did not amount to
                    margin calls.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The term “margin call” is not
                    specifically defined in any of the agreements between the parties. The
                    plaintiff, however, relied on Cynthia Chin’s AEIC that a margin call
                    occurs when the plaintiff is informed of the extent of the shortfall and is
                    asked to remedy it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     As for the fax dated 7 October 2008, the
                    plaintiff advanced the following submissions:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(a)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">the fax was not
                            an official communication from the defendant because it contained the
                            following notation:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">“This is not an official bank’s statement or advice and
                            is not a substitute for our official statements or advice. This summary

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(b)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">the fax did not specifically require the plaintiff
                            to restore the margin shortfall; and</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(c)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">in any event, by about 3.28pm on 7 October
                            2008 the exchange rates had improved and the margin shortfall had
                            resolved itself.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     As for the fax dated 8 October 2008, the
                    plaintiff repeated the same submissions save that sub-para (c) did not
                    apply on 8 October 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Did the plaintiff regard the faxes from the defendant dated 7 and
                8 October as “margin calls” which required him to take steps to
                clear the shortfall</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     It may well be that the faxes of 7 and
                    8 October contained the notation that they did not constitute
                    “official bank’s statement or advice…” and that they
                    did not explicitly require the plaintiff to clear the margin shortfall. It
                    remains necessary to examine the plaintiff’s responses to the
                    faxes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Counsel for the defendant drew my attention to
                    the evidence that the plaintiff was clearly aware that the above faxes
                    constituted margin calls which required him to take steps to rectify the margin
                    shortfall:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, the plaintiff admitted in his
                        AEIC that by reason of the margin shortfall of USD 610,000, the
                        defendant became entitled to close the account on 7 October
                        2008:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">19. On 7<sup>th</sup> October 2008, I was informed by
                            the Defendant that <em>my account had shortfall of USD
                                610,000</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">20. An account shortfall occurs when the value of my collateral, as
                            determined by the Defendant, is deemed to be less than my total exposure
                            in my currency trading account with the Defendant. The account shortfall
                            occurred mainly as a result of the Defendant’s failure to convert
                            part or all of my deposits into USD. If the Defendant insisted, under
                            the terms and/or powers it claimed to have based on the documents signed
                            by me, that I should convert all my deposits into USD in September 2008
                            I would be obliged to do – just like the many options I
                            traded.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">21. Pursuant to the terms of Defendant’s Service Agreement, the
                            Defendant should be entitled to close my account upon an account
                            shortfall.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">22. <em>Therefore, the Defendant became entitled to
                                close my account once there was an account shortfall of USD610,000
                                on 7<sup>th</sup> October 2008</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-2">The reference to USD 610,000 in para 19 and 22 of the
                        plaintiff’s AEIC was taken from the defendant’s fax dated
                        7 October 2008. However, the plaintiff claimed that the assertions in
                        his AEIC were made only with reference to the Service Agreement. While it is
                        true that the plaintiff did not refer to the Master Agreement in this
                        context, his omission to do so is most telling. Clearly, the plaintiff did
                        not regard that the defendant’s right to close out the FX positions
                        under the Service Agreement was curtailed in any way by cl 2.6 of the
                        Master Agreement. If it was otherwise, the plaintiff would have raised it.
                        It is simply not open to the plaintiff to “blow hot and
                        cold”.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_b"></a>(b)     Following the fax dated 7 October 2008, Cynthia Chin spoke to the
                        plaintiff at around 4.59pm. The plaintiff then instructed the defendant to
                        place a “Limit Order” to sell AUD 10,000,000 for CHF at the
                        AUD/CHF exchange rate of 0.8413 for the purpose of reducing the shortfall.
                        This was acknowledged by the plaintiff under cross-examination:</p>

                        defendant may not have expressly informed the plaintiff to clear the margin
                        shortfall, by the plaintiff’s own conduct, he was left in no doubt
                        that his account was in margin shortfall on 7 and 8 October 2008 and
                        that he was required to take steps and in fact took steps with a view to
                        clearing the shortfall by trading himself out of it. After all, the
                        plaintiff was a seasoned FX investor. He knew exactly what he was required
                        to do when his account fell into margin shortfall.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_e"></a>(e)     The validity of the margin call must
                        be determined at the time when it was made. On 7 October 2008 when the
                        defendant sent the fax, there was no doubt that the plaintiff’s
                        Advisory Account was in margin shortfall of USD 610,000. The fact that the
                        shortfall resolved itself later in the day at 3.28pm did not change the fact
                        that it was a valid margin call when it was made.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Based on the evidence, I find that the
                    defendant made a valid margin call on 7 October 2008 when the plaintiff was
                    informed that his account was in margin shortfall to the tune of USD 610,000. As
                    the margin shortfall deteriorated further, the defendant made further margin
                    calls on 8 and 10 October 2008. The plaintiff knew he was required to clear
                    the margin shortfall but unsuccessfully tried to resolve it with his
                    “Limit Orders”. On this finding alone, the plaintiff’s claim
                    must fail irrespective of whether cl 2.6 of the Master Agreement or the
                    48-hour grace period was applicable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the transactions were governed by the Master
                Agreement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     For completeness I shall also examine the
                    plaintiff’s case assuming that the only valid margin call was made on
                    10 October 2008. In this regard, it is relevant to consider whether the
                    margin call of 10 October 2008 was made in breach of cl 2.6 of the
                    Master Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The Master Agreement, together with the
                    Service Agreement and the Security Agreement, were all signed by the plaintiff
                    on 28 November 2007 when he opened the Advisory Account and the FX Gem
                    Account with the defendant. There is no dispute that the FX positions which were
                    closed out by the defendant on 10 October 2008 were under the Advisory
                    Account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The defendant denied that the Master Agreement
                    applied to transactions under the Advisory Account. The defendant submitted that
                    the Master Agreement only applied to options and derivatives trading under the
                    FX Gem Account where the defendant was a counterparty to the plaintiff in the
                    transactions.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The defendant submitted that for transactions
                    under the Advisory Account, the defendant was not the counterparty to the
                    plaintiff and therefore the Master Agreement did not apply to those
                    transactions. Furthermore, Cynthia Chin testified that if the plaintiff did not
                    wish to engage in options and derivatives, there would be no necessity to sign
                    the Master Agreement. This was not challenged by the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     On the other hand, the plaintiff correctly
                    submitted that the applicability of the Master Agreement is not dependent on the
                    type of account but rather the type of transaction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     It appears to me that the defendant’s
                    submission is neither supported by the terms of the Master Agreement nor by its
                    own conduct:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_a"></a>(a)     Clause 10 of the Master
                        Agreement specifically stipulated that the Master Agreement shall apply to
                        all Derivatives Transactions. The Master Agreement is not restricted only to
                        transactions under the FX Gem Account. Cl 10 provides, <em>inter alia</em>, as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Upon the execution of this Agreement and unless the parties to this
                            Agreement otherwise agree in writing by specific reference to this

                            evidence of the Transaction shall be deemed to be a Confirmation.
                                <em>“Derivatives Transaction” means any

                            which is a rate swap transaction, a swap option, basis swap, forward
                            rate transaction, commodity swap, commodity option, equity or equity
                            index swap, equity or equity index option, bond option, interest rate
                            option, <em>foreign exchange transaction</em>
                            … or other financial instrument or interest, or any other similar
                            transaction (including any option with respect to any of these
                            transactions) and any combination of these transactions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-2">Under cl 10, the Master Agreement applied to “any

                        Service and Security Agreements. Furthermore, it expressly applied to any
                        “Derivatives Transaction” which by definition in cl 10
                        would include any foreign exchange transaction.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_b"></a>(b)     Even if there is some ambiguity as to whether
                        the foreign exchange transactions referred to in the definition of

                        to derivatives involving foreign exchange, counsel for the plaintiff
                        helpfully pointed out that the standard form draft board resolution for
                        corporate clients who wish to enter into the Master Agreement clearly
                        contemplates that foreign exchange transactions are distinct from
                        derivatives:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(2) That <em>all foreign exchange and/or derivative
                                transactions</em> entered or to be entered into by the Company

                            conditions set out in the Master Agreement</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-2">It is therefore not restricted to only FX options or derivatives
                        as alleged by the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_c"></a>(c)     FX transaction is not specifically defined in the Master
                        Agreement. Unless otherwise stated, it should be given its ordinary meaning
                        and should encompass any transaction involving foreign currencies. The
                        principal activity of the plaintiff under the Advisory Account was
                        “Carry Trade Investment Strategy”. The plaintiff’s
                        deposits with the defendant were in Australian Dollars
                        (“AUD”), NZD, and USD. His loan currencies with the defendant
                        were JPY and CHF. In the absence of a contrary definition, I accept the
                        plaintiff’s submission that his deposits and loans in foreign
                        currencies with the defendant would amount to FX transactions within the
                        meaning of cl 10 of the Master Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_d"></a>(d)     From the evidence, it is clear that in managing
                        his “Carry Trade Investment Strategy”, the plaintiff would
                        place “Limit Orders” with the defendant to sell various
                        currencies at specific exchange rates for other currencies to pay down the
                        loan currencies. This is a clear characteristic of an FX
                    transaction.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_e"></a>(e)     The
                        defendant has also brought a counterclaim against the plaintiff in this
                        action for losses arising from the FX positions which were closed by the
                        defendant on 10 October 2008 under the Advisory Account. In bringing
                        the counterclaim, the defendant had in effect treated the plaintiff as the
                        counterparty in respect of the margin call transactions.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_f"></a>(f)     Finally and perhaps most
                        significantly, the defendant in its letter dated 10 October 2008
                        referred to both the Master Agreement and the Service Agreement in requiring
                        the plaintiff to take immediate steps to restore the margin shortfall. By a
                        subsequent letter dated 13 October 2008, the defendant also referred to
                        the Master Agreement and the Service Agreement when it informed the
                        plaintiff that it had closed the plaintiff’s FX positions on
                        10 October 2008. The defendant has not provided any explanation to
                        reconcile their reliance on the Master Agreement in their letters dated 10
                        and 13 October 2008 with their submission that the Master Agreement was
                        not applicable to the transactions under the Advisory Account. No evidence
                        was led by the defendant to explain away their reference to the Master
                        Agreement in the two letters.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     It may well be that the plaintiff was not
                    required to sign the Master Agreement if he did not wish to engage in options or
                    derivatives trading. However, the undeniable fact remains that the defendant did
                    require the plaintiff to sign and it was so signed. Furthermore, it provides no
                    explanation for the defendant’s own reliance on the Master Agreement in
                    the two letters to the plaintiff in respect of the FX positions under the
                    Advisory Account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     In these circumstances, it was hardly
                    surprising when counsel for the defendant acknowledged the sheer all
                    encompassing width of the Master Agreement in his Opening:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[T]hat <em>if you read clauses 9 and 10, it’s so wide
                            in its usual manner that it can include all sorts of

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Did cl 2.6 of the Master Agreement apply to the margin
                calls</p>

<p class="Judg-1">The plaintiff maintained that cl 2.6 was applicable to the
                    margin call since the Master Agreement applied to all FX transactions. However,
                    that alone does not inexorably lead to the conclusion that the margin call made
                    by the defendant on 10 October 2008 was necessarily governed by
                    cl 2.6.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     To understand the purport of cl 2.6, a
                    close examination of the clause is essential:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_a"></a>(a)     It entitled the defendant to require
                        the plaintiff to deliver additional collateral if the defendant should deem
                        for any reason that the existing collateral was
                    insufficient.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
                        entitlement to require additional collateral was to cover present or future
                        obligations of the plaintiff to the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_c"></a>(c)     The one business day notice was for the
                        plaintiff to deliver additional collateral of a type and in an amount as
                        required by the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_d"></a>(d)     Failure to deliver the additional collateral would
                        constitute an event of default which would entitle the defendant to
                        terminate all of the plaintiff’s transactions at its discretion
                        without further notice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     On the face of cl 2.6, the defendant was
                    entitled to require the plaintiff to deliver additional collateral even if the
                    account was not in a margin shortfall. This is clear from cl 2.6 which
                    entitled the defendant to require the plaintiff to bring in additional
                    collateral if the defendant should deem that the existing collateral was
                    insufficient for whatever reason. Furthermore, the fact that the additional
                    collateral to be delivered is to satisfy future obligations lends support to the
                    construction that cl 2.6 is applicable even if the account is not in margin
                    shortfall. When cl 2.6 was dissected in this manner, counsel for the
                    plaintiff candidly accepted that cl 2.6 would apply even when the account
                    was not in margin shortfall.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     It follows that when the plaintiff’s
                    account fell into margin shortfall between 7 and 10 October 2008, there was
                    no necessity for the defendant to rely on cl 2.6. It is important to
                    recognise that cl 2.6 is not designed to give the plaintiff time before the
                    defendant could close the FX positions when the account is in margin shortfall.
                    Instead, cl 2.6 confers a right on the defendant to require the plaintiff
                    to deliver additional collateral in such an amount if the defendant so requires.
                    The one business day notice only comes into play if the defendant should decide
                    to invoke cl 2.6 and not otherwise. Counsel for the plaintiff submitted
                    that while cl 2.6 would apply even if the account was not in margin
                    shortfall, it is nevertheless wide enough to cover a situation when the account
                    was in such shortfall.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The defendant submitted that it was
                    contractually entitled to close out the plaintiff’s FX positions under the
                    Advisory Account at any time and without notice. The defendant relied, <em>inter alia</em>, on the Service Agreement which provides as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Credit banking and foreign exchange facilities</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1.    We may (but need not) grant you credit banking and
                            foreign exchange facilities (“Facilities”) in accordance
                            with the terms of this Service Agreement and other terms as may be
                            agreed. All Facilities are made available on an uncommitted basis and
                            subject to the provision of adequate collateral. We may at any time and
                            from time to time vary, suspend or terminate any or all Facilities
                            without prior notice. In such event, all your Liabilities under the
                            Facilities shall become immediately due and payable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.    Any payment relating to the Facilities not made
                            when due shall bear interest at such rate as we may reasonably
                            determine. Such interest shall accrue and be calculated daily from and
                            including the due date until but excluding the actual payment date. Such
                            interest may be capitalised by us monthly, and itself bear
                            interest.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.    We have the right to determine the total value of
                            collateral we consider acceptable (“Collateral
                            Value”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4.    We may assign a lower Collateral Value to
                            collateral denominated in currencies different from the currencies of
                            our exposure to you to take into account our currency exchange rate
                            risk.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5.    The Collateral Value must not be less than 100% of
                            the Total Exposure [as defined below] at any time…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">6.    If at any time, the Collateral Value is less than
                            100% of the Total Exposure, we may exercise our Rights on Termination.
                            We may (but need not) allow you time to restore the Collateral Value to
                            more than 100% of the Total Exposure.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     It is clear that under the Service Agreement,
                    the plaintiff was required to ensure that the Collateral Value, which is the
                    value of the plaintiff’s collateral as determined by the defendant, must
                    not be less than 100% of his Total Exposure and if it is less than the requisite
                    100%, the defendant may terminate the transactions under the Advisory Account
                    without providing any time to the plaintiff to restore the shortfall. This was
                    not only undisputed by the plaintiff but was admitted to be so in his AEIC and
                    under cross-examination.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Although the defendant’s letter dated
                    10 October 2008 referred to both the Master Agreement and the Service
                    Agreement, it is clear from the language of the letter that the
                    defendant’s notice to the plaintiff to clear the shortfall (not to deliver
                    any specific additional collateral) was made pursuant to the Service
                    Agreement:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_a"></a>(a)     It specifically referred to the
                        requirement for the plaintiff “to maintain the value of the
                        Collateral pledged to us at not less than 100% of your Total Exposure to
                        us”. This mirrors the requirement under cl 5 (Credit banking and
                        foreign exchange facilities) of the Service Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_b"></a>(b)     Clause 2.6 would apply in a
                        situation when the defendant invokes the right to direct the plaintiff to
                        deliver additional collateral of a type acceptable and in an amount required
                        by the defendant. Not only was cl 2.6 not referred to, the letter did
                        not specify any amount which the plaintiff was required to deliver. It
                        merely required the plaintiff to clear the shortfall by either providing
                        additional collateral or reducing his Total Exposure to the
                        defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     On 10 October 2008, the plaintiff’s
                    margin shortfall reached a critical level. His account was then in negative
                    equity of about USD 1,054,612.74. This meant that if all the plaintiff’s
                    foreign currency deposits were liquidated, the proceeds would be insufficient to
                    repay the plaintiff’s foreign currency loans which he owed to the
                    defendant. In other words, on 10 October 2008, the defendant’s
                    ability to recover their foreign currency loans from the plaintiff was at risk.
                    This is to be contrasted with the plaintiff’s margin shortfall between 7
                    and 9 October 2008 which were still in positive equity. Although it is not
                    disputed that the defendant did not have additional rights when the account fell
                    into negative equity, it does not alter the fact that the defendant was entitled
                    to close out the plaintiff’s FX positions on 10 October 2008 without
                    giving time to the plaintiff since his account had been in margin shortfall
                    since 7 October 2008, be it negative or positive equity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Accordingly, on a true construction of
                    cl 2.6 read together with the defendant’s letter of 10 October
                    2008, I find that none of the margin calls including the letter of
                    10 October 2008 was governed by cl 2.6 of the Master Agreement. In
                    this connection, it should be recalled that cl 2.6 was originally pleaded
                    by the plaintiff’s previous solicitors to the effect that he should have
                    been given one business day to clear the margin shortfall. It was then deleted
                    by way of an amendment in February 2009. However, it was restored by way of a
                    further amendment on the first day of the trial by his current solicitors. Under
                    cross-examination, the plaintiff was not able to provide any coherent
                    explanation for his inexplicable “about-turns” on the
                    applicability of cl 2.6.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Clause 2.6 would not have assisted the plaintiff in any
                event</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     As I have already found that cl 2.6 did
                    not govern any of the margin calls, it is strictly not necessary to deal with
                    this issue. However, even if cl 2.6 was held to have been applicable, it
                    would not have changed the outcome.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Under cl 2.6, time begins to run when the
                    defendant requires the plaintiff to deliver additional collateral in an amount
                    required by the defendant. It is important to note that the one business day
                    under cl 2.6 is intended for a specific purpose i.e. time to deliver the
                    required additional collateral. The time allowed under cl 2.6 was not to
                    prevent the defendant from closing out the FX positions prior to the expiry of
                    the one business day notice. While the defendant did inform the plaintiff of the
                    shortfall and that he was required to clear it, it did not expressly direct the
                    plaintiff to deliver any specific additional collateral. It was for the
                    plaintiff to clear the shortfall which could be achieved by either delivering
                    additional collateral or by reducing his Total Exposure. The choice was the
                    plaintiff’s. He elected to reduce his Total Exposure with his
                    “Limit Orders” but they were insufficient to do so. In fact, the
                    shortfall deteriorated significantly in spite of the “Limit
                    Orders”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The plaintiff was in fact given more than one
                    business day to deliver additional collateral. Assuming that the margin call was
                    only made on 10 October 2008 as alleged by the plaintiff and taking his
                    case at its highest, it is not disputed that after the plaintiff received the
                    letter of 10 October 2008, Cynthia Chin informed him that the defendant
                    would allow him to deliver additional collateral by the following Tuesday on
                    14 October 2008 if he could provide a commitment that he would do
                    so:</p>

<p class="Judg-1">In this way, the plaintiff was effectively granted more than two
                    business days to deliver the additional collateral. The fact that the extension
                    of time was conditional on the plaintiff’s commitment did not alter the
                    fact that it was an extension nonetheless. After all, the one business day
                    notice under cl 2.6 was to enable the plaintiff to deliver the additional
                    collateral. If the plaintiff’s intention was to use the one business day
                    to deliver additional collateral, there would be no sensible reason for him not
                    to give the commitment. It was not unreasonable for the defendant to enquire
                    whether the plaintiff had any intention to do so. The plaintiff could well have
                    given the commitment to the defendant but to his credit, he testified that he
                    would only have done so if he was “hundred per cent sure” that he
                    could deliver the additional collateral. Since the plaintiff knew that he would
                    not be able to do so, the commitment was not provided to the
                defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Finally, the one business day notice under
                    cl 2.6 was to allow the plaintiff time to provide the additional
                    collateral. By his own evidence, he confirmed that he was unwilling and/or
                    unable to do so even if the time was extended to 14 October 2008. This was
                    admitted by the plaintiff under cross-examination:</p>

                    breach of cl 2.6 by the defendant even if it had applied. Ultimately the
                    one business day notice was to give the plaintiff time to deliver the additional
                    collateral. From the evidence, it is clear that the plaintiff had categorically
                    informed the defendant in no uncertain terms that he did not require the time to
                    do so.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     As I have already determined that a valid

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Counsel for the plaintiff, however, submitted
                    that for promissory estoppel, it is strictly not necessary to prove detriment.
                    It is sufficient for the plaintiff to prove that it would be inequitable to
                    allow the defendant to act in a manner inconsistent with the promise: see

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As for the third element, there has been some discussion as to whether
                        there must be “detriment” suffered by the debtor before the
                        creditor is estopped from going back on his promise. In this respect,
                            <em>Chitty on Contracts</em> (<a href="#p1_42">[42]</a> <em>supra</em>) at para 3-135, asserts that
                            <em>the better view is that detriment of the kind
                            required for the purpose of estoppel by representation is not an
                            essential requirement and all that is necessary is that the promisee
                            should have acted in reliance on the promise in such a way as to make in
                            inequitable to allow the promisor to act inconsistently with
                            it</em>. <em>Chitty on Contracts</em> also
                        states that by making the payment, a debtor would act in reliance on the
                        creditor’s promise and so make it <em>prima
                            facie</em> inequitable for the creditor to peremptorily go back on
                        his promise.</p>

<p class="Judg-1">The Court of Appeal upheld her decision (judgment reported at [2007]
                    3 SLR(R) 592) but on the issue of detriment, it left the question open
                    when it observed:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In this appeal, counsel for the appellants has not challenged the
                        correctness of the Judge’s ruling on the third condition. It is
                        therefore not necessary for us to enter into this controversy without the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     The leading case referred to by <em>Chitty on Contracts</em> (30<sup>th</sup> Ed)
                    para 3-094 for the proposition that the doctrine can apply in the absence
                    of detriment is <em>W J Alan &amp; Co Ltd v E L Nasr
                        Export &amp; Import Co</em> [1972] 2 QB 189 at 213
                        (“<em>W J Alan</em>”). In <em>W J Alan</em>, the sellers agreed to sell two lots of
                    coffee FOB Mombasa at the price of “shs262/-...per cwt”. At that
                    time, Kenya shilling and sterling shilling were of equal value. The buyers
                    opened an irrevocable letter of credit (“L/C”) in sterling
                    shilling for the first shipment which the sellers accepted. When the cargo of
                    coffee was loaded for the second shipment, the sterling devalued. The sellers
                    rejected the L/C for the second shipment on the ground that Kenya shilling was
                    the currency of account for the contracts. The buyers, however, claimed that
                    their payment obligation had been discharged because the currency of account was
                    sterling and even if it was Kenya shilling, the sellers had agreed to vary
                    and/or waive the payment term by accepting sterling. The Court of Appeal in
                        <em>W J Alan</em> held that the sellers by
                    accepting payment under a sterling L/C had irrevocably waived their right to
                    receive payment in Kenyan currency. Waiver and promissory estoppel were treated
                    in the same vein. The following passage from the judgment of Lord Denning in
                        <em>W J Alan</em> is often cited in support of the
                    proposition that detriment is not essential for promissory estoppel:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A seller may, by his conduct, lead the buyer to believe that he is not
                        insisting on the stipulated time for exercising an option: <em>Bruner v. Moore</em> [1904] 1 Ch. 305. A buyer may, by
                        requesting delivery, lead the seller to believe that he is not insisting on
                        the contractual time for delivery: <em>Charles Rickards Ltd.
                            v. Oppenhaim</em> [1950] 1 K.B. 616, 621. A seller may, by his
                        conduct, lead the buyer to believe that he will not insist on a confirmed
                        letter of credit: <em>Plasticmoda</em> [1952] 1 Lloyd's
                        Rep. 527, but will accept an unconfirmed one instead: <em>Panoustsos v. Raymond Hadley Corporation of New York</em> [1917]

                            Fischer</em> [1960] 2 Lloyd's Rep. 340. A seller may accept a less
                        sum for his goods than the contracted price, thus inducing him to believe
                        that he will not enforce payment of the balance: <em>Central
                            London Property Trust Ltd. v. High Trees House Ltd</em>. [1947]

                        [1966] 2 Q.B. 617, 624. <em>In none of these cases does the
                            party who acts on the belief suffer any detriment. It is not a
                            detriment, but a benefit to him, to have an extension of time or to pay
                            less, or as the case may be. Nevertheless, he has conducted his affairs
                            on the basis that he has that benefit and it would not be equitable now
                            to deprive him of it</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     In <em>W J
                    Alan</em>, the buyers had relied on the sellers’ implied promise
                    that he could pay in sterling shilling. Consequently, the buyers did not
                    purchase Kenya shilling prior to the devaluation. In a sense, the buyers would
                    have suffered a “detriment” if the sellers were permitted to go
                    back on their promise since they would have to purchase Kenya shilling at a
                    higher exchange rate. Lord Denning sought to reconcile the previous decisions on
                    the basis that the parties in those cases did not suffer any detriment but were
                    instead deprived of the benefit if the promisor was permitted to resile from his
                    promise. It has been commented that Lord Denning was using the word
                    “detriment” in the narrow sense of either incurring a liability or
                    an expenditure: see Spencer Bower, <em>The Law Relating to
                        Estoppel by Representation</em> (LexisNexis
                        UK,4<sup>th</sup> Ed, 2004) (“Bower”) at

          <em>W J Alan</em>
                    was referred to by Grimberg JC in <em>Fu Loong Lithographer
                        Pte Ltd v Mun Hean Realty Pte Ltd</em> [1989] 1 SLR(R) 194
                    at 204. The learned Judicial Commissioner observed that there has been “a
                    divergence of judicial opinion as to whether the alteration in the position of
                    the party seeking to set up estoppel need result in detriment to him”.
                    After referring to Spencer Bower &amp; Turner, the learned Judicial Commissioner
                    equated detriment to mean “injustice to the promisee which would result
                    if the promisor were allowed to recede from his promise”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     The principal reason for the divergence of
                    judicial and academic opinion about the requirement to establish a detriment is
                    because the term “detriment” has not been used consistently: see
                    Bower at p 481. It has been used to describe:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_55-p2_a"></a>(a)     Expenditure of money and
                        time</p>
<p class="Judg-2">In <em>Yokogawa Engineering Asia Pte Ltd v
                            Transtel Engineering Pte Ltd</em> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 532,
                        the court held that the plaintiff was estopped from relying on the correct
                        version of the arbitration clause because the defendant had commenced
                        arbitration proceedings under the ICC Rules and had paid the sum of
                        US$30,000 to the ICC based on an outdated version of the general conditions
                        which was provided by the plaintiff. The court found that the payment of the
                        US$30,000 constituted “detriment”. Similarly in <em>Hartley v Hymans</em> [1920] 3 KB 475, the
                        buyer was found to be estopped from exercising his right to terminate
                        because by his conduct he had led the seller to believe that the contract
                        was still valid (even though the delay would have justified termination) and
                        the seller had incurred expenditure in preparation for future
                        deliveries.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_55-p2_b"></a>(b)     Incurring a liability</p>
<p class="Judg-2">In <em>Fenner v
                            Blake</em> [1900] 1 QB 426, the tenant represented to
                        the landlord that he wanted to vacate the premises midway during the
                        tenancy. Relying on the representation, the landlord sold the premises to a
                        third party. The tenant subsequently refused to vacate the premises and
                        claimed there was no consideration for his promise to quit the premises. The
                        court had no hesitation in finding that the tenant was estopped from
                        resiling from his promise to vacate the premises because the landlord had
                        incurred a liability in relying on the tenant’s promise by entering
                        into the sale and purchase agreement for the premises. In so doing, the
                        landlord had rendered himself liable to an action at the suit of the
                        purchaser if he was unable to provide vacant possession.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_55-p2_c"></a>(c)     Change of position</p>
<p class="Judg-2">The
                            <em>locus classicus</em> of this species of
                        detriment is none other than <em>Hughes v Metropolitan
                            Railway Co</em> (1877) 2 App Cas 439 (<em>“Hughes”</em>). In that case, the owner of the
                        freehold gave six months notice to the lessee to repair the premises. The
                        lessee, however, made an offer to purchase the owner’s leasehold
                        interest. Unfortunately, the negotiations which went on for some time did
                        not result in the sale whereupon the owner gave the lessee notice of
                        ejectment for failing to complete the repairs on time. The court found that
                        the owner was estopped from enforcing its strict legal rights because the
                        lessee had changed his position by relying on the owner’s implied
                        promise that he would not be required to repair the premises while the
                        negotiations were underway.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_55-p2_d"></a>(d)     Deprivation of benefit</p>
<p class="Judg-2">This has already been
                        covered in <em>W J Alan</em> in para 52-53
                        above. In <em>W J Alan</em>, the buyers through
                        the sellers’ conduct was led to believe that payment could be made in
                        sterling shilling. The court found that the sellers had irrevocably waived
                        the right to receive payment in Kenyan currency. If the sellers were
                        permitted to withdraw from the promise, the buyers would be deprived of the
                        benefit to pay in sterling shilling which by that time had devalued against
                        Kenya shilling.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Expenditure of money/time and incurring a
                    liability have often been described as “detriment” in the narrow
                    sense because in both these situations, the promisee <em>had
                        already</em> suffered the “detriment” in reliance on the
                    promise. However as for change of position and deprivation of benefit, the
                    promisee <em>would only</em> suffer the
                    “detriment” if the promisor is permitted to resile from his
                    promise. This is commonly described as “detriment” in the broader
                    sense.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     In my view, it will not be helpful to attach
                    labels to properly characterise “detriment”. The overarching
                    principle in each of these categories is that the doctrine has consistently been
                    held to apply in circumstances when it was inequitable either in the narrow or
                    broader sense of “detriment” for the promisor to resile from his
                    promise and to enforce his strict legal rights. This was after all the
                    foundation of the doctrine as developed in <em>Hughe</em>s:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">if parties who have entered into definite and distinct terms involving
                        certain legal results – certain penalties or legal forfeiture –
                        afterwards by their own act or with their own consent enter upon a course of
                        negotiation which has the effect of leading one of the parties to suppose
                        that the strict rights arising under the contract will not be enforced, or
                        will be kept in suspense, or held in abeyance, <em>the person
                            who otherwise might have enforced those rights will not be allowed to
                            enforce them where it would be inequitable having regard to the dealings
                            which have thus taken place between the parties</em> - per Lord
                        Cairns at 448 [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Accordingly, I will examine whether, on the
                    facts of the present case, it would be inequitable for the defendant to enforce
                    its strict legal rights under the Service Agreement if the plaintiff was in fact
                    promised a 48-hour grace period to respond to the margin call.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Curiously, in spite of the submission by the
                    plaintiff’s counsel that there is no requirement to prove detriment, in
                    the Reply and Defence to Counterclaim the plaintiff alleged that he had suffered
                    detriment:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">c.    The Plaintiff <em>suffered
                                detriment</em> when the Defendant reneged on this
                            promise/agreement as the Plaintiff was denied more time to restore the
                            alleged Shortfall and the benefit of more favourable exchange rates
                            anticipated by the Plaintiff to be the result of the G7 meeting which
                            was to take place over the weekend on11 to 12 October 2008. The
                            Plaintiff reiterate that paragraph 14B(b) of the Statement of Claim
                            (Amendment No. 2) and says that as at 13 October 2008, there would not
                            have been any alleged Shortfall. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Before analysing each of the three elements, I
                    should perhaps first deal with the defendant’s submission that the defence
                    only applies “as a shield and not a sword”. The plaintiff’s
                    reliance on the doctrine was to preclude the defendant from relying on their
                    contractual right to close out without notice under the Service Agreement.
                    Viewed in this way, there can be no dispute that it was indeed raised as a
                    “shield”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Was the promise made</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     The plaintiff claimed that he was promised by
                    the defendant’s managing director, Mr Torsten Linke
                    (“Mr Linke”) some time in July 2008 that the defendant would
                    grant him a 48-hour grace period to “respond to a margin call”.
                    According to the plaintiff, he was extended the preferential term of a 48-hour
                    grace period because he was regarded as an important client of the defendant.
                    This accords with the defendant’s call report dated 8 May 2008 in
                    which the plaintiff was described as a “key client” of the
                    defendant when he first met Mr Linke. Given the size of the
                    plaintiff’s deposits and his loans with the defendant, he would indeed be
                    aptly described as a “key” or “important” client of
                    the defendant. This is also in line with the fact that the plaintiff was granted
                    other preferential terms by the defendant such as attractive loan spread and
                    deposit rates.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     I accept the plaintiff’s submission that
                    the promise was made:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_62-p2_a"></a>(a)     Although the 48-hour grace period
                        was specifically pleaded and asserted in the plaintiff’s AEIC, the
                        plaintiff was not challenged on this point in cross-examination. In
                        para 33 of the plaintiff’s AEIC, he asserts, <em>inter alia</em>, as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">I was surprised by the unreasonably short deadline that the Defendant
                            gave me which contradicted what the Defendant represented to me and
                            agreed that I would be given the 48-Hour Grace Period to do so. I
                            recalled that in or about July 2008, in an official meeting in the
                            defendant’s office with the Defendant’s senior officers, Mr.
                            Torsten Linke (“Linke”), managing director, in the
                            presence of Ms Chin and 3 other senior officers (2 directors and 1
                            senior vice present) <em>(sic)</em> of the
                            Defendant, Linke promised me that the Defendant would grant me a grace
                            period of 48-hour to respond. It should be noted that the said 48-hour
                            grace period was not a conditional grace period (namely, no need to
                            undertake or promise to remit funds).</p>
<p class="Judg-2">The rule in <em>Browne v Dunn</em> (1896)
                        6 R 67 would preclude the defendant from submitting otherwise. See
                        also <em>Britestone Pte Ltd v Smith Associates Far East
                            Ltd</em> [2007] 4 SLR(R) 855 at [17].</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_62-p2_b"></a>(b)     The plaintiff also referred to the
                        promise of the 48-hour grace period during his conversations with Cynthia
                        Chin on 8 and 10 October 2008. Clearly the promise was not a fiction of
                        the plaintiff’s imagination or a “fabrication” as
                        alleged by the defendant:</p>

                        his evidence would not be favourable to the plaintiff on this issue: see

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Was it inequitable for the defendant to enforce its strict legal
                rights – Detrimental Reliance</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     The burden of proving detrimental reliance
                    remains throughout on the party raising the estoppel. In this connection, the
                    plaintiff alleged:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">that he relied on the promise and cancelled his
                            plans to remit deposits to other banks and in fact remitted additional
                            funds to his account with the defendant on 12 September 2008;

<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">that he suffered “detriment” in

                            benefit of anticipated favourable exchange rate over the weekend of 11
                            and 12 October 2008.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     The inquiry is not simply whether the
                    plaintiff had relied on the promise but whether the reliance had rendered it
                    inequitable for the defendant to go back on its promise and to enforce its
                    strict legal rights under the Service Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     For promissory estoppel, the reliance must be
                    linked to the “detriment”. In the present case, I agree with the
                    defendant’s submission that there is an obvious disconnect between the
                    pleaded reliance and the alleged detriment. The plaintiff alleged that he
                    remitted additional funds to the defendant some two to three months after the
                    promise. However, the plaintiff is not alleging that he suffered detriment in
                    transferring the additional funds. It was for the plaintiff to decide how and
                    what he wished to do with his deposits including the additional funds which were
                    remitted in September 2008. The plaintiff instead alleged that he suffered
                    detriment in that he was denied more time to restore the margin
                    shortfall.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     It is not the plaintiff’s case that if
                    the defendant had not resiled from its promise, he would have been ready,
                    willing and able to deliver additional collateral to clear the shortfall within
                    the 48-hour grace period. If that had been the plaintiff’s case, at least
                    there would be a causal link and a legal platform to mount a case on promissory
                    estoppel. However, the plaintiff did not pursue his case in this manner because
                    he knew it was against the weight of the evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     How could the plaintiff allege that it was
                    inequitable for the defendant to enforce its rights under the Service Agreement
                    (which has the effect of withdrawing the promise of the 48-hour grace period)
                    given his own evidence that he was unwilling and/or unable to do so even if the
                    grace period was extended to 72 hours up to 14 October 2008. The truth
                    is the plaintiff was given time to respond. His response was clear and
                    unequivocal:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Your response is very clear. You don’t have
                            money; right?</span></p>

                            it in because every account is like an independent ship;

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Yes.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in bold]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     The plaintiff was aware and accepted that the
                    defendant was indeed entitled to close his FX positions on 10 October
                    2008:</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Having accepted that the defendant was
                    entitled to close his FX positions on 10 October 2008 and the positions
                    were in fact closed on 10 October 2008, it would in fact be unfair for the
                    plaintiff to now raise promissory estoppel to challenge the validity of the
                    margin call transactions. This is all the more so on the facts of this case
                    since it is the plaintiff’s own evidence that the right to close out had
                    accrued on 7 October 2008 and that the defendant should have done so some
                    three days earlier. Accordingly on the evidence before me, I find that it was
                    not inequitable for the plaintiff to rely on the terms of the Service Agreement
                    to close out the plaintiff’s FX positions on 10 October
                2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Counterclaim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     Following the closing out of the
                    plaintiff’s FX positions under the Advisory Account on 10 October
                    2008, a balance sum of USD 1,135,239.43 is due and owing by the plaintiff to the
                    defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     Counsel for the plaintiff accepts that if the
                    defendant had the right to close out the FX positions under the Advisory Account
                    on 10 October 2008, it follows that the defendant’s counterclaim must
                    be allowed and I so order.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     Although the action started with several
                    pleaded causes of action, when the present counsel for the plaintiff took over
                    conduct, he elected to focus on what he perceived to be the plaintiff’s
                    “best shot”. This was probably a sensible approach. However, the
                    plaintiff, despite adopting a clinical approach to his remaining case, cannot
                    ignore the evidence before the court. In particular, he cannot disregard his own
                    evidence that he was aware of the margin shortfall since 7 October 2008 and
                    that the defendant’s right to close out his FX positions had accrued on
                    that day.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     By reason of the above findings, I hold that
                    the plaintiff’s claim fails at every level. First, at the threshold level,
                    I find that the defendant did make a valid margin call on 7 October 2008.
                    On that ground alone, the plaintiff’s claim must stand dismissed with
                    costs. Secondly, even if the margin call was only made on 10 October 2008
                    and not 7 October 2008 (contrary to my finding), cl 2.6 of the Master
                    Agreement did not govern the margin call and even if it did, it would
                    nonetheless not have assisted the plaintiff in the light of his own unequivocal
                    confirmation that he was unable and or unwilling to deliver additional
                    collateral to clear the margin shortfall even if time was extended to
                    14 October 2008. Finally, and even though I found that the 48-hour grace
                    period was promised to the plaintiff, the case based on promissory estoppel
                    would suffer the same fate for the same reason given the plaintiff’s
                    confirmation that he would not have been able to deliver the additional
                    collateral even if the grace period was extended beyond the 48-hour grace
                    period.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     The plaintiff’s claim is therefore
                    dismissed with costs to be taxed. The defendant’s counterclaim in the sum
                    of USD 1,135,239.43 is allowed together with interest and costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     As there is some overlap between the
                    defendant’s counterclaim and the plaintiff’s claim, I will only
                    allow one set of costs to the defendant to be taxed, if not
                agreed.</p>
