The plaintiff, who was the defendant’s friend and former colleague, was interested in becoming a shareholder in the defendant’s company but could not formally register his shareholding due to a contractual non-compete duty which he owed to his former employer. To circumvent this problem, the parties executed a trust deed creating an arrangement whereby the defendant held 50 shares in the company on trust for the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 Shortly after the execution of the trust deed, the defendant caused the company to issue 350,000 additional shares in his own name. The plaintiff contends that this was a breach of the terms of the trust deed, which provided, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, that the defendant could not increase the amount of the company’s share capital without the plaintiff’s agreement. He seeks equitable compensation for the loss which he has allegedly suffered from the dilution of his shareholding without his consent. The defendant counters that the plaintiff knew and approved of this share issuance, and/or that the plaintiff is in any event barred from relief due to the applicability of various defences. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 Having carefully considered the evidence and the submissions before me, I find that the plaintiff succeeds on the issue of liability but not on the issue of quantum as claimed. In the interest of fairness, I order that a separate assessment be held to ascertain the quantum of compensatory relief (if any) payable by the defendant to the plaintiff. The grounds for my decision are set out below.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Background to the dispute </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The plaintiff is a Swiss national who is currently working in Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The defendant is a Malaysian citizen who is presently working and residing in Malaysia. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The plaintiff and the defendant first met each other in mid-2011.

The relevant provision in this regard is s 47(2) of the EA, which defines an “expert” as “a person with such scientific, technical or other specialised knowledge based on training, study or experience”. This definition is generally applied with “considerable laxity”: while the expert must be skilled, he may be so by experience rather than by special study (see <span class="font-italic">Leong Wing Kong v Public Prosecutor </span>[1994] 1 SLR(R) 681 at [16], citing <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v </span><span class="font-italic">Muhamed bin Sulaiman </span>[1982] 2 MLJ 320). Nevertheless, the mere fact of experience will not justify a witness giving expert testimony unless that experience relates specifically to the matters in issue: see Jeffrey Pinsler SC, <span class="font-italic">Evidence and the Litigation Process </span>(LexisNexis, 6th Ed, 2017) (“<span class="font-italic">Evidence and the Litigation Process</span>”) at para 8.025. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 In the present case, the plaintiff holds himself out as someone who has extensive experience in the supply and distribution of medical devices, having been in the medical device industry for “more than 10 years”.

</div> I am thus of the view that he is unqualified to give expert evidence on the valuation of the Company’s shares. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 However, the inquiry does not end here. While it used to be the general rule that laypersons could not adduce opinion evidence unless it fell within the specific categories of lay opinion enumerated under ss 49–52 of the EA (see for <span class="font-italic">eg</span> <span class="font-italic">Sim Cheng Soon v BT Engineering Pte Ltd and another </span>[2007] 1 SLR(R) 148 at [22]), Parliament has since enacted a more general exception under s 32B(3) of the EA, which provides as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3)  Where a person is called as a witness in any proceedings, a statement of opinion by him on a relevant matter on which he is not qualified to give expert evidence, <span class="font-italic">if made as a way of conveying relevant facts personally perceived by him</span>, is admissible as evidence of what he perceived.

An example would be when a witness to a traffic accident may be allowed to testify that the driver involved was intoxicated, the witness’s opinion that the driver was intoxicated being inferred from what he had observed, for example the driver had blood-shot eyes, an unsteady gait and slurry speech. The opinion would provide clarity to the witness’ testimony.

This was evidently not a situation in which the plaintiff had given his opinion in order to express or communicate some fact(s) which he had personally observed. Rather, as the defendant asserts, the plaintiff had simply taken it upon himself to fulfil the role of a valuation expert by “pluck[ing] various different formulas off the internet (including from Google), and appl[ying] them based on his own understanding”.

</div> The product of the plaintiff’s calculations is, with respect, arbitrary and wholly unreliable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 As such, I agree with the defendant’s submissions that paragraphs 105–168 of the plaintiff’s AEIC are inadmissible for the purpose of assessing the quantum of the plaintiff’s claim. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Negotiation Evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 I now turn to the defendant’s objection to the admissibility of the Negotiation Evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 In <span class="font-italic">Koh</span><span class="font-italic"> Lau Keow and others v Attorney-General </span>[2014] 2 SLR 1165, the Court of Appeal opined (at [25]) that there is no absolute or rigid prohibition against the admissibility of extrinsic evidence for the purposes of construing a trust deed, particularly where such extrinsic evidence is objectively demonstrative of the settlor’s intent. However, the court did not have an opportunity to comment on the admissibility of evidence of <span class="font-italic">prior negotiations</span> in particular. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 In my view, guidance on this specific issue may be drawn from the realm of contract law. Of particular salience is the Court of Appeal’s pronouncement in <span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd v B-Gold Interior Design &amp; Construction Pte Ltd </span>[2008] 3 SLR(R) 1029 (at [132(d)]) that evidence of previous negotiations would only be admissible for the purposes of contractual interpretation if it is relevant, reasonably available to all contracting parties, and relates to a clear or obvious context. The Court of Appeal subsequently clarified in <span class="font-italic">Xia </span><span class="font-italic">Zhengyan v Geng Changqing </span>[2015] 3 SLR 732 that these requirements are likely to be satisfied with little difficulty where the plain wording of the contract is “extremely clear”, such that the evidence of prior negotiations “serves … a <span class="font-italic">confirmatory </span>(and, hence, complementary as well as subsidiary) function” (at [69]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 I see no reasons in principle against applying the above contractual principles to the construction of trust deeds. The interpretation of a contract begins with the same ideological premise as the interpretation of a deed: in both contexts, it is the objectively-ascertained intentions of the parties to the instrument which forms the cornerstone of the interpretative exercise. It is also apposite to note that English and Australian authorities have readily and consistently extended the principles governing the interpretation of contracts to the interpretation of deeds, including trust deeds (see for <span class="font-italic">eg</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Vandervell v Inland Revenue Commissioners </span>[1967] 2 AC 291 at 312; <span class="font-italic">Byrnes v </span><span class="font-italic">Kendle </span>(2011) 243 CLR 253 at [53]; Matthew Conaglen, “Sham Trusts” (2008) 67(1) CLJ 176 at 181). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Returning to the facts of the present case, I note that the defendant’s objection to the Negotiation Evidence rests primarily on his allegation that the Negotiation Evidence was tendered “for the purpose of changing and/or adding to the meaning of the words contained [in the Trust Deed]”. I am unable to agree with this submission. The plaintiff’s claim is premised solely on Clauses 3.3 and 3.4(b) of the Trust Deed, the plain wording of which clearly and unambiguously prohibit the defendant from increasing the Company’s issued share capital without the plaintiff’s consent. There is nothing in paragraphs 20–48 of the plaintiff’s AEIC which contradicts or detracts from this interpretation. If anything, I find that the Negotiation Evidence serves a <span class="font-italic">confirmatory </span>function in so far as it underscores the parties’ mutual willingness to consult each other on matters involving the Company’s share capital.  <span style="color: rgba(255,0,0,1)"> </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Further and in any event, I am of the view that the Negotiation Evidence satisfies the three <span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance </span>requirements. It is relevant because it illuminates the intended meaning of the Trust Deed. It was reasonably available to both parties as it had been contemporaneously documented in their e-mail exchanges with one another. Finally, it relates to an obvious context, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the circumstances surrounding the formation of the Trust Deed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Thus, I find that the Negotiation Evidence is admissible to support the literal meaning of Clauses 3.3 and 3.4(b) of the Trust Deed, and that it should be given due weight for this purpose.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Hearsay Legal Opinion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The only material statement in paragraphs 32–34 of the plaintiff’s AEIC is the plaintiff’s remark (at paragraph 33) that “[the plaintiff] could not hold shares as a registered shareholder in the Company as long as [he] was an employee of Sonova AG”.

The fact that the defendant’s relatives held (and continue to hold) a proportion of the shares in the Company, and the reason(s) behind this arrangement, have no bearing whatsoever on this claim. Further, the Scandalous Statements impute criminality and/or unethical character to the defendant and are thus inadmissible under s 54 of the EA, which provides that “in civil cases the fact that the character of any person concerned is such as to render probable or improbable any conduct imputed to him is irrelevant, except in so far as such character appears from facts otherwise relevant”.

I must clarify at the outset that, in my view, this inquiry is only relevant to the extent that it affects the <span class="font-italic">quantum</span> of relief that the plaintiff would be entitled to if he succeeds in his claim. It is <span class="font-italic">not </span>determinative of the existence of liability in the present case.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 To reiterate, the breach alleged by the plaintiff is the defendant’s failure to comply with the directions under Clause 3.3 read with Clause 3.4(b) of the Trust Deed by “increas[ing] the amount of the Company’s issued share capital” without the plaintiff’s consent.

As such, putting aside all potential defences and proof of loss issues, the only crucial question to be addressed in the present case is this: Did the plaintiff authorise the Share Issuance?

According to the defendant, this conversation had taken place while the defendant was updating the plaintiff on the Company’s challenges in relation to the acquisition of new customers. To address these concerns, the defendant purportedly suggested “raising the [Company’s] capital” so that he could “submit the [Company’s] financial information to all the new customer [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] for them to do the supplier due diligence”.

First, despite its obvious importance to the defendant’s case, the Alleged Oral Conversation had not been pleaded or mentioned in the defendant’s AEIC and only belatedly surfaced during the defendant’s cross-examination. When queried as to why this was the case, the defendant explained that:

As the plaintiff points out, the defendant had no qualms about referring to other oral discussions in his AEIC, despite the fact that he lacked documentary evidence to back up their existence. These alleged oral discussions include, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the defendant’s first meeting with the plaintiff in September 2014

</div> It is odd that the defendant did not raise the existence of the Alleged Oral Conversation when he had multiple opportunities to do so, especially since he had thought to mention significantly less material oral discussions in his AEIC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Secondly, the existence of the Alleged Oral Conversation was never put to the plaintiff during cross-examination. This is a violation of the rule in <span class="font-italic">Browne v Dunn </span>(1893) 6 R 67, which requires parties to put contradictory facts to a witness during cross-examination in order to give the witness an opportunity to respond to them. Consequently, I am entitled to regard the plaintiff’s evidence (that he was never verbally informed of the increase in the Company’s share capital) as undisputed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Thirdly, the contents of the Alleged Oral Conversation are unsubstantiated by any evidence apart from the defendant’s own assertions. In my view, the defendant has not shown himself to be a reliable or consistent witness. During cross-examination, he was able to recall the details of the Alleged Oral Conversation with apparent clarity, yet claimed to have lost all recollection of the extraordinary general meeting (“EGM”) during which the Share Issuance purportedly took place.

</div> It would thus be incorrect to suggest that the Share Issuance was carried out “in agreement with the instructions of the [plaintiff]”, pursuant to Clause 3.3 of the Trust Deed – after all, a person cannot possibly authorise or agree to something of which he had no knowledge at the material time. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 In these circumstances, I find that the defendant has committed a breach of Clause 3.3 read with Clause 3.4(b) of the Trust Deed. I now proceed to examine the defences which, according to the defendant, defeat the plaintiff’s claim in its entirety. These consist of both equitable defences (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, “unclean hands”, laches and acquiescence) as well as general defences (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, estoppel and waiver). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the plaintiff’s claim is defeated by any applicable defences</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">“Unclean hands”</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 I turn first to the defendant’s “unclean hands” defence, which is based on the equitable maxim that “he who comes to equity must come with clean hands”. The principles relating to this defence were summarised by Sundaresh Menon JC (as he then was) in <span class="font-italic">Hong Leong Singapore Finance Ltd v United Overseas Bank Ltd </span>[2007] 1 SLR(R) 292 (“<span class="font-italic">Hong Leong</span>”) at [225]–[226] as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">225 It is true that a plaintiff in equity must approach the court with clean hands but this does not mean he must be blameless in all ways. Firstly, the undesirable behaviour in question must involve more than general depravity. “[I]t must have an <span class="font-italic">immediate and necessary relation to the equity sued for</span>; it must be <span class="font-italic">a</span> <span class="font-italic">depravity in a legal as well as in a moral sense</span>”: see <span class="font-italic">Dering v Earl of Winchelsea</span> [1775–1802] All ER Rep 140. ...</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">226 Moreover, the principle has lost some of its vitality over time. The position is set out thus in <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore</span> vol 9(2) (LexisNexis, 2003) at para 110.016: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The maxim has been relaxed over time and is no longer strictly enforced. The question is whether in all the circumstances it would be a travesty of justice to assist the plaintiff given his blameworthy participation or role in the transaction. <span class="font-italic">The whole circumstances must be taken into account having regard to the relief sought, for the relative blameworthiness only emerges after a complete and exhaustive scrutiny</span> and relief which is less drastic need not be defeated by conduct that is less opprobrious. … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 The doctrine of “unclean hands” is not as well-defined as its common law counterpart, the defence of illegality. Nevertheless, two features of the “unclean hands” defence are apparent. First, the conduct complained of must bear an immediate and necessary relation to the equity sued for (see <span class="font-italic">Hong Leong </span>at [225]; <span class="font-italic">E C Investment Holding Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Ridout Residence Pte Ltd and others and another appeal </span>[2012] 1 SLR 32 at [92]). Secondly, the court must undertake a “complete and exhaustive scrutiny” of all the circumstances in a particular case in order to ascertain whether it would be a travesty of justice to grant a plaintiff relief (see <span class="font-italic">Hong Leong </span>at [226]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Beyond these two general principles, reference must be had to case law in order for one to fully appreciate the types of factual matrices which may disclose a successful “unclean hands” defence. See I C F Spry, <span class="font-italic">The Principles of Equitable Remedies: Specific Performance, Injunctions, Rectification and Equitable Damages </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 8th ed, 2010) at pp 5–6: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [I]t becomes clear that the maxim that predicates a requirement of clean hands does not set out a rule that is either precise or capable of satisfactory operation.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 In my judgment, this argument is clearly a non-starter. In the first place, it is entirely speculative for the defendant to suggest that the present action is in any way linked to the plaintiff’s earlier unsuccessful attempts to recover the Disputed Interest Sum. There are numerous possible reasons – legal, commercial and/or personal – as to why one might decide to pursue or discontinue the pursuit of a legal demand. The fact that the plaintiff “conveniently omit[ted] to raise any issue about the Share Issuance until his failure to claim the [Disputed] Interest Sum”

In my view, pursuing one cause of action when another is thought to be unlikely to succeed is not morally reprehensible, much less a legal wrong.

First, he avers that the defendant is precluded from relying on this argument since it was neither raised nor particularised in the defendant’s pleadings.

</div> I will examine each of these objections in turn. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Whether the plaintiff’s alleged breaches were adequately pleaded</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 I deal first with the point on pleadings. As the Court of Appeal explained in <span class="font-italic">V </span><span class="font-italic">Nithia (co-administratrix of the estate of Ponnusamy Sivapakiam, deceased) v Buthmanaban s/o Vaithilingam and another </span>[2015] 5 SLR 1422 (“<span class="font-italic">V </span><span class="font-italic">Nithia</span>”) at [38], the general rule is that the court is precluded from deciding on any matter which the parties have not put into issue. However, the law permits a departure from this rule in limited circumstances, where no prejudice is caused to the other party or where it would be clearly unjust for the court not to do so (see <span class="font-italic">V </span><span class="font-italic">Nithia </span>at [40]; <span class="font-italic">OMG Holdings Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Pos Ad Sdn Bhd </span>[2012] 4 SLR 231 at [18]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 In my view, the defendant’s failure to provide particulars of the plaintiff’s alleged breaches has not caused irreparable prejudice to the plaintiff. First, there is nothing to suggest that the defendant knew of the plaintiff’s non-compete duty until it was expressly raised in the plaintiff’s AEIC, which was filed <span class="font-italic">after </span>the close of pleadings.<span class="font-italic"> </span>It was the <span class="font-italic">plaintiff</span> who had <span class="font-italic">voluntarily</span> revealed the existence of this duty to the Court and to the defendant. In light of these circumstances, it does not now lie in the plaintiff’s mouth to suggest that he was unfairly taken aback by the defendant’s submissions on this point. The plaintiff should have prepared for the likely consequences of exposing the motive(s) behind his conduct.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 Secondly, although the defendant did not amend his Defence to incorporate the particulars of the plaintiff’s alleged breaches, I do not think that the plaintiff has suffered any substantial injustice as a result of this omission. By the plaintiff’s own admission, the circumvention of the non-compete clause was “[o]ne of the <span class="font-italic">first</span> issues that the [defendant] raised <span class="font-italic">at the start </span>of the trial”

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 As determined at [68] above, the plaintiff has had knowledge of the Share Issuance since 15 February 2016. However, the plaintiff only informed the defendant of his intention to pursue his breach of trust claim on 18 January 2019, before commencing the present Suit on 11 February 2019. Thus, the delay in the present case was slightly under three years. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 In my view, this three-year lapse was not so lengthy as to cause serious prejudice to the defendant. The facts of the present case are materially different from those in <span class="font-italic">Chng</span><span class="font-italic"> Weng Wah. </span>In that case, the appellant argued that the doctrine of laches was applicable since the respondent’s 12-year delay in commencing legal proceedings had caused most of the relevant evidence to be lost or destroyed. The Court of Appeal agreed with the appellant’s submissions and highlighted that the parties had been in a personal relationship wherein they had “dealt with each other on a relatively informal basis”, resulting in a situation where “limited formal documentation was kept” (at [54]–[55]). Additionally, the respondent’s claim was premised on an oral trust with no express terms (at [55]). Accordingly, any attempt to reconstruct the events surrounding the dispute would necessarily depend on the strength of the parties’ recollection, which had been severely compromised by the intervening lapse of time (at [54] and [59]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 Returning to the facts of the present case, I note that the plaintiff and the defendant were, like the parties in <span class="font-italic">Chng</span><span class="font-italic"> Weng Wah</span>, long-time friends who were fairly close to each other. However, the similarity between the two cases ends there. Despite the informality of their relationship, the plaintiff and the defendant had predominantly corresponded via e-mail, and the instrument on which the plaintiff’s action is founded – namely, the Trust Deed – was formally recorded in writing. It would therefore be incorrect to characterise this case as one where limited documentary evidence was available. Further, the 12-year lapse in <span class="font-italic">Chng</span><span class="font-italic"> Weng Wah </span>was four times the duration of the delay in the present case. It is unlikely that a span of three years would have eroded the defendant’s recollection to such an extent as to impair his ability to effectively conduct his defence, especially since he has the aid of relatively extensive documentary evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 In the premises, I am satisfied that the plaintiff’s delay is not sufficiently unconscionable to bar him from equitable relief. The defence of laches thus fails. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Acquiescence </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 The doctrine of acquiescence is described in the following manner in <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s Laws of England </span>vol 16 (Butterworths, 4th Ed Reissue, 2000) at para 924 (cited by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Genelabs</span><span class="font-italic"> Diagnostics Pte Ltd v Institut Pasteur and another </span>[2000] 3 SLR(R) 530 at [76]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The term acquiescence is … properly used where a person having a right and seeing another person about to commit, or in the course of committing an act infringing that right, <span class="font-italic">stands </span><span class="font-italic">by in such a manner as really to induce the person committing the act and who might otherwise have abstained from it, to believe that he consents to its being committed; a person so standing-by cannot afterwards be heard to complain of the act</span>. In that sense the doctrine of acquiescence may be defined as quiescence under such circumstances that assent may reasonably be inferred from it and is no more than an instance of the law of estoppel by words or conduct … [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 Thus, while laches in its strict sense refers to delay on the part of the plaintiff coupled with prejudice to the defendant, acquiescence is “premised not on delay, but on the fact that the plaintiff has, by standing by and doing nothing, made certain representations to the defendant in circumstances to found an estoppel, waiver, or abandonment of rights” (see <span class="font-italic">Tan Yong San v Neo Kok </span><span class="font-italic">Eng and others </span>[2011] SGHC 30 at [114]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 In <span class="font-italic">Koh</span><span class="font-italic"> Wee Meng v Trans Eurokars Pte Ltd </span>[2014] 3 SLR 663 (“<span class="font-italic">Koh</span><span class="font-italic"> Wee Meng</span>”), Judith Prakash J (as she then was) explained (at [120]) that there are two types of situations in which the defence of acquiescence might be established: first, where a plaintiff abstains from interfering while a violation of his legal rights is in progress; and second, where a plaintiff refrains from seeking redress when a violation of his rights, which he did not know about at the time, is brought to his notice. In the second type of situation, the plaintiff will only be held to have acquiesced if he “stood by and saw the defendant dealing with property in a manner inconsistent with the right of the plaintiff” (<span class="font-italic">Koh</span><span class="font-italic"> Wee Meng </span>at [119], citing <span class="font-italic">S </span><span class="font-italic">Pathmanathan v Amaravathi </span>[1979] 1 MLJ 38). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 In my view, the facts of the present case do not correspond to either of the two situations described above.

</div>
</div> In <span class="font-italic">Koh</span><span class="font-italic"> Wee Meng</span>, the plaintiff discovered that a Rolls-Royce Phantom SWB automobile (“the Rolls”) which he had purchased from the defendant was defective. The plaintiff sent the Rolls back to the defendant for rectification works on a total of eight occasions in 2008 and 2009. Despite the defendant’s efforts, the plaintiff remained dissatisfied with the Rolls’ performance and eventually commenced an action against the defendant, seeking to reject the Rolls and obtain a full refund. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 At the trial, the defendant argued that the plaintiff’s lack of complaint about the Rolls’ defects from end-September 2009 till the commencement of the action signified the plaintiff’s acquiescence in the defendant’s breach of contract. Rejecting this defence, Prakash J held (at [122]) that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [I]t is unlikely that the plaintiff’s conduct during this period could have induced the defendant to believe that it would not be sued. The plaintiff had explained in court that he saw no point in raising the issue since the defendant had failed to solve the noise and vibration after a year. During this time, he had sent the Rolls back for servicing on a total of eight occasions but <span class="font-italic">had not indicated that he would not sue on the noise and vibration. Nor did he give the defendant an indication that he would not enforce his rights</span>. The plaintiff’s conduct did not demonstrate any acquiescence nor did the defendant demonstrate any reliance on the alleged acquiescence. Therefore, there was no acquiescence in this case. [emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 It is thus apparent that acquiescence requires more than mere silence on the part of the plaintiff. To succeed in the defence, the defendant must prove that the plaintiff, by “standing by”, has made some representation or given some indication to the defendant that he does not intend to insist on his legal rights. I am unable to find any proof of that here. As such, the doctrine of acquiescence is inapplicable in the present case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Estoppel</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 It is trite that the defendant must prove three elements in order to successfully make out a defence of promissory estoppel: (a) the plaintiff must have made a clear and unequivocal representation, whether by words or conduct, that he will not enforce his strict legal rights; (b) the defendant must have acted in reliance on the plaintiff’s representation and suffered detriment as a result; and (c) it must be “inequitable” for the plaintiff to resile from his promise (see for <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Nanyang Medical Investments Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Kuek Bak Kim Leslie and others </span>[2018] SGHC 263 at [140]; <span class="font-italic">Oriental Investments (SH) Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Catalla Investments Pte Ltd </span>[2013] 1 SLR 1182 at [83]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 I note that the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">V </span><span class="font-italic">Nithia </span>held (at [5]) that in a claim based on <span class="font-italic">proprietary </span>estoppel, any supporting allegations have to be pleaded with sufficient detail and “with sufficient particulars of the substance of the representations, the reliance alleged to have been placed on the representations, and the detriment suffered by the party in relying on the representations”. This principle is equally applicable to a defence of promissory estoppel (see <span class="font-italic">V </span><span class="font-italic">Nithia </span>at [43], citing <span class="font-italic">Chng</span><span class="font-italic"> Bee Kheng v Chng Eng Chye </span>[2013] 2 SLR 715 at [94]). In my view, the defendant has not adequately particularised his defence of promissory estoppel. In relation to the first element (<span class="font-italic">viz.</span> the existence of a clear and unequivocal representation on the plaintiff’s part), the Defence only cursorily states that the plaintiff had “signed off on all of the Company’s audited financial reports … all of which contained the Company’s share capital subsequent to the Share Issuance”.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 I am unable to agree with this submission. In my view, the plaintiff’s acts merely signify his determination to retain his hold over the Company and to continue extracting profit from it. They do not amount to an <span class="font-italic">unequivocal</span> representation that the plaintiff would not bring an action against the defendant for the breach of the Trust Deed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 In the alternative, the defendant asserts that the plaintiff’s failure to raise any issue with the Share Issuance despite his knowledge of the same amounts to a representation <span class="font-italic">by silence</span> that he would not enforce his legal rights. I am likewise unable to accept this argument. It is well established that “mere silence or inaction will not normally amount to an unequivocal representation” <span class="font-italic">unless </span>there is a “duty to speak” (see <span class="font-italic">Audi Construction Pte Ltd v Kian </span><span class="font-italic">Hiap Construction Pte Ltd </span>[2018] 1 SLR 317 (“<span class="font-italic">Audi</span>”) at [58]). Given the diverse range of circumstances in which a “duty to speak” may arise, the court’s assessment of whether a “duty to speak” exists in a particular case is necessarily fact-specific (see <span class="font-italic">Audi </span>at [61]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… <span class="font-italic">The expression “duty to speak” does not refer to a legal duty as such, but to circumstances in which a failure to speak would lead a reasonable party to think that the other party has elected between two inconsistent rights or will forbear to enforce a particular right in the future, as the case may be</span>. We emphasise that this is not the subjective assessment of the other party but an objective assessment made by reference to how a reasonable person apprised of the relevant facts would view the silence in the circumstances, though unsurprisingly, the parties’ relationship and the applicable law which governs it will be a critical focus of the court’s assessment of whether those circumstances exist. [emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 As I recently noted in <span class="font-italic">Tractors Singapore </span><span class="font-italic">Ltd v Pacific Ocean Engineering &amp; Trading Pte Ltd</span> [2020] SGHC 60 at [92], it is important to bear in mind that cases in which a “duty to speak” arises are the exception rather than the norm. In my view, there was nothing exceptional about the circumstances of the present case which could have given rise to a “duty to speak” on the plaintiff’s part. Although the parties were close acquaintances, their friendship did not impose a moral or legal obligation on them to be fully transparent with each other <span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">every respect</span>. Ultimately, they were two independent and commercially-savvy businessmen whose interests and objectives had happened to coincide at the time of the Company’s inception. I am satisfied that a reasonable person who had been fully apprised of the facts of this case would not have viewed the plaintiff’s three-year silence as an <span class="font-italic">unequivocal</span> representation that he did not intend to insist on his strict legal rights. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 Accordingly, I find that the first element of the defendant’s estoppel defence is not made out.

</div> I am unable to agree with this argument for two reasons. First, the two “rights” referred to by the defendant are <span class="font-italic">not</span> inconsistent and/or irreconcilable. In my judgment, it was not self-contradictory for the defendant to contribute to the Company’s development post-Share Issuance, whilst simultaneously preserving his legal entitlement to bring a claim against the defendant for the earlier breach of the Trust Deed.

</div> I am thus unable to consider this remedy in further detail. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 Turning to the plaintiff’s claim for equitable compensation, I make the preliminary observation that the plaintiff’s submissions appear to conflate the <span class="font-italic">substitutive </span>remedy of falsification with the <span class="font-italic">reparative</span> remedy of equitable compensation. In my view, these two remedies are legally distinct and conceptually incompatible. I elaborate on their differences in the discussion below. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Traditional accounting remedies: Falsification and surcharging</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 Traditionally, the victim of a breach of trust would seek relief by claiming for an account. As noted by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Chng</span><span class="font-italic"> Weng Wah </span>at [21], there are broadly two different categories of accounts:   </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) general or common accounts (also known as accounts of common form) where no misconduct has been alleged; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) accounts on the basis of wilful default, which involves some kind of misconduct on the part of the fiduciary.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 A common account is usually ordered to ascertain whether a trustee has misapplied trust property in breach of his <span class="font-italic">custodial stewardship duty</span> to act only in accordance with the terms of the trust (see <span class="font-italic">Sim </span><span class="font-italic">Poh Ping v Winsta Holding Pte Ltd and another and other appeals </span>[2020] SGCA 35 (“<span class="font-italic">Sim </span><span class="font-italic">Poh Ping</span>”) at [111];<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Tongbao (Singapore) Shipping Pte Ltd and another v Woon Swee Huat and others </span>[2019] 5 SLR 56 (“<span class="font-italic">Tongbao</span>”) at [125], citing Charles Mitchell, “Equitable Compensation for Breach of Fiduciary Duty” (2013) 66 CLP 307 at 320–321).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 The claim for a common account is divided into three phases (see <span class="font-italic">Chng</span><span class="font-italic"> Weng Wah </span>at [22]): </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the question of whether the plaintiff has a right to an account is asked. In general, the beneficiary of a trust is entitled “as of right” to be given a common account, without having to show that the trustee has committed a breach of trust (see <span class="font-italic">Foo </span><span class="font-italic">Jee Seng and others v Foo Jhee Tuang and another </span>[2012] 4 SLR 339 at [87]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, the account is taken. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, once a discrepancy in the trustee’s account is revealed, the plaintiff can <span class="font-italic">falsify</span> the unauthorised disbursement from the account. This has the effect of creating a deficit between the account and the fund that the fiduciary must replenish (see <span class="font-italic">Tongbao</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [125]). Alternatively, the plaintiff can opt to <span class="font-italic">adopt</span> the unauthorised disbursement, <span class="font-italic">eg</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>if it was made for an asset which has in fact risen in value (see <span class="font-italic">Cheong </span><span class="font-italic">Soh Chin and others v Eng Chiet Shoong and others </span>[2019] 4 SLR 714 (“<span class="font-italic">Cheong </span><span class="font-italic">Soh Chin</span>”) at [78]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 Seeking payment following an account of common form is analogous to an order for specific performance or payment of a liquidated debt, and is therefore not dependent on proof of loss (see <span class="font-italic">Sim </span><span class="font-italic">Poh Ping </span>at [113]; <span class="font-italic">Agricultural Land Management Ltd v Jackson and Others (No 2) </span>[2014] WASC 102 at [336]–[337]; Yip Man and Goh Yihan, “Navigating the Maze: Making Sense of Equitable Compensation and Account of Profits for Breach of Fiduciary Duty” (2016) 28 SAcLJ 884 at 900). This is not to say that the concept of causation is wholly irrelevant, as the plaintiff must still establish a causal link between the trustee’s breach of duty and the subject-matter of the trust that is sought to be restored. However, “the sense in which causation appears in the situation of falsification is a limited one, meaning that the court does not go further to determine whether the loss would still have occurred in the absence of the trustee’s breach of duty” (<span class="font-italic">Sim </span><span class="font-italic">Poh Ping </span>at [114]–[115]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 Unlike a common account, which is available as of right, an account on the basis of wilful default is ordered only when a trustee breaches his <span class="font-italic">management stewardship duty</span>. A breach of this nature occurs when the trustee fails to administer the trust fund in accordance with his equitable duties, <span class="font-italic">eg</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>by managing the trust fund negligently (see <span class="font-italic">Sim </span><span class="font-italic">Poh Ping </span>at [100]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 When an account is taken on the basis of a wilful default, the account is <span class="font-italic">surcharged</span> by the amount that the trustee <span class="font-italic">might</span> have received if not for his default (see <span class="font-italic">Cheong </span><span class="font-italic">Soh Chin </span>at [82]). Accordingly, the plaintiff must establish that the trust has sustained a loss which is causally connected to the breach of the trustee’s duty (see <span class="font-italic">Sim </span><span class="font-italic">Poh Ping </span>at [121]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Equitable compensation </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 The term “equitable compensation” was first introduced in <span class="font-italic">Nocton</span><span class="font-italic"> v Lord Ashburton </span>[1914] AC 932 to describe a reparative (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, compensatory) remedy for a <span class="font-italic">non-custodial breach</span> of fiduciary duty. However, it subsequently evolved to encompass reparative remedies for custodial breaches, including breaches of <span class="font-italic">trust</span> (see for <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Target Holdings Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Redferns (a firm) and another </span>[1996] 1 AC  421 (“<span class="font-italic">Target Holdings</span>”); <span class="font-italic">AIB Group (UK) plc v Mark </span><span class="font-italic">Redler &amp; Co Solicitors </span>[2015] AC 1503 (“<span class="font-italic">AIB</span>”)). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 As equitable compensation is intended to restore the victim of a breach of trust or fiduciary duty (as the case may be) to the position that he or she would have been in if not for the breach (see <span class="font-italic">Quality Assurance Management Asia Pte Ltd v Zhang Qing and others </span>[2013] 3 SLR 631 at [41]), a plaintiff who seeks equitable compensation must establish both loss and causation. The law on causation in relation to equitable compensation was recently clarified by the Court of Appeal <span class="font-italic">Sim </span><span class="font-italic">Poh Ping</span>, albeit in the context of a breach of <span class="font-italic">fiduciary duty</span> (as opposed to a breach of trust). Nevertheless, and as I shall explain further below, the question of causation does not arise in the present case because the plaintiff has not even managed to prove the existence of any loss on his part. It is therefore unnecessary for me to examine the principles in <span class="font-italic">Sim </span><span class="font-italic">Poh Ping </span>in further detail. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 At this juncture, I pause to note that the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Sim </span><span class="font-italic">Poh Ping</span> strongly urged counsel, academics and courts to guard against loose usage of the “equitable compensation” terminology, and to use the term to refer <span class="font-italic">only</span> to the reparative remedy sought for<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">non-custodial</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>breaches of <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">fiduciary duty</span> (see <span class="font-italic">Sim </span><span class="font-italic">Poh Ping </span>at [123] and [126]). However, the Court of Appeal did <span class="font-italic">not </span>expressly rule out the possibility that a reparative monetary award (which is distinct from the traditional accounting remedies of falsification and surcharging described at [122]–[127] above) could be awarded for a breach of <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">trust</span>, as in the cases of <span class="font-italic">Target Holdings </span>and <span class="font-italic">AIB. </span>For clarity, I will hereinafter refer to such an award as “compensatory relief”. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The appropriate remedy in the present case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 It is evident from the preceding analysis that an order for compensatory relief for a breach of trust is distinct from the remedy of falsification. The former is <span class="font-italic">reparative</span> and therefore contingent on proof of loss. By contrast, the latter is <span class="font-italic">restitutionary</span> or <span class="font-italic">restorative</span> in nature. It is available as of right once a common account has been taken and a misapplication of trust property has been established (see [125] above and <span class="font-italic">Libertarian Investments Ltd v Thomas </span><span class="font-italic">Alexej Hall </span>[2014] 1 HKC 368 at [167]–[168]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 In my judgment, the remedy of falsification would not be appropriate in the present case. As explained at [123] above, falsification is intended to remedy a discrepancy in the trust account which results from an unauthorised disbursement by the trustee. This was not such a case. It is clear that the defendant did not misapply the 50 shares which he held on trust for the plaintiff. Nor does the plaintiff allege this to be the case. Rather, the plaintiff’s claim is that the defendant has caused the <span class="font-italic">value</span> of these 50 shares to fall by issuing 350,000 additional shares in his own name.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 As the plaintiff has not sought an account on the basis of wilful default, the only suitable remedy which is available to the plaintiff in the present case is an order for compensatory relief similar to that ordered in <span class="font-italic">Target Holdings </span>and <span class="font-italic">AIB. </span>As such, it is imperative for the plaintiff to prove his loss in order to demonstrate his entitlement to relief.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether loss was proven in the present case </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134   The plaintiff submits that his loss must be calculated “on the basis of what [his] 50% beneficial shareholding in the Company should be worth”, as the defendant has deprived him of the same by diluting his shareholding in breach of the Trust Deed.

</div> the plaintiff did not make an application to bifurcate the trial under O 33 r 2 of the ROC. Nevertheless, case law suggests that the absence of such an application does not preclude the court from exercising its powers to make a bifurcation order, even if the trial of the matter has already been concluded.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 In <span class="font-italic">Lee Chee Wei v Tan </span><span class="font-italic">Hor Peow Victor and others and another appeal </span>[2007] 3 SLR(R) 537 (“<span class="font-italic">Lee Chee Wei</span>”), the plaintiff claimed specific performance of an agreement for the sale and purchase of his shares or, in the alternative, damages in lieu of specific performance. The claim for specific performance was found to be impractical, but the plaintiff had not adduced any evidence on the value of his shares. The Court of Appeal acknowledged that the plaintiff’s conduct of the trial “le[ft] much to be desired” (at [80]) but ultimately made an order for the assessment of damages in lieu of specific performance. It held (at [64]) that although neither of the parties had applied prior to the trial for a bifurcation of the hearing pursuant to O 33 r 2 of the ROC, “the fact remain[ed] that the plaintiff would have readily been granted a bifurcation order, had he applied for it at the appropriate juncture”. Furthermore, “the defendants [had] suffered no prejudice that [could not] be adequately compensated by costs” (at [76]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 <span class="font-italic">Lee Chee Wei</span> was subsequently endorsed in <span class="font-italic">Chew Ai Hua Sandra v Woo </span><span class="font-italic">Kah Wai and another (Chesney Real Estate Pte Ltd, third party) </span>[2013] 3 SLR 1088 (“<span class="font-italic">Sandra Chew</span>”), where Lionel Yee JC (as he then was) made an order for damages to be separately assessed <span class="font-italic">after</span> the conclusion of the trial even though the plaintiff had not made any prior application to bifurcate the hearing. Yee JC’s findings on this point were not overturned on appeal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 Underpinning both <span class="font-italic">Lee Chee Wei </span>and <span class="font-italic">Sandra Chew </span>is the proposition that “the [c]ourt ought not to be so far bound and tied by rules … as to be compelled to do what will cause injustice in the particular case” (<span class="font-italic">Sandra Chew </span>at [68], citing <span class="font-italic">In the Matter of </span><span class="font-italic">an Arbitration between Coles and Ravenshear </span>[1907] 1 KB 1 at 4). Ultimately, “each case involving procedural lapses or mishaps must be assessed in its proper factual matrix and calibrated by reference to the paramount rationale of dispensing even handed justice” (<span class="font-italic">Lee Chee Wei </span>at [82]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 In my view, the present case is analogous to <span class="font-italic">Lee Chee Wei </span>in that a bifurcation order would almost certainly have been granted if the plaintiff had applied for it prior to the commencement of the trial. As in <span class="font-italic">Lee Chee Wei</span>, the assessment of compensatory relief in the present case is “somewhat controversial” as it would require expert evidence on, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the valuation of the 50 shares beneficially owned by the plaintiff and the Company’s ability to secure purchasers in the hypothetical scenario that the Share Issuance had not occurred. As such, it is likely that “substantial costs and time would have been saved” if liability issues had been resolved first, as a negative finding on this critical question alone “would have rendered otiose any need to adduce evidence on damages” (see <span class="font-italic">Lee Chee Wei </span>at [64]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 Furthermore, it is noteworthy that the defendant did not choose to call any expert witnesses to rebut the plaintiff’s Lay Opinion. Accordingly, any prejudice which the defendant may suffer (in the form of inconvenience, unnecessary expense and/or duplicated effort) is likely to be very slight. Such prejudice is also readily compensated by costs (see <span class="font-italic">Sandra Chew </span>at [69]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 In the circumstances, I am of the view that it would be fair and just for the quantum of compensatory relief due to the plaintiff to be assessed at a separate hearing, and I thus make an order in those terms. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conduct of the action</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 Before closing, I make the brief observation that the plaintiff’s closing and reply submissions contain a number of personal attacks on the defendant’s counsel, insinuating, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, that the defendant’s counsel is unprofessional and/or inept. While these irrelevant and disparaging remarks have not had any impact whatsoever on the outcome of my decision, I take the view that such assertions are wholly inappropriate and uncalled for. It is of paramount importance that all advocates and solicitors, as members of an honourable profession, conduct themselves with dignity and extend professional courtesy and civility towards one another at all times. </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 In summary, my decision is as follows: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Interlocutory judgment is entered for the plaintiff as regards the defendant’s liability for breaching Clause 3.3 read with Clause 3.4(b) of the Trust Deed.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) An assessment of compensatory relief is to be conducted by the Registrar to determine the amount of compensatory relief, if any, which is to be paid by the defendant to the plaintiff. The question of interest, if any, is also reserved to the Registrar. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 I will hear parties on the issue of costs at a later date. Parties are to file their submissions on costs, limited to ten pages each, within 14 days from the date of this judgment. Additional costs for the assessment of compensatory relief shall be reserved to the Registrar. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Vincent Hoong <br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Cai Enhuai Amos and Wong Changyan Ernest (Yuen Law LLC) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Pang Khin Wee (Peng Qinwei) (Hoh Law Corporation) for the defendant. </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
