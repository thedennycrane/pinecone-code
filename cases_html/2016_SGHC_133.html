The appellant plaintiff instituted Magistrates’ Courts Suit No 357 of 2015 (“MC/MC 357/2015”) on 7 January 2015 against the respondent defendant for damages in respect of personal injuries suffered by him on 7 January 2012 when the respondent’s vehicle collided into the rear of the appellant’s stationary vehicle. The question for determination in HC/RAS 9/2016 is whether the date on which the appellant’s cause of action accrued is to be excluded or included for the purpose of computing the three-year limitation period under s 24A(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Limitation Act (Cap 163, 1996 Rev Ed). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The computation of time relating to the limitation timeline for causes of action is essential. If even a delay of one day is not a good reason to allow a time-barred claim to proceed (see <span class="font-italic">Ang Sin Hock v</span><span class="font-italic"> Khoo Eng Lim</span> [2010] 3 SLR 179 (“<span class="font-italic">Ang Sin Hock</span>”) at [78]), <span class="font-italic">precise</span> <span class="font-italic">rules</span> for the calculation of limitation periods are required. One day, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the period of 24 hours beginning with one midnight and ending with the next or the time it takes the earth to revolve once on its axis (see <span class="font-italic">Black’s Law Dictionary</span> (Bryan A Garner ed) (West Group, 9th Ed, 2009) at p 453; <span class="font-italic">Jowitt’s</span><span class="font-italic"> Dictionary of English Law</span> vol 1 (Daniel Greenberg ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 3rd Ed, 2010) at p 638), may make all the difference in determining whether an action is time-barred or not. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 This judgment examines the ambit and interpretation of provisions on the computation of time in the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) and the Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 2002 Rev Ed) – as well as relevant common law principles in the common law – and their application to the provisions stipulating limitation periods in the Limitation Act.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 I agree with the position taken by the appellant that in computing limitation periods as provided for in the Limitation Act, the date the cause of action accrued should be excluded. Accordingly, the appellant’s action that was filed on 7 January 2015 is not time-barred.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Brief facts and procedural history</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The appellant and respondent were involved in a road traffic accident on 7 January 2012. It is common ground that, at about 4:00 a.m. to 4:50 a.m., a collision occurred at the junction of Victoria Street and Ophir Road involving motor car no. SGB 8876T driven by the appellant and motor lorry no. GBA 7313Y driven by the respondent. The appellant claims that he had brought his car to a stop at the junction when the traffic light turned amber, and that the respondent’s lorry had collided into the rear of his stationary car shortly after. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 On 7 January 2015, the appellant instituted MC/MC 357/2015 claiming damages in respect of personal injuries suffered by him, alleging negligence of the respondent in the driving, management and control of his vehicle. The respondent entered an appearance to the suit on 20 January 2015 and filed a defence on 17 March 2015, primarily relying on s 24A(2) of the Limitation Act to plead that the suit was time-barred as it was not commenced within three years from the date on which the cause of action had accrued. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 The respondent then applied in Summons No 4188 of 2015 (“MC/SUM 4188/2015”) to strike out the appellant’s Statement of Claim on the ground that the respondent’s action was time-barred at the time of the issue of the writ on 7 January 2015, the last day to bring the action purportedly being 6 January 2015. The Deputy Registrar hearing MC/SUM 4188/2015 on 18 August 2015 held that the action was time-barred and struck out the appellant’s action.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 The appellant appealed against the Deputy Registrar’s decision and at the hearing of Registrar’s Appeal No 50 of 2015 (MC/RA 50/2015) on 16 September 2015, the District Judge dismissed the appeal. The District Judge also heard and dismissed the appellant’s application for leave to appeal against the decision in MC/RA 50/2015 to the High Court on 29 October 2015.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 Both parties then appeared before me on 1 March 2016 upon the application of the appellant in Originating Summons No 1048 of 2015 (HC/OS 1048/2015) seeking leave to appeal to the High Court against the District Judge’s decision in MC/RA 50/2015. I granted the appellant leave to appeal, bringing us to the present appeal in HC/RAS 9/2016.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Decision of the Deputy Registrar in MC/SUM 4188/2015</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 The Deputy Registrar recognised that there were contrary positions in both the case law and material presented to her which were “not reconciled”.

</div> She then decided to follow the apparent approach of the High Court in two relatively recent cases (<span class="font-italic">Yan Jun v Attorney-General</span> [2014] 1 SLR 793 (“<span class="font-italic">Yan Jun</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 2827 v GBI Realty Pte Ltd and </span><span class="font-italic">another</span> [2014] 3 SLR 229 (“<span class="font-italic">GBI Realty</span>”)) and computed the limitation period to <span class="font-italic">include</span> the day the cause of action accrued. The limitation period was thus held to have expired on 6 January 2015, and the Deputy Registrar struck out the appellant’s action.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Decision of the District Judge in MC/RA 50/2015</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 In her grounds of decision reported at <span class="font-italic">Suresh s/o </span><span class="font-italic">Suppiah v Jiang Guoliang </span>[2015] SGMC 31 (the “GD”), the District Judge similarly took the position that the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Yan Jun </span>had dealt with the computation of time for the limitation period under s 24A(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Limitation Act (which is the same provision that applies in the present case), where the Judge had <span class="font-italic">included</span> the date when the cause of action accrued in computing the limitation period. Hence, the District Judge held that as the accident in the present case had occurred on 7 January 2012, the last date for instituting the action was 6 January 2015. She thus dismissed the appeal against the Deputy Registrar’s decision. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 In the proceedings below, the respondent made the argument that only cases dealing specifically with s 24A of the Limitation Act would be relevant for consideration, and that cases interpreting the computation of time for s 6 of the Limitation Act (or s 2 of the Limitation Act 1939 (c 21) (UK) (the “UK Limitation Act 1939”) which was also the provision that related to actions founded on contract or tort) cited by the appellant were not, relying on the Court of Appeal’s holding in <span class="font-italic">Lian Kok Hong v </span><span class="font-italic">Ow Wah Foong and Another </span>[2008] SGCA 30 at [14] that the two sections cannot apply concurrently (see [5] of the GD). Although the District Judge did not expressly state so, she seemed to have implicitly agreed with this argument when she held that s 24A(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Limitation Act applied and that the decision of <span class="font-italic">Yan Jun</span> applied without addressing the other cases cited by the appellant at all (see [9]–[10] of the GD). This treatment of the contrary authorities seems to be jumping the gun. Although the exact provisions in the Limitation Act that were engaged in those cases may have been different due to the different causes of action, the phrasing of the time limits is largely similar in the format of “action(s)…shall not be brought after the expiration of [time period] from the date on which the cause of action accrued”. With the issue at hand being one of computation of time and not about which limitation period applied, those contrary authorities are <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>also relevant. Holding otherwise would be an implicit and counterintuitive recognition that the principles relating to the computation of time periods under different provisions in the Limitation Act could differ.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issues in HC/RAS 9/2016</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 The focus of the appeal in HC/RAS 9/2016 is on the issue of whether the action was time-barred under s 24A(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Limitation Act, and the question that determines this issue is whether the date on which the appellant’s cause of action accrued is to be excluded or included for the purpose of computing the three-year limitation period under s 24A(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Limitation Act.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 Both parties agree that the cause of action arose on the date of the accident on 7 January 2012, and it is also common ground that the appellant had the knowledge required to bring the action on the date of the accident. Thus, the relevant limitation period under s 24A(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Limitation Act is three years. If the date on which the appellant’s cause of action accrued were to be <span class="font-italic">excluded</span>, the relevant limitation period would have started running on 8 January 2012 and would hence have expired on 7 January 2015 (this date being the last day for bringing the action). His action instituted on 7 January 2015 would then not be time-barred. If it were to be <span class="font-italic">included</span> though, the relevant limitation period would have expired on 6 January 2015 and his action would therefore be time-barred. The timeline below summarises these two interpretations:</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 Section 24A(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Limitation Act reads:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">24A.(2) An action to which this section applies, where the damages claimed consist of or include damages in respect of personal injuries to the plaintiff or any other person, shall not be brought <span class="font-italic">after the expiration of</span> —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) 3 years <span class="font-italic">from</span> the date on which the cause of action accrued</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 As the relevant limitation period provided for is a statutory provision providing for a time period to bring an action before the courts, there are other statutory interpretative provisions that may apply to assist in the computation of time. Section 50 (in particular s 50(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)) of the Interpretation Act, which was cited by the appellant, may be one such provision:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Computation of time</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">50.

These cases support the definition of “from” in <span class="font-italic">Stroud’s Judicial Dictionary of Words and Phrases </span>(8th Ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2015) at p 1158:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">“From” is much akin to “after”; and when used in reference to the computation of time, e.g. “from” a stated date, prima facie <span class="font-italic">excludes</span> the day of that date… [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Thus, these are the few questions that I will have to consider before I can address the overarching question of whether the date of the accrual of the cause of action should be excluded or included in the computation of time:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Does s 50(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Interpretation Act and/or O 3 r 2(2) of the Rules of Court apply in the interpretation and computation of time periods in the Limitation Act?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Are there relevant principles in the common law relating to the computation of time and interpretation of statutory provisions providing for time periods that would apply?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Is s 50(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Interpretation Act inapplicable to computation of periods of time <span class="font-italic">not</span> expressed in days (<span class="font-italic">ie</span> expressed in weeks, months, years, etc., as in the present case being that of three years under s 24A(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Limitation Act) due to the express phrase used in the provision being “period of <span class="font-italic">days</span>” (emphasis added)?</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issue not yet authoritatively determined</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Before going into the substantive analysis, I have to state that the conflicting local authorities cited by both parties do reflect that this issue has not yet been conclusively or authoritatively determined. Although the more recent cases that guided the Deputy Registrar’s and District Judge’s decisions (see above at [10]–[11]) seemed to indicate that the date of the accrual of the cause of action should be <span class="font-italic">included</span>, I note that these decisions, though relating to the issue of limitation, ultimately did not address or deal directly with the present (and narrower) issue where a day’s delay had mattered and submissions relating to this were not made. The Judge in both <span class="font-italic">Yan Jun</span> and <span class="font-italic">GBI Realty</span> was not actually considering or addressing this narrow legal question. The precise computation of time was not actually an issue that was argued upon as a day’s difference was not critical in both cases; the dates on which the actions were brought had well exceeded the relevant limitation periods. Instead, <span class="font-italic">Yan Jun</span>’s limitation issue was mainly whether the suit was subject to a three-year limitation period (see <span class="font-italic">Yan Jun</span> at [31]) while that in <span class="font-italic">GBI Realty</span> related to when the cause of action had actually accrued. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 For reference, the Judge in <span class="font-italic">Yan Jun</span> stated that under s 24A(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Limitation Act, the plaintiff’s cause of action would have accrued by 20 July 2009 and the limitation period would have expired on 19 July 2012 (at [48]). In <span class="font-italic">GBI Realty </span>at [28], the Judge postulated a six-year limitation period under s 24A(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Limitation Act:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">On the MCST’s best case, the <span class="font-italic">cause of action accrued on 29 May 2007</span> and not on 22 August 2007, which was the date of the MCST council meeting. A six-year period <span class="font-italic">commencing on 29 May 2007</span> would <span class="font-italic">end on 28 May 2013</span>. Boustead was joined as a party on 30 July 2013. The action was accordingly brought more than six years after 29 May 2007.

The court affirmed the finding in <span class="font-italic">Hare v </span><span class="font-italic">Gocher </span>[1962] 2 QB 641 where the words of the statutory provision were phrased as “at the expiration… of one month <span class="font-italic">beginning with</span> the date on which it is passed” (emphasis added), it meant that the day upon which the Act was passed was to be <span class="font-italic">included</span> in the computation of time. I should note that Lord Denning MR dissented (see <span class="font-italic">Trow</span><span class="font-italic"> v Ind Coope </span>at 915) as he felt that distinguishing between “beginning with” and “beginning from” was too subtle a distinction that would be “out of touch with the common man”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Fortunately, this purported distinction is not an issue in the present case.

In <span class="font-italic">Gelmini</span><span class="font-italic"> v Moriggia</span>, the statutory provision in issue was s 3 of the Limitation Act 1623 (c 16) (UK) which reads that “[a]ll actions… shall be commenced and sued within the time and limitation hereafter expressed, and not after (that is to say)… within six years next after the cause of such actions or suit.” In that case, the last day for payment of a promissory note was on 22 September 1906, and the writ in an action upon the note against the makers was issued on 23 September 1912. Channell J held that since the cause of action was complete at the commencement of 23 September 1906, that whole day (23 September 1906) was to be <span class="font-italic">included</span> in the computation of the six-year limitation period which expired on 22 September 1912.

As the general rule to exclude was based on disregarding parts or fractions of a day and allowing potential claimants the whole of the stipulated limitation period to bring their actions, the decision to include the whole day of 23 September 1906 in the computation of time in <span class="font-italic">Gelmini</span><span class="font-italic"> v Moriggia</span> does not flout that principle as the cause of action had technically accrued between 22 and 23 September 1906 or at 0000 hrs on 23 September 1906. At the last moment of 22 September 1906, the time for payment on the promissory note had not yet expired. However, at the first moment of 23 September 1906, it had expired and the cause of action had accrued by then. Hence, there would be no effective backdating in holding that time, for the purpose of the limitation timeline, ran from the commencement of 23 September 1906. No part or fraction of a day was involved at all.

In <span class="font-italic">Lester v Garland</span> at 257, Sir William Grant MR observed that because a day is treated as indivisible, an act done in the compass of a day cannot properly be said to be passed until the day is passed:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…upon technical reasoning I rather think, it would be more easy to maintain, that the day of an act done, or an event happening, ought in all cases to be excluded, than that it should in all cases be included.

Lawyers naturally adopt the spatial concept of time of ordinary thought and language. It follows that time is measured in periods; and any period or space of time, a year, a day, an hour, is, in theory at all events, divisible. But, as a day is for law the unit of measure in most cases, it was early said that <span class="font-italic">the law was not concerned with divisions of a day</span>. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A day, the period of the earth's axial rotation, is the natural and fundamental division of time. A day for legal purposes is the mean solar day, a period of twenty-four hours. These hours are reckoned from midnight to midnight, the instant of midnight being both the end of one day and the beginning of the next, for there are no rests in time, and as each instant comes it goes. A day has a significance for law in two ways: first, as a division of time, that is the space of time within which an event happened or is to happen, or something was done or is to be done: secondly, as a measure of the passage of time, a unit in a period of time.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Similarly, Lord Mansfield CJ in <span class="font-italic">Pugh v Duke</span> said that reference to a date does not mean the hour or the minute, but the day of delivery, and in law there is no fraction of a day (see [26], above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 However, this technical rule and legal fiction is ultimately a convenient rule for the sake of temporal certainty, meant to overcome the practical and evidentiary problems with identifying the precise time of an event with certainty. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Consideration of a one-day limitation period</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Another justification for the general rule is derived from considering the hypothetical situation of a one-day time period. If one considers a case of a one-day limitation period (the “one-day test”), the reasonableness of the conclusion to exclude the date of accrual of the cause of action becomes apparent. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 In this vein, Parke B in <span class="font-italic">Young v </span><span class="font-italic">Higgon</span> (1840) 6 M &amp; W 49 at 54 remarked: “[a]pply the criterion which has been before suggested—reduce the time to one day, and then see what hardship and inconvenience must ensue if the principle I have stated is not to be adopted.” This “test” was subsequently also adopted in <span class="font-italic">Radcliffe v Bartholomew</span> by Wills J (and cited by Havers J in <span class="font-italic">Marren</span><span class="font-italic"> v Dawson</span>) who commented that “the result of reducing the time to one day would be that an offence might be committed a few minutes before midnight, and there would only be those few minutes in which to lay the complaint, which would be to reduce the matter to an absurdity” (at 163).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Underlying the conclusion from this notional test to exclude the first day is the principle that the statutory stipulation of a period of time has to be fully adhered to, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the whole of three years to bring an action must pass before the limitation period is held to have expired, giving plaintiffs their full limitation period to bring their actions. Thus in <span class="font-italic">Young v </span><span class="font-italic">Higgon</span>, Alderson B remarked that “where there is given to a party a certain space of time to do some act, which space of time is included between two other acts to be done by another person, both the days of doing those acts ought to be excluded, in order to ensure to him the whole of that space of time” (at 54). Similarly, Gurney B in the same case relied on this principle “so as not to be in restriction of the general right of bringing actions” (at 55).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">“Fair” construction?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 This brings us to what seems to have been either rarely discussed or disregarded in the authorities after <span class="font-italic">Lester v Garland</span>: the observation that Sir William Grant MR seemingly accepted from counsel for the plaintiff (see <span class="font-italic">Lester v Garland</span> at 256) that where the act done from which the computation is made is one to which the party against whom the time runs is privy, the day of the act done is <span class="font-italic">included</span>; but where it is one to which he is a stranger or foreign to, it may be <span class="font-italic">excluded</span>. Although Bayley J subsequently adopted and applied this distinction in <span class="font-italic">Hardy v Ryle</span> (see 607–608), this distinction and reasoning was doubted by Parke B in <span class="font-italic">Webb v </span><span class="font-italic">Fairmaner</span> at 477 as being “not…quite satisfactory”. In <span class="font-italic">Hardy v Ryle</span>, it was rationalised that in the case of a seizure of the plaintiff’s goods under the authority of a warrant granted by the defendant, the plaintiff was not privy to the seizure and thus the day of the seizure would be excluded in the computation of time.<span class="font-italic"> </span>In the present case, since the appellant, against whom the limitation timeline runs, was not privy to the act done on the day of the accident, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the alleged collision against the rear of his stationary vehicle by the respondent (in the sense that a wrong was alleged to have been committed against him), the day of the accrual of the cause of action would be apparently excluded under this rule. However, considering that Sir William Grant MR was reluctant to lay down a general rule upon this subject, his comments on this distinction should not be interpreted as doing so. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Another rule of construction has been expressed by the courts to be “fair”: where the “computation is to be for the benefit of the person affected as much time should be given as the language admits of, and where it is to his detriment the language should be construed as strictly as possible” (see <span class="font-italic">In re North</span> at 270). In <span class="font-italic">In re North</span>, it was thus rationalised that this rule would lead to excluding the first day (or part of a day) since the provision in question affected debtors in a very detrimental manner and the provision thus ought to be construed as much for the debtor’s benefit as possible. Without commenting on the soundness of such a rule, it cannot be gainsaid that, at first blush, this rule may not assist the computation of limitation periods, since the affected positions of <span class="font-italic">both</span> the claimant and the defendant are at diametrically opposite ends and have to be balanced. Of course, if one takes the simpler view that only the claimant’s right to bring an action is being directly affected, the conclusion to exclude the date of accrual of the cause of action would be reached to construe the statute as much as possible for the claimant’s benefit.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Application of general rule in the present context consistent with the purpose of the law of limitation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 However, considering the context and subject-matter of limitation law, I am of the view that <span class="font-italic">excluding</span> the date of the accrual of the cause of action would be the more reasonable construction that affords potential claimants the <span class="font-italic">full</span> periods of limitation as stipulated by the Limitation Act.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Singapore’s Limitation Act was enacted in 1959 (No 57 of 1969), modelled after the UK Limitation Act 1939 and then subsequently amended to include the reforms of the UK Limitation Act 1980 (c 58) and UK Latent Damage Act 1986 (c 37) (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</span> (2 September 1959) vol 11 at col 587 (K M Byrne, Minister for Labour and Law); and <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</span> (29 May 1992) vol 60 at col 32 (Professor S Jayakumar, Minister for Law)). The Limitation Act currently stipulates limitation periods categorised based on particular causes of actions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 The three-fold functions underlying statutes of limitation was laid out in the Report of the Law Reform Committee of England and Wales entitled Limitation of Actions in Cases of Personal Injury (Cmnd 1829, 1962), as follows (at para 17, which was also quoted by the Singapore Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Ang Sin Hock</span> at [77]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In considering what recommendations we should make … we have constantly borne in mind what we conceive to be the accepted function of the law of limitation. In the first place, it is intended to protect defendants from being vexed by stale claims relating to long-past incidents about which their records may no longer be in existence and as to which their witnesses, even if they are still available, may well have no accurate recollection. Secondly, we apprehend that the law of limitation is designed to encourage plaintiffs not to go to sleep on their rights but to institute proceedings as soon as it is reasonably possible for them to do so. … Thirdly, the law is intended to ensure that the person may with confidence feel that after a given time he may treat as being finally closed an incident which might have led to a claim against him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 As I mentioned earlier, limitations law has to balance what is fair to claimants who would wish to have as long a period as possible to bring their claims, and what is fair to defendants who should be protected from stale claims. With these considerations in mind, I am of the view that it is reasonable, after looking at the one-day test and the fact that it would be unfair to potential claimants, to effectively backdate the commencement of the limitation period and the running of time (<span class="font-italic">ie</span> to 0000 hrs of the day of the accrual of the action), to <span class="font-italic">exclude</span> the date of the accrual of the cause of action in the computation of time for the purposes of limitation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 The one-day test which was purportedly ascribed to Lord Tenterden CJ in <span class="font-italic">Pellew</span><span class="font-italic"> v The Inhabitants of the Hundred of Wonford in the County of Devon </span>(1829) 9 B &amp; C 134 (“<span class="font-italic">Pellew</span>”), and subsequently applied in <span class="font-italic">Webb v </span><span class="font-italic">Fairmaner </span>at 477, <span class="font-italic">Young v </span><span class="font-italic">Higgon </span>at 54, <span class="font-italic">In re Ra</span><span class="font-italic">ilway Sleepers Supply Company </span>(1885) 29 Cd D 204 at 207, and <span class="font-italic">Radcliffe v Bartholomew</span> at 163–164, was raised as an example (on close reading) by Lord Tenterden CJ in <span class="font-italic">Pellew</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>not actually as an arbitrary rule but as a test of reasonableness to aid the construction of the statutory provision in question in that case.

Including the first day would mean that the claimant would have only a minute to bring the action. Even if the relevant period was a week or seven days, including the first day would lead to the effective <span class="font-italic">backdating</span> of the commencement of the running of time by a whole day less a minute. Depriving claimants of the fraction of the day that has passed from midnight to the precise time of accrual of the cause of action would unduly prejudice them by not affording them the <span class="font-italic">whole</span> of the limitation period clearly provided for. Considering the severe effect of a system of limitation that bars claims offending the requisite limitation timeline and which has no sympathy for claimants where even “a delay of one day would not be a good reason to allow a claim offending the requisite limitation timeline to proceed” (see <span class="font-italic">Ang Sin Hock </span>at [78]), the balance to be struck in this situation should fall in favour of potential claimants.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 With the passage of time and the ebbs and flows of the tide of the common law, Sir William Grant MR’s comments in <span class="font-italic">Lester v Garland</span> have come to be seen as laying down a general principle as to the computation of time despite his express reservations regarding an absolute rule. However, blind applications of technical rules without considering the context of statutory language would be unwise and may result in injustice. In the present case, the conclusion to exclude the date of the accrual of the cause of action is sound and fair, and is one that accords with the context and purpose of the Limitation Act.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Thus, even without the benefit of resorting to s 50(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Interpretation Act, I would still hold that the date on which the appellant’s cause of action accrued is to be excluded for the purposes of computing the three-year limitation period under s 24A(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Limitation Act.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Interpreting “period of </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">days</span><span class="font-weight-bold">” in s 50(</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">a</span><span class="font-weight-bold">) Interpretation Act</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 The next issue relates to a narrow point of construction regarding s 50(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Interpretation Act.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> I agree that the expression “period of days” does not bar the application of s 50(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Interpretation Act to statutory provisions that refer to time periods not expressed in units of days.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Guidance from foreign jurisdictions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 It would also be useful to consider the interpretation of provisions found in Interpretation statutes in foreign jurisdictions that are <span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">pari materia </span>with s 50(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Interpretation Act. Apart from Malaysia and Hong Kong, many other Commonwealth jurisdictions have adopted the same provisions on computation of time. For our purposes though, the foreign authorities that are on point are scant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 In Malaysia, the Johor Bahru Federal Court in <span class="font-italic">Setali</span><span class="font-italic"> Development Sdn Bhd &amp; another v Lim You Keng</span> [1984] 1 MLJ 26 applied s 54(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Malaysian Interpretation Act 1967 (exactly worded like s 50(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) in Singapore’s Interpretation Act) in the computation of the time period of “one month” under r 56 of the Rules of the Federal Court 1980 (M’sia) which disallowed appeals without leave after the expiration of one month. The court did not seem to find any difficulty with applying s 54(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) in spite of the unitary reference to “days”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 However, the courts in Hong Kong have reached a different conclusion. In <span class="font-italic">Li Tat Kong v Official Receiver &amp; another </span>[2001] HKEC 35 (“<span class="font-italic">Li Tat Kong</span>”), the Hong Kong Court of Appeal interpreted the reference to “period of days” in s 71(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Interpretation and General Clauses Ordinance 1966 (Cap 1) (HK) (“Hong Kong’s Interpretation Ordinance”) literally to mean period of “days” only and “not a period of weeks, months or years” in its interpretation of the reference to “period” in a subsequent sub-section. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Similarly, in <span class="font-italic">Secretary for Justice v Maxim's Caterers Ltd</span> [2009] 4 HKLRD 723 which dealt with the interpretation of s 26 of the Magistrates Ordinance (Cap 227) (HK) that required any information in respect of an offence to be laid “within 6 months from the time when the matter of such information …arose”, the Deputy Judge adopted the reasoning in <span class="font-italic">Li Tat Kong</span> that s 71(1) of Hong Kong’s Interpretation Ordinance was “relevant clearly to the computation of a period of days rather than weeks, months or years”. However, she eventually allowed the appeal and held that the six-month time limit excluded the day of the offence by resorting to the common law position (at [9]–[10]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is…clear that at common law, the computation of time does not include the day upon which the offence occurred, and the appellant argues that as a matter of statutory construction, it also must be the same, citing s.71(1) of Cap.1</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Although I agree with respondent counsel’s argument that s.71(1) of Cap.1 is relevant clearly to the computation of a period of days rather than weeks, months or years (see <span class="font-italic">Li Tat Kong v Official Receiver</span> [2001] 1 HKC 207), I do not accept that it, therefore, by implication means that the common law provision has been in any way abrogated by the absence of wordings of weeks, months or years in Cap.1.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 To a certain extent, it would not totally fly against logic to consider that any time period could be a “period of days”, with a day being a smaller unit that makes up time periods expressed in weeks, months, years, etc.. In <span class="font-italic">Prowse v McIntyre</span>, Windeyer J referred to the coming of age of a person as the “end of a period of days” in, apparently treating all time periods (that may extend to years and decades) as essentially “period[s] of days” (at 280). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 However, it would also not be inaccurate to consider the fact that larger units of time vary in length and are not the same. Months and years vary in length and ought to be taken as months and years respectively in computing the passage of time. When computing time by calendar months for example, time is reckoned by looking at the calendar and not by counting days. Thus, one calendar month from any given day of a given month is held to expire upon arriving at the first moment of the corresponding day in the next month. A period of one month starting on 2 January will expire upon the first moment of 2 February (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the end date of the period is 1 Feburary). This principle is also termed the “corresponding date rule” (see <span class="font-italic">Jeow</span><span class="font-italic"> Fong Mei v Chong Mee Yoke</span> [1996] 1 MLJ 387, following <span class="font-italic">Migotti</span><span class="font-italic"> v Colvill</span>, and also the House of Lords’ decision in <span class="font-italic">Dodds</span><span class="font-italic"> v Walker </span>[1981] 2 All ER 609). For further illustration of how the unit of expression used is important, the time periods expressed as 30 days, four weeks and a month from 1 January 2016 (assuming 1 January 2016 is excluded) would all actually result in different end dates: namely 31 January 2016, 29 January 2016 and 1 February 2016.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Historical development of s 50(</span><span class="font-weight-bold">a</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">) of the Interpretation Act</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 Looking at the historical development of the provision though, it would seem that the phrase “period of days” in s 50(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) was intended to refer to time periods <span class="font-italic">in general</span>, regardless of the base unit of time they are expressed in.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 Section 50(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) can be traced back to the first legislative provision dealing with the computation of time in s 16 of the Interpretation Act 1867 (SS Act No 14 of 1867) passed by the Straits Settlements Legislative Council, which seemed to codify the common principle then to exclude the first day (by 1838 in <span class="font-italic">Webb v </span><span class="font-italic">Fairmaner</span>, Parke B had treated the 1808 decision in <span class="font-italic">Lester v Garland </span>as laying down this “sound rule”), with reference to time as “computed by days”:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Whenever by any such Written Law <span class="font-italic">time is to be computed by days from a certain day</span>, the first day, or the day from which such time is to be computed, shall be excluded and the last day shall be included in such computation.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 The enactment of the General Clauses Ordinance 1888 (SS Ord No 1 of 1888) subsequently repealed the Interpretation Act 1867 and the provision was redrafted as such in s 10(1):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In all Ordinances –</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(1.) For the purpose of excluding the first in a <span class="font-italic">series of days or any period of time</span> it shall be deemed to have been and to be sufficient to use the word “from.”</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 In this iteration of the principles relevant to the computation of time in statutes (which continued to be in this form in the subsequent Interpretation Ordinance 1912 (SS Ord No 6 of 1912) which replaced the General Clauses Ordinance 1888), it is clear that, at least by 1888, the exclusion of the first day in the computation of a time period is a principle that applies to “any period of time”, regardless of the unit of time used to express it in.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 The current statutory language of s 50(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) in the Interpretation Act only came about when s 36(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Interpretation and General Clauses Ordinance 1948 (Ord No 7 of 1948) was enacted in the Malayan Union:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">36. In computing time for the purposes of any written law, unless the contrary intention appears—</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) a period of days from the happening of an event or the doing of any act or thing shall be deemed to be exclusive of the day in which the event happens or the act of thing is done;</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 This same phrasing was then adopted in s 40(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Interpretation and General Clauses Ordinance 1951 (No 4 of 1951), which was passed by the Legislative Council of the Colony of Singapore, repealing the Straits Settlements’ Interpretation Ordinance 1912. The provision as currently worded was then preserved from the Interpretation Act 1965 (No 10 of 1965) onwards.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 From this brief historical survey, it would seem that the phrase “period of days” should not be narrowly interpreted as, without any indication otherwise, I would assume that the principles on computation of time in the interpretation statutes are intended to remain unchanged. Section 10(1) of the General Clauses Ordinance 1888 clearly refers to time periods in general, and even statutorily references the common law general rule in construing the word “from” in the computation of time. Thus, I find that s 50(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) refers to time periods in general and applies to the computation of the three-year period in s 24A(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Limitation Act.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 More importantly, this construction accords with the context and purpose of the Limitation Act. I also note that this is consistent with other statutory provisions in Commonwealth jurisdictions which express the same principle but with clearer and express reference to “period[s] of time” or “time” in general, instead of “periods of days”: see s 35(2) of the Interpretation Act 1999 (No 85) (New Zealand); s 26(4) of the Interpretation Act, C 1985, (c I-21) (Canada); s 39(2) of the Interpretation Act 1954 (Cap 33) (Northern Ireland); and s 36(1) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (No 2) (Australia).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 In conclusion, s 50(a) of the Interpretation Act is applicable in determining how to compute time for the purposes of s 24A(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Limitation Act. However, even if I am wrong on the point that s 50(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) should not be narrowly construed to only apply to time periods expressed strictly in units of days, I would reach the same conclusion by following the general rule at common law, which excludes the day of the cause of action in computing the limitation period (see [41]–[51] and [64]–[71] above). Hence, in computing the period of three years from the relevant event, that is, the date of the accrual of the cause of action, the day that the event happened shall be <span class="font-italic">excluded</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 In the present case, the appellant’s cause of action arose on the day of the accident on 7 January 2012. With 7 January 2012 excluded from the computation, time only started running on 8 January 2012 with 7 January 2015 being the last day for the appellant to bring the action against the respondent. Thus, the action in MC/MC 357/2015 which was instituted on 7 January 2015 is not time-barred. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 For the reasons stated, the appellant’s appeal in HC/RAS 9/2016 against the decision of the District Judge is allowed.<span style="color: rgba(255,0,0,1)"> </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 I will hear parties on costs if no agreement is reached. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Chan Seng Onn<br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Gong Chin Nam (Hin Tat Augustine &amp; Partners) for the plaintiff/appellant;<br/>Frances Angeline Shanti d/o Thanarajoo (Tan Kok Quan Partnership) for the defendant/respondent.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
