</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The charges which the Accused pleaded guilty to speak for themselves in showing the sordid nature of his sexual depravity and transgressions. After considering the submissions on sentence, I took into account the relevant sentencing principles, precedents, the charges that were taken into consideration (being the 4th, 5th, 7th, and 8th charges) for the purposes of sentencing, and the Accused’s plea of guilt. I sentenced the Accused as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Fourteen years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane for the first charge of penetrating, with his penis, the mouth of his six-year-old daughter without her consent, an offence under s 376(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Revised Edition) (“Penal Code”), punishable under s 376(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the same (“the 1st charge”).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Six years’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane, and a fine of $6,000 (in default 1 month’s imprisonment) for the second charge of recruiting his wife for the purpose of sexual exploitation, by placing her in fear of being physically assaulted if she refused to prostitute herself, an offence under s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Prevention of Human Trafficking Act (No 45 of 2014) (“PHTA”), punishable under s 4(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the same (“the 2nd charge”).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Six years’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane, and a fine of $6,000 (in default 1 month’s imprisonment) for the third charge of knowingly receiving payments amounting to a total of $10,930 in connection with the sexual exploitation of his wife, who was a trafficked victim at the material time, an offence under s 6(1) PHTA, punishable under s 6(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the same (“the 3rd charge”).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Five and a half years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane for the sixth charge of using criminal force on his 13-year-old niece by removing her bra and T-shirt and touching and licking her breasts and nipples and kissing her neck and face, with intent to outrage her modesty. In order to facilitate the offence, he wrongfully restrained his niece by pushing and pinning her to the bed, thereby committing an offence punishable under s 354A(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Penal Code (“the 6th charge”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 Thereafter, considering the one-transaction rule and the totality principle, I ordered the sentences for the 1st, 2nd and 6th charges to run consecutively, while the sentence for the 3rd charge was to run concurrently. The Accused’s global sentence was 25 and a half years’ imprisonment, 24 strokes of the cane and a $12,000 fine (in default 2 months’ imprisonment). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 Dissatisfied, the Accused has appealed against the sentence for being manifestly excessive. I therefore detail the grounds of my decision herein.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The bare charges belie the severity of the Accused’s misdeeds, which warrant exposition in detail. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The Statement of Facts which the Accused pleaded guilty to without qualification disclosed the following:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">1 The Accused is 27-year[s]-old … At the material time of the offences, the Accused was unemployed</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">2 The Victims are:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">a. the Accused’s biological daughter, … who was 6 years old at the time of the offence;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">b. the Accused’s niece, … who was 13 years old at the time of the offences; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">c. the Accused’s wife, … she is also [the Accused’s niece’s] aunt.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts relating to the 1st Charge</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">(Sexual assault by penetration of a person under 14 years of age)</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">6 The assault involving [the Accused’s daughter] occurred … while the Accused and his family were residing at the Hotel … On the material date, the Accused had engaged in a round of sexual intercourse with [his wife] when she left the bed to use the toilet. The Accused’s 6-year-old daughter … and 4-month-old son … were lying on a separate mattress next to the bed. The Accused, who was in a state of arousal post-intercourse, noticed that [his daughter] was awake and beckoned her to come to him, with the intention of making her suck his penis. At the time, the Accused was wearing only a T-shirt, with his genital area completely exposed.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">7 On her father’s instructions, [the Accused’s daughter] obediently made her way to the bed. The Accused instructed [his daughter] to sit in between his legs and pushed her head towards his penis. When [his daughter] resisted and tried to shy away from her father’s penis, the Accused forcibly inserted his penis into [his daughter’s] mouth and demanded that she suck his penis on the count of three. [His daughter] felt like vomiting as the Accused’s penis had penetrated her throat too deeply, and she refused to comply with the Accused’s demands to suck his penis. Notwithstanding [his daughter’s] refusal, the Accused forcibly gripped [her] hair and guided her head in an up-and-down motion to achieve his objective. Although [his daughter] tried to push the Accused away, she was unsuccessful and was thus forced to fellate the Accused against her will.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">8 … The entire episode of forced fellatio lasted several minutes and comprised multiple penetrations. After the assault, the Accused warned [his wife] and [his daughter] not to tell anyone about what had happened, and threatened to beat them up if they dared to disobey him. [His daughter] felt scared as a result of the incident and was afraid of sleeping alone. She also felt angry at the Accused for violating her in this fashion.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">9 At the time of the incident, the Accused suspected that he had a sexually transmitted disease (“<span class="font-weight-bold">STD</span>”) as he had been experiencing uncommon white discharge from his urethra, in addition to dysuria (painful or difficult urination). Fearing that he had contracted an STD, the Accused proceeded to seek medical treatment … after his arrest, … he was formally diagnosed with an STD. Despite his suspicions that he had contracted an STD – which were subsequently confirmed – the Accused nevertheless callously forced [his daughter] to fellate him, thus placing her at risk of contracting an STD herself …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background to the offences against [his wife]</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">13 The Accused and [his wife] entered into a relationship in 2008 and married in 2012. The Accused began physically abusing [her] in 2009 over trivial matters. Over time, the assaults against [her], which involved slapping her face, pulling her hair, hitting her head against the cupboard as well as kicking and punching her body and face, increased in both frequency and severity. From June 2015, the Accused assaulted [his wife] at least once a week. The abuse persisted throughout [her] pregnancies.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">14 The abuse caused [his wife] to be very fearful of the Accused. [His wife] was so afraid of him that she no longer dared to use her handphone or contact her own family members as the Accused explicitly disallowed her from doing so. [His wife] was also constantly stressed as she had to listen very carefully to the Accused for fear that she would make a mistake when complying with his directions to her, and risk getting physically assaulted again. [His wife] did not report the abuse to the Police as the Accused had previously threatened to kill her if she made the abuse known.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts relating to the 2nd Charge</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">(Procuring a woman for the purpose of prostitution)</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">16 In July 2016, … the Accused suggested that [his wife] prostitute herself to pay for their infant son’s diapers, milk powder and other general household expense. The Accused rejected [his wife’s] request to apply for a normal job and insisted that prostitution was a quick and lucrative means of earning money to sustain their family. However, the Accused himself remained unemployed at the time. He rejected the notion that he had to work to earn money for the family, and instead demanded that [his wife] support their household as the sole breadwinner by prostituting herself for profit.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">17 When [his wife] resisted the Accused’s demands to prostitute herself, he badgered her persistently for three days knowing that she was afraid of him as she told him she did not want to be assaulted again. [His wife] eventually succumbed to his pressure, fearing that the Accused’s physical assaults would intensify if she continued to disobey him. She also needed money to buy milk powder for their infant son who was then only 3 months old.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">18 On the Accused’s instructions, [his wife] began soliciting for customers [online]. The Accused was familiar with the online prostitution trade as he had frequented various online platforms to engage prostitutes for himself.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">20 … The Accused also forced his wife to abide by a daily quota of customers. If the quota was not met, she had to compensate for it the following day by securing more customers.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">21 In addition to prostituting herself, the Accused directed [his wife] to secretly record her sexual acts with customers and demanded that she provide these recordings to him thereafter. The Accused did so as he had a deviant fetish for seeing his wife engaging in sexual acts with other men. [His wife] complied with each of the Accused’s demands out of fear.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">22 The Accused closely monitored [his wife’s] movements throughout the period of prostitution (June to 19 August 2016) and would scold and assault her if she failed to respond to his calls, secure enough customers, or earn enough money. On one occasion, when [his wife] was trying to solicit for customers online, the Accused kicked her head as he felt she was taking too long. He then rained punches on her. On another occasion, the Accused punched [his wife’s] left ear, causing it to bleed. There were also instances when the Accused punched [his wife] on her face because he was jealous due to the sexual positions she adopted when engaging in intercourse with her customers, or when her clients paid her less than the agreed-upon amount.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">23 In yet another incident, the Accused insisted that [his wife] provide sexual services to a former classmate [of hers] who had engaged her services [without] knowing who she was. The Accused demanded that [his wife] either take her [former] classmate’s money and leave, or persuade him to engage in a threesome with them. The Accused was dissatisfied when [his wife] opted for the former, and punched her repeatedly until she acquiesced to his demand for a threesome.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">24 On the Accused’s instructions, [his wife] met her [former] classmate in the hotel room whilst the Accused hid in the bathroom. As [his wife] fellated her [former] classmate, the Accused emerged from the toilet and watched the duo. When the customer left, the Accused began punching [his wife] as he was unhappy that she had failed to persuade her [former] classmate to engage in a threesome. In the course of the altercation, the Accused hit [his wife] with a dumbbell and demanded that she solicit for more customers.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">25 Desperate to appease the Accused, [his wife] complied and began looking for more customers online, albeit unsuccessfully. She eventually pacified the Accused by fellating him until he fell asleep.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">26 Investigations revealed that the Accused’s physical and verbal abuse of [his wife] persisted throughout the period of prostitution …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts relating to the 3rd Charge</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">(Receiving payment in connection with exploitation of trafficked victim)</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">27 … Between June 2016 and 19 August 2016, [his wife] provided sexual services to approximately 138 customers, serving an average of 3 to 5 customers a day. She earned an estimated $10,930 and handed all her earnings to the Accused.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts relating to the 6th Charge</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">(Outraging the modesty of [his niece] on 1 August 2016)</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">31 … on 1 August 2016, the Accused insisted that [his wife] bring her niece … to him. … Fearful of the Accused’s threats, [his wife] eventually complied with the Accused’s demands …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">33 [His wife] took [her niece] to [the Hotel] which she had booked on the Accused’s instructions. … the Accused direct[ed] her to instruct [her niece] to take a shower. While [her niece] was having a shower, [his wife] left the room, met the Accused in the lobby, handed him the room key and told him not to hurt [her niece]. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">34 The Accused proceeded to [the Hotel room], undressed himself and waited for [his niece] to finish her shower. When [his niece] emerged from the toilet, the Accused hugged her from behind, pushed her onto the bed, climbed atop her and pinned her to the bed with his body. Despite [his niece’s] repeated attempts at resisting the Accused, he managed to remove her T-shirt and bra and began touching, fondling and squeezing her breasts. He then licked her nipples and breasts and kissed her neck and face.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">35 [His niece] cried throughout and despite efforts to push the Accused away, was unable to do so. When she tried to shout for help, he covered her mouth and nose with his hand. He then placed a pillow over her face to muffle her screams. After a while, [his niece] stopped struggling as she could no longer breathe. The Accused panicked, ceased the sexual assault on his niece and removed the pillow. He then called [his wife] and asked her to return to the room. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 The Accused’s psychiatric reports from the Institute of Mental Health (“IMH”) disclosed that he was somewhat boastful of his sexual exploits.

</div> Dr Cheow Enquan (“Dr Cheow”) also opined in his report on the Accused dated 16 September 2016 that the Accused “continues to pose a risk to his daughter”, and “also a high risk of violence towards his wife”.

As See Kee Oon J (“See J”) observed in <span class="font-italic">GBR v Public Prosecutor and another appeal </span>[2018] 3 SLR 1048 (“<span class="font-italic">GBR v </span><span class="font-italic">PP</span>”) at [29(f)]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I note that s 354(2) is itself a provision that deals with outrage of modesty of a child below the age of 14.

Instead of protecting his own daughter from harm, the Accused flagrantly abused his position as the victim’s father, forcing her to fellate him against her own will.

</div> The entire chain of events speak for themselves in showing the Accused’s despicable misuse of his position of trust as the victim’s biological father, and cannot be condoned in any way. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 Overlaying the Accused’s abuse of his position of trust was the Accused’s propensity for preying on vulnerable women who were the close to him, and who did not have the physical and/or psychological will to resist his sordid acts. As the charges disclosed, apart from sexually assaulting his own daughter, the Accused had sexually assaulted his young niece on at least three occasions (forming the 6th to 8th charges). Furthermore, he had physically and verbally abused his own wife to the point that she became compliant to his every demand, going so far as to prostitute herself. This demonstrated the Accused’s disregard for his privilege (and the responsibilities that flow from it) as the parent, uncle, or husband to the women in his life, whom he callously utilised for his own means. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Third, in the course of achieving his desired fellatio, the Accused blatantly disregarded his daughter’s welfare. In <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span>, the Court of Appeal considered at [44(i)] that it would be aggravating for a sexual offender to assault his victim with knowledge that he is suffering from a life-threatening sexually transmitted disease (“STD”). Here, while the Accused had not yet been diagnosed with a STD at the material time, he suspected that he had a STD due to the visible uncommon white discharge coming from his urethra, as well as the dysuria (painful or difficult urination) which he felt.

The Accused punched his wife repeatedly until she acquiesced to his demand for a threesome between himself, his wife, and the former classmate. However, when his desired threesome did not materialise, the Accused began punching his wife, and, in the course of the altercation, hit her with a dumbbell and demanded that she solicit more customers.

</div>
</div> In this regard, Mr Ng pointed out that the PHTA was passed to address “a lucrative transnational crime” (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates</span>, <span class="font-italic">Official Report </span>(3 November 2014) vol 92 (Mr Christopher de Souza, Deputy Speaker) (“PHTA Debates”)).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 While the driving force for the PHTA may have been to curb transnational trafficking of persons, the broad statutory provisions, which do not distinguish between transnational or entirely domestic cases of trafficking, demonstrates that the Act was intended to weed out <span class="font-italic">all </span>forms of human trafficking, however committed. As the Deputy Speaker observed in the PHTA Debates:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[H]uman trafficking is real; it is cruel; and it must be stemmed. We, as a society, must speak up for the voiceless and helpless by sending as strong a signal as we can against these serious crimes. Indeed, this is the ethos of the Bill. To prevent TIP (trafficking-in-persons) from taking root in our community, <span class="font-italic">our laws have to be comprehensive yet targeted, possess sufficient bite to punish perpetrators and deter would-be offenders, </span>and offer protection and support to those in need. … [The Bill] raises our standards of fighting TIP both <span class="font-italic">locally and internationally</span> … [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Hence, to hold that trafficking of an entirely domestic nature reduces the Accused’s culpability would fly in the face of the intention of the PHTA, which seeks to comprehensively deter trafficking, both “locally and internationally”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 This is supported by s 4(2)(<span class="font-italic">g</span>) of the PHTA, which provides that “[i]n determining the appropriate sentence for an offence [of trafficking in persons], the court may take into account the aggravating factors … including the following: … (<span class="font-italic">g</span>) the offender was the trafficked victim’s spouse”. Cases involving the trafficking of one’s own spouse, as in the present, are likely to lack transnational characteristics. Yet, the Act expressly provides that such forms of trafficking may be considered aggravated.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 As a result, I found that the Accused’s culpability was not lowered simply because the trafficking was entirely domestic in this case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">High level of harm</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 I also found that the degree of harm inflicted on his wife was of a high level. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Apart from using persistent violence against her, he also levelled systematic psychological abuse against her (<span class="font-italic">Poh Boon </span><span class="font-italic">Kiat </span>at [76(a)(iii)]), making her do degrading and dangerous things such as secretly recording her sexual acts with customers and to provide such recordings to the Accused so as to satisfy his deviant fetish of seeing his wife engaging in sexual acts with other men.

As disclosed by the 7th and 8th charges which were taken into consideration, the Accused had outraged the modesty of his niece by touching and rubbing her breasts on two earlier occasions. Fuelled by this, the Accused then demanded that his wife, who was subservient to his demands due to her fear of him, pick his niece up from school and bring her to the hotel, which she had booked on the Accused’s instructions. At the hotel, as per his instructions, his wife then brought his niece to the room to shower, and left the room to pass the Accused the keys to the room. When left in the room with his niece alone, the Accused accordingly undressed, and waited for his niece to finish her shower. After which, the Accused proceeded to assault her.

Here, the victim missed her Primary School Leaving Examinations (“PSLE”) as a result of the Accused’s demand that his wife was to pick the victim up from school on the morning of the offence. Fortunately, her principal made special arrangements for the victim to sit for her PSLE examination in the afternoon on the same day. Despite the distressing ordeal which would have properly explained her absence, the victim did not recount the events that had unfolded earlier to her principal, and instead sat for her examination,

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 As See J observed in <span class="font-italic">GBR</span> <span class="font-italic">v PP </span>at [34], cases “involving the skin-to-skin touching of the victim’s private parts of sexual organs” would fall at the higher end of the spectrum of Band 2 cases. Furthermore, cases with two or more aggravating factors would invariably fall within Band 2. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Here, there were multiple aggravating factors atop the skin-to-skin touching of the victim’s breasts and nipples, as explored above. In the circumstances, I was satisfied that the offence fell within Band 2 <span class="font-italic">at the very least</span>. While I gave weight to the Accused’s plea of guilt, I also considered that there were charges taken into consideration detailing two separate occasions whereby he had touched the same victim’s breasts under the cover of a darkened cinema. In the circumstances, I considered that five and a half years’ imprisonment with six strokes of the cane, being a sentence which falls in the middle of Band 2 in the adapted framework (at [55] above), was appropriate.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Global sentence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Having determined the appropriate sentence for each charge, I determined that the sentence for the 3rd charge ought to run concurrently, as the 3rd charge flowed from the Accused’s sexual exploitation of his wife, which was the subject of the 2nd charge. This was aligned with the one-transaction principle (see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v </span><span class="font-italic">Raveen Balakrishnan </span>[2018] 5 SLR 799 at [54]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 I also decided that the sentences for the 1st, 2nd and 6th charge ought to run consecutively. This was commensurate with the high culpability of the Accused, as well as the severe harm he had inflicted on each of his three victims. This was also aligned with the sentencing principles.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Sentencing principles</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 In cases of egregious sexual depravity, as in the present, general deterrence is a key sentencing consideration. As V K Rajah J (as he then was) observed in <span class="font-italic">PP</span><span class="font-italic"> v NF </span>at [42]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[O]ur courts would be grievously remiss if they did not send an unequivocal and uncompromising message to all would-be sex offenders that abusing a relationship or a position of authority in order to gratify sexual impulse will inevitably be met with the harshest penal consequences. In such cases, the sentencing principle of general deterrence must figure prominently and be unmistakably reflected in the sentencing equation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Apart from the principle of general deterrence, I also found that retribution was a relevant sentencing consideration in the present case, given the significant harm the Accused had caused to his victims. In particular, his wife had suffered at his hands for a prolonged period, starting in 2009, and ending only in August 2016. Furthermore, while the Accused would be released upon the completion of his sentence, the trauma and emotional distress felt by his young victims (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, his daughter and his niece) will likely follow them for the rest of their lives. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Specific deterrence was also a relevant sentencing consideration. Here, the IMH psychiatrist reported that the Accused did not have a treatable mental disorder, and that his mental state did not have a contributory link to the offences.
