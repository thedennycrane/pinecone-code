        Chan Sek Keong CJ (delivering the judgment of the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       There are before us two appeals and an
                    application for leave to appeal by Astrata (Singapore) Pte Ltd
                    (“Astrata”) against the decisions of the Judge (“the
                    Judge”) in, respectively, Originating Summons No 171 of 2010
                    (“the Injunction Application”), Originating Summons No 690 of
                    2010 (“the Declaration Application”) and Summons No 3264 of
                    2010 (“the Stay Application”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The respondents in the proceedings before us are
                    Tridex Technologies Pte Ltd (“Tridex”) and Portcullis Escrow Pte
                    Ltd (“PEPL”). The judgment in respect of the two appeals is

                    leave to appeal is made in Originating Summons No 1082 of 2010 (“the
                    Leave Application”) is reported in <em>Portcullis Escrow

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Astrata is a company incorporated in Singapore
                    and is part of the Astrata group of companies, of which the ultimate holding
                    company is Astrata Group Incorporated (“AGI”), a company
                    incorporated in Nevada, USA. Astrata is in the business of designing and
                    developing advanced location-based information technology services and solutions
                    that combine global positioning systems, wireless communication (satellite or
                    terrestrial) and geographical information technology. These solutions enable
                    businesses, institutions and governments to monitor, trace and control the
                    movement and status of machinery vehicles, personnel or other
                assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       In a Supply Agreement dated 10 April 2007
                    (“the Supply Agreement”), Astrata agreed to develop and supply an
                    electronic plate system to Tridex. The Supply Agreement was defined as
                    comprising the Supply Agreement itself and any Points of Agreement
                    (“PoA”) between Astrata and Tridex, of which 12 were eventually
                    executed. The Supply Agreement provided for arbitration with respect to any
                    disputes between the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Pursuant to PoA #7 dated 10 October 2007,
                    Astrata, Tridex and PEPL entered into a tripartite Escrow Agreement (“the
                    Escrow Agreement”) on 23 October 2007. The Escrow Agreement
                    designated PEPL as the Escrow Agent to hold in escrow the Comprehensive Source
                    Code and the Comprehensive Engineering Diagrams (collectively “the Escrow
                    Property”) which Astrata was required to deliver to Tridex under the
                    Supply Agreement. The Escrow Agreement also stipulated in cll 7(i)(c) and
                    7(ii)(b) a list of events on the occurrence of any of which PEPL was obliged to
                    release the Escrow Property to Tridex (the “triggering events” or
                    a “triggering event”, as the case may be). We will refer to these
                    contractual arrangements in more detail later.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">How disputes came about</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Disagreements developed between Astrata and
                    Tridex under the Supply Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. The dispute surfaced
                    after AGI sought Chapter 11 reorganisation under the United States Bankruptcy
                    Code on 6 August 2009, after a failed voluntary restructuring proposal. Its
                    final Reorganisation Plan (“the Reorganisation Plan”) was
                    confirmed by the competent United States court on 15 December 2009 and became
                    effective on 4 January 2010 (“AGI’s Chapter 11”).
                    AGI’s Chapter 11 resulted in a change of shareholder control of AGI and is
                    now controlled by a new shareholder called Fame Trading Ltd holding 94.5% of the
                    shares in AGI.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       On 5 February 2010, Tridex purported to
                    terminate the Supply Agreement on the ground that Astrata had breached its
                    obligations under the Supply Agreement. On the same day, Tridex wrote to PEPL
                    stating that it was invoking its rights under the Escrow Agreement on the ground
                    that a triggering event in cl 7(i)(c) had occurred, <em>viz</em>, AGI’s Chapter 11 which in Tridex’s view
                    constituted an arrangement for the benefit of AGI’s creditors. Tridex
                    further notified PEPL that it would call for the delivery of the Comprehensive
                    Source Code at the appropriate time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Astrata objected to Tridex’s claim that
                    AGI’s Chapter 11 was a triggering event, and in a letter dated
                    9 February 2010, instructed PEPL not to release the Escrow Property as
                    AGI’s scheme of arrangement was “for the purpose of a genuine
                    amalgamation or reconstruction” (as per the language in cll 7(i)(c)
                    and 7(ii)(b) of the Escrow Agreement: see also <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a> below). In this judgment, we shall refer to this dispute as
                    “the Bilateral Dispute”. In the same letter, Astrata also sought
                    confirmation from PEPL that it had not delivered the Escrow Property to Tridex.
                    When Astrata did not receive any response from PEPL, Astrata filed the
                    Injunction Application to restrain (a) Tridex from requiring PEPL to
                    deliver the Escrow Property, and (b) PEPL from delivering the Escrow
                    Property, pending the determination of the Bilateral Dispute by an arbitral
                    tribunal under the Supply Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       PEPL responded by filing an interpleader summons
                    which it later withdrew in order to file the Declaration Application (which also
                    included interpleader relief). The declaration sought was whether “the
                    conditions in cl 7(i)(c) and cl 7(ii)(b) had been satisfied”,
                        <em>ie</em>, any triggering event had occurred, thereby
                    entitling PEPL to release the Escrow Property to Tridex. In response to the
                    filing of the Declaration Application, Astrata filed the Stay Application
                    pursuant to s 11A of the International Arbitration Act (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev
                    Ed) (“IAA”) to stay the hearing of the Declaration Application
                    until the Bilateral Dispute has been determined by an arbitral tribunal to be
                    appointed under the Supply Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Material issues in this case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     In this judgment, instead of discussing the
                    Judge’s decisions and his reasoning with reference to the Injunction
                    Application, the Stay Application or the Declaration Application, we shall only
                    consider the two material issues that have arisen from the facts of this case.
                    The first (under Civil Appeal No 158 of 2010) is whether the Bilateral
                    Dispute is subject to cl 29.1 (the arbitration clause) in the Supply
                    Agreement (“the Jurisdiction Issue”). If the Bilateral Dispute is
                    referable to arbitration, the second issue (under Civil Appeal No 159 of
                    2010) will not arise and the proceedings in this case will be stayed pending the
                    outcome of the arbitration which Astrata has already initiated under
                    cl 29.1 of the Supply Agreement. If the Bilateral Dispute is <em>not</em> referable to arbitration, however, the second issue
                    arises as to whether AGI’s Chapter 11 is a triggering event under
                    cll 7(i)(c) and 7(ii)(b) of the Escrow Agreement (“the Substantive
                    Issue”). If the Substantive Issue is decided against Astrata, Tridex
                    would be entitled to call for delivery of the Escrow Property from PEPL.
                    Conversely, if the Substantive Issue is decided in Astrata’s favour,
                    Tridex would not be entitled to delivery of the Escrow Property. Accordingly,
                    the disposition of Astrata’s application in Originating Summons
                    No 1082 of 2010, for leave to appeal against the Judge’s declaration
                    in the Judgment that cll 7(i)(c) and 7(ii)(b) had been satisfied on the
                    facts (<em>viz</em>, the Leave Application), would hinge on
                    the outcome of the Substantive Issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     With respect to the Jurisdictional Issue, the
                    Judge held that the Bilateral Dispute was not referable to arbitration under the
                    Supply Agreement, and accordingly dismissed both the Injunction Application and
                    the Stay Application. With respect to the Substantive Issue, the Judge proceeded
                    on the basis that AGI’s Chapter 11 was an arrangement for the benefit
                    of creditors and held that it constituted a triggering event under
                    cll 7(i)(c) and 7(ii)(b) of the Escrow Agreement because (a) the
                    saving clause “save for the purpose of a genuine amalgamation or
                    reconstruction” (“the Saving Clause”) did not apply to that
                    triggering event, but that even if it did, (b) AGI’s Chapter 11 was
                    not a “reconstruction” for the purposes of the Saving Clause. We
                    shall examine first the Jurisdictional Issue as it is logically prior to the
                    Substantive Issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Jurisdictional Issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The material provisions pertaining to the
                    Jurisdictional Issue are found in cll 21.1 and 29.1 of the Supply
                    Agreement, PoA #7 and cll 7, 18 and 20(c) of the Escrow
                Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Clause 21.1 of the Supply Agreement
                    (which contains the entire agreement clause) provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Subject to the [PoAs] which have been executed and shall be executed
                        between [Tridex] on one hand and [AGI] and [Astrata] on the other in
                        relation to this Supply Agreement, this Supply Agreement constitutes the
                        entire agreement between the Parties in relation to the subject matter
                        herein, and supersedes all prior representations, agreements, statements and
                        understandings, whether verbal or in writing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Clause 29.1 (which contains the
                    arbitration agreement between Astrata and Tridex) provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If there is a dispute relating to any claim or controversy arising out of,
                        or in connection with this Supply Agreement, including any question
                        regarding its formation, existence, validity, enforceability, performance,
                        interpretation, breach, or termination (the “Dispute”) ...
                        then the Dispute may at the election of either Party be finally settled
                        under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce by
                        one or more arbitrators appointed in accordance with the said Rules.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     PoA #7 contains the parties’ agreement
                    to put the Escrow Property into escrow, to be released to Tridex upon the
                    occurrence of any of the triggering events. Clause 1(v)(c) of PoA #7
                    provides that the Comprehensive Source Code kept by (the nominated escrow
                    agent):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1) … shall be:</p>

<p class="Judg-1">The Escrow Agreement was executed by Astrata and Tridex pursuant to
                    PoA #7, with PEPL ultimately appointed as the escrow agent.</p>

                    Escrow Agreement both prescribe the same triggering events upon the occurrence

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Clause 11 of the Escrow Agreement
                    contains the entire agreement clause as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This Escrow Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between all three
                        Parties (but not Tridex and Astrata alone) in relation to the subject matter
                        herein, and supersedes all prior representations, agreements, statements and
                        understandings, whether verbal or in writing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It may be noted that the words in parenthesis “(but not Tridex
                    and Astrata alone)” make clear that the Escrow Agreement does not
                    constitute the entire agreement between Tridex and Astrata as the Supply
                    Agreement also constitutes the entire agreement between them with respect to the
                    matters under the Supply Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Clause 18 of the Escrow Agreement
                    provides a dispute resolution mechanism and also, specifically, for submission
                    to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the “court of Singapore” in
                    relation to any Dispute (as defined therein). The clause reads as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">a) If there is a dispute relating to any claim or controversy arising out
                        of, or in connection with this Escrow Agreement, including any question
                        regarding its formation, existence, validity, enforceability, performance,
                        interpretation, breach, or termination (the “Dispute”), then
                        PEPL shall have the right to terminate this Escrow Agreement forthwith by
                        giving 30 days’ notice and require Tridex and Astrata to appoint
                        another Escrow Agent to replace PEPL, failing which PEPL shall also have the
                        right to issue an interpleader summons to place the [Escrow Property] with
                        the Singapore Court pending the outcome of the dispute between Tridex and
                        Astrata. Both Tridex and Astrata agree to be jointly and severally liable to
                        indemnify PEPL for all costs and expenses arising therefrom.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">b) The parties hereby submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the
                        court of Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in the event of a Dispute,
                        Tridex and Astrata shall continue to fulfil their respective obligations
                        under this Escrow Agreement until a settlement of the Dispute has been
                        reached.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In addition to cl 18(b), the Escrow
                    Agreement also provides a general submission to the non-exclusive jurisdiction
                    of the Singapore court in cl 20(c) as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Jurisdiction</b>: The parties hereby submit to
                        the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the court of Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     PEPL is not involved in the Bilateral Dispute
                    as the Singapore court has granted an order to PEPL to interplead and to place
                    the Escrow Property in the control of the Singapore court under the Declaration
                    Application. Accordingly, there is no trilateral dispute under the Escrow
                    Agreement in these proceedings. In our view, since the Bilateral Dispute arises
                    out of the Escrow Agreement, it would, <em>prima
                    facie</em>, fall to be resolved under the dispute resolution mechanism in
                    the Escrow Agreement unless it has been displaced by the arbitration agreement
                    between Astrata and Tridex in the Supply Agreement pursuant to which the Escrow
                    Agreement was executed (<em>ie</em>, specifically PoA #7).
                    As PEPL has been allowed to interplead, it is therefore not involved in the
                    Jurisdictional Issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Astrata’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Astrata’s case is that cl 29.1 of
                    the Supply Agreement applies to any dispute between Astrata and Tridex in
                    relation to the Escrow Property and therefore applies to the Bilateral Dispute
                    even though the Bilateral Dispute arose under the Escrow Agreement. Astrata
                    argues as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_a"></a>(a)     the Supply Agreement (including PoA
                        #7) constitutes the entire agreement between Astrata and Tridex (see
                        cl 21.1 of the Supply Agreement) and the triggering events in
                        PoA #7 are identical to those in the Escrow
                    Agreement;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_b"></a>(b)     the
                        Escrow Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between Astrata, Tridex
                        and PEPL, “but not Tridex and Astrata alone” (see cl 11
                        of the Escrow Agreement): these words are consistent with the Escrow
                        Agreement being applicable to trilateral disputes and the Supply Agreement
                        continuing to apply to bilateral disputes between Astrata and Tridex, and
                        accordingly there is no conflict between the dispute resolution mechanism in
                        the two agreements;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_c"></a>(c)     any apparent conflict between them can be reconciled, and resolved by
                        restricting the non-exclusive jurisdiction clause in the Escrow Agreement to
                        seeking curial assistance from the Singapore courts, <em>eg</em>, interim orders, as was the approach of the English
                        courts in the <em>Paul Smith</em> line of cases (see
                            <a href="#p1_30">[30]</a> below). Alternatively, the
                        Supply Agreement prevails over the Escrow Agreement as it is the commercial
                        centre of the transaction: see the approach of the court in <em>UBS AG &amp; Anor v HSH Nordbank AG</em> [2010]

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Tridex’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Tridex’s case is that the Bilateral
                    Dispute is not subject to arbitration under cl 29.1 of the Supply
                    Agreement. Tridex argues as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_a"></a>(a)     Astrata and Tridex have
                        intentionally carved out the escrow matters from the Supply Agreement and
                        put them into the Escrow Agreement to be dealt with exclusively under that
                        agreement;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_b"></a>(b)     clause 11 of the Escrow Agreement provides that the Escrow Agreement
                        constitutes the entire agreement between the three parties in relation to
                        the subject matter covered by the Escrow Agreement, and supersedes all prior
                        agreements between the parties;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_c"></a>(c)     under cl 18(b) of the Escrow Agreement, the parties
                        have agreed to submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the Singapore
                        court on any disputes relating to any claim or controversy in connection
                        with the Escrow Agreement, <em>ie</em>, any dispute
                        that arises between and/or among the three parties, or any of them, in
                        relation to the matters connected to the Escrow
                    Agreement;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_d"></a>(d)     further,
                        under cl 20(c) of the Escrow Agreement, the three parties have also
                        agreed to submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the court of Singapore
                        generally, <em>ie</em>, on all matters under the Escrow
                        Agreement;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_e"></a>(e)     clear and specific words are required to incorporate an arbitration
                        agreement which are absent from the Escrow Agreement: see <em>Transocean</em> at [18];</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_f"></a>(f)     PoA #7 did not constitute an agreement to arbitrate the escrow
                        issues: it merely provided that an escrow agreement be signed to incorporate
                        the parties’ agreements on the disposal of the Escrow
                    Property;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_g"></a>(g)     clause 4(a) of the Escrow Agreement also confirms the parties’
                        intention not to refer escrow matters to arbitration by providing that the
                        Escrow Property “shall be transferred to Tridex notwithstanding any
                        provisions otherwise in the earlier agreement(s), entered into between
                        Tridex and Astrata” if the conditions in the Escrow Agreement are
                        satisfied;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_h"></a>(h)     in
                        contrast with the Supply Agreement, the parties’ choice of Singapore
                        law as the governing law of the Escrow Agreement also reinforces the
                        parties’ intention to refer any dispute arising thereunder to court
                        adjudication;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_i"></a>(i)     
            <em>Transocean</em> is indistinguishable from the
                        present case. Furthermore, the case of <em>DLA Piper Hong
                            Kong v China Property Development (Holdings) Ltd</em> [2010] HKLRD
                        903 (“<em>DLA Piper</em>”) is analogous
                        to the facts of the present case and the reasoning of the Hong Kong Court of
                        Appeal is applicable to the present case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Our decision on the Jurisdictional Issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The Jurisdictional Issue has arisen because,
                    contrary to the views of the Judge that “these complex agreements have
                    been painstakingly drafted, advised and negotiated with the assistance of
                    lawyers” (see the Judgment at [60]), the parties’ legal advisers, if any, have
                    singularly failed to express clearly and explicitly whether any dispute between
                    Astrata and Tridex in relation to the Escrow Property is subject to arbitration
                    under cl 29.1 of the Supply Agreement in drafting PoA #7 and also the
                    Escrow Agreement. It was a simple step that should have been taken. This
                    omission has led to serious disagreement between the parties and a not
                    inconsiderable expenditure of intellectual effort by the Judge to determine
                    their intention by their words, or lack of them. As we shall see, this is not an
                    isolated failure in the present case. There is also disagreement on the meaning
                    and effect of the triggering events in cll 7(i)(c) and 7(ii)(b), because
                    the draftsman appears to have simply incorporated (what the Judge recognises as)
                    boilerplate clauses, drafted for use in the context of an English model of
                    companies insolvency legislation, into a commercial agreement to which a US
                    company is a party.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In this appeal, neither Astrata nor Tridex is
                    proceeding on the basis that there is a conflict between the Supply Agreement
                    and the Escrow Agreement. Astrata’s case is that the two agreements can be
                    read together (as was intended by the parties) to separate trilateral disputes
                    from bilateral disputes affecting the Escrow Property: the Supply Agreement,
                    being the primary entire agreement between the parties, applies to all disputes
                    between them. Tridex’s case is that the parties intended the Escrow
                    Agreement to be a self-contained agreement on all matters relating to the Escrow
                    Property, and that any dispute, whether trilateral or bilateral, relating to the
                    Escrow Property ought to be resolved under the dispute resolution mechanism as
                    set out under the Escrow Agreement. What the true answer is turns on the proper
                    construction of the terms of the Escrow Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     We do not agree with Astrata’s argument
                    that since the Escrow Agreement is a trilateral agreement, the dispute
                    resolution mechanism in cl 18 of the Escrow Agreement applies only to
                    trilateral disputes between Astrata, Tridex and PEPL, and not to any dispute
                    between Tridex and Astrata “alone”. This argument is not borne out
                    by cl 18(a) of the Escrow Agreement which, as drafted, has a much wider
                    scope in that it provides, <em>inter alia</em>, that
                        <em>if there is a dispute relating to any claim or
                        controversy arising out of, or in connection with this Escrow
                        Agreement</em>, then PEPL may interplead and place the Escrow Property
                    with the Singapore court pending the outcome of the dispute between Tridex and
                    Astrata. The italicised words above are not qualified in any way by reference to
                    the identities of the disputants and, in our view, are broad enough to refer to
                    a dispute relating to any claim or controversy arising out of the Escrow
                    Agreement between (a) Astrata and Tridex; (b) Astrata and PEPL;
                    (c) PEPL and Tridex; and (d) Astrata, Tridex and PEPL. There is no
                    reason to cut down their meaning and restrict their application only to
                    trilateral disputes. All disputes arising out of the Escrow Agreement are
                        <em>prima facie</em> subject to the non-exclusive
                    jurisdiction of the court of Singapore as provided under cl 18(b) of the
                    Escrow Agreement. The crucial issue is whether the presumptive exclusion of
                    cl 29.1 of the Supply Agreement by cl 18(a) of the Escrow Agreement
                    has been displaced by other provisions or words in the Escrow
                Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In this regard, Astrata relies on the
                    parenthetical words “(but not to Tridex and Astrata alone)” in the
                    Entire Agreement clause of the Escrow Agreement (cl 11) to argue that those
                    words were intended to carve out disputes between Astrata and Tridex in relation
                    to the Escrow Property from cl 18 of the Escrow Agreement. In our view,
                    those words do no more than to recognise that there is another separate entire
                    agreement between Astrata and Tridex. If a carving out were intended, it would
                    surely have been done in cl 18 itself and not in cl 11. Those words do
                    not evince an intention that the arbitration agreement in the Supply Agreement
                    should apply to disputes arising from the Escrow Agreement. The two agreements
                    are consistent with each other, as each was intended to apply in their
                    respective spheres, subject to their respective dispute resolution
                    mechanisms.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Astrata has also argued that the words
                    “pending the outcome of the dispute between Tridex and Astrata” in
                    cl 18(a) of the Escrow Agreement refer to the outcome of the dispute
                    between Tridex and Astrata by arbitration. We are unable to accept this argument
                    for two reasons. First, there is no basis to read a reference to arbitration
                    into those words as they are equally capable of referring to the outcome of
                    court proceedings. Indeed, utilising the exact same terminology that was used to
                    define a “Dispute” in cl 29.1 of the Supply Agreement,
                    cl 18(a) of the Escrow Agreement goes on to provide that a
                    “Dispute” under the Escrow Agreement is one that relates to
                    “any claim or controversy arising out of, or in connection, with [the]
                    Escrow Agreement, including any question regarding its formation, existence,
                    validity, enforceability, performance, interpretation, breach, or
                    termination”. Accordingly, the phrase cited at the start of this
                    paragraph appears to be one capable of referring to a bilateral dispute between
                    Astrata and Tridex relating to any claim or controversy arising out of, or in
                    connection with this Escrow Agreement (see also above at [25]). At best, these words are neutral since
                    they say nothing about the nature of the dispute resolution mechanism that will
                    produce the outcome of the Bilateral Dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Secondly, we see no rational basis in
                    Astrata’s argument that these words have the effect of displacing the
                    presumptive effect of the jurisdiction clause, albeit a non-exclusive one. We
                    earlier mentioned that cl 18(a) applies to both bilateral and trilateral
                    disputes. We can test the rationale with the following hypothesis. A dispute in
                    category (b) or (c) (see <a href="#p1_25">[25]</a> above)
                    would arise if, for example, PEPL agrees or disagrees with Tridex that a
                    triggering event has occurred under, say, cl 7(i)(c) and decides to act
                    accordingly. In the first case, Astrata may dispute PEPL’s decision, and
                    in the second case, Tridex may dispute PEPL’s decision. Assuming that it
                    is the first case, Astrata would have to commence proceedings against PEPL for
                    injunctive relief to restrain PEPL from delivering the Escrow Property to
                    Tridex. This was what Astrata had to do in the present case when it did not
                    receive confirmation from PEPL that PEPL would not deliver the Escrow Property
                    to Tridex.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     But let us assume further that PEPL, instead
                    of interpleading, decides to stand its ground (backed by Tridex with a full
                    indemnity on costs) and contests Astrata’s claim. In this situation, there
                    would doubtless be a claim by Astrata against PEPL arising out of the Escrow
                    Agreement. Such a dispute would be subject to the jurisdiction of the Singapore
                    court and not referable to arbitration (since PEPL is not a party to any
                    arbitration agreement). Now, the essence of the dispute between Astrata and PEPL
                    in this situation is no different from the essence of the Bilateral Dispute,
                    which is whether a triggering event under cl 7(i)(c) of the Escrow
                    Agreement has occurred in consequence of AGI’s Chapter 11. What then, it
                    may be asked, is the basis for Astrata’s argument that if the dispute were
                    with PEPL, the dispute resolution clause in Escrow Agreement would be
                    applicable, but if the dispute were with Tridex (with PEPL interpleading) the
                    same dispute resolution clause would not apply but cl 29.1 of the Supply
                    Agreement would apply? Astrata has given no explanation as to why it was
                    prepared to accept court adjudication under the Escrow Agreement where it had a
                    dispute with PEPL but not where it had a dispute with Tridex.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Astrata has further contended that the
                    non-exclusive jurisdiction clauses (cll 18(b) and 20(c)) of the Escrow
                    Agreement are limited to curial assistance in support of arbitration. We are
                    also unable to accept this argument. Such a construction may be attractive in
                    cases where there are arbitration as well as non-exclusive jurisdiction clauses
                    in the same contract or, perhaps, in related contracts between the same parties,
                        <em>eg</em>, as in the <em>Paul
                        Smith</em> line of cases (<em>Paul Smith Ltd v H &amp;
                        S International Holding Inc</em> [1991] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 127
                    QBD (Comm) discussed in <em>AXA Re v Ace Global Markets
                        Ltd</em> [2006] 1 Lloyd’s Rep IR 683 QBD (Comm)) but it has
                    no application in the present case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In the circumstances, we would give the
                    non-exclusive jurisdiction clauses their ordinary meaning. They have not been
                    displaced by any provision or words in the Escrow Agreement or the Supply
                    Agreement. So construed, and as recognised in case law (see, for instance,
                        <em>Transocean</em> at [16] and <em>Bambang Sutrisno v Bali
                        International Finance Ltd and others</em> [1999] 2 SLR(R) 632 at
                        [11]), the non-exclusive
                    jurisdiction clauses presumptively exclude other means of dispute resolution in
                    favour of the non-exclusive forum.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     We would also agree with Tridex’s
                    argument that this conclusion is reinforced by the choice of Singapore law in
                    cl 17 of the Escrow Agreement. When contrasted to the choice of English law
                    in the Supply Agreement, the choice of Singapore law in the Escrow Agreement,
                    which deals only with the Escrow Property, fortifies the presumption in favour
                    of Singapore as the non-exclusive forum in respect of disputes relating only to
                    the Escrow Property. It follows that s 11A of the IAA has no application to
                    the Bilateral Dispute, and it is therefore unnecessary for us to decide whether
                    or not to refer the Bilateral Dispute to arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Substantive Issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The Substantive Issue is whether any condition
                    in cl 7(i)(c) has been triggered so as to entitle Tridex to delivery of the
                    Escrow Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">AGI’s Chapter 11 </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     As mentioned earlier at <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a>, the Judge held that AGI’s
                    Chapter 11 constituted a triggering event under cl 7(i)(c) (and also
                    cl 7(ii)(b)) of the Escrow Agreement on the ground that it was an
                    arrangement for the benefit of its creditors and that this condition did not
                    come within the terms of the Saving Clause. The Judge also held that in any case
                    AGI’s Chapter 11 was not a reconstruction for the purposes of the
                    Saving Clause. Before we discuss the Judge’s analyses of these issues, it
                    is necessary that we provide the background to the reasons for AGI seeking
                    Chapter 11 reorganisation as it is, in our view, material to the question
                    whether AGI “has made any arrangement for the benefit of its
                    creditors” under cl 7(i)(c) of the Escrow Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     In 2009, AGI experienced financial
                    difficulties and proposed an out-of-court restructuring plan (“the
                    Out-of-Court Plan”) for approval by its creditors and shareholders.
                    Almost all creditors voted in favour of the Out-of-Court Plan. However, one Jed
                    Frost, a shareholder and unsecured creditor, and the Vision group (comprising
                    Vision Opportunity China Fund Limited, Vision Capital Advantage Fund LP and
                    Vision Opportunity Master Fund Ltd, collectively “Vision”), a
                    shareholder and purported unsecured creditor, voted against the Out-of-Court
                    Plan. As a result, AGI could not effectuate the Out-of-Court Plan. Following
                    some failed negotiations, AGI applied for bankruptcy protection under
                    Chapter 11 in order to preserve AGI’s ability to restructure its
                    debts, to preserve AGI’s business operations, and to preserve AGI’s
                    assets for the benefit of its creditors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     As mentioned earlier (see <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a> above), AGI’s Chapter 11 took effect from
                    4 January 2010 resulting in 94.5% of AGI’s shares being held by Fame
                    Trading Ltd, a white knight who had provided interim financing of US$8.5 million
                    to AGI. The remaining 5.5% of AGI’s shares were issued to a Litigation
                    Trust established pursuant to the Reorganisation Plan. The material provisions
                    of the Reorganisation Plan relating to the Litigation Trustee are as
                    follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     With regard to the purpose of a

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Chapter 11 in the United States is a reorganization and restructuring

                        the British concept of “administration”. <em>The United States is somewhat unique because Chapter 11 is more
                            like a financing transaction, rather than a bankruptcy, and this concept

                    Judgment) as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[26]  ...
                            Astrata’s proposed construction ignores the business objective of
                            this commonly used standard form precedent. In <em>Boilerplate: Practical Clauses</em> (Richard Christou gen ed)
                            (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 5th Ed, 2009), the editors provide an example
                            of a precedent clause which deals with the disappearance of a party
                            through dissolution, death or insolvency. The precedent clause reads as
                            follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">The Contract may be terminated with immediate effect by
                            either party giving notice of termination to the other party (the
                            “Defaulting Party”):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-3">(i) if the Defaulting Party (being a company) shall pass a
                                resolution for winding-up (otherwise than for the purposes of a
                                solvent amalgamation or reconstruction where the resulting entity is
                                at least as credit-worthy as the Defaulting Party and assumes all of
                                the obligations of the Defaulting Party under the Contract) or a
                                court shall make an order to that effect …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[27]  Indeed, the
                            editors explain the nature and effect of this precedent clause as
                            follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">The following clause deals with the disappearance of a party through
                            dissolution, death or insolvency. The exception relating to a solvent
                            amalgamation or reconstruction should be noted since its absence would
                            forbid perfectly harmless reorganizations, for instance, of the
                            structure of a group of companies.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The phrase “amalgamation or reconstruction” is commonly used
                        as a carve-out to liquidations for this purpose.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[28]  The business purpose of provisions such as
                            cl 7(i)(c) of the Escrow Agreement is to secure the Escrow items
                            for the purchaser, upon the occurrence to the supplier and specified
                            entities, of clearly defined and understood commercial triggering
                            events. It is in these clearly defined trigger events that the purchaser
                            seeks to preserve its contractual and proprietary interests in the
                            Escrow property against cessation of business, asset or undertaking
                            seizures, creditor arrangements, or liquidation of the specified
                            entities. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[31]  Astrata concedes that AGI’s Chapter 11
                            was not an amalgamation but submits that it is a
                            “reconstruction” within the meaning of the Escrow
                            Agreement. It should be stated at the outset that the issue before me is
                            not whether AGI’s Chapter 11 constitutes a
                            “reconstruction” under United States law (federal or
                            state). The meaning of “reconstruction” in a contract
                            expressed to be governed by Singapore law falls to be construed by
                            Singapore law. In this Escrow Agreement, cl 7(i)(c) refers to
                            reconstruction to apply to specified entities, several of which are
                            Singapore incorporated companies and one is AGI incorporated in the
                            state of Nevada. To construe this clause to mean different things under
                            the law of each entity’s law of the place of incorporation and not
                            the governing law of the Escrow Agreement would not be warranted under
                            the terms of the Escrow Agreement itself. As escrow agreements deal with
                            contingencies and precise events, business efficacy, as to the meaning
                            of reconstruction in this Escrow Agreement, requires that this term be
                            construed in the same way under the expressly chosen governing law, with
                            respect to all the parties to this agreement regardless of their place
                            of incorporation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[32]  What then is the meaning to be accorded to
                            reconstruction in cl 7(i)(c) of the Escrow Agreement under
                            Singapore law? Whatever else the term may mean in the United States, the
                            meaning of “reconstruction” in a Singapore law governed
                            document making provision for financial distress is shaped by our
                            English common law foundations. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Our approach is as follows. While we can agree
                    with all of what the Judge has said in the passages above – such as the
                    business objectives of these boilerplate clauses, and that since the Escrow
                    Agreement is governed by Singapore law, it has to be construed in accordance
                    with Singapore law, that commonly used clauses should be given their commonly
                    understood meanings, and that the same words used in an agreement should
                    ordinarily be given the same meaning – the flaw in the Judge’s
                    interpretational approach is that, as we shall see, he has conflated the meaning
                    of words in the Escrow Agreement with their meaning under Singapore law,
                    specifically in the context of company law. Thus, he held that the word
                    “reconstruction” had the meaning which it bears when used in the
                    reconstruction of a company under the Companies Act (see <a href="#p1_63">[63]</a> below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     In our view, this approach to contextual
                    interpretation is incorrect because the word “reconstruction” in
                    cl 7(i)(c) of the Escrow Agreement is not necessarily used in the context
                    of a company reconstruction under the Singapore Companies Act, but in the very
                    different context of a commercial agreement between a US corporate group (which
                    included a Singapore subsidiary, Astrata) and Tridex (a Singapore company). The
                    Judge himself recognised that the word “reconstruction”, and also
                    the word “amalgamation” are not terms of art (see below at
                        <a href="#p1_64">[64]</a>). These words must therefore mean
                    what the parties intended them to mean. Although the Escrow Agreement is
                    governed by Singapore law, that law does not dictate that the words used in the
                    Escrow Agreement must bear the meanings they have in a Singapore company law
                    context but rather in a business context. Under Singapore law, the basic
                    principle of documentary interpretation is that words used by the parties in an
                    agreement mean what the parties intend them to mean. The parties here may or may
                    not have had the Singapore company law meanings in mind; regardless, even if
                    they did have Singapore company law meanings in mind, it does not necessarily
                    follow that these meanings are apt to cover any corporate restructuring of AGI
                    under US law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     In the present case, it is all the more
                    necessary to consider what the parties had in mind when they drafted the
                    triggering events in cl 7(i)(c) to apply to a US corporation which can only
                    effect a corporate restructuring or reconstruction in accordance with US law and
                    not Singapore law. A reconstruction of a company under Singapore law may not
                    find an exact counterpart in US law and <em>vice
                    versa</em>, and similarly, with the phrase “any arrangement for the
                    benefit of its creditors”. More generally, it is not clear to us that the
                    purpose of cl 7(i)(c) (which is, as the Judge found, to protect
                    Tridex’s vested rights in the Escrow Property (for whose development they
                    had paid upfront to Astrata) against the effects of corporate insolvency events
                    affecting AGI) is adequately served by superimposing Singapore company law
                    concepts on a US company to which such concepts may be alien, and <em>vice versa</em>. It seems to us that whoever drafted
                    cl 7(i)(c) of the Escrow Agreement had copied the boilerplate clauses
                    applicable only to business transactions between Singapore and/or UK
                    incorporated companies without much thought as to whether the triggering events
                    countenanced therein would have been appropriate for AGI and non-Singapore
                    corporate bodies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     For these reasons, we think that in construing
                    the meaning of the triggering events in cl 7(i)(c), it is preferable to
                    give more weight to the underlying commercial purpose of cl 7(i)(c),
                        <em>ie</em>, to protect Tridex’s vested interest
                    in the Escrow Property in the event that Astrata and/or AGI finds
                    itself/themselves unable to carry on its/their business, thereby jeopardising
                    Tridex’s rights to the Escrow Property. This is provided, of course, that
                    giving effect to the parties’ purpose is permitted by the words used in
                    cl 7(i)(c). In this connection, we repeat, and would elaborate below, that
                    some of the terms under consideration are not terms of art in the context of
                    Singapore and English company law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     We now turn to the specific questions set out
                    at <a href="#p1_39">[39]</a> above.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issue (a): Whether a receiver, administrator or similar officer has
                been appointed over all or any part of AGI’s assets or undertaking</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     This issue was argued before the Judge but he
                    did not rule on it. Tridex argues that the appointment of the Litigation Trustee
                    pursuant to the Reorganisation Plan is equivalent or similar to the appointment
                    of a receiver under Singapore law, and the relevant triggering event has
                    occurred. In support of this argument, counsel referred to the commentary in
                        <em>Law and Practice of Corporate Insolvency</em>
                    (Andrew Chan Chee Yin gen ed) (LexisNexis, 2005) Ch V, paras 853–900
                    (pp V-109–V-110).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     We do not agree that the commentary referred
                    to is relevant to Tridex’s case as it is concerned with the functions of a
                    receiver and manager appointed by a debenture holder, and not a receiver
                    appointed by a court. Such a receiver and manager is a different creature from a
                    receiver appointed by a court under O 30 of the Rules of Court
                    (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed). A court-appointed receiver is merely
                    a passive and neutral custodian of the property entrusted to him, pending the
                    resolution of the dispute between the claimants to the property. In contrast, a
                    receiver and manager appointed under a debenture has many more functions and
                    duties. He has a duty to bring in the assets subject to the debenture under
                    which he was appointed, and to realise those assets for the benefit of the
                    debenture holder. If those assets include choses-in-action he can bring actions
                    to enforce them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     The Litigation Trustee certainly bears no
                    resemblance to a court-appointed receiver, although there is some similarity
                    between that office and that of a receiver and manager. A litigation trustee
                    under a Chapter 11 reorganisation is under a duty to enforce and pursue the
                    company’s rights and interests for the benefit of creditors. However, such
                    a comparison fails to consider the different context in which each officer is
                    appointed. In Martin R Pollner &amp; Brian R Socolow, “The
                    Litigation Trustee: A Major New Tool for Creditors’ Committees”
                    American Bankruptcy Institute Journal (March 2001) (20-2 ABIJ
                        14)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>, the authors
                    state the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Creditors’ committees are increasingly turning to litigation
                        trustees to handle complex litigation in chapter 11 proceedings.
                        Although not expressly authorized in the Bankruptcy Code, litigation
                        trustees have been appointed in several recent cases, including <em>In re Pintlar</em>, 175 B.R. 379 (Bankr. D.
                        Idaho 1994), and <em>In re Rincon Island Ltd.
                            Partnership</em> (Bankr. C.D. Cal. 2000).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The position of a litigation trustee is a relatively new tool for
                        creditors’ committees (and shareholders) when the debtor’s
                        assets include potential claims against third parties, such as the failed
                        company’s former officers and directors. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A litigation trustee is usually appointed by the bankruptcy court upon the
                        recommendation of one or more creditors’ committees after a
                        reorganization plan has been confirmed by the court. As part of the
                        reorganization plan, a trust is formed, and assets of the debtor or the
                        bankruptcy estate (such as all claims, rights or causes of action, as well
                        as money to fund the litigation trustee’s efforts) are transferred to
                        the trust. The litigation trustee's mandate is to pursue various claims,
                        through litigation or settlement, against third parties on behalf of the
                        trust and its beneficiaries, and to distribute, pursuant to the plan, any
                        net proceeds of such litigation or settlement. Usually, a post-confirmation
                        creditors’ committee will work with the trustee on strategic and
                        settlement issues.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     As can be seen from the above commentary, the
                    litigation trust is established as part of a Chapter 11 reorganisation, the
                    primary purpose of which is to sustain the company as a going concern –
                    AGI’s US attorneys described it as “more like a financing
                    transaction, rather than a bankruptcy” (see above at <a href="#p1_37">[37]</a>)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>.
                    In contrast, the receiver appointed by the court or a receiver and manager
                    appointed by a debenture holder, in performing his respective functions is not
                    concerned with the continued viability of the company as a going concern. In the
                    light of the purpose of cl 7(i)(c), which is to protect Tridex’s
                    interest in the continuing functioning of Astrata and/or AGI, this distinction
                    is critical. Functionally, a litigation trustee in a Chapter 11
                    reorganisation is not analogous to a receiver contemplated by cl 7(i)(c).
                    Nor is the expression “receiver” apt to refer to a litigation
                    trustee in the US Bankruptcy Code. Accordingly, we would hold that the
                    Litigation Trustee appointed pursuant to the terms of the Reorganisation Plan is
                    not a receiver contemplated by cl 7(i)(c) of the Escrow
                Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issue (b): Whether AGI has made any arrangement for the benefit
                of its creditors</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Both here and below, the parties and the Judge
                    have proceeded on the assumption that AGI’s Chapter 11 <em>was</em> an arrangement for the benefit of its creditors, and
                    also that AGI <em>had</em> made such an arrangement by
                    undergoing the Chapter 11 reorganisation. We had our doubts about the
                    correctness of these two assumptions. After we reserved judgment in this appeal,
                    we invited further submissions on these two issues in the form of a composite
                    question as expressed in issue (b) above. However, we did not find the
                    submissions helpful. Having raised the composite question, we will now address
                    it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Is AGI’s Chapter 11 an
                    “arrangement” for the benefit of “creditors”? The
                    word “arrangement” is not defined in the Escrow Agreement or in
                    the Companies Act. A different point arises with the word
                    “creditors”. Does it mean all the creditors of AGI or only some of
                    them, and if so, how many of them? Suppose AGI had made an arrangement for the
                    benefit of only a minority of secured creditors – would this be an
                    arrangement for the benefit of creditors as contemplated by cl 7(i)(c)?
                    Many different permutations can be posited. None of these interpretative
                    problems have been raised by Astrata, and yet they must be material to whether
                    or not the relevant triggering event has occurred.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     In our view, the word
                    “arrangement” must take its meaning from the context of the Escrow
                    Agreement and its commercial objective, as recognised by the Judge. In the case
                    of <em>In re British Basic Slag Ltd’s
                        Application</em> [1963] 1 WLR 727 (“<em>British Basic Slag</em>”), the court was concerned to
                    interpret the meaning of the word “arrangement” in the UK
                    Restrictive Practices Act. Wilmer LJ said at 739–740:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I think it is highly significant that Parliament did not see fit to
                        include any definition of “arrangement.” I infer from this
                        that it was intended that the word should be construed in its ordinary or
                        popular sense. Though it may not be easy to put into words, everybody knows
                        what is meant by an arrangement between two or more parties. If the
                        arrangement is intended to be enforceable by legal proceedings, as in the
                        case where it is made for good consideration, it may no doubt properly be
                        described as an agreement. ... For when each of two or more parties
                        intentionally arouses in the others an expectation that he will act in a
                        certain way, it seems to me that he incurs at least a moral obligation to do
                        so. An arrangement as so defined is therefore something “whereby the
                        parties to it accept mutual rights and obligations.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1">At 746–747, Diplock LJ said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“Arrangement” is not a term of art; and in section 6(3)
                        of the [Restrictive Trade Practices] Act of 1956 I agree with my Lords that
                        it bears the meaning that an ordinary educated man would ascribe to it. It
                        involves a meeting of minds because under section 6(1) it has to be an
                        arrangement “between two or more persons,” and since it must
                        be an arrangement “under which restrictions are accepted by two or
                        more parties” it involves mutuality in that each party, assuming he
                        is a reasonable and conscientious man, would regard himself as being in some
                        degree under a duty, whether moral or legal, to conduct himself in a
                        particular way or not to conduct himself in a particular way as the case may
                        be, at any rate so long as the other party or parties conducted themselves
                        in the way contemplated by the arrangement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     In <em>In re N.F.U. Development
                        Trust Ltd</em> [1972] 1 WLR 1548 (“<em>Re
                        NFU</em>”), the company petitioned the court to sanction a
                    scheme of arrangement under s 206(2) of the Companies Act 1948 (“the
                    UK Companies Act 1948”) whereby all existing members of the company
                    except the N.F.U. Development Co. would cease to be members. Six persons, five
                    of whom were already directors, were to be the sole individual members. All
                    other existing members were to be deprived of their membership and forfeited all
                    their rights, and on a winding up the surplus assets were to be distributed to
                    another body or company to be determined by the company (and in default of such
                    determination, to charity). The object of the scheme was to reduce
                    administrative expenses. At a meeting directed by the court in May 1972, 85% of
                    the members voted in favour of the scheme. On a petition seeking the court's
                    approval, the scheme was opposed by five persons. It was held that although a
                    majority of three-fourths in value of members in favour of the scheme as
                    required by s 206(2) of the UK Companies Act 1948 had been obtained,
                    nevertheless the section dealt with a “compromise” or
                    “arrangement” between a company and its members which implied
                    accommodation on both sides and could not apply to the present scheme whereby
                    members rights were totally surrendered without compensation. Accordingly, since
                    the scheme was one which no member voting in the interests of members as a whole
                    could reasonably approve, the petition would be dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     
          <em>Re NFU</em> is an
                    English authority for the meaning of “arrangement” under
                    s 206(2) of the UK Companies Act 1948 which corresponds to s 210 of
                    our Companies Act. On that authority, an “arrangement” in which
                    members are deprived of their rights without compensation is not an arrangement
                    but a confiscation of their rights. There is no element of “give and
                    take” in such an arrangement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Consistent with our own approach that the
                    meaning of the words in cl 7(i)(c) should be interpreted to mean what the
                    parties intend, <em>British Basic Slag</em> is helpful
                    because it adopted the popular meaning of the word “arrangement”
                    which requires a meeting of minds as to their mutual rights and obligations
                    (whether the arrangement is intended to be enforceable or not). <em>Re NFU</em> is, however, not as helpful as the decision was
                    concerned with the interpretation of “arrangement” in the context
                    of a “scheme of arrangement” under the UK Companies Act
                    1948.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     In our view, the essence of an arrangement
                    with creditors under cl 7(i)(c) must involve a meeting of minds of the
                    parties to the arrangement. This is reinforced by the actual words of the
                    condition – that AGI “has made any arrangement with ...”.
                    AGI cannot make an arrangement with its creditors if they do not accept the
                    arrangement or agree with it. On the facts of this case, AGI had, quite simply,
                        <em>not</em> made an arrangement with its creditors. It
                    tried to do so when it proposed the Out-of-Court Plan, but the proposal was
                    rejected by a small minority of its creditors, <em>viz</em>, Jed Frost and Vision. Because of this, AGI had to apply to the
                    US Bankruptcy Court to sanction a Chapter 11 reorganisation under a
                    modified plan. The Reorganisation Plan, first mentioned at <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a> earlier, provided <em>inter
                        alia</em> that creditors whose claims were scheduled as disputed,
                    contingent or liquidated and who did not file a proof of claim timeously were
                    not to be treated as creditors for the purposes of voting or distribution. By
                    contrasting these two events, it is apparent that (a) AGI had <em>failed to make</em> an arrangement with its creditors through
                    the Out-of-Court Plan, and (b) AGI’s Chapter 11 was neither
                        <em>made by AGI</em>, nor <em>with its
                        creditors</em> – it was sanctioned by the US Bankruptcy Court
                    and imposed on all creditors. In our view, AGI did not make an arrangement for
                    the benefit of its creditors as contemplated by cl 7(i)(c).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     In the result, it would not be necessary for
                    us to address issues (c) and (d), but since they were fully argued before
                    us, we shall discuss them as well.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issue (c): Whether the Saving Clause applies to “any
                arrangement for the benefit of its creditors”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     The Judge answered this question in the
                    negative. He rejected Astrata’s construction that cl 7(i)(c) applies
                    to only three categories of triggering events (see the Judgment at [23]) as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Where AGI:]</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(i)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">has ceased or threatened to cease to carry on its
                            business, or</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(ii)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">has had a receiver, administrator or similar

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(iii)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">has made any arrangement for the benefit of its
                            creditors, or gone into liquidation save for the purpose of a genuine
                            amalgamation or reconstruction.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Judge held (at [25] of
                    the Judgment) that there are four categories of triggering events, as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[AGI] <b>(i) </b>has ceased or threatened to
                        cease to carry on its business <b>or
                        (ii) </b>has had a receiver, administrator or similar officer
                        appointed over all or any part of its assets or undertaking <b>or (iii) </b>has made any arrangement for the
                        benefit of its creditors <b>or (iv) </b>gone
                        into liquidation save for the purpose of a genuine amalgamation or
                        reconstruction. [emphasis in bold in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The dispute was on where to put the punctuation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     It is possible to argue that the Judge’s
                    interpretation as set out in the passage above does not appear to accord with
                    its grammatical structure, because the word “has” is missing from
                    the fourth category. Without that word, Astrata’s construction of that
                    clause as having three categories is not unreasonable. However, we agree with
                    the result of the Judge’s construction, not for the reason given by him,
                    but because that was the intention of the parties as evinced in the formulation
                    in PoA #7 and also cl 7(ii)(b) of the Escrow Agreement. The relevant clause
                    in PoA #7 listed four categories, providing as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If [Astrata] and/or [AGI](but not any of its subsidiaries or associates
                        other than Astrata (Asia Pacific) Pte Ltd or [Astrata]) (hereinafter
                        singularly or collectively referred to as “ASAG”) ceases or
                        threatens to cease to carry on its business; if a receiver, administrator or
                        similar officer is appointed over all or any part of the assets or
                        undertaking of <b>ASAG</b>; if <b>ASAG</b> makes any arrangement for the benefit of its creditors
                        or <b>ASAG</b> goes into liquidation save for the
                        purpose of a genuine amalgamation or reconstruction. [emphasis in bold
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     In our view, the repetition of the word
                    “ASAG” with reference to its liquidation has the effect of
                    creating a fourth triggering event that includes and is qualified by the Saving
                    Clause. This delineation is repeated in cl 7(ii)(b) which provides for the
                    release of the Comprehensive Engineering Diagrams in similar terms:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[O]n Tridex’s production of conclusive proof (including but not
                        limited to the production of authenticated copies of publicly filed
                        documents confirming the appointment of the receiver, administrator or
                        similar officer as referred to in this paragraph), that [Astrata] and/or
                        [AGI] (but not any of its subsidiaries or associates other than Astrata
                        (Asia Pacific) Pte Ltd or [Astrata]) (hereinafter singularly or collectively
                        referred to as “ASAG”) has ceased or threatened to cease to
                        carry on its business; or has had a receiver, administrator or similar
                        officer appointed over all or any part of its assets or undertaking or has
                        made any arrangement for the benefit of its creditors or <b>has</b> gone into liquidation save for the purpose of a genuine
                        amalgamation or reconstruction. [emphasis in bold added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     At [24] of the Judgment, the Judge rejected Astrata’s
                    submissions, and said, as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">24    In support of its proposed construction, Astrata
                            first draws on the quite separate Supply Agreement in which semicolons
                            have been inserted which do not exist in the parallel clause in the
                            Escrow Agreement. It submits that the Supply Agreement discloses
                            Astrata’s and Tridex’s agreement as to the trigger events
                            which must dictate the construction of a parallel but not identically
                            worded clause in the Escrow Agreement between different parties.
                            However, I am only concerned to construe cl 7(i)(c) of the Escrow
                            Agreement and I find no merit in this submission that the construction
                            of a clause in one agreement between different parties is to be
                            determined by a similar but not identical clause entered earlier between
                            some but not all the parties. In any event, it is not my task to
                            construe the Supply Agreement and POA#7.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     We do not agree with this approach in a case,
                    as here, where a clause in an agreement is ambiguous and where two clauses
                    applying to the same subject matter are arguably inconsistent. In such a case,
                    the court is entitled to and should examine the history and source of these
                    clauses to determine the intention of the parties. In the present case, the
                    triggering clauses originated from PoA #7 which required them to be
                    incorporated into the Escrow Agreement, with the specific instruction that the
                    Escrow Agreement must give effect, <em>inter alia</em>, to
                    those clauses.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issue (d) - Whether AGI’s Chapter 11 is a
                reconstruction </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     The Judge held that AGI’s
                    Chapter 11 was not a reconstruction as contemplated by cl 7(i)(c)
                    because under Singapore law, a reconstruction must not result in the
                    shareholding of the reconstructed company being substantially different from
                    that of the original company. It may be recalled (see <a href="#p1_36">[36]</a> above) that, under the Reorganisation Plan, 94.5% of
                    AGI’s equity is now held by Fame Trading Ltd, a new shareholder who
                    injected US$8.5 million into AGI, with the remaining 5.5% held by the Litigation
                    Trust. In so holding, the Judge followed the English authorities on the meaning
                    of “reconstruction” under English company law. He relied on the
                    following passage in Buckley J’s judgment in <em>In re
                        South African Supply and Cold Storage Company</em>, <em>Wild v Same Company</em> [1904] 2 Ch 268 (“<em>South African Supply</em>”) at 286:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... What does “reconstruction” mean? To my mind it means
                        this. An undertaking of some definite kind is being carried on, and the
                        conclusion is arrived at that it is not desirable to kill that undertaking,
                        but that it is desirable to preserve it in some form, and to do so, not by
                        selling it to an outsider who shall carry it on–that would be a mere
                        sale–but in some altered form to continue the undertaking in such a
                        manner as that the persons now carrying it on will substantially continue to
                        carry it on. It involves, I think, that substantially the same business
                        shall be carried on and substantially the same persons shall carry it on.
                        But it does not involve that all the assets shall pass to the new company or
                        resuscitated company, or that all the shareholders of the old company shall
                        be shareholders in the new company or resuscitated company. Substantially
                        the business and the persons interested must be the same. Does it make any
                        difference that the new company or resuscitated company does or does not
                        take over the liabilities? I think not. I think it is none the less a
                        reconstruction because from the assets taken over some part is excepted
                        provided that substantially the business is taken, and it is immaterial
                        whether the liabilities are taken over by the new or resuscitated company or
                        are provided for by excepting from the scheme of reconstruction a sufficient
                        amount to answer them. It is not, therefore, vital that either the whole
                        assets should be taken over or that the liabilities should be taken over.
                        You have to see whether substantially the same persons carry on the same
                        business; and if they do, that, I conceive, is a reconstruction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     It will be noticed that Buckley J
                    acknowledged that “reconstruction”, by itself, is not a term of
                    art (at 281–282):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Neither of these words, “reconstruction” and
                        “amalgamation,” has any definite <em>legal</em> meaning. Each is a commercial and not a legal term,
                        and, even as a commercial term, bears no exact definite meaning. In each
                        case one has to decide whether the transaction is such as that, in the
                        meaning of commercial men, it is one which is comprehended in the term
                        “reconstruction” or “amalgamation.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     We have earlier stated that the company law
                    meaning of “reconstruction” (assuming it is the same as its
                    meaning under English and Australian case law) may not be the same as its
                    popular meaning or the meaning intended in cl 7(i)(c) in its application to
                    a US company (if it is capable of being reorganised or
                    “reconstructed” under the US Bankruptcy Code in a different way).
                    It is not necessary for us to decide in this appeal (a) whether the meaning
                    of “reconstruction” given by English or Australian case law (see,
                    for example, <em>In re Mytravel Group plc</em> [2005]
                    1 WLR 2365 and <em>Re Opes Prime Stockbrocking Ltd (recs and
                        mgrs apptd) (in liq) and ors</em> [2009] 258 ALR 362) should be
                    followed by our courts; (b) how substantial the corporate changes should be
                    before a reorganisation ceases to be a reconstruction; or (c) whether the
                    meaning of “reconstruction” intended by the parties is the same as
                    the meaning given in the case law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     The English and Australian cases are not
                    necessarily determinative of the meaning of the word
                    “reconstruction” under Singapore law. At least, before the
                    decision of the Judge in the present case, there has been no local decision on
                    the point. The problem with the English position – that “the
                    essential character of corporate reconstruction is that substantially the same
                    business is carried on and substantially the same persons continue to carry it
                    on” (per Millett J citing <em>South African
                        Supply</em> in <em>In re Courage Group’s Pension
                        Schemes Ryan and Others v Imperial Brewing &amp; Leisure Ltd. And
                        Others</em> [1987] 1 WLR 495 at 509) – is that a company
                    which has lost all its capital and which needs an injection of new capital from
                    new investors can never be reconstructed unless the existing shareholders whose
                    shares are worthless shares have to be given new (funded) shares to enable them
                    to retain a substantial shareholding in the reconstructed company. For now, it
                    is only necessary to observe that the Saving Clause in cl 7(i)(c) is not
                    intended to apply to a company undergoing a Chapter 11 reorganisation as
                    that clause is premised on a company being liquidated. A Chapter 11
                    reorganisation does not involve the liquidation of the corporation that is being
                    reorganised or reconstructed. Of course, if the Saving Clause were applicable to
                    Astrata or AGI making any arrangement for the benefit of its creditors, then it
                    would not be inconceivable that AGI’s Chapter 11 might well have been
                    contemplated by the parties as a form of reconstruction.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Waiver</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     In view of our conclusions above, it is not
                    necessary for us to decide Astrata’s argument that Tridex has by its
                    conduct waived its right to invoke the triggering events under cll 7(i)(c)
                    and 7(ii)(b) of the Escrow Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Summary of conclusions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     In respect of the Jurisdictional Issue, we
                    hold that the parties have submitted to the jurisdiction of the Singapore court
                    with respect to the Bilateral Dispute by reason of the non-exclusive
                    jurisdiction clause in favour of Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     In respect of the Substantive Issue, we hold
                    that Tridex is not entitled to delivery of the Escrow Property as neither of the
                    two relevant triggering events in cll 7(i)(c) and 7(ii)(b) of the Escrow
                    Agreement it has relied on has occurred. We find that :</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_69-p2_a"></a>(a)     the Litigation Trustee is not a
                        “receiver” or “similar officer appointed over all or
                        any part of its assets or undertaking” as contemplated by
                        cll 7(i)(c) and 7(ii)(b) of the Escrow Agreement;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_69-p2_b"></a>(b)     AGI’s Chapter 11 is not an
                        “arrangement for the benefit of its creditors”, nor has AGI
                        “made any arrangement with its creditors” as contemplated by
                        cll 7(i)(c) and 7(ii)(b) of the Escrow Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Disposition</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     For the above reasons, we</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_70-p2_a"></a>(a)     grant Astrata’s application
                        for leave to appeal in Originating Summons No 1082 of 2010 and declare
                        that Tridex is not entitled to delivery of the Escrow Property;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_70-p2_b"></a>(b)     dismiss Astrata’s appeals in Civil Appeal No 158 of 2010 and
                        Civil Appeal No 159 of 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Astrata and Tridex
                    shall bear their own costs both here and below. PEPL shall be paid its costs
                    here and below on an indemnity basis to be borne equally by Astrata and Tridex.
                    The usual consequential orders shall apply.</p>
