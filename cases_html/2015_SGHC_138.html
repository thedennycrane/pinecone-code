        Choo Han Teck J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiff is the administrator of the estate
                    of Mr Franklin Heng Ang Tee (“the deceased”). The deceased
                    underwent a liposuction procedure carried out by Dr Wong Meng Hang (“the
                    first defendant”) with the assistance of Dr Zhu Xiu Chun (“the
                    second defendant”) on 30 December 2009 at Reves Clinic Pte Ltd
                    (“the third defendant”). As a result of the first and second
                    defendants’ negligence in performing the surgery and failure to properly
                    monitor the deceased’s condition, the deceased asphyxiated during the
                    procedure and doctors were unable to revive him in the Accident and Emergency
                    Department of Tan Tock Seng Hospital later that day. At the time of his demise,
                    the deceased was 44 years old.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The plaintiff brought this action on
                    11 March 2011 on behalf of the deceased’s estate pursuant to section
                    10 of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed) (“CLA”) and the
                    deceased’s dependants pursuant to sections 20, 21 and 22 of the CLA.
                    Interlocutory judgment was entered against the third defendant in default of
                    appearance on 30 March 2011. Liability was admitted by the first and second
                    defendants who consented to interlocutory judgment filed on 15 August 2012. This
                    judgment pertains to the assessment of damages payable by the defendants to the
                    plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The deceased was the Chief Executive Officer of
                    YTL Starhill Global REIT Management Limited (“YTL”), a property
                    management firm. The deceased has two children, a daughter born on 9 June 1996,
                    presently 18 years old, and a son born on 19 May 1999, presently 16 years old.
                    He and his former wife, Ms Peggy Quek (“Ms Quek”), presently 45
                    years old had obtained the Decree Nisi for divorce on 23 February 2006. Prior to
                    his death, the deceased was paying maintenance of $9,000 a month to Ms Quek and
                    the children.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       I now set out the claims made by the plaintiff
                    in the following table, alongside the submissions made by the first and second

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       There are also further heads of claim which are
                    undisputed by the first and second defendants. These include funeral expenses of
                    $14,813.95, legal fees and disbursements incurred for obtaining Letters of
                    Administration of $15,421.58 and damages for bereavement of
                $15,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Counsel for the first defendant submitted that
                    certain heads of claim brought by the plaintiff at the beginning of the trial
                    has not been pleaded in its statement of claim. I recognise that each party
                    should be bound by its pleadings, but I note that the purpose of the rule is for
                    the other party (or parties) to be put on notice and to have an opportunity to
                    respond to the claims. In this case, as the new heads of claim had been fully
                    set out in the plaintiff’s opening statement at the start of the trial, I
                    find that the defendants have been put on notice and were able to respond to
                    such claims at trial. I thus allow the heads of claim as laid out in the
                    plaintiff’s opening statement and submissions. The conventional method of
                    addressing such omissions is to allow an amendment to the pleadings if there
                    would be no prejudice. In this case, the defendants have all responded to the
                    unpleaded claims.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">General damages for pain and suffering</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The plaintiff states that the deceased had
                    suffered for over five and a half hours from the large number of puncture
                    injuries inflicted on him during the procedure. Counsel for the plaintiff, Ms
                    Kuah Boon Theng (“Ms Kuah”), has stressed that a sedative is not
                    an analgesic agent, and does not provide pain relief. The first defendant has
                    responded by stating that though the deceased experienced momentary pain from
                    the injuries inflicted, further medication was administered to the deceased such
                    that the sensation was reduced. The second defendant has opposed the awarding of
                    any general damages for pain and suffering, stating that the plaintiff collapsed
                    soon after the surgery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Upon reviewing the coroner’s report, I
                    accept that the deceased would have experienced some pain from the injuries
                    inflicted during the procedure and that a sedative is distinct from an analgesic
                    agent. However, the level of sedation that the deceased was under during the
                    procedure “had caused him to drift into a state of deep sedation almost
                    to the point of general anaesthesia”. I thus award the plaintiff $5,000
                    as general damages for pain and suffering.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Medical expenses and related charges</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The plaintiff argues that the defendants had
                    failed to fulfil their contractual obligations in providing appropriate medical
                    care, treatment and advice to the deceased prior to and during the treatment.
                    But the plaintiff has not given the court evidence to show that the deceased had
                    not been properly counselled about the risks associated with the procedure such
                    that there was a lack of informed consent. It is also clear that the deceased
                    did approach the defendants out of his own volition to undergo a liposuction
                    procedure. I thus dismiss the plaintiff’s claims for a refund of the
                    medical expenses incurred and the car-related charges incurred by Electronic
                    Road Pricing and parking.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Coroner’s inquiry fees</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Ms Kuah’s professional charges for the
                    Coroner’s Inquiry have been clearly set out in their invoice dated 12
                    September 2012 and I find that they have been reasonably incurred. I thus award
                    the plaintiff a total of $190,513.05 for professional fees and costs relating to
                    the Coroner’s Inquiry.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Plaintiff’s professional fees and disbursements as trustee and
                administrator</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Before his demise, the deceased had appointed
                    Ms Mabel Leong (“Ms Leong”), his girlfriend, and Mr Ng
                    Yong Hwee (“Mr Ng”), his friend, as joint executors and trustees
                    of the deceased’s estate. However, they subsequently renounced their
                    rights in favour of the plaintiff as a professional trustee. The plaintiff
                    states that the expenses of a professional trustee were reasonably incurred in
                    light of the high total probate value of the deceased’s assets of slightly
                    less than $7.7m (excluding the value of insurance benefits). In contrast,
                    Ms Leong had no training or expertise as an executor and trustee, and was
                    unable to focus on the undertaking as one who was grieving. Further, Mr Ng
                    was “a busy Chief Executive Officer in his own right, and with many of
                    his own responsibilities.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The second defendant states in response that
                    the administrator and his legal adviser have ignored the provisions of the
                    Trustees Act (Cap 337, 2005 Rev Ed) which allows trustees to obtain their fees
                    from the trust fund. Upon review of the provisions in ss 41Q, 41R, and 41S of
                    the Trustees Act, I find that the trustees do not have a claim against the
                    defendants as an estate claim, and dismiss the claim accordingly. As such, I
                    also find that the plaintiff is not entitled to claim for its future expenses
                    that will be incurred as trustee and administrator. The plaintiff will have to
                    claim its fees from the trust itself.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Losses and expenses incurred on the landed properties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Following the disposal of the three landed
                    properties owned by the deceased consequent to his demise, the plaintiff claims
                    that the estate has suffered loss. In particular, as the Duchess Avenue property
                    was under development and purchase had not been completed at the time of the
                    deceased’s death, the plaintiff decided to rescind the Sale and Purchase
                    Agreement after evaluating the best course of action to take, and had to forego
                    a significant portion of what had already been paid to the developer. This loss
                    alone amounted to almost $1.2m.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The first and second defendants cite
                        section 10(3)(<em>c</em>) of the CLA to show that
                    such a claim has been barred. The section states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where a cause of action survives as specified under subsection (1) for the
                        benefit of the estate of the deceased person, the damages recoverable
                        … shall be calculated without reference to any loss or gain to his
                        estate consequent on his death except that a sum in respect of funeral
                        expenses may be included.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The plaintiff attempts to argue in reply that
                    “the only thing consequent to the demise, was the actual realisation of
                        <em>how much</em> the loss was going to be (emphasis in
                    original).” But it is clear in this case that the losses and expenses
                    incurred on the properties by the rescission of the sale and purchase agreement
                    were consequent to the deceased’s death. Further, in the circumstances of
                    this case, the loss that was occasioned to the estate was not directly caused by
                    the death of the deceased but by the estate being unable to service the loan and
                    the subsequent decision to rescind the agreement. This claim also fails for
                    reasons of remoteness as such a loss is not reasonably foreseeable to the
                    defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Dependency claim for loss of support</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The plaintiff calculates the loss of support
                    to dependants based on ascertaining the percentage of the deceased’s
                    income used for personal expenses, and then assuming that the balance would be
                    meant for them (“the percentage deduction method”). An alternative
                    method would be to calculate the total value of benefits received by the
                    dependants from the deceased whilst the deceased was still alive, and use that
                    to determine the value of a dependency claim for loss of support (“the
                    traditional method”). I find that in this case, although the deceased did
                    view his family as important to him and contributed towards their expenses, I am
                    not persuaded that the balance of his income would wholly have gone to his
                    dependants. This is especially pertinent in this case as the deceased was no
                    longer living with his family, and had a girlfriend whom he would conceivably
                    have spent considerable expenses on. I will thus go on to assess the dependency
                    claims using the traditional method.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Dependency claim of Mdm Tan Siak Cheng</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The plaintiff has claimed for the loss of
                    support of the deceased’s mother, Mdm Tan Siak Cheng (“Mdm
                    Tan”), of $1,200 per month up to August 2014. Mdm Tan is currently 94
                    years old. The plaintiff claims that the deceased made regular Automated Teller
                    Machine (“ATM”) withdrawals of $1,000 from his bank account,
                    allegedly for Mdm Tan’s personal expenses, and $200 a month for
                    medical expenses. But the plaintiff has only provided evidence of two medical
                    bills which were paid. These are merely one-off payments and do not prove that
                    Mdm Tan received regular support of $1,200 per month from the deceased for her
                    personal and medical expenses. I find that it is just and appropriate to award
                    $20,000 instead to Mdm Tan’s caregiver to go toward payment of a part of
                    her medical expenses.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Dependency claim of Ms Quek and the children</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     In assessing the dependency claim of
                    Ms Quek and the children, I have found that the composite maintenance order
                    of $9,000 constitutes a good starting point to work from. This is because the
                    manner in which a court assesses dependency under the traditional method is
                    similar to how the court assesses maintenance in matrimonial proceedings –
                    in both cases, taking into account the claimant’s needs and whether the
                    deceased was able to meet those needs (<em>Hanson Ingird
                        Christina and others v Tan Puey Tze and another appeal</em> [2008] 1
                    SLR(R) 409 (“<em>Hanson</em>”) at [27]). I
                    then consider whether the pecuniary support which the dependent would have
                    received from the deceased, but for his death, exceeds the composite maintenance
                    order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The plaintiff calculates the dependency claim
                    of Ms Quek and the children using the composite maintenance order, and
                    $20,000 per year for overseas vacations and other expenses as multiplicands. It
                    then seeks to find an appropriate multiplier to use by determining when the
                    children will complete their tertiary education, thus coming to a multiplier of
                    11 for Jo-Ann (assuming she graduates at the age of 23) and 15 for Ryan
                    (assuming he graduates at the age of 25 after undergoing National Service as
                    well). It also assumes that the deceased would continue to work past
                    65 years old, and thus uses a multiplier of 25 for Ms Quek. It takes
                    an average multiplier of 17 years and applies a 25% discount to obtain an
                    average discounted multiplier of about 13 years.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     I have found it useful to assess the claims of
                    Ms Quek and the children separately as their needs and potential pecuniary
                    benefit they would have derived from the deceased differ. The first defendant
                    has also rightly cited section 22(3A) of the CLA which states that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In an action brought under section 20, the damages payable to a former
                        wife of the deceased shall only be in respect of a subsisting maintenance
                        order against the deceased at the time of his death.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Thus, Ms Quek’s dependency claim has been limited by
                        statute to her portion of the subsisting maintenance order against the
                        deceased at the time of his death.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Dependency claim of Ms Quek </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Ms Quek has admitted under cross-examination
                    that in dividing the composite maintenance order of $9,000, approximately $2,000
                    was set aside for herself, and $7,000 was to be for the children in equal
                    amounts. I will thus use $2,000 as the multiplicand for Ms Quek’s
                    dependency claim. I find that the deceased would most probably have continued to
                    work until the age of 65 years but for his death and hence arrive at a
                    multiplier of 21. “It is axiomatic that the longer the period of
                    dependency, the greater would be the percentage reduction” to take into
                    account the vicissitudes of life and the investment value of receiving a lump
                    sum payment in an award (<em>Balanalagirisamy Gowri Rajeswari and
                        another (administrators of the estate of Radhakrishnan Hari Babu, deceased)
                        v Wong Si Wah</em> [2009] 1 SLR(R) 819 at [10]). With that in mind and
                    after considering the precedents, I use a 40% discount to fix the discounted
                    multiplier at 12.6 (being 40% of 21). Applying a multiplier of 12.6 to the
                    multiplicand of $2,000 per month will give Ms Quek a total sum of <u>$302,400</u>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Dependency claim of the children</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The plaintiff claims that the deceased, over
                    and above paying monthly maintenance of $9,000 to the family, had also paid
                    $20,000 a year to cover additional expenses including gifts, computers and
                    school trips. But these are mere assertions made by Ms Quek and the
                    children without further corroboration. The only evidence they were able to give
                    to the court was that the deceased had paid Ms Quek two sums of $59,000 and
                    $129,700 respectively, presumably to aid her and the children in buying a new
                    home. However, these one-off payments for the purchase of a home are not
                    evidence of a commitment by the deceased to pay for a bulk of the
                    children’s expenses every year from now till the foreseeable future. The
                    children also claim that their father encouraged them to study abroad and
                    Ms Quek “is very sure the deceased would have supported his children
                    in their decision to pursue their studies overseas”. But unlike the
                    plaintiff in <em>Hanson</em>, the plaintiff in this case
                    has not been able to give the court examples of how the deceased demonstrated
                    any outward conduct whilst he was alive, which shows his intention to support
                    and fund the children’s overseas tertiary education. I thus find that
                    there is insufficient evidence that the deceased had intended to fund the
                    children’s overseas tertiary education, and use $3,500 as the multiplicand
                    in calculating the dependency claim of each child separately.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The plaintiff submits that a multiplier of
                    11 years should be used for the daughter Jo-Ann, and a multiplier of 15
                    years should be used for the son Ryan. I find that a multiplier of 10 years for
                    Jo-Ann is more appropriate, given that she was 13 years old at the time of
                    the deceased’s demise, and will be 23 years old when she finishes her
                    tertiary education. As for Ryan, I find that a multiplier of 15 years is
                    appropriate, as he would finish his tertiary education at the age of
                    25 years old. Given the length of the multiplier, I think that it would be
                    appropriate to employ a discount, and use a discounted multiplier of 7.5 for
                    Jo-Ann and 11.25 for Ryan (applying a discount of 25% for each). I agree with
                    counsel for the second defendant that during the years of tertiary education,
                    the children may require a higher amount of maintenance. I will use the
                    multiplicand of $4,000 for three years to enable them to obtain a university
                    degree. I thus find that Jo-Ann’s dependency claim will come to $328,500
                    (being $4,000 per month for three years, and $3,500 per month for seven years,
                    and applying a discount of 25%) and Ryan’s dependency claim will come to
                    $486,000 (being $4,000 per month for three years and $3,500 per month for
                    12 years, and applying a discount of 25%). I do not think it appropriate to
                    make provision for Ms Quek’s contribution to the family as I am not
                    calculating the total expenses of each child (after all such information was not
                    given to the court by the plaintiff). I am, instead, focussing on what pecuniary
                    benefit the children would have received from the deceased, but for his death.
                    The plaintiff’s overall dependency claim for Ms Quek and the children
                    will be <u>$1,116,900</u>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Loss of inheritance claim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     All parties have stressed that this is the
                    first case in which a loss of inheritance claim is being made under a dependency
                    claim pursuant to section 22(1A) of the CLA. The parties have submitted for
                    different methods of calculation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The plaintiff seeks to evaluate this lump sum
                    award “by way of a <em>financial projection</em>
                    guided by experts with relevant financial and accounting expertise in this area
                    (emphasis in original).” The plaintiff’s expert, Mr Keoy, has
                    reviewed the cash flow analysis for a period of four years, followed by a
                    three-stage future projection to come to a value of about $23m (subsequently
                    amended in submissions to the an amount of about $9.5m using a different
                    discount rate). Mr Keoy’s report takes into account the cash flow of
                    the deceased not just based on his salaried income, but also his investments in
                    properties and other areas. This approach also comprised of many forecast
                    assumptions that attempted to predict 36 years into the future. I am not
                    convinced that these are balanced assumptions. Though Mr Keoy applied a
                    discounted cash flow approach when assessing the deceased’s wealth, he
                    employed a discount rate of 1.1% based on 12-month fixed deposit rates, which
                    did not seem appropriate for longer period forecasts. In calculating the value
                    contributed by the three landed properties which the deceased owned,
                    Mr Keoy seemed to have adopted a simplistic view of property values. This
                    included the fact that the annual rental for each property would grow at 2.2%
                    per annum, equivalent to long-term inflationary rate, and that the deceased
                    would own all of the three properties up to the age of 80 when he would have
                    died of a natural death. This approach disregards the volatility in values that
                    may be caused due to market forces. As such, his estimation of $9.103m
                    attributed to the properties appears to be high.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     On the other hand, the defendant’s
                    expert report seems to adopt an overly narrow approach in focussing on the
                    income of the deceased and fails to take an all-rounded and balanced
                    appreciation of the deceased’s accumulation of wealth which would
                    naturally be inherited by his children. The defendant’s expert has also
                    seemed inconsistent as during the course of the trial, his estimated cash flow
                    value was revised from a deficit of more than $4m to a surplus of almost $2m and
                    then to a net surplus of slightly more than $2m.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     I have considered the expert views from both
                    parties and have been greatly assisted by the court assessor, Mr Harsha
                    Basnayake (“Mr Basnayake”), and taking into account all views
                    presented, I am of the opinion that a balanced approach is to calculate the
                    amount of wealth the deceased would have accumulated, but for his death. I first
                    make an adjustment to Mr Keoy’s report by taking out the value
                    attributed to the three properties, because the estate has realised the value by
                    disposing them and that represents the value today for those assets. I then
                    deduct the personal expenditure and insurance expenses of the deceased, and
                    factor in the maintainable rental income per annum and amounts set aside to
                    finance the properties which would have contributed to the deceased’s
                    average maintainable savings per annum. Using this information and the
                    information from both expert reports, I come to a range of $524,000 to $650,000
                    per annum of savings. I thus take the average savings of the deceased per year
                    as $587,000. This is also consistent with the way such claims are quantified.
                    There is no reason to create a wholly new method of calculation in this
                    case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     I do not find it appropriate to use Mr
                    Keoy’s discount rate of 1.1%, and instead choose to use a discount rate of
                    4% which better reflects the risks attached to the cash flows. This is
                    consistent with prevailing market interest rates, precedent cases, and the
                    position in other jurisdictions. I applied the discount rate of 40% to the
                    multiplier of 21 years (being the remaining years till the deceased’s
                    probable retirement at 65 years old) and multiplied this sum by $587,000
                    per annum, coming to a sum of $7,396,200. I consider the children of the
                    deceased to be his dependents, and note that they are to inherit 52.5% of the
                    deceased’s estate based on his last will. Thus this will result in a sum
                    of <u>$3,883,005</u> for the loss of inheritance of the
                    dependants.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>I award interest at 5.33% per annum (as the default
                        interest rate) on the damages for pain and suffering, Coroner’s
                        Inquiry fees, funeral expenses, and Letters of Administration fees, in all
                        cases from the date of writ until judgment. I also award interest at 5.33%
                        per annum on the damages for bereavement and pre-trial loss of support of Ms
                        Quek and the children (using an approximate figure of five years as
                        submitted by the plaintiff) for the period between the date of death up to
                        and including the date of final judgment. I will hear the parties on costs
                        at a later date if they are unable to agree costs.</p>
