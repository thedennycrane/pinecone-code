The applicants are volunteer council members of MCST Plan No 508 (“the MCST”), which is a strata-titled development located along Upper East Coast Road (“the Development”). The applicants hold the offices of Secretary and Chairman of the MCST. The respondent is the daughter of the late Mr Cheong Kim Koek (“the late Mr Cheong”) and one of two executors and trustees of the estate (“the Estate”). The other executor and trustee of the Estate is the respondent’s husband. Grant of Probate for the Estate was issued on 8 November 2013.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The late Mr Cheong owned unit 53 in the Development (“the Unit”) until the time of his passing. To date, title to the Unit remained with the late Mr Cheong and had not been transferred to the beneficiaries of the Estate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 In 2019, the respondent commenced private prosecution (<span class="font-italic">via</span> private summonses) against the applicants in the State Courts. Subsequently, in early 2020, the respondent commenced a civil action against the applicants and the MCST. Both the private prosecution and the civil action concerned the MCST’s removal of kitchen exhaust ducts (“the Ducts”) from the exterior of the Unit. In response to the private summonses, the applicants filed the present Originating Summons, and prayed for an order that the private prosecution in the State Courts be permanently stayed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 On 14 October 2020, I dismissed the application. The applicants have since appealed against my decision. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The facts</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Events leading to the dispute between the parties</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 As mentioned, the late Mr Cheong was the owner of the Unit up until his time of passing. The Ducts serving the Unit were installed in or around 2004. At that time, the late Mr Cheong was the Chairman and a council member of the MCST.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 As at the date of the hearing of the present Originating Summons, title to the Unit was in the process of being transferred to the respondent and her husband.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 On 14 November 2018, the respondent received a notice and agenda from the MCST calling for an EOGM on 23 November 2018. The purpose of the EOGM was to pass resolutions to authorise the MCST to commence legal proceedings against the respondent to compel her to remove several allegedly unauthorised fixtures and installations, including the Ducts. These resolutions were not passed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 On 18 February 2019, the respondent’s solicitors received a letter from the MCST dated 11 February 2019, where the MCST took the position that no approval had been given for the allegedly unauthorised fixtures and installations. Notice was given to the respondent to remove the Ducts with immediate effect. In response, the respondent’s solicitors informed the MCST by way of a letter dated 20 February 2019 that the requisite approval had been obtained for the installation of the Ducts. The respondent accordingly informed the MCST that a court order should be obtained if the MCST intended to remove the Ducts from the exterior of the Unit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 Then, on the morning of 23 February 2019, the MCST engaged 98 Construction (S) Pte Ltd (“98 Construction”) to remove the Ducts. As the removal was taking place, the respondent and her husband received a call from the tenant of the Unit, Mikawa Yakitori Bar (“Mikawa”). Mikawa informed them that the Ducts were being removed. Mikawa also reported the matter to the police. The respondent and her husband thus made their way to the Unit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 When the respondent and her husband arrived at the Unit, the Ducts had been partially removed. In the process of removal, 98 Construction also allegedly damaged the remaining parts of the Ducts. At this point, the respondent’s husband stopped 98 Construction from proceeding with the removal of the Ducts. Soon after, the police arrived at the Unit. The respondent showed the police the letters from her solicitors and requested the police to stop 98 Construction from proceeding with the removal. The police advised the respondent to commence civil proceedings against the MCST.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 The respondent also requested the applicants, who were present, and 98 Construction to return the removed parts of the Ducts, but they refused. According to the respondent, at this point, the police who were observing the commotion advised the respondent to make a formal police report. The respondent eventually did so on the same day.

What was in contention was whether there were grounds to warrant the issuance of such a stay.

In <span class="font-italic">Soh Chee Wen</span>, Hoo Sheau Peng J comprehensively set out the law on the court’s inherent power to stay criminal proceedings for abuse of process. Hoo J thoroughly canvassed a myriad of authorities spanning multiple jurisdictions. I reiterate herein only the salient aspects of her Honour’s decision (at [31], [39]–[40] and [46]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">31 … the constitutional separation of judicial and prosecutorial powers does not preclude the existence of an inherent power to stay criminal proceedings for an abuse of process. … in the exercise of its criminal jurisdiction, the inherent power is meant to “prevent abuses of [the court’s] process and to control [the court’s] own procedure” and to “safeguard an accused from oppression or prejudice”.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">39 … I am of the view that the superior court has the inherent power to stay criminal proceedings for abuse of process, and that this does not contravene the constitutional separation of judicial and prosecutorial powers.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">The circumstances in which the court would exercise the inherent power to stay criminal proceedings</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">40 … the inherent power may be exercised in two categories of cases, namely, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">(i) where it will be impossible to give the accused a fair trial; </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">or</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> (ii) where the particular circumstances are such that to try the accused would offend the court’s sense of justice and propriety</span> …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">46 … I make a few comments about the second category of cases. According to <span class="font-italic">Maxwell</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">a stay of criminal proceedings should be granted where the court concludes in all the circumstances [that] a trial will “undermine public confidence in the criminal justice system and bring it into disrepute” so as to militate against the public interest in trying persons charged with criminal offences</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> … In undertaking this enquiry, there is a balancing of competing public interests ie, that of ensuring that those who are charged with crimes should be tried with that of ensuring that the integrity of the criminal justice system is upheld.</span> …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in bold in original; emphasis added in bold italics; additional emphasis added in bold underlined italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 I agreed with Hoo J’s observations in <span class="font-italic">Soh Chee Wen</span>. The court must be able to wield the power to protect the integrity of its criminal justice processes. If allowing a prosecution to proceed will represent an abuse of process, the court will intervene to ensure that public confidence in the administration of justice will not be undermined. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Hoo J thus identified two alternative grounds under which a stay may be granted (<span class="font-italic">Soh Chee Wen </span>at [40]): </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) where it will be impossible to give the accused a fair trial (“the first limb”); or </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) where the particular circumstances are such that to try the accused would offend the court’s sense of justice and propriety (“the second limb”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Relevant for present purposes was the second limb. It was apparent from the framing of the Originating Summons, the parties’ written submissions and their arguments in the course of the oral hearing that the applicants were not arguing that a fair trial was impossible.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 It may be observed that Hoo J’s reasoning in <span class="font-italic">Soh Chee Wen</span> was in the context of a <span class="font-italic">public</span> prosecution commenced by the Public Prosecutor. In my view, as a matter of good sense, the rationale espoused therein applies with equal, if not greater, force in the context of <span class="font-italic">private </span>prosecutions, which are commenced by individuals making a complaint to a Magistrate pursuant to s 151 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”). The cases dealing with private prosecutions bear this out.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Permanent stays of private prosecutions</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Cases lacking basis or foundation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 The decision of Woo Bih Li J (as he then was) in <span class="font-italic">Sum Lye Heng (also known as Lim Jessie) v Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 2285 and others </span>[2003] 4 SLR(R) 553 (“<span class="font-italic">Sum Lye Heng</span>”) is on point. <span class="font-italic">Sum Lye Heng</span> was a case that, much like the present one, involved an application for a permanent stay of criminal proceedings that emanated from a <span class="font-italic">private</span> prosecution. Woo J held that the High Court possesses the inherent jurisdiction to grant a permanent stay of criminal proceedings commenced by way of private summonses (at [47]). Having considered the parties’ arguments, Woo J granted the application and permanently stayed the criminal proceedings commenced against the applicant. His Honour observed as follows (at [54] and [80]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">54 … If a case lacked foundation, it would be an abuse of process to pursue it. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">80 I should add that although it is my view that an action or proceeding will be an abuse of process if there is no basis or foundation for it, I have some hesitation in accepting the views of the majority bench in <span class="font-italic">Williams v </span><span class="font-italic">Spautz</span> that a predominantly improper purpose will suffice to constitute an abuse of process. As Deane J said, an action may be initiated for a multitude of reasons. Generally speaking, a reason which is different from the relief sought in the action does not, <span class="font-italic">per se</span>, constitute an abuse of process. Even malice or vindictiveness <span class="font-italic">per se</span> will generally not amount to an abuse of process if there is a valid basis for the action.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The latter part of the reproduced excerpt, concerning the relevance of <span class="font-italic">malice</span>, was <span class="font-italic">obiter</span> given that Woo J granted the application on the sole basis of the lack of foundation in the complainants’ action in that case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Woo J’s decision was upheld on appeal in <span class="font-italic">Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 2285 and others v Sum Lye Heng (alias Lim Jessie) </span>[2004] 2 SLR(R) 408 (“<span class="font-italic">Sum Lye Heng (CA)</span>”). There, the Court of Appeal observed as follows (at [15]–[16]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">15 While the High Court may stay proceedings which are an abuse of its process, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">such an order should only be made if there is very clear evidence of such abuse</span>. In the present case, the essence of the complaint lodged by the fourth appellant, CTS, on behalf of the MC, was that there were sufficient grounds for proceeding against Jessie for contravening ss 66(1) and 67(2) of the Land Titles (Strata) Act. Section 66(1) of the Act provides as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Subject to this section, every member of a council who is in any way, directly or indirectly, interested in a contract or proposed contract with the management corporation shall as soon as practicable after the relevant facts have come to his knowledge declare the nature of his interest at a meeting of the council.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Section 67(2) states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A member of a council … shall not use his position as a member of the council … to gain, directly or indirectly, an advantage for himself or for any other person or to cause detriment to the management corporation.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">16 It is quite obvious that <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">CTS had no cause whatsoever to lodge the complaint which led to the private summons</span> against Jessie. Woo J rightly pointed out that it was not open to the MC to make the complaint that Jessie had breached ss 66(1) and 67(2) of the Land Titles (Strata) Act because all parties concerned had acted on the basis that Jessie had complied with the requirements of the Land Titles (Strata) Act and SCMS had even been encouraged to tender for the management contract in question.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The Court of Appeal did not address Woo J’s <span class="font-italic">dicta</span> in <span class="font-italic">Sum Lye Heng</span> regarding the point on malice, given that it was not an issue on appeal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Based on the above authorities, it is apparent that the threshold for granting a permanent stay of criminal proceedings commenced by way of private summonses is a high one. The complainant must have had “no cause whatsoever to lodge the complaint which led to the private summons” (<span class="font-italic">Sum Lye Heng (CA) </span>at [16]). If the merits of the case are in question and there are triable issues to be ventilated at trial, a stay ought not to be granted given its permanent nature. The bar to meet is that a permanent stay will only be granted if there is <span class="font-italic">very clear</span><span class="font-italic"> evidence</span> of an abuse of process. As will be made clear, this high threshold was material in my decision.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The relevance of malice or mala fides</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Given the express averments made by the applicants that the respondent acted maliciously in taking out the private summonses, a discussion on the issue of malice is warranted. The applicants averred that the private prosecution was commenced “for no reason other than to intimidate and inundate the [a]pplicants … and [was] an attempt by the [r]espondent to strong arm her way to act as she deem[ed] fit”.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 In this regard, I concurred with Woo J’s <span class="font-italic">dicta</span> in <span class="font-italic">Sum Lye Heng</span>. It is worth reproducing, <span class="font-italic">in extenso</span>, Woo J’s observations (at [52]–[54], citing the judgment of Deane J in <span class="font-italic">Williams v </span><span class="font-italic">Spautz </span>(1991–1992) 174 CLR 509 (“<span class="font-italic">Williams v </span><span class="font-italic">Spautz</span>”)):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">52 The dissenting judges Deane and Gaudron JJ, however, were of the view that it was not sufficient to establish that the predominant purpose for instituting a proceeding was something else other than the relief sought. Thus Deane J said at 543:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The subjective purposes which might lead a plaintiff, claimant or informant legitimately to institute civil or criminal proceedings are manifold. Indeed, they are almost unlimited. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">It has never been the policy of the common law that a plaintiff’s predominant subjective purpose in instituting civil proceedings must be that of obtaining the orders sought in them or that committal proceedings can be instituted by a private informant only for a predominant purpose of obtaining the punishment of the defendant and/or the protection of the community.</span> Most civil proceedings are instituted in the hope that the defendant will settle before the action ever comes to trial or formal orders are made. Frequently, they are instituted for the predominant subjective purpose of obtaining an object which it would be beyond the power of the particular court to award in the particular proceedings. For example, the predominant subjective purpose of a plaintiff in a common law action for damages for wrongful dismissal may well be to obtain a settlement involving reinstatement in his or her former position under a contract for personal services of a type which a court would not enforce by specific performance or injunction.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">53 At 547, Deane J said:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">If the proceedings obviously lack any proper foundation in the sense that there is no evidence capable of sustaining a committal, they will obviously be vexatious and oppressive</span>. In such a case, the proceedings themselves are an abuse of the process of the Local Court and will inevitably result in the discharge of the defendant. Notwithstanding the fact that it is ordinarily inappropriate for a supervisory court to stay proceedings in an inferior court on the ground that they will ultimately fail, I am inclined to think that, if it is clear that the proceedings are brought to serve some collateral purpose of the informant and that the charges against the defendant lack any foundation, the Supreme Court would be justified in intervening to halt the proceedings <span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">limine</span> in order to prevent the defendant from being subjected to unfair vexation and oppression.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">At 550, Deane J reiterated:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The proceedings themselves, if otherwise regularly conducted, will constitute an abuse of process only if the circumstances (including X’s collateral purposes and actions) are either such that the proceedings are vexatious and oppressive for the reason that they lack any proper foundation or such that any subsequent trial will be necessarily and unavoidably unfair. Such circumstances plainly have not been shown to exist in the present case where there is no suggestion that, if committal orders were made, any trial would be unfair and where it is not argued that Dr Spautz’s charges lack foundation.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">54 Although Deane J’s judgment at 547 may at first blush suggest a dual requirement of both improper purpose and lack of foundation before a case of abuse of process is made out<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">, it seemed to me that he was not suggesting a dual requirement. If a case lacked foundation, it would be an abuse of process to pursue it.</span> The collateral purpose or motive of the party pursuing the action might be taken into account in determining the absence of foundation but was not a discrete requirement.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">From the above excerpt, and bearing in mind the Court of Appeal’s observations in <span class="font-italic">Sum Lye Heng (CA)</span>, I make two critical observations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 First, and as a matter of <span class="font-italic">stare decisis</span>, I was bound by the Court of Appeal’s pronouncement in <span class="font-italic">Sum Lye Heng (CA)</span>, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, a total lack of basis or foundation in a complainant’s claim would suffice to constitute an abuse of process, absent any malice. Woo J’s observation at [54] of <span class="font-italic">Sum Lye Heng </span>(as reproduced and emphasised at [39] above) was upheld on appeal. I wholly agreed with the rationale behind this rule; if it is patently clear that no valid complaint whatsoever exists, then the complainant’s invocation of the court’s processes under the CPC would clearly be abusive and serve only as a waste of judicial resources. This is something the court will not allow as a matter of justice and propriety.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Second, in my view, I considered malice on the complainant’s part to be <span class="font-italic">insufficient</span> as a standalone requirement to constitute an abuse of process. Deane J’s observations in <span class="font-italic">Williams v </span><span class="font-italic">Spautz</span>, as reproduced at [39] above,<span class="font-italic"> </span>were apposite; in essence, the law recognises that in reality, complainants and claimants may often be angry people. They seek redress and vindication through the court mechanism. Their motivations notwithstanding, the court’s duty is to scrutinise the merits of their complaints or claims in accordance with the established principles of law. If a case is meritorious, it does not matter if it was brought in anger or spite. The converse is true: if a case is wholly and patently unmeritorious, it matters little if it was brought in good faith. The court might still find this to be an abuse of process (in line with the observations in <span class="font-italic">Sum Lye Heng</span> and <span class="font-italic">Sum Lye Heng (CA)</span>). This turns on the specific facts of each case. Malice does not discount the need for an applicant who prayed for a permanent stay of criminal proceedings to prove that the respondent’s private prosecutions were wholly without basis, although, as observed by Woo J, malice where present might “be taken into account in determining the absence of foundation [in a complainant’s case]” (at [54]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 With the law as set out above, I turn to address the merits of the parties’ respective cases.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether a permanent stay should be granted</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The respondent’s locus standi</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The applicants identified this as a preliminary issue to be dealt with at the outset.

Criminal proceedings in the form of a private prosecution may thus be initiated against the accused under s 150 upon issuance of a summons by the Magistrate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 As the trustee of the Estate, the respondent would have a duty to protect and preserve all the property of the Estate in the interest of and for the benefit of the beneficiaries. I could not see how the respondent would have no <span class="font-italic">locus standi</span> to make a complaint to the Magistrate pursuant to s 151(1) of the CPC that the applicants had committed an offence of mischief against the property of the Estate by causing “<span class="font-italic">the destruction to the property of the Estate </span><span class="font-italic">…, to wit, by engaging one [98 Construction], … to remove and destroy part of the [Ducts] installed on the back wall of the property…</span>”<span class="font-italic"> </span>as was stated in the respective charges. There is nothing in s 151 of the CPC which restricts a complainant only to the <span class="font-italic">person </span><span class="font-italic">injured</span> as a result of an alleged offence, or the registered <span class="font-italic">owner of property</span> damaged as a result of an alleged offence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 As such, I found that the applicants’ preliminary objection on the respondent’s lack of <span class="font-italic">locus standi</span> based on the mere fact that the respondent’s name was not listed in the land register as a subsidiary proprietor of the Unit was simply without basis.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 In any event, the applicants’ preliminary objection would not cross the high threshold required for a permanent stay of the private prosecutions brought by the respondent. It is worth noting that the present private prosecutions could not be initiated without the Magistrate being satisfied that there was sufficient reason to proceed with the respondent’s complaint that the applicants had committed an alleged offence of mischief under s 425 of the Penal Code. Below, I explain in detail why there is good reason for the matter to proceed to trial.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the court should exercise its inherent jurisdiction to grant a stay</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Reiterating the test for abuse of process</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 I point out preliminarily that the respondent conflated the two alternative grounds for a permanent stay, as espoused in <span class="font-italic">Soh Chee Wen</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([30] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>). Counsel for the respondent provided their interpretation of the <span class="font-italic">first limb</span>, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the “fair trial” limb, of <span class="font-italic">Soh Chee Wen</span> (see <span class="font-italic">Soh Chee Wen</span> at [40], as well as the emphasised portion of the excerpt reproduced at [30] above). However, the applicants did not argue that a fair trial would be impossible if the matter were to proceed. Their argument was that the respondent was abusing the court process, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the second limb in <span class="font-italic">Soh Chee Wen</span> involving a situation “where the particular circumstances [were] such that to try the accused would offend the court’s sense of justice and propriety”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The threshold for this second limb, as mentioned earlier with reference to <span class="font-italic">Sum Lye Heng</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([35] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>and <span class="font-italic">Sum Lye Heng (CA)</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([36] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), would be met if it could be shown that the complainant’s case was wholly devoid of merit. In the words of Deane J in <span class="font-italic">Williams v </span><span class="font-italic">Spautz </span>([39] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), the threshold is met when “the proceedings obviously lack any proper foundation in the sense that there is <span class="font-italic">no evidence</span> capable of sustaining a committal” [emphasis added] (at p 547).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Viewed another way, an application for a permanent stay of criminal proceedings bears shades of an application for striking out of a party’s pleadings in civil proceedings under O 18 r 19 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed). A striking out application often involves scrutiny of the lack of merit to a party’s claim in law or in fact (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, under the “discloses no reasonable cause of action or defence” limb under O 18 r 19(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)). This is a similar threshold to that of “no basis or foundation” as espoused in Woo J’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Sum Lye </span><span class="font-italic">Heng</span> and the Court of Appeal’s observations in <span class="font-italic">Sum Lye Heng (CA)</span>. I have emphasised this point above at [37] and [44].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 If the applicants were of the view that respondent’s private prosecutions were wholly without merit despite the respondent providing <span class="font-italic">some </span>evidence in support of her case, then a submission of no case to answer after the close of the private prosecution could be adopted by the applicants. If the evidence at the close of the Prosecution’s case could not withstand scrutiny at that juncture, then the applicants would be acquitted of the charges without their defence being called. That is a decision to be made <span class="font-italic">at trial</span>, and not at this juncture.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether the present case amounted to an abuse of process by the respondent</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 With the above in mind, all of the applicants’ arguments that the respondent’s commencement of private prosecution amounted to an abuse of process were untenable.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) The capacities of the applicants</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The first argument was that the respondent brought the private summonses against the applicants in their personal capacities, but the applicants were acting in their <span class="font-italic">official capacities as officers of the MCST </span>(see [22(a)] above). As I mentioned, the argument appeared to be that the MCST, <span class="font-italic">not</span> the applicants, ought to be the subject of criminal proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 For offences such as mischief under s 425 of the Penal Code, a non-natural entity such as the MCST would inevitably have to act through natural persons, such as the applicants. There was evidence that the applicants were personally involved in organising and carrying out the removal and destruction of the Ducts with the assistance of 98 Construction. That they might also have acted in their official capacities as officers of the MCST would not necessarily preclude them for being criminally liable in mischief if their acts were in contravention of s 425 of the Penal Code. I accordingly did not see the applicants’ argument as meritorious; it by no means rendered the respondent’s claim as baseless or without foundation. This issue of the applicants’ capacity should be better left for trial. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) The removal of the Ducts</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The applicants’ next argument was that the act of removing the Ducts was not wrongful to begin with, for a myriad of reasons including (see [22(b)] above): </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the Ducts were fixtures that were affixed to common property, and accordingly the property interest in the Ducts resided with the MCST;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the respondent’s claim that the requisite approval had been obtained for the installation of the Ducts on common property was founded on a forged document, namely the “2004 Minutes”; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the relevant provisions of the BMSMA and the LT(S)A showed that the respondent and/or the Estate and/or the late Mr Cheong were not entitled to install the Ducts on common property as there was no prior authorisation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In my view, these were all issues that had to be ventilated at trial. The first issue involved a question of law. The second issue involved a question of fact. The third issue involved a mixed question of law and fact.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(A) The issue of fixtures</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 On the issue of fixtures, counsel for the applicants cited <span class="font-italic">People’s Park Chinatown Development Pte </span><span class="font-italic">Ltd v Schindler Lifts (Singapore) Pte Ltd</span> [1992] 3 SLR(R) 236 (“<span class="font-italic">People’s Park</span>”) at [10] as standing for the proposition that title to any fixtures reverts to the freeholder of the property, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the MCST in this case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 It would <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> appear that the Ducts were fixtures, given the manner in which they were affixed to the Development (albeit I make no definitive finding on this factual issue, given that the respondent disputed the Ducts’ status as fixtures in her affidavit).

</div> However, and more importantly, counsel for the applicants omitted to cite the full extract in <span class="font-italic">People’s Park</span> in context. While the Court of Appeal noted at [10] that as against a <span class="font-italic">builder</span>, a freeholder to a property has incontrovertible title, the Court of Appeal also noted the exception of <span class="font-italic">tenant’s fixtures</span>, and that in such cases a tenant might be entitled to “sever” the fixture as against other persons, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, the freeholder. Indeed, it would seem offensive to common sense that a tenant who expended funds on procuring a fixture would not be allowed to sever and reclaim the fixture for his own benefit (which in my view is the basis of the rule on tenant’s fixtures). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 In line with such concerns, in <span class="font-italic">Riduan</span><span class="font-italic"> bin Yusof v Khng Thian Huat and another </span>[2005] 4 SLR(R) 234 (“<span class="font-italic">Riduan</span><span class="font-italic"> bin Yusof</span>”), the Court of Appeal restated the rule on tenant’s fixtures as follows (at [25]–[26]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">25 … the category of fixtures is further divided into landlord's fixtures, which must be left by the tenant at the expiry of his lease, and tenant’s fixtures which the tenant is permitted to remove. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">26 The policy consideration behind the exception of tenant’s fixtures is alluded to in Woodfall’s <span class="font-italic">Landlord and Tenant </span>at para 13.142 (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, Release 58, May 2004) in these terms:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The policy of the law which led to the relaxation of the rule prohibiting the removal of trade fixtures is plain. It was evolved “in support of the interests of trade, which have become the pillar of the state”. Thus the courts considered that the commercial interests of the country might be advanced by the encouragement given to tenants to employ their capital in making improvements for carrying on trade, with the certainty of having the benefit of their expenditure secured for them at the end of their terms.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 In a similar tenor, Judith Prakash J (as she then was) observed in <span class="font-italic">BP Refinery Singapore Pte Ltd v Amazon Group Ltd </span>[1998] 3 SLR(R) 4<span class="font-italic"> </span>that “[t]enant’s trade fixtures have <span class="font-italic">long occupied a special place in the law of fixtures</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>… they may be removed from the land by the tenant during or at the expiration of his tenancy” [emphasis added] (at [18]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Whether the Ducts could be regarded as fixtures and whether the doctrine of tenant’s fixtures could be invoked in the present case would be issues for trial, and I make no further comment on them. As the Court of Appeal noted in <span class="font-italic">Riduan</span><span class="font-italic"> bin Yusof</span> at [27], “[w]hat would constitute … tenant’s fixtures must depend on <span class="font-italic">the circumstances of the case</span>, in particular, the <span class="font-italic">purpose</span> for which the article is affixed onto the land” [emphasis added]. What was clear to me was that the respondent’s private prosecution could not be regarded at this preliminary stage as unsustainable simply by virtue of the Ducts being fixtures affixed to the Development.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 I add a further point on this issue: the relevant provisions of the BMSMA on the issue of “common property” do not appear to derogate from the doctrine of tenant’s fixtures. The respondent did not appear to dispute that the Ducts were in fact built on common property.

Not all of these issues have been fleshed out in detail in these proceedings. These are serious issues to be tried, and matters <span class="font-italic">better left for trial</span>. They involve intertwined questions of law and fact dealing with, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the interpretation of the BMSMA provisions as well as how the MCST’s power to enact by-laws has been invoked in the present case. I elaborate further on the issues on statutory interpretation at [67]–[68] below.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(B) The 2004 Minutes</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Counsel for the applicants claimed, in written submissions, that the report stating that the 2004 Minutes were forgeries (“the TFEG Report”) was not disputed by the respondent, the argument being that the respondent did not challenge the conclusion that the said minutes were forged.

</div> Needless to say, this would be an issue to be tested at trial, given that a closer examination of the factual evidence, including the 2004 Minutes, would be required. This would foreseeably include forensic analyses of the 2004 Minutes and cross-examination of the relevant personnel involved in the preparation of these minutes.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(C) The provisions of the BMSMA and LT(S)A</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 On the issues relating to the BMSMA and the LT(S)A, this boiled down to a proper interpretation of the relevant statutes. I accepted that the applicants made a compelling case regarding their unilateral right to remove the Ducts pursuant to s 30 of the BMSMA given that no exclusive use by-laws had apparently been made by the MCST pursuant to relevant resolutions, and more particularly the 90% resolution under s 33(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>), allowing the subsidiary proprietor of the Unit to mount the Ducts on common property resulting in exclusive use of the common property since 2004. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 However, the respondent correctly pointed out in written submissions that s 30 of the BMSMA appears to be silent on whether the MCST would, after dismantling the Ducts installed on common property, be entitled to refuse to return the removed parts of the Ducts to the respondent and/or the trustees of the Estate upon their request, and even to go further to dispose of or destroy the removed parts of the Ducts to the detriment of the respondent and/or the Estate. The refusal to return and the forceable disposal or destruction of the removed parts of the Ducts despite requests for the return of the items by the respondent at the time of the dismantling of the Ducts no doubt would be relevant to a charge of mischief against the applicants in their personal capacities under s 425 of the Penal Code. To date, it would appear that the respondent had not been informed of the whereabouts of the removed parts of the Ducts. These disputed issues in my view were better left for trial. On the face of the applicants’ arguments, I was not persuaded that the relevant provisions of the BMSMA rendered the respondent’s private prosecutions wholly unviable.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) The overlap between OSS 3 and the private summonses</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 The applicants’ final contention was that OSS 3 substantially overlapped with the private summonses, and the issues raised in the private summonses were not “separate and distinct from those raised in OSS 3” (see [22(c)] above). This argument was essentially a suggestion that there was only one real dispute between the parties, and that this dispute ought to be heard in a single set of proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 I found this argument to be unmeritorious. The objects of a criminal prosecution with a higher standard of proof <span class="font-italic">beyond a reasonable doubt</span> differ from that of a civil claim with a lower standard of proof <span class="font-italic">on a balance of probabilit</span><span class="font-italic">ies</span>, though both could stem from the same broad set of facts. Civil and criminal liability do commonly coexist, and they serve different purposes. I did not see how the overlap could preclude either a civil claim or private prosecution on a criminal charge, where both the civil claim and criminal charge would be separately made out on the facts. I did not think that an accused person could escape criminal liability simply because he might also be liable at the same time under a civil claim for having committed acts which made him liable for both. A clear example would be accident cases where an accused person could be sued for compensation by the injured accident victim and yet be prosecuted for a traffic offence committed. Overlap of the issues raised in OSS 3 and in the private summonses would therefore be insufficient, <span class="font-italic">ipso facto</span>, to warrant a permanent stay of the criminal proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(4) Concluding remarks on the issue of abuse of process</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 In totality, I observed that the various arguments raised by the parties lent themselves to several serious issues to be tried. There was no basis to conclude at this preliminary juncture that the respondent’s case was wholly untenable or unsupported by any evidence at all. This matter should be left to the scrutiny of the trial judge, who would have the opportunity to hear the parties’ cases in full and review the salient aspects of the evidence.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 I accordingly dismissed the application. I ordered costs of $3,500, inclusive of disbursements, in favour of the respondent against the applicants.
