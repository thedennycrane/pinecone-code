<p align="justify">1.    This is an appeal against some parts of a decision by the

District Judge Mrs Emily K Wilfred on ancillary matters of a divorce petition.

</p><p align="justify">2.    The parties are David Chan Teck Hock (the Husband) and

Leong Mei Chuan (the Wife). They were married on 21 September 1983 but unfortunately their

marriage eventually floundered.

</p><p align="justify">3.    On or about 10 February 1997, the Husband left the

matrimonial home.

</p><p align="justify">4.    On 21 November 1997, the Wife petitioned for divorce and a

Decree Nisi was granted on 24 September 1998.

</p><p align="justify">5.    The parties then fought over the ancillaries and on 20

January 2000, the District Judge made an Order on various aspects of the ancillaries, some of which

are the subject of appeal by the Husband and some by the Wife.

</p><p align="justify">6.    I set out below those parts of the Order which are the

subject of appeal by either party:

</p><blockquote>
<p align="justify">(1) The Wife has sole custody, care and control of the 3 children of the

  marriage with reasonable access to the Husband as follows:

  </p><p align="justify">[The details of access are not material for the appeals before me. However, the

  Husband is appealing for an order that on the issue of the childrens education, the Wife is to

  consult and obtain his prior consent. His appeal in respect of the childrens religion was

  withdrawn before me.]</p>
<p align="justify">(2) The Husband is to pay the Wife a sum of $16,000 per month for the

  maintenance of the 3 children and the Wife ($5,000 per child per month and $1,000 per month for

  the Wife) with effect from 1 January 2000 and thereafter the first day of each month, payment to

  be made directly.

  </p><p align="justify">[The Husband is appealing that the maintenance be reduced to:</p>
<p align="justify">(a) $8,000 per month for the children as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(i) $3,500 for the eldest child Cheryl,</p>
<p align="justify">(ii) $2,500 for the second child Sean, and</p>
<p align="justify">(iii) $2,000 for the youngest child Valerie, and</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">(b) $500 per month for the Wife.</p>
<p align="justify">On the other hand, the Wife is appealing that (a) the maintenance for her be

  increased to $5,000 per month, and (b) the maintenance for her and the children be paid with

  effect from February 1996.]</p>
<p align="justify">(3) 

  </p><p align="justify">(4) 

  </p><p align="justify">(5) The Wife shall be entitled to 15% of the Husbands Dell stocks, namely:-

  </p><blockquote>
<p align="justify">(i) 111,100 shares purchased from the open market and valued at

    US$4,575,986.80;</p>
<p align="justify">(ii) 10,821 shares bought from the Employee Stock Purchase Plan valued at

    US$445,695; and</p>
<p align="justify">(iii) The gains from Dell stocks vested and exercised by the Respondent under

    the Non-Statutory Stock Option Agreement scheme amounting to US$2,573,328 less tax to be paid on

    such gains (proof on demand of payment from the IRAS).</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">[The Wife is appealing for 30% instead of 15%.]</p>
<p align="justify">(6) There shall be no division of Dell stocks in the Non-Statutory Stock Option

  Agreements which have yet to be vested in the Husband.

  </p><p align="justify">[The Wife is appealing for a 30% or 15% share.]</p>

<p align="justify">7.    The Wifes appeal with regard to a property in Gold Coast,

Australia, was withdrawn before me.

<b><i>
<p align="justify">Childrens education</p>
</i></b>
<p align="justify">8.    I refer to para 5 of the Grounds of Decision (GD) of

the District Judge:

</p><blockquote>
<p align="justify"> There had been umpteen applications for access since 1997 and the

  parties had resorted to communicating with each other through their lawyers on every small issue

  concerning the children. It can be gleaned through their numerous affidavits that their

  relationship was highly contentious and acrimonious. I could not foresee the parents cooperating

  with each other on the education and religion of the children. Furthermore I was of the view that

  (<i>sic</i>) children were old enough to voice their own views on such matters and if the wife was

  to force her views on the children, they could inform their father who could then make the

  necessary application to court . With regard to education, the children are already attending

  schools. In all fairness, the husband has not accused the wife of being incapable of raising the

  children. In fact he consented to her having care and control of them. I was of the view that it

  would be detrimental to the welfare of the children if I made an order that the husbands

  consent be obtained on matters of religion and education in view of their acrimonious

  relationship.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">9.    I have considered the many affidavits filed by the

respective parties. The acrimony between the parties is clear.</p>
<p align="justify">10.    In my view, it is unrealistic to compel the Wife to consult

and seek the prior consent of the Husband on the childrens education. That would be a recipe for

disaster.

</p><p align="justify">11.    As the Husband has consented to the Wife having care and

control of the children, he should not qualify his consent by imposing the condition which is the

subject of his appeal before me. Much as he loves the children, he should come to terms with the

situation.

<p align="justify">Maintenance</p>

<p align="justify">12.    Section 69(4) of the Womens Charter (Cap 353) 1997

Edition requires the court to have regard to all the circumstances of the case when ordering

maintenance for a wife or child including various factors listed as (a) to (h) under sub-section

(4).

<p align="justify">14.    The Wife said she received $13,000 per month from the

Husband when she resigned from her job with Royal Bank of Canada. This was for six months and the

Husband was to continue paying for family and household expenses. The Husband said the $13,000 per

month was to include the family and household expenses and the Wife was supposed to look for a job.

</p><p align="justify">15.    It is immaterial to me whether the $13,000 per month was to

include or exclude family and household expenses. It was obviously given to the Wife because she had

resigned from her job. She had also accompanied the Husband to Tokyo. It was a special situation

then.

</p><p align="justify">16.    As can be seen from the Wifes job history, the Wifes

earning capacity was quite great. However she alleged that all her previous jobs required her

to travel on a frequent basis. Subsequently, she decided not to take a job which required her to

travel as that would mean leaving the children alone for long periods. Her present job with Kim Eng

Securities (Pte) Ltd was taken on the basis that she does not have to travel at all, hence her low

income (see para 96 of her affidavit filed on 30 August 1999).

</p><p align="justify">17.    However, although the Wifes current basic salary is

$4,000 per month, she is entitled to receive a bonus.

the parties for Year of Assessment (YA) 1999 and YA 2000.

income from employment to be $42,736. This was less than $4,000 a month but it was not explained to

me why this was so.

employment to be $92,657 which was about $7,700 per month.

<p align="justify">22.    The Husbands income from Dell Asia was not confined to

his basic salary. Aside from allowances, he was also entitled to receive a bonus provided targets

were met.

</p><p align="justify">23.    For 1998, the Notice of Assessment shows his income from

employment in Singapore was $181,405. The Form IR8A indicated that this income from Singapore ceased

on 30 September 1998.</p></font>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">24.    <font face="Times New Roman">The Employers Return of

Remuneration &amp; Pensions for Hong Kong income for the year ended 31 March 1999 showed his income

for six months from 1 October 1998 to 31 March 1999, excluding various allowances, to be HK$820,438

(i.e about $182,320 at an exchange rate of, say, HK$4.5 to S$1). There was nothing for bonus.

<p align="justify">25.    It is easier to consider the Employers Return for Hong

Kong income for one full year from 1 April 1999 to 31 March 2000. This was HK$1,792,829 for salary

and HK$1,333,283 for bonus, i.e a total of HK$3,126,112 (or about $694,692 at the same exchange

rate). This works out to $57,891, say, $58,000 per month (including bonus) or about S$33,200 per

month (excluding bonus). Neither figure includes G &amp; S allowance, Auto allowance and Stock

Purchase discount or gains realised from stock options for the Husband.

</p><p align="justify">26.    At this stage, I refer to the case of <i>Susy Suryani

Santoso v Lee Kong Eng &amp; Alexis Khoo</i> (Divorce 1704/98 and RAS 95 and 96/99). In that case,

Justice Judith Prakash ordered that the husband pay additional maintenance based on each months

bonus received by the husband if and when he was paid any bonus. Her decision on this point was

reversed by the Court of Appeal but no written reasons were given.

</p><p align="justify">27.    I am of the view that the decision of the Court of Appeal

does not mean that bonuses should never be taken into account on the issue of maintenance. Each case

must depend on its own particular facts and it should be borne in mind that bonuses may not be paid

or, if paid, may not be for the same sum each year.

</p><p align="justify">28.    Prior to the District Judges order on maintenance, there

were two earlier orders for maintenance.

</p><p align="justify">29.    On 2 February 1998, the Wife applied for maintenance. The

parties then consented to an order dated 13 February 1998 under Summons No MSS 265/1998 (the 1<sup>st</sup>

Maintenance Order).

</p><p align="justify">30.    Under the 1<sup>st</sup> Maintenance Order, the Husband was

to pay $11,000 per month for maintenance of the Wife and the three children with effect from 15

February 1998 and thereafter on the 15<sup>th</sup> of each month.

</p><p align="justify">31.    Just a few months later, the Wife applied on 25 June 1998

for an increase in the maintenance.

</p><p align="justify">32.    The parties again consented to an order this time dated 13

August 1998 and made under Summons No MSS 3099/1998 (the 2<sup>nd</sup> Maintenance Order).

</p><p align="justify">33.    Under the 2<sup>nd</sup> Maintenance Order, the Husband was

to pay $14,500 per month for maintenance of the Wife and three children with effect from 15 August

1998 and thereafter on the 15<sup>th</sup> of each month.

</p><p align="justify">34.    However the 2<sup>nd</sup> Maintenance Order was made

without prejudice to the ancillary issues to be dealt with in the divorce petition. The 1<sup>st</sup>

Maintenance Order did not have this qualification.

</p><p align="justify">35.    While Counsel for each party stressed that the 2<sup>nd</sup>

Maintenance Order was made without prejudice to the ancillaries, neither was too keen to say much,

if anything, as to why her client had agreed to the amount of maintenance ordered under the 1<sup>st</sup>

Maintenance Order. The reason for this was obvious. In the case of the Husband, he was seeking less

than what had been ordered thereunder and in the case of the Wife, she was seeking more.

</p><p align="justify">36.    After considering various factors, as set out in paras 15

to 17 of her GD, the District Judge made an order for maintenance at $16,000 per month, as set out

in para 6 above.

</p><p align="justify">37.    In so far as the Husband had sought to use the 1<sup>st</sup>

Maintenance Order and the 2<sup>nd</sup> Maintenance Order against the Wife, he was not entitled to

use the 2<sup>nd</sup> Maintenance Order to do so as it was made without prejudice to the

ancillaries (even though the without prejudice qualification may have been included at his request).

The without prejudice privilege applies to both parties and Mrs Anamah Tan for the Husband did not

contend otherwise.

</p><p align="justify">38.    As for the 1<sup>st</sup> Maintenance Order, it can be

taken into account for or against either of the parties, and not just against the Wife.

</p><p align="justify">39.    It is incumbent on either party seeking less or more than

what had been ordered under the 1<sup>st</sup> Maintenance Order to justify why a decrease or

increase should be allowed.

</p><p align="justify">40.    As for the Wife, her Counsel Ms Kanya submitted that when

the Wife agreed to the $11,000 per month, this was because the Husband was supposed to continue

paying the utility bills, payments in respect of the matrimonial home as well as supermarket

expenses. These were paid by GIRO and when the Husband stopped the GIRO payment subsequently, the

Wife sought an increase in maintenance which resulted in the 2<sup>nd</sup> Maintenance Order.

</p><p align="justify">41.    However, this reason turned out to be untrue.

</p><p align="justify">42.    Under the 1<sup>st</sup> Maintenance Order, the Wife was to

pay for the mortgage, TAS, PUB, maintenance charges and property tax for the matrimonial home. The 1<sup>st</sup>

Maintenance Order was silent about the subsequent supermarket expenses. I am of the view that it was

for the Wife to require an express stipulation if the Husband was to continue paying supermarket

expenses.

</p><p align="justify">43.    In any event, the Wife herself did not give the reason

which Ms Kanya gave when the Wife sought an increase in maintenance which resulted in the 2<sup>nd</sup>

Maintenance Order.

</p><p align="justify">44.    In the Wifes second complaint which led to the 2<sup>nd</sup>

Maintenance Order, she gave the following reasons for seeking an increase to about $33,000 per

month:

</p><blockquote>
<p align="justify">2(a) That the maintenance sum of $11,000-00 is insufficient to meet the

  needs of the Complainant and the children of the family.</p>
<p align="justify">(b) That the Respondent has not fully declared his means to the Court and is

  able to support the family in the sum to be varied.</p>
<p align="justify">(c) That the Respondent has not been paying sufficient maintenance since

  January 1996.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">45.    I am of the view that her paragraph 2(c) is not a valid

reason for increasing maintenance from a consent order.

</p><p align="justify">46.    As for her paragraph 2(a), I do not agree that $11,000 per

month is insufficient to meet the needs of the children and the Wife. Whether it is sufficient to

enable them to live in the lifestyle they were used to is another matter.

</p><p align="justify">47.    The real reason for the Wife seeking an increase was her

paragraph 2(b). This reason is reiterated in paras 25 to 28 of her affidavit filed on 12 August 1998

i.e one day before the 2<sup>nd</sup> Maintenance Order was made.

</p><p align="justify">48.    Furthermore, in para 20 of her Affidavit of Evidence in

Chief 1<sup>st</sup> for the Ancillary matters filed on 25 June 1999 (AEIC) the Wife said that

she was seeking maintenance of at least $33,000 per month, based on the Respondents last known

income earned in Singapore of $840,416.15 in 1997, and his last known income earned in Hong Kong,

for the period 1 April 1997 to 31 March 1998, of HK$18,735,755. This income was earned by the

Respondent prior to his promotion from Vice President, Asia Direct, to President of Dell, Hong

Kong/China. This translates to an (<i>sic</i>) approximately monthly income of S$382,297.26.

</p><p align="justify">49.    This reinforces the point that her ground for seeking an

increase in maintenance in June 1998 and later in her AEIC for ancillaries was because she had found

out more about the Husbands income.

</p><p align="justify">50.    The question I have to consider is whether there is some

basis for the Wife to say that she would not have agreed to $11,000 per month had the Husband not

misrepresented his income.

</p><p align="justify">51.    From the correspondence between solicitors and the Husbands

own affidavit filed on 11 August 1998 in respect of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Maintenance Summons, it is

clear to me that the Husband had said that he was earning slightly over $20,000 per month when the

Wife first agreed to $11,000 per month for the 1<sup>st</sup> Maintenance Order (of 13 February

1998).

</p><p align="justify">52.    The Husband sought to explain this away by saying that he

was not asked to state the exact figure. Even so, I am of the view that he was giving a lower round

figure than he should have and he had omitted to mention his eligibility for bonus.

</p><p align="justify">53.    I am of the view that the Wife has established that she

would not have agreed to the $11,000 per month had the Husbands true income then been disclosed

and certainly not when his income for the year 1 April 1999 to 31 March 2000 (see para 25 above) is

known.

</p><p align="justify">54.    However, I have still to consider the alleged expenses for

the children and her.

</p><p align="justify">55.    For this purpose, I start with the Wifes initial claim

for maintenance which led to the 1<sup>st</sup> Maintenance Order. She had listed out various

alleged expenses.

</p><p align="justify">56.    According to Ms Kanya and Mrs Tan, the total of the alleged

expenses amounted to $24,340.14.

</p><p align="justify">57.    Both Counsel then assumed that the Wife had claimed

maintenance of about $24,000 per month.

</p><p align="justify">58.    I noted that both Counsel had used an incomplete complaint

made by the Wife under s 133(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code. Item 5 of the complaint in which the

Wife was to state the amount of maintenance claimed was blank. Therefore I asked for a copy of the

completed complaint to be provided to me and eventually this was done.

</p><p align="justify">59.    As it turned out, the completed complaint showed that the

Wife was then claiming $21,000 (and not $24,000) per month as maintenance for herself and the three

children. This is quite telling because it was a claim she had made before she was misled about the

Husbands income.

</p><p align="justify">60.In just under five months, she was subsequently alleging that her expenses,

and corresponding claim for maintenance, had increased to $33,000 per month for her 2<sup>nd</sup>

claim for maintenance.

</p><p align="justify">61.    The Wife provided a list of alleged expenses for her 2<sup>nd</sup>

claim for maintenance. She also provided a list of such expenses in her AEIC (for ancillaries) and

it is this list which I have considered. It appears to me that she had inflated her expenses in an

attempt to justify her claim for $33,000 per month. Also, some of the items should not be included

in a maintenance order.

</p><p align="justify">62.    For example, the Wife included insurance premiums for

policies she had taken out. These appeared to have a savings or investment element in them as the

premiums were rather high bearing in mind the sums insured. The Wife did not deny this but

considered it right that the Husband should pay the premiums. I do not agree. When the policies

mature, the Wife or the children will have the benefits and not the Husband.

</p><p align="justify">63.    The Wife also claimed for monies given to her mother and

for making gifts to relatives and friends. While a court would encourage filial piety and

generosity, this cannot be at the expense of the Husband.

</p><p align="justify">64.    Also, in claiming for household expenses, the Wife was

claiming for a household of seven i.e herself, the three children, a maid and her parents. She gave

the reason that her parents were helping to take care of the children but I do not accept that the

parents contribution to the care of the children was to such an extent that it was right to

compel the Husband to provide for household expenses for the parents.

</p><p align="justify">65.    The Wife also said that the amounts paid by CSV from 1994

to January 1995 would support her claim of expenses amounting to about $33,000 per month. She

alleged that all payments by CSV were for such expenses. I have considered the payments made by CSV

during this period. Some of the payments for large sums were to the Husband or to the Wife for their

respective salaries. Some were for their respective credit card expenses and it was unclear what

other payments to the Husband were for. Some of the other payments were also dubious, eg there were

payments of $1,000 a month to Leong Kuan Swee (the Wifes father) for transport, presumably as

some sort of chauffeur, of $800 a month to Tan Cheng Poon (the Wifes mother) for tuition, and of

$2,000 a month to Kam Swee Kee (the Husbands mother) for tuition. I doubt that such payments were

genuinely for chauffeur services or for tuition. They were probably to draw money out from CSV for

these relatives.

</p><p align="justify">66.    At this point, I would mention that the Husband sought to

use the Wifes new list of alleged expenses to his advantage. That new list had three headings:

(a) Household Expenses, (b) the Wifes Expenses and (c) the Childrens Expenses. The Childrens

Expenses amounted to slightly over $9,000 per month. Using this, the Husband said that $8,000 per

month for the children was fair after taking into account some exaggeration on the part of the Wife.

</p><p align="justify">67.    I am of the view that the Husbands approach was not

correct. Obviously some of the Household Expenses would also be for the account of the children.

Furthermore, he himself had consented to maintenance of a total of $11,000 per month for the Wife

and the children under the 1<sup>st</sup> Maintenance Order and yet was now seeking to convince the

court that it should be $8,500 per month (ie $8,000 per month for the children and $500 per month

for the Wife).

</p><p align="justify">68.    Mrs Tan did not give any reason why the Husband had agreed

to $11,000 per month in the first place.

</p><p align="justify">69.    Coming back to the Wifes appeal for an increase in

maintenance, Mrs Tan had submitted that the Wife was trying to have two bites at the cherry, first,

by using the Husbands stock options to claim higher maintenance and, secondly, by claiming a

share in the Husbands stock options in the division of matrimonial assets.

</p><p align="justify">70.    Ms Kanya denied this. She referred to para 15 of the GD in

which the District Judge had determined that the Husbands average monthly income was $44,281

without taking into account his stock options or gains therefrom.

</p><p align="justify">71.    However, I note that in para 20 of the Wifes AEIC, the

contents of which I have cited in para 48 above, the Wife did take into account the Husbands

gains from stock options when she was seeking $33,000 per month as maintenance (see also para

40(2)(g) and (h) at p 32 and p 307 and 310 of the Wifes AEIC).

</p><p align="justify">72.    In any event, at present, the Wife is no longer seeking

$33,000 per month in her appeal before me but $20,000 per month (instead of the $16,000 per month

allowed by the District Judge) for the children and herself. The increase of $4,000 per month is

sought for herself.

</p><p align="justify">73.    In the light of Ms Kanyas argument, as mentioned in para

70 above, it appears that Ms Kanya is not relying on the stock options to seek the additional $4,000

per month for the Wife. Accordingly, I am disregarding the stock options for the issue of

maintenance.

</p><p align="justify">74.    After taking into account the Wifes initial claim for

maintenance, the amount consented to under the 1<sup>st</sup> Maintenance Order and the factors I

have mentioned as well as the factors listed in s 69(4) of the Womens Charter, and using a

broad-brush approach, I am of the view that the maintenance should be $15,000 a month and that it

should be spread more evenly among the children and the Wife, ie $4,000 per month for each of the

children and $3,000 per month for the Wife.

</p><p align="justify">75.    Taking into account the Wifes income, she should have

$19,000 per month, even if she does not receive bonuses, for the children and herself.

</p><p align="justify">76.    On the part of the Husband, he will have enough for himself

even if he does not receive bonuses.

</p><p align="justify">77.    According to paragraph 18(ii) of Mrs Tans submissions,

the Husband has left Dell Asia since October 2000. However, Mrs Tan pointed out, and I agree, that

this is not relevant because I am not dealing with an application or appeal based on a change of

circumstances.

</p><p align="justify"> </p>
<b><i>
<p align="justify">Back-dating of maintenance</p>
</i></b>
<p align="justify">78.    The Wife has sought maintenance from February 1996 on the

basis that the Husband has not provided any maintenance since then. Accordingly, if the maintenance

ordered by the District Judge is increased under the Wifes appeal, the Wife is also seeking that

the increase be back-dated to start from February 1996.

</p><p align="justify">79.    The claim for the maintenance to be back-dated to February

1996 was mentioned in an affidavit of the Wife but Mrs Tan pointed out to me that it was not pursued

in the submissions on the Wifes behalf to the District Judge.

</p><p align="justify">80.    Furthermore, if the maintenance is reduced under the

Husbands appeal, the Wifes position is that it should not be back-dated to the effective date

of maintenance under the District Judges order i.e 1 January 2000 or to the effective date of

maintenance under either the 2<sup>nd</sup> Maintenance Order or the 1<sup>st</sup> Maintenance

Order.

</p><p align="justify">81.    Ms Kanya even took the technical point that the Husbands

Notice of Appeal did not say that any reduction should be with effect from 1 January 2000. Therefore

any reduction should be from the date of my decision or thereabouts. I am of the view that this

argument is a non-starter. The Husband is appealing from the decision of the District Judge and

hence any order made by me to reduce maintenance should take into account the effective date of

maintenance under the District Judges order.

</p><p align="justify">82.    It is clear to me that the Wife is trying to have her cake

and eat it.

</p><p align="justify">83.    In any event, I am not satisfied that the Wife has

established that the Husband has failed to pay any maintenance between February 1996 to 15 February

1998. Indeed I note from the completed complaint leading to the 1<sup>st</sup> Maintenance Order

that her allegation then was that the Husband had failed to maintain her and the three children

since January 1996 adequately as opposed to at all.

</p><p align="justify">84.    In the circumstances, my order on maintenance is to take

effect from the effective date of maintenance under the District Judges order i.e 1 January 2000.

The 2<sup>nd</sup> Maintenance Order will cease to apply from this date.

</p><p align="justify"><b><i></i></b></p>
<p align="justify">Stock Options</p>
<p align="justify">85.    The Husband was employed by Dell Asia. From time to time he

received agreements from Dell Computer Corporation (the Corporation), a Delaware corporation,

to grant him stock options in the Corporation which he in turn had apparently agreed to.

</p><p align="justify">86.    The terms of each agreement are similar but not identical

as I will elaborate below.

</p><p align="justify">87.    Under each agreement, the Husband was granted what is

described as a Non Statutory Stock Option to purchase a certain number of the Corporations stock.

However the option does not vest in him immediately i.e. he cannot exercise the option immediately.

</p><p align="justify">88.    Portions will vest at stated periods, for example, 20% on

each of the first, second, third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the date of the grant.

</p><p align="justify">89.    Once the option vests, it must be exercised before a

termination date which, for example, is ten years from the date of the grant but there may be

periods of unexercisability, to be determined by the Corporation, to avoid insider trading.

</p><p align="justify">90.    Should the Husband decide to exercise a vested option, he

has to give notice for the number of shares of stock being purchased with payment of the exercise

price. I was informed by both Counsel that this had been done in the past and the Husband then sold

some shares or stock and made a profit although there appears to be no obligation on him to sell

them.

</p><p align="justify">91.    Ms Kanya categorised the options into three categories:

</p><blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) options which have vested and which have been exercised by the Husband (the

  1<sup>st</sup> category),</p>
<p align="justify">(b) options which have vested but have not yet been exercised by the Husband (the

  2<sup>nd</sup> category),</p>
<p align="justify">(c) options which have not vested in the Husband (the 3<sup>rd</sup>

  category).</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">92.    The District Judge granted the Wife 15% of the gains from

the 1<sup>st</sup> category but nothing for the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> categories.

</p><p align="justify">93.    The Wifes position is that as regards the 1<sup>st</sup>

category, she should be granted 30% for her indirect contributions to the marriage as that was the

District Judges decision in respect of the matrimonial home.

</p><p align="justify">94.    As for the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> categories,

the Wifes position is that she should also be granted 30% of the value of the options, or

alternatively, 15%. However, Ms Kanya accepted that the options may not vest or, even if vested, may

not be exercised by the Husband. That is why she sought an if and when order to be made rather

than ask for a value to be ascribed to the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> categories.

</p><p align="justify">95.    Ms Kanya also submitted that an if and when order is

within the purview of s 112(5)(e) of the Womens Charter.

</p><p align="justify">96.    Section 112(5)(e) states:

</p><blockquote>
<p align="justify">(5) In particular, but without limiting the generality of subsections (3)

  and (4), the court may make any one or more of the following orders:</p>
<p align="justify">(a) </p>
<p align="justify">(b) </p>
<p align="justify">(c) </p>
<p align="justify">(d) </p>
<p align="justify">(e) an order postponing the sale or vesting of any share in any matrimonial

  asset, or any part of such share, until such future date of until the occurrence of such future

  event or until the fulfilment of such condition as may be specified in the order;</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">97.    In my view, s 112(5)(e) enables a court to postphone the

sale or vesting of any share in any matrimonial asset which is already vested in one or both of the

parties. It does not apply to the situation where the vesting of a matrimonial asset is delayed

under the terms of the agreement which allegedly gives rise to the acquisition of the asset.

</p><p align="justify">98.    The Amended Notice of Appeal of the Wife in respect of the

2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> categories seeks that:

</p><blockquote>
<p align="justify">3. There be a division of Dell stocks in the Non-Statutory Stocks Option

  agreements which <u>have vested but yet to be exercised by the Respondent and which</u> have yet

  to be vested in the Respondent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">99.    Technically, even with the amendment, it is not appropriate

to refer to a division of Dell stocks because no Dell stock has been acquired yet as regards the 2<sup>nd</sup>

and 3<sup>rd</sup> categories. However it is clear to me that this prayer was intended to refer to a

division of the stock options under the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> categories and indeed, the

submission of both Counsel proceeded on that basis.

</p><p align="justify">100.    Section 112(1) and (10) of the Womens Charter (1997 Ed)

states:

</p><blockquote>
<p align="justify">Power of court to order division of matrimonial assets</p>
<p align="justify">112. (1) The court shall have power, when granting or subsequent to the grant

  of a decree of divorce, judicial separation or nullity of marriage, to order the division between

  the parties of any matrimonial asset or the sale of any such asset and the division between the

  parties of the proceeds of the sale of any such asset in such proportions as the court thinks just

  and equitable.</p>
<p align="justify">(10) For the purposes of this section, "matrimonial asset" means </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a)  </p>
<p align="justify">(b) any other asset of any nature acquired during the marriage by one party

    or both parties to the marriage,</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">but does not include any asset (not being a matrimonial home) that has been

  acquired by one party at any time by gift or inheritance and that has not been substantially

  improved during the marriage by the other party or by both parties to that marriage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">101.    Ms Kanya submitted that the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup>

categories are choses in action and that they come within the wide definition of any other asset

of any nature.

</p><p align="justify">102.    She referred to Halsburys Laws of England, Fourth

Edition Reissue Volume 6 at para 8 which states:

</p><blockquote>
<p align="justify">8. <b>Enumeration of choses in action.</b> In order that a more

  comprehensive idea as to the nature and extent of the expression "chose in action" may

  be formed, it may be convenient to show in some detail what kinds of things and property have been

  held to be choses in action. The following things have been held to be choses in action; they are

  grouped in five divisions for purposes of convenience only.</p>
<p align="justify">(1) Debts, whether due by specialty or by simple contract, .</p>
<p align="justify">(2) The benefit of a contract, including  an option to purchase shares, ;

  a right to be issued shares in a company .</p>
<p align="justify">(3) Recognised subjects of property, such as stock in public funds; a share of

  bank stock; shares in joint stock companies, and presumably in every kind of company, including

  stock issued by national corporations; a fund in court; .</p>
<p align="justify">(4) Equitable rights to property, such as beneficial interests under trusts .</p>
<p align="justify">(5) Miscellaneous rights, such as a right of action arising under contract,

  including a claim for unliquidated damages for breach of contract; .</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">103.    Ms Kanya further submitted that although the Singapore

High Court and the Court of Appeal have not in the past made any decision as to whether stock

options are matrimonial assets for the purpose of dividing them, these courts have included shares

or stocks for the purpose of dividing matrimonial assets.

</p><p align="justify">104.    She also referred me to the American case of <i>Barbara

Green v Michael Green</i> (8 July 1985, Court of Special Appeals of Maryland).

</p><p align="justify">105.    In that case, Karwacki J, delivering the judgment of the

Court of Special Appeals of Maryland said:

</p><blockquote>
<p align="justify">In <i>Deering v. Deering, 292 Md. 115, 437 A.2d 883 (1981)</i>, the Court of

  Appeals held that a spouses pension rights, to the extent accumulated during the marriage,

  constitute "marital property" within the meaning of The Marital Property Act. The Court

  of Appeals emphasized that its holding applied to all pensions, whether vested or unvested, or

  whether matured or unmatured. This Court in <i>Ohm v. Ohm, 49 Md.App. 392, 431 A.2d 1371 (1981)</i>

  had earlier reached the same conclusion. The Court of Appeals in Deering noted: "It is

  significant that over the past several years, pension benefits have become an increasingly

  important part of an employees compensation package which he or she brings to a marriage

  unit". <i>292 Md.at 122, 437 A.2d 883</i>. And in Ohm, this Court identified, through

  citations to numerous cases, those jurisdictions which have held that rights under a private or

  public pension plan, to the extent such rights were acquired during the marriage, are property

  subject to division upon dissolution. We noted that these decisions rested upon the rationale

  "that retirement benefits are a form of deferred compensation or wage substitute and the

  right to receive such benefits, being contractual in nature, is a chose in action and thus,

  property" <i>Ohm, 49 Md.App. at 397, 431 A.2d 1371.</i></p>
<p align="justify">As with pension plans, restricted stock option plans like those we consider

  here are a form of employee compensation, providing to the employee the right to accept within a

  prescribed time period and under certain conditions the corporate employers irrevocable offer

  to sell its stock at the price quoted. If the employer attempts to withdraw that offer, the

  employee has "a chose in action" in contract against the employer. We therefore conclude

  that stock option plans, like other benefits in an employees compensation package, constitute

  "property" as used in the definition of marital property. Furthermore, because the plans

  in the case sub judice granted stock options to the appellee while he was married to the

  appellant, those options were "acquired" during the marriage. See <i>Harper v. Harper,

  294 Md.54, 448 A.2d 916 (1982).</i> The stock options are therefore marital property under the

  terms of 8-201(e) and as such are subject to valuation and equitable adjustment in the form of a

  monetary award, pursuant to 8-204 and 8-205.</p>
<p align="justify">The trial court stated in its memorandum opinion that the stock options were

  valueless because they had no "fair market value". Although it is true that an

  unassignable, unsalable option has no fair market value, it is nonetheless an economic resource,

  comparable to pension benefits, to which a value can be attributed. We will comment briefly upon

  the method by which the trial court may value and adjust the parties equities in this form of

  marital property.</p>
<p align="justify">The appellate courts of Maryland have recognized the complexity of the task

  confronting trial courts in properly valuing and allocating certain forms of marital property. <i>Deering,

  292 Md. At 129, 437 A.2d 883; Ohm, 49 Md.App. at 405-06, 431 A.2d 1371</i>. An elastic approach to

  the problem is required so as to accommodate the circumstances presented by each case. <i>Nisos v.

  Nisos, 60 Md.App. 368, 383, 483 A.2d97 (1984).</i> As with pensions, the valuation and allocation

  of stock options necessitates such a flexible approach. In completing steps 2 and 3 of the

  procedure for allocating this marital property by formulating an equitable monetary award, the

  court must take into consideration the nature of the appellees property right in the options.

  In simple terms, the appellees property interest can be described as the right to choose

  whether or not to purchase 5,000 shares of Network Systems stock on certain dates at specified

  prices. Thus the court may not adopt an approach to the equitable adjustment of that property

  which would operate to compel the appellee to exercise his option, since to do so would in effect

  deprive him of the essence of his property interest; i.e., the right to make a choice regarding

  the exercise of the options.</p>
<p align="justify">The trial court may in its discretion, however, adopt an "if, as and

  when" approach to the valuation and equitable allocation of the unexercised options,

  including the 2,500 matured options as well as the 2,500 unmatured options. This approach has

  proven to be a workable method for the allocation of unmatured pensions, see <i>Deering, supra, </i>and

  we believe, is equally effective in the allocation of stock options. We explain. Under the second

  of the three step process for the determination of a monetary award in adjustment of this marital

  property, the court must attach a value to options as of the date of the decree, see <i>Nisos, 60

  Md.App. at 381-85, 483 A.2d 97.</i> That value may be determined by taking into consideration the

  market value of shares of Network stock as of the time of that decree, and the cost to the

  appellee of exercising the options. The court may, then, pursuant to the third step of the

  process, determine a percentage by which the profits should be divided if, as and when the options

  are exercised. Under such an approach to the equitable allocation of this marital property, the

  appellee is under no compulsion to exercise his options. At the same time, however, the appellants

  equitable interest in the options, if exercised, is protected. We believe this approach fairly

  implements the process of adjusting the equities between the parties with respect to marital

  property as mandated by the Act.</p>
<p align="justify">For these reasons, we hold that the trial court was clearly erroneous in its

  conclusion that the stock options were valueless and in failing to include them in its

  determination of the marital property. We will thus remand this case in order that the court may

  make appropriate findings of fact with respect to the valuation of those assets, and make such

  adjustment to the monetary award as it deems equitable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">106.    Mrs Tan submitted that it was arguable whether a stock

option per se is in fact a chose in action.

</p><p align="justify">107.    She also submitted that it is not a matrimonial asset to

be divided by the court under s 112 of the Womens Charter. She said that our courts have always

divided tangible assets but she did not dispute that our courts have considered shares as

matrimonial assets.</p></font>
</p><p align="justify" xmlns="">108.    <font face="Times New Roman">She sought to distinguish

stock options from shares by saying that shares are tangible and already belong to someone whereas

stock options in the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> categories do not yet belong to anyone.

<p align="justify">109.    She argued that there must be certainty of ownership and

to include a stock option or a chose in action as a matrimonial asset would have far-reaching

ramifications. It will mean that a debt owing to one party would then be a matrimonial asset but

this would create a problem if the monies were not recovered.

</p><p align="justify">110.    She also argued that the Green case cited by Ms Kanya was

not applicable in Singapore as, first, the system of American matrimonial law differs from ours as

theirs is based on community property, and secondly, even within their country, it may differ from

state to state.

</p><p align="justify">111.    She further argued that the Husband had not yet acquired

the stock options under the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> categories. He acquires these stock

options only when the same are both vested and exercised by him.

</p><p align="justify">112.    Mrs Tans main point was that there were too many

uncertainties until the options are vested and exercised by the Husband. For this argument, she

referred to various provisions in the agreements granting the stock options.

</p><p align="justify">113.    One provision in point is that the options are not vested

immediately upon the execution of the stock option agreements.

</p><p align="justify">114.    A second provision in point is that the vesting of the

options can be deferred, but not beyond a certain date which can be specified in the respective

agreements.

</p><p align="justify">115.    A third provision in point is that the options will be

terminated if the Husbands employment is terminated for serious misconduct. If it is terminated

for reasons other than serious misconduct, options in the 3<sup>rd</sup> category will expire then

and options in the 2<sup>nd</sup> category will expire after a certain time.

</p><p align="justify">116.    A fourth provision in point is that in some (but not all)

of the agreements granting the stock options, there is also a provision for the forfeiture of option

proceeds. Under such a provision, certain option proceeds will have to be repaid by the Husband if

he competes with the Corporation within a certain time frame after the termination of his

employment.

</p><p align="justify">117.    Mrs Tan further supported her argument about

non-acquisition by referring to the definition of the word acquired in The Shorter Oxford

English Dictionary. It defines acquire as to gain, or get as ones own (by ones own

exertions or qualities); to receive, come into possession. She argued that, By this

definition, once an asset is acquired, it is yours period and no one can take it away from you.

</p><p align="justify">118.    It is not disputed that the Green case involved the

consideration of what constitutes martial property within the meaning of a different

legislation i.e. The Marital Property Act.</p></font>
</p><p align="justify" xmlns="">119.    <font face="Times New Roman">However, in my view, that

case is authority for the proposition that a stock option is a chose in action. This is similar to

the position under English law as set out in Halsburys Laws of England (see para 102 above). That

case also illustrates the use of an if, as and when order. I will refer to such an order as an

if and when order for simplicity.

<p align="justify">120.    I am of the view that clearly the stock options in the 2<sup>nd</sup>

category are choses in action. As regards the stock options in the 3<sup>rd</sup> category, where

the options have not yet vested in the Husband, these are also choses in action. The Husband has a

benefit under a contract or contracts to have the options vested in him at some future date.

</p><p align="justify">121.    I am also of the view that the stock options of the 2<sup>nd</sup>

and 3<sup>rd</sup> categories come within the wide definition of matrimonial asset under s

112(10)(b) of the Womens Charter i.e. any other asset of any nature. In my view, matrimonial

asset is not confined to tangible assets.

</p><p align="justify">122.    Accordingly a debt owing to one of the spouses can be a

matrimonial asset if acquired during the marriage.

</p><p align="justify">123.    I do not agree with Mrs Tans argument about

far-reaching ramifications. Indeed, if she were correct, a spouse will be encouraged to lend monies

to various persons when the marriage is floundering, and then claim that such debts should not be

treated as part of matrimonial assets for the purpose of s 112.

</p><p align="justify">124.    I am also of the view that any difficulty in establishing

the value of a matrimonial asset should not be confused with its existence.

</p><p align="justify">125.    The uncertainties mentioned in Mrs Tans arguments are

conditions subsequent to the acquisition of the choses in action. They are not pre-conditions to the

acquisition. Accordingly, the Husband has acquired the choses in action under the 2<sup>nd</sup> and

3<sup>rd</sup> categories.

</p><p align="justify">126.    I also do not think that it is correct to describe a share

as a tangible asset but, in the circumstances, it is unnecessary for me to elaborate further on this

point.

</p><p align="justify">127.    As regards Mrs Tans argument that the provision for the

forfeiture of option proceeds (which would apply if the Husband were to compete with the Corporation

within a specified time frame of the termination of his employment) demonstrated non-acquisition,

this is not a valid argument. If she were correct, then even the stock options under the 1<sup>st</sup>

category cannot be said to be acquired by the Husband if such a provision applies to those options.</p></font>
</p><p align="justify" xmlns="">128.    <font face="Times New Roman">As regards Mrs Tans

argument that once an asset is acquired, no one can take it away from you, this is also not a valid

argument. For example, a house bought by the Husband and mortgaged to a bank can be taken away from

the Husband if he fails to pay the bank. Yet no one would say that the house has not yet been

acquired by the Husband for the purpose of s 112.

<p align="justify">129.    As for the definition of acquire in The Shorter

Oxford Dictionary, I am of the view that it is neither here nor there.

</p><p align="justify">130.    Mrs Tan had one other argument. She submitted that the

Wife had taken all the stock options into account in determining the Husbands remuneration for

the issue of maintenance and the Wife should not be allowed to have them taken into account in the

division of matrimonial assets. Otherwise, the Wife would be having two bites of the same cherry.

</p><p align="justify">131.    I have already mentioned above that Ms Kanya is not

relying on the stock options to claim additional maintenance for the Wife and I have disregarded it

for that issue.

</p><p align="justify">132.    I now turn to the District Judges reasons for not

ordering a division of the stock options in the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> categories. In

para 14 of her GD, she said:

</p><blockquote>
<p align="justify">14. There was no doubt that the unvested Dell stock options were part of the

  husbands salary package and although they were allotted to him once in every six (6) months,

  they were intrinsically tied up with his performance in the company. Furthermore if his employment

  were to be terminated with just cause, he would lose all the vested stock options, which he had

  exercised. In <i>Susy Suryani Santoso v. Lee Kong Eng &amp; Alexis Khoo</i> (Divorce 1704/98 and

  RAS 95 &amp; 96/99), the wife had asked for a portion of his year end bonus. The court of the

  first instance declined to make such an order as bonuses were invariably a discretionary measure

  contingent on several factors e.g employees performance, companys performance and a variety

  of other imponderable conditions. On appeal, her Honour, Justice Judith Prakash reversed the

  earlier decision on the issue of bonus and ordered that "the husband pay the wife additional

  maintenance of S$6,000 for each months bonus received by him <i>if and when</i> (the emphasis

  is mine) he was paid any bonus". The Court of Appeal in their oral judgment, delivered on 25<sup>th</sup>

  January 2000, reversed her decision on this issue. I declined to make a "if, as and

  when" order for the following reasons:-</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"> the share value of the stock option was based on market value at the time

    it was exercised;</p>
<p align="justify"> the husband had, in the past, not exercised his rights to those stock

    options and this may cause the wife to enquire why he had failed to do so;</p>
<p align="justify"> there may be double counting as the husband was paying maintenance and the

    stock options form part of his salary package;</p>
<p align="justify"> the "if, as and when" order was vague and posed uncertainty as

    there would be liabilities to be met when he exercised those rights;</p>
<p align="justify"> the above order also runs contrary to the clean break principle in the

    division of matrimonial asses; and</p>
<p align="justify"> most importantly, the unvested stock options were allotted to the husband

    after the breakdown of the marriage and her indirect contribution was not substantial enough to

    merit a share in his unvested stock options (see para 11 above).</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">133.    The case of <i>Susy Suryanti Santoso v Lee Kong Eng &amp;

Alexis Khoo</i> cited by the District Judge is not applicable here because there the question was

whether the husbands bonus should be taken into account for the issue of maintenance. That point

did not involve stock options or the division of matrimonial assets.

</p><p align="justify">134.    Furthermore, as there was no written judgment from the

Court of Appeal in that case, I am of the view that it is likely that the decision of the Court of

Appeal was on the particular facts in that case. It is not an authority for the proposition that an

if and when order should, generally, not be made.

</p><p align="justify">135.    As for the list of reasons given by the District Judge, I

am of the view that:

</p><blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) Although it may be said that the share value of a stock option is based on

  market value at the time the option is exercised, it does not follow that this is the only value

  that can be ascribed to a stock option. If the option is vested but not yet exercised, its value

  may be less, and if it is not yet vested, its value may be even lesser. However, as I have already

  said above, this does not detract from the fact of its existence. Furthermore, any difficulty in

  valuing share options under the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> categories is not an adequate

  ground for denying their existence or for refusing to attempt to divide them. Thirdly, there is no

  need to give a value at present if an if and when order is made.</p>
<p align="justify">(b) Although the Wife had made inquiry in the past as to why the Husband did

  not exercise any of the unexercised stock options, this is also not an adequate ground for

  refusing to take such options into account in the division of matrimonial assets. Besides, suffice

  it to say that the Husband is not obliged to exercise the stock options. If he has chosen not to

  exercise them bona fide, the Wife has no legal basis to complain. However if, for example, the

  Husband has given up any right to have the stock options vested in him in exchange for other

  rights or assets in order to defeat the Wifes claim, then the Wife can pursue her legal rights.

  However, the burden will be upon her to establish her assertion.</p>
<p align="justify">(c) There is no question of double counting if the stock options are not taken

  into account for the maintenance issue.</p>
<p align="justify">(d) While an if and when order poses some uncertainty, this is also not

  an adequate reason to disregard the stock options in the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup>

  categories for the purpose of division. That the Husband would have to pay the exercise price can

  be taken into account in an appropriately worded if and when order.</p>
<p align="justify">(e) If such an order is vague and does not cover all the eventualities which

  subsequently arises, this can be addressed by the parties seeking clarification or further

  directions. After all, under s 112(3) to (8) of the Womens Charter, the court is given very

  wide powers to give effect to any order it makes for the division of matrimonial assets.

  Furthermore, it is open to the parties to agree on a lump sum settlement of the Wifes

  entitlement to the stock options rather than be troubled with having to comply with an if and

  when order.</p>
<p align="justify">(f) I would add that the concept of stock options is not novel although it

  appears to be used more and more for so-called New Economy businesses. A scheme for stock options

  provides the answer to attracting and retaining key personnel without causing the businesses to

  fail under the weight of huge salaries before huge returns are achieved. Furthermore, very often,

  it is such a scheme, and not the salary, that attracts the key personnel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">136.    Therefore, it is my view that it would be only realistic

to take into account stock options in the context of maintenance or the division of matrimonial

assets, unless there are reasons on the particular facts of a case why this should not be done. No

such reasons exist in the case before me.

</p><p align="justify">137.    While an if and when order would not achieve the

clear-break principle, this principle is not paramount. It must be subject to the more important

principle of justice in accordance with the law.

</p><p align="justify">138.    Furthermore, if the stock options (in any of the

categories) were allotted to the Husband after the breakdown of the marriage, that is a factor in

determining whether the Wife should be granted a share in them and if so, the extent of the share.

It is not a reason to deny any division outright. In so far as the District Judge said that the Wifes

indirect contribution after the breakdown of the marriage was not substantial enough to merit a

share, I will come back to this point later below.

</p><p align="justify">139.    As this stage, I need refer only to <i>Yeo Gim Tong

Michael v Tianzou</i> <nobr>[1996] 2 SLR 1</nobr>. In that case, L P Thean JA, delivering the judgment of the

Court of Appeal, said at p 4:

</p><blockquote>
<p align="justify">We agree that the husbands CPF moneys accrued or accumulated prior to the

  date of the marriage should be excluded in the computation of the husbands assets for division

  under s 106 of the Womens Charter. But, we are unable to accept that assets acquired by a

  party, and in this case the husband, after the date of the breakdown of the marriage should not be

  included. Subsection (1) and (3) of s 106 each refer to assets acquired during the marriage,

  and the marriage is only dissolved when the decree nisi is made absolute. Normally the ancillary

  matters come before the court for hearing prior to the date when the decree nisi is made absolute.

  As a matter of practically, the court would take, for the purpose of determining the assets

  falling within s 106, in the case of CPF moneys of the spouses, the latest statements issued by

  the Central Provident Fund Board, and in other cases the assets of the spouses as of that date. <u>Therefore

  any assets acquired during the marriage including those acquired after the marriage has broken

  down fall to be considered under these provisions. What contribution a spouse makes to the

  acquisition of such assets during this period depends on the facts of the case.</u> In making a

  division under s 106(3) the court would have regard to the period in which the husband and wife

  have ceased to cohabit and the indirect contribution, if any, made by the wife during the period.

  In this case, the wifes indirect contribution continued: she continued to look after the child

  after she had filed the petition, and her contribution fell within s 106(3).</p>
<p align="justify">[Emphasis added.]</p>
</blockquote>
</font>
</p><p align="justify" xmlns="">140.    <font face="Times New Roman">Although that case was

applying s 106(1) and (3) of the then Womens Charter (1985 Edition) which are not identical with

s 112(1) and (10) of the present Womens Charter, the judgment of the Court of Appeal on the

meaning of assets acquired during the marriage would still apply to the same phrase in the

present s 112(10)(b).

<p align="justify">141.    I have already set out the provisions of s 112(1) and

(10)(b) of the present Womens Charter.

</p><p align="justify">142.    For easy comparison, I set out the provisions of s 106(1)

and (3) of the Womens Charter (1985 Edition):

</p><blockquote>
<p align="justify">106(1) The court shall have power, when granting a decree of divorce,

  judicial separation or nullity of marriage, to order the division between the parties of any

  assets acquired by them during the marriage by their joint efforts or the sale of any such assets

  and the division between the parties of the proceeds of sale.</p>
<p align="justify">(2)  </p>
<p align="justify">(3) The court shall have power, when granting a decree of divorce, judicial

  separation or nullity of marriage, to order the division between the parties of any assets

  acquired during the marriage by the sole effort of one party to the marriage or the sale of any

  such assets and the division between the parties of the proceeds of sale.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">143.    I should also mention that the Wife is confining her claim

to stock options already granted as at the date of the decree nisi (whether vested or not and

whether exercised or not). This is a fair cut-off point.

</p><p align="justify"> </p>
<b><i>
<p align="justify">Share of the Wife in the stock options</p>
</i></b>
<p align="justify">144.    As regards the 1<sup>st</sup> category of stock options,

the District Judge had granted the Wife a 15% entitlement.

</p><p align="justify">145.    Ms Kanya submitted that the Wife should be entitled to 30%

which was the percentage granted by the District Judge to the Wife for her indirect contribution in

respect of the matrimonial home. She submitted that the same percentage should apply to the stock

options.

</p><p align="justify">146.    However, the facts in relation to the stock options are

not the same as the facts pertaining to the matrimonial home. The latter had been acquired when the

marriage had not broken down.

</p><p align="justify">147.    The first agreement to grant stock options to the Husband

was dated 12 August 1996. The Husband left the matrimonial home in February 1997.

</p><p align="justify">148.    There was no suggestion that all was well with the

marriage until February 1997. On the contrary, it is clear that some years before, the marriage had

already broken down.

</p><p align="justify">149.    For example, when the Husband was performing services for

Quorum between 1994 to 1996, he was already under severe stress because of his marital problems,

although I would add that he is not as blameless as he would like the court to think.

</p><p align="justify">150.    The Wife had been extremely suspicious about the Husband

and harassed his secretary on his whereabouts and even complained to his boss about him. Apparently

she also threatened to complain to the President of Dell Corporation when the Husband was

subsequently working for Dell Asia.

</p><p align="justify">151.    Although the Wife denied harassing the secretary and

complaining to the boss in Quorum, I am of the view that she did complain about him and had been

harassing his secretary and him.

</p><p align="justify">152.    The situation did not improve when the Husband began to

work for Dell Asia in January 1997.</p></font>
</p><p align="justify" xmlns="">153.    <font face="Times New Roman">Thereafter, the Divorce

Petition was filed on 21 November 1997. The 1<sup>st</sup> Maintenance Complaint was filed on 2

February 1998, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Maintenance Complaint was filed on 25 June 1998. The Decree Nisi

was made on 24 September 1998. The parties were engaged in all kinds of acrimonious disputes

including access to the children which entailed the filing of numerous affidavits.</font>
</p><p align="justify" xmlns="">154.    <font face="Times New Roman">It was because of these

factors that Mrs Tan submitted that the Wifes indirect contribution was a negative one and that

even 15% was generous although the Husband had decided not to appeal against the decision of the

District Judge on the 15% entitlement of the Wife in respect of the 1<sup>st</sup> category. Mrs Tan

submitted that the Wife should not be entitled to any share of the stock options as regards the 2<sup>nd</sup>

and 3<sup>rd</sup> categories.</font>
</p><p align="justify" xmlns="">155.    <font face="Times New Roman">As regards the argument about

the Wifes negative contribution, Ms Kanya submitted that the District Judge had taken this

argument into account and had nevertheless granted the Wife 15% of the stock options under the 1<sup>st</sup>

category.

<p align="justify">156.    However, Ms Kanyas submission would in turn detract

from her other argument seeking 30% for the Wife for all the three categories.</p></font>
</p><p align="justify" xmlns="">157.    <font face="Times New Roman">The District Judges

reasons for awarding 15% are set out in para 11 of her GD. It includes some of the factors I have

mentioned and the fact that notwithstanding the Wifes so-called negative contribution, the Wife

was still taking care of the children while the Husband was pursuing his career in Hong Kong.</font>
</p><p align="justify" xmlns="">158.    <font face="Times New Roman">The District Judge also took

into account factors like the Wife (a) having had exclusive use of the matrimonial house since

February 1997 when the Husband left, (b) had obtained 60% of the matrimonial property and (c) 100%

of a property in Gold Coast, Australia, although there is an outstanding mortgage on it which the

Wife will be responsible for.</font>
</p><p align="justify" xmlns="">159.    <font face="Times New Roman">I am of the view that the

District Judge was correct in awarding 15% of the stock options under the 1<sup>st</sup> category to

the Wife. However, I do not agree that this should be confined to the 1<sup>st</sup> category only.</font>
</p><p align="justify" xmlns="">160.    <font face="Times New Roman">I have already dealt with the

i.e that the unvested stock options were allotted to the Husband after the breakdown of the

marriage, I have already mentioned that the marriage did not breakdown only when the Husband left

were allotted to the Husband after the breakdown of the marriage.</font>
</p><p align="justify" xmlns="">162.    <font face="Times New Roman">In my view, the fact that the

marriage had broken down was one of the main reasons for the District Judges decision to allot

15% instead of 30% to the Wife for the 1<sup>st</sup> category. That reason should not be used again

to reduce the 15% to nil for the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> categories.</font>

    interest-bearing escrow account until the said term ceases to apply whereupon the monies and

    interest thereon shall be paid to the Wife. However, if the Husband is required under the said

    term to pay the net gain to the Corporation, then the Wifes solicitors shall release the

    monies held in the interest-bearing account to the Husband upon receipt of supporting documents

    that the net gains have to be paid to the Corporation under the said term. If the interest

    earned need not be paid to the Corporation, then the interest shall be paid to the Wife.</p>
