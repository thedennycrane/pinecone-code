On 17 January 2023, leave was granted by the parties’ consent and SUM 2787 was filed by WDL on 7 September 2023.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 On 27 September 2023, KfW applied by way of HC/SUM 2979/2023 (“SUM 2979”) for the priority of claims against the Sale Proceeds to be determined and for payment out of the Sale Proceeds to be ordered. After hearing the parties on 23 October 2023, I allowed SUM 2979 but ordered, with the agreement of KfW and WDL, that a sum of USD 1,500,000.00 be retained in court pending the final determination of SUM 2787 (the “Ringfencing Order”).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The issue: did the mortgage extend to “gaming equipment” on board the Vessel?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 At the time SUM 2787 was filed, WDL’s second prayer thereunder was, in substance, for the Ringfencing Order to be made.

Whether this declaration should be granted turns on one question: having regard to the terms of the WD Documentation, did the mortgage created thereunder include or extend to the “gaming equipment” on board the Vessel?</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">WDL has led insufficient evidence to clearly identify the “gaming equipment”</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 As a preliminary point, KfW objects to SUM 2787 on grounds that WDL’s reference to “gaming equipment” is too ambiguous.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Counsel for KfW, Mr Edgar Chin, points out that the only evidence WDL adduced to explain its reference to “gaming equipment” was a spreadsheet listing various items by description along with other details (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, their acquisition cost and book value) (the “Asset Listing”).

</div> The real question at this stage is one of principle, namely, whether the “gaming equipment” (as a class of objects considered in the abstract) came within the scope of the mortgage over the Vessel. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 I disagree with the position taken by WDL. In my view, while there may well be ancillary matters that will have to be ironed out after declaratory relief is granted, <span class="font-italic">identifying</span> – even if only on a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>basis – the subject matter of the relief sought is not one of them. It is simply not enough to assume in the abstract that there was “gaming equipment” belonging to WDL on board the Vessel at the time the Vessel was arrested and/or sold. There must be <span class="font-italic">some</span> degree of specificity as to what those objects are in order to satisfy the Court that the declaration, if made, will not be in vain. In my view, the evidence led by WDL is insufficient for that purpose. Whether sums have been retained from the Sale Proceeds pending the determination of this application is beside the point. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 In the circumstances, I am persuaded that KfW’s evidential objection alone is sufficient for me to dismiss SUM 2787. However, KfW was in any case prepared to meet the application on its legal merits (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, by showing that the “gaming equipment” fell within the scope of the mortgage) and advanced substantive arguments in support of its position.

Some of those articles were used not for the navigation of the vessel but for fishing. The question was whether title to those articles passed with the mortgage. Charles J concluded that it did because those articles came within the reference to the “ship” in the mortgage.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Mr Chin submits that <span class="font-italic">Coltman</span> is authority for the proposition that the word “ship” encompasses any object that is either (a) necessary to the navigation of the ship, and without which no prudent person would sail, <span class="font-italic">or </span>(b) necessary to the prosecution of the adventure. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 On the other hand, Ms Ang contends that the holding in <span class="font-italic">Coltman </span>is that the word “ship” encompasses any object that is (a) either necessary to (i) the navigation of the ship <span class="font-italic">or</span> (ii) the prosecution of the adventure; <span class="font-italic">and</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(b) without which no prudent person would sail.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The parties’ conflicting interpretations of <span class="font-italic">Coltman </span>appear to stem from the fact that Charles J never stated a composite definition of the word “ship” in his decision. Nevertheless, I prefer KfW’s reading of <span class="font-italic">Coltman</span> for the following reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 First, the headnote to <span class="font-italic">Coltman </span>itself reads:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A mortgage of a ship passes to the mortgagee under the word “ship” articles <span class="font-italic">necessary to the navigation of the ship </span><span class="font-italic font-underline">or</span><span class="font-italic"> to the prosecution of the adventure</span> which were on board at the date of the mortgage and articles brought on board in substitution for them subsequently to the mortgage. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">I make two observations on the quoted passage. First, there is a distinction between (a) articles necessary “to the navigation of the ship” and (b) articles necessary “to the prosecution of the adventure”. For convenience, I will refer to the former as “Navigation Articles” and the latter as “Adventure Articles”. Second, it contains no reference to any standard of ‘prudence’.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Second, Charles J himself only adopted the language of ‘prudence’ in relation to Navigation Articles (at 334): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">the articles comprised in the second class are articles which are in substitution for the original articles, <span class="font-italic">are necessary for the navigation of the ship, and are articles without which no prudent person would sail</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Third, Charles J referred to the case of <span class="font-italic">Gale</span><span class="font-italic"> v Laurie </span>(1826) 5 B &amp; C 155<span class="font-italic"> </span>(“<span class="font-italic">Gale</span>”) and concluded (at 333) that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[<span class="font-italic">Gale</span>] is to the effect that the word “ship” in s. 1 of the Act of Geo. 3, covered the fishing stores on board—that is, the <span class="font-italic">articles on board which were needful for the accomplishment of the objects of the voyage</span>; it is true that it is a decision on an Act of Parliament regulating the limitation of the shipowner’s liability; but it is an instructive exposition of what is included in the word “ship.” </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Charles J was plainly relying on <span class="font-italic">Gale </span>for the proposition that “articles on board which were needful for the accomplishment of the objects of the voyage” (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Adventure Articles) were to be regarded as a part of the “ship”. Again, no reference to ‘prudence’ was made in reaching this conclusion.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Fourth, Charles J also relied (at 333) on the following extract from Wills J’s decision in <span class="font-italic">In</span><span class="font-italic"> re Salmon &amp; Woods, Ex parte Gould </span>(1885) 2 Mor Bky Cas 137 (at 141): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It has been argued that ‘ship’ is equivalent to ‘ship and its appurtenances’, and to a certain extent that is doubtless so. It would include spare sails, duplicate anchors—<span class="font-italic">anything, in fact, which it would not be prudent to send a ship to sea without</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">There are three points of note in the quoted extract. First, the objects referred to (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, spare sails and duplicate anchors) are quite plainly more in the nature of Navigation Articles than Adventure Articles. Second, Wills J went on to describe those objects as those “which it would not be prudent to <span class="font-italic">send a ship to sea </span><span class="font-italic">without</span>”. The word ‘prudence’ is, therefore, only used in connection with Navigation Articles. Third, the generality of words I have just quoted – referring as they do to “<span class="font-italic">a</span> ship” rather than “<span class="font-italic">the</span> ship” – harks back, in my view, to concepts of seaworthiness and safe navigation, rather than the fulfilment of any commercial or personal objective. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Overall, I am unable to read <span class="font-italic">Coltman </span>as having applied the “prudence” standard in connection with anything other than Navigation Articles.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 To support her interpretation of <span class="font-italic">Coltman</span>, Ms Ang cited the following extract from the Federal Court of Australia’s judgment in <span class="font-italic">OW Bunker and Trading Co Ltd A/S v Ship MV “Mawashi Al </span><span class="font-italic">Gasseem” (No 2) </span>[2007] FCA 1139 (“<span class="font-italic">Mawashi Al </span><span class="font-italic">Gasseem (No 2)</span>”) (at [18]), which in turn cited the following paragraph from Nigel Meeson, <span class="font-italic">Admiralty Jurisdiction and Practice</span> (LLP, 3rd Ed, 2003) (“<span class="font-italic">Admiralty Jurisdiction and Practice</span>”) (at para 10.68): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The scope of the mortgage in statutory form was considered in <span class="font-italic">Coltman v Chamberlain </span>where it was held that a mortgage of a ship passed to the mortgagee under the word “ship”: “all articles necessary to the navigation of the ship or to the prosecution of the adventure, <span class="font-italic">and without which no prudent person would sail</span>, which were on board at the date of the mortgage and articles brought on board in substitution for them subsequently to the mortgage.”</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">This paragraph appears unchanged in the fifth edition of the same text. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 With the greatest respect to the learned author of <span class="font-italic">Admiralty Jurisdict</span><span class="font-italic">ion and Practice</span>, the quoted parts (at [48] above) do not appear <span class="font-italic">verbatim </span>in <span class="font-italic">Coltman.</span> The part of <span class="font-italic">Coltman </span>that reflects the quote most closely is the headnote to the decision (which I have set out at [43] above). Crucially, the important words “and without which no prudent person would sail” <span class="font-italic">do not appear</span> in the headnote. In other words, the passage from <span class="font-italic">Admiralty </span><span class="font-italic">Jurisdiction and Practice </span>does not, in my view, accurately reflect what was in fact decided in <span class="font-italic">Coltman. </span>I do not, therefore, consider the proper interpretation of <span class="font-italic">Coltman </span>to be aided by that passage (or <span class="font-italic">Mawashi Al </span><span class="font-italic">Gasseem (No 2)</span>, which cites it). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Finally, Ms Ang argues that unless <span class="font-italic">Coltman </span>is read to have also applied the ‘prudence’ standard to Adventure Articles, the definition of “ship” would be too wide. In my view, that is an overstatement. First, necessity is <span class="font-italic">still</span> the controlling factor, and it can hardly be said that necessity pegs the bar too low. Furthermore, whether an object is necessary for the prosecution of the adventure is an intensely fact-sensitive inquiry. What is necessary for the adventure undertaken by a fishing vessel may not be necessary where research vessels or oil tankers are concerned, for example. I do not, therefore, agree that KfW’s reading of <span class="font-italic">Coltman </span>will produce unreasonable or illogical outcomes.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 To conclude, I am persuaded that the correct holding in <span class="font-italic">Coltman </span>is that the word “ship” encompasses any object that is either (a) necessary to the navigation of the ship, and without which no prudent person would sail; <span class="font-italic">or </span>(b) necessary to the prosecution of the adventure.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The “gaming equipment” was necessary to the prosecution of the Vessel’s adventure</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 I turn next to the question of whether the word “Ship” in the WD Mortgage encompasses the “gaming equipment”, having regard to the holding of <span class="font-italic">Coltman</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 It is not suggested that the “gaming equipment” can be described as having been “necessary to the navigation of the ship, and without which no prudent person would sail”. The nub of the matter is whether the “gaming equipment” was “necessary to the prosecution of the adventure”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 For KfW, Mr Chin submits that the Vessel was a “cruise vessel … purposed for entertainment and leisure, <span class="font-italic">with a focus on gambling</span>”. Gaming was a key aspect of the experience that the Vessel’s passengers were intended to have, and the “gaming equipment” was obviously essential to delivering that experience. He argues, therefore, that the “gaming equipment” was necessary to the prosecution of the Vessel’s adventure.

</div> It seems, therefore, that at least nine out of the 60 or so spaces and facilities on board the Vessel were catered to gaming. To be clear, I am not attempting to characterise the significance of the gaming facilities with any mathematical precision. However, the information supplied by the ALC Report makes it impossible to say that gaming was only a <span class="font-italic">minor</span> aspect of the overall entertainment and leisure experience that the Vessel was intended to provide, contrary to Ms Ang’s submissions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 I turn to my second point, which is that even if gaming was not a focus of the overall experience, it <span class="font-italic">does not</span> follow that the “gaming equipment” was unnecessary to the accomplishment of the Vessel’s adventure. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Ms Ang’s basic argument is that because the Vessel’s adventure was to provide passengers with a <span class="font-italic">multi-faceted</span> entertainment and leisure experience, the failure of <span class="font-italic">one </span>facet of that experience would not entail the failure of the <span class="font-italic">entire </span>experience. This is especially because some passengers may have no interest in gaming whatsoever. Therefore, so the argument goes, the “gaming equipment” was not necessary in relation to the adventure <span class="font-italic">as a whole</span> (even if it may have been necessary for some part thereof).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 This argument appears attractive at first blush, but is ultimately erroneous because it treats the multi-faceted entertainment and leisure experience as if it were a <span class="font-italic">unitary</span> object. Describing the object of the adventure as the provision of a multi-faceted entertainment and leisure experience is merely a convenient way of saying that the object was to provide quality dining options to passengers who would value them; spa and wellness services to passengers who would wish to indulge in them; swimming pools and water slides to passengers who might enjoy getting a tan or an adrenaline rush; gaming facilities for passengers who might take pleasure in gambling; so on and so forth. In other words, there were <span class="font-italic">several</span> objects – and not only a singular object – that went to the provision of ‘entertainment and leisure’. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 With this context in mind, the relevant question, in my view, is not whether a given article on the Vessel was necessary for the experience <span class="font-italic">as a whole</span>. That question, so framed, ignores the very purpose of describing the adventure as ‘multi-faceted’ (which expression conveys that there was more than one object at play). In my judgment, the proper question to ask is whether the article was necessary for some <span class="font-italic">discrete</span> form of entertainment and leisure that the Vessel was intended to provide, <span class="font-italic">the sum</span> of which is the multi-faceted experience the Vessel’s passengers were intended to have. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 For reasons set out at [61]–[64] above, I accept that the Vessel <span class="font-italic">was</span> intended to provide entertainment in the form of gaming to passengers who might have a taste for it. The “gaming equipment” was quite clearly essential for the provision of entertainment <span class="font-italic">in th</span><span class="font-italic">at form</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 In the premises, I am persuaded that the “gaming equipment” <span class="font-italic">was </span>necessary for the prosecution and accomplishment of the Vessel’s adventure. In my judgment, the “gaming equipment” was therefore a part of the “ship” subject to the mortgage.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The “gaming equipment” came within the reference to the Vessel’s “appurtenances”</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 I turn now to explain why, in my judgment, the “gaming equipment” also came within the meaning of the word “appurtenances” as used in both the WD Mortgage and WD Deed (see [27] and [29] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 In <span class="font-italic">The</span><span class="font-italic"> “Eurosun” and “Eurostar” </span>[1993] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 106 (“<span class="font-italic">The Eurostar</span>”), Sheen J noted (at 111) that “the ordinary meaning of the word ‘appurtenances’, is a<span class="font-italic"> </span>mechanical accessory or some apparatus or gear which appertains or belongs to the ship.” On that footing, it was held that fuel oil could not be regarded as an “appurtenance” of a ship.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 In <span class="font-italic">The “Dundee”</span> (1823) 166 ER 39 (“<span class="font-italic">The Dundee</span>”), the eponymous vessel was responsible for a collision on the River Thames. The shipowner’s liability was statutorily limited to the value of the ship, tackle, apparel, furniture, and appurtenances.<span class="font-italic"> </span>The question arose as to whether fishing stores (which included harpoons, spears, and fishing lines) on board the ship<span class="font-italic"> </span>came within the meaning of “appurtenances”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Lord Stowell answered that question in the affirmative, holding (at [46]) that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The word ‘appurtenances’ must not be construed with a mere reference to the abstract naked idea of a ship; for that which would be an encumbrance to a ship one way employed, would be an indispensable equipment in another. … You must look to the relation they bear to the actual service of the vessel.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Lord Stowell also observed (at [44]) that “the very nature of an appurtenance is, that it is one thing which belongs to another thing”, so that “[a] cargo cannot be considered as appurtenances of the ship, being that which is intended to be disposed of at the foreign port for money … Its connection with the ship is merely transitory”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 <span class="font-italic">Gale </span>(which I referred to at [45] above) continues from the Court of Admiralty’s decision in <span class="font-italic">The Dundee</span>. Against that decision, the defendant applied to the Court of Queen’s Bench for a writ of prohibition. Abbott CJ upheld Lord Stowell’s conclusion that the fishing stores constituted “a part of the ship and her appurtenances” because:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">whatever is on board a ship <span class="font-italic">for the object of the voyage and adventure on which she is engaged</span>, belonging to the owners, constitutes a part of the ship and her appurtenances within the meaning of the [English Act to Limit the Responsibility of Ship Owners in Certain Cases], whether the object be warfare, the conveyance of passengers, or goods, or the fishery … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 It is apparent from the foregoing summary of the authorities that they do not lay down a precise test for determining if an object qualifies as an “appurtenance” of a vessel. For the purposes of deciding SUM 2787, it is not necessary for me to attempt to do so. However, what the authorities <span class="font-italic">do </span>indicate is that an object may be properly regarded as an “appurtenance” of a ship if (a) it “appertains” or “belongs” to the ship, and (b) it is carried “for the object of the voyage and adventure on which she is engaged”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Before I consider whether the “gaming equipment” on board the Vessel satisfies the rubric I have just set out, I should first briefly address Ms Ang’s reliance on the case of <span class="font-italic">St John v Bullivant</span> (1881) 45 UCQB 614 (“<span class="font-italic">St </span><span class="font-italic">John</span>”). Ms Ang submits that <span class="font-italic">St John </span>stands for the proposition that “mere furnishings”, especially those of an ornamental nature, will not ordinarily be viewed as falling within the scope of a ship’s “appurtenances”.

It is obvious from the ALC Report that disparate pieces of “gaming equipment” were systematically organised and operated in tandem to effectively create multiple “floating casinos” of varying sizes. Some of those items (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, gaming machines and tables) are hardly portable in nature. There is no evidence to show that the “gaming equipment” on board the Vessel had ever been shifted across or deployed between different vessels, or was ever intended to be.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 <span class="font-italic">Armstrong </span>was a case concerned with a contract for the sale of a ship “with all belonging to her on board and on shore”. At the time the contract was concluded, a chronometer previously on board the vessel was being serviced on land by the defendant opticians. The chronometer was subsequently restored to the vessel, and again removed for maintenance. When the opticians refused to restore it to the vessel, the plaintiff purchasers sued for delivery up of the chronometer. The issue was whether the chronometer came within the scope of the words “all belonging to [the vessel] on board and on shore”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 First, I accept that as a matter of plain English, “objects belonging to the ship” and “the ship’s belongings” refer, in substance, to the same thing. Although <span class="font-italic">The Dundee </span>was a case concerned with the word “appurtenances”, the court in <span class="font-italic">Armstrong </span>quite clearly relied on <span class="font-italic">The Dundee</span> in interpreting the words “belonging to” as used in the contract of sale. This indicates that the court in <span class="font-italic">Armstrong </span>was interpreting the words “belonging to” not in their general sense, but in the context of words used to transfer proprietary rights in ships and their articles. I am therefore of the view that <span class="font-italic">Armstrong </span>is instructive as to the meaning of the word “belongings” as they appear in ship mortgages.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 In deciding that the chronometer “belonged to” the ship, the Lord President placed weight on at least two factors. First, the chronometer was necessary for the navigation of the vessel (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, it was a Navigation Article). Although it was not necessary to ask if the chronometer was necessary for the accomplishment of the vessel’s adventure (<span class="font-italic">ie, </span>whether it was also an Adventure Article), the Lord President’s reliance on <span class="font-italic">The Dundee</span> suggests, in my view, that the outcome of the case would have been no different even if the chronometer was not a Navigation Article but an Adventure Article. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 Second, the Lord President was satisfied that there was a sufficient connection between the chronometer and the ship to justify describing the former as “belonging to” the latter. There was no precise guidance on what amounted to a sufficient connection for that purpose. However, the Lord President specifically rejected the argument that “nothing can be said to belong to a ship unless it is specifically appropriated or devoted to that ship” (at 341). It is also clear that, in the court’s view, the connection was sufficient notwithstanding that the chronometer had been intermittently removed from the vessel – especially since the chronometer was only removed so that it could be made ready for subsequent voyages (at 342).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 I refer again to [70] above, where I concluded that the “gaming equipment” was necessary for accomplishing the object of the Vessel’s adventure. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 I have also referred to those parts of the ALC Report documenting the nature of the “gaming equipment” and the manner in which it was deployed on board the Vessel (see [63] and [82] above). In my view, if a chronometer that was regularly removed from a vessel for servicing could nevertheless be regarded as sufficiently connected to the vessel in <span class="font-italic">Armstrong</span>, it seems to me impossible to say that the “gaming equipment” depicted in the ALC Report bears any less of a connection to the Vessel. Such a conclusion is also consistent with my earlier conclusion that the “gaming equipment” “appertained” or “belonged” to the Vessel (see [82] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 In the premises, if it were necessary for my decision, I would also hold that the “gaming equipment” came within the reference to “belongings” in cl 1.1 of the WD Deed.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the “gaming equipment” came within the reference to the Vessel’s “equipment” or the Sweep Up Phrase</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 Mr Chin and Ms Ang take opposing positions on whether the “gaming equipment” fell within the ambit of the word “equipment” in cl 1.1 of the WD Deed. In light of the conclusions I have arrived at, I do not consider it necessary for me to express a view on this point.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 Counsel also disagree on the relevance of the following words in cl 1.1 of the WD Deed (which I will refer to as the “Sweep Up Phrase”):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… whether on board or ashore and whether now owned or later acquired by the Owner and also any and all additions, improvements and replacements made in or to such vessel or any part of it or in or to its equipment and appurtenances.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 Mr Chin submits that the Sweep Up Phrase further extended the definition of “Ship” under cl 1.1 of the WD Deed to cover “all of [WDL’s] property on board or brought on to the Vessel.”

Put another way, the Sweep Up Phrase is relevant only insofar as the article in question first came within the ambit of the words “engines, machinery, boats, tackle, outfit, equipment, spare gear, fuel, consumable or other stores, belongings and appurtenances”.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 Again, this point is academic in light of my prior conclusions and so I express no view on it.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">WDL’s reliance on general principles of contractual interpretation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 Finally, parties addressed me at length on the general principles of contractual interpretation to be applied in this case. In this connection, Ms Ang relies on [131] of <span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd v B Gold Interior Design &amp; Construction Pte Ltd</span> [2008] 3 SLR(R) 1029 (“<span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance</span>”), which in turn cites Gerard McMeel,<span class="font-italic"> The Construction of Contracts: Interpretation, Implication, and Rectification </span>(Oxford University Press, 2007), for the following canons of contractual interpretation:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) The aim of contractual interpretation is “to ascertain the meaning which [the terms] would convey to a reasonable business person”;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) Contractual terms must be interpreted having regard to both the contract as a whole and the circumstances in which it was entered into; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) The court should eschew an interpretation that would lead to an unreasonable result, “unless it is required by clear words and there is no other tenable construction”. </div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 Ms Ang argues that in keeping with the abovementioned principles – and the disinclination for unreasonable outcomes in particular – the WD Documentation should have explicitly referred to the “gaming equipment” if the mortgage was to cover it. To shore up this argument, Ms Ang cites the following extracts from David Osborne, Graeme Bowtle and Charles Buss, <span class="font-italic">The Law of Ship Mortgages</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(Routledge, 2nd Ed, 2016) (“<span class="font-italic">The Law of Ship Mortgages”</span>) (at paras 5.9.3 and 5.9.6):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Equipment, such as electronic navigation equipment, that is owned by the mortgagor can be easily moved from ship to ship, and, where this is so, <span class="font-italic">the equipment should be specifically described </span><span class="font-italic">in order to ensure that the mortgage extends to it</span>. … If it is intended to obtain security against [mere furnishings, particularly those of an ornamental nature], <span class="font-italic">the deed of covenant should specifically mortgage these items</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In the case of passenger ships and large yachts there may be a greater problem in deciding the extent to which items such as furniture, gymnasium equipment, televisions and other moveable equipment owned by the owner and not merely leased to it are included in the mortgage. <span class="font-italic">In practice, the position with respect to such items is normally made clear by the deed of covenant</span>, which will also extend the charge to all other property brought on to the ship by the owner, whether in substitution or in addition to property on board at the time the mortgage was granted.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In reliance on this passage, Ms Ang submits that the language of the WD Documentation was simply insufficient to produce the result KfW urges upon me.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 The general principles cited by Ms Ang at [97] above are well established and uncontroversial. In this case, however, I have considered the case law and come to the conclusion that the language of the WD Documentation <span class="font-italic">was </span>sufficient to bring the “gaming equipment” within the scope of the ship mortgage. The real question, therefore, is whether my reliance on judicial interpretations of the words “ship”, “belongings”, and “appurtenances” is consistent with the modern interpretive principles Ms Ang invokes. In my view, the answer is ‘yes’. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 I begin with the following observation by the learned authors of <span class="font-italic">Chitty on Contracts</span> (Hugh G. Beale gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 34th Ed, 2022)<span class="font-italic"> </span>(at para 15-065):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Where the same words of contractual provisions have for many years received a judicial construction, the court will suppose that the parties have contracted upon the belief that their words will be understood in the accepted legal sense.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 This proposition is amply borne out by the authorities. For example, in<span class="font-italic"> Marc Rich &amp; Co. Ltd. v </span><span class="font-italic">Tourloti Compania Naviera S.A. (The “Kalliopi A”)</span> [1988] 2 Lloyd’s Rep. 101, Staughton LJ observed (at 105) that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It must, I suppose, be accepted that the interpretation of a charter-party cannot be conducted solely on the basis of the ordinary English meaning of the words which the parties have used in their contract. Regard must be had to what the same or similar words or phrases have been held to mean in the past. As I ventured to say in <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Radauti</span> (at p. 278):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Once a particular clause, phrase or word has received an authoritative interpretation from the Courts, it is thought right to follow that interpretation in other cases in the belief that the parties to subsequent contracts will have had it in mind when concluding their bargains or at least their legal advisers will have considered it when deciding whether to pursue a dispute subsequently.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 Of course, this is not to say that established judicial interpretations are immutable, or that they must be woodenly applied despite clear evidence of contrary intentions. The point, however, remains that commercial parties are assumed to have ordered their commercial dealings around long-standing interpretations – especially if the relevant words are used in the same context or formulation with which the established authorities were concerned. Put another way, a reasonable businessperson would start from the position that the contracting parties intended for those words to have the meaning given to them in the decided cases. If this presumptive meaning is to be displaced, there must be clear and admissible evidence (whether in or extrinsic to the contract) to show that the parties intended for a different interpretation to prevail. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 In this case, the relevant terms of the WD Mortgage and WD Deed were framed in a manner that is standard to ship mortgages. Both sides dealt with each other at arm’s length – or at least, there is no suggestion to the contrary. There is nothing in the WD Documentation to reveal any contradiction between the judicial interpretations I have applied and the parties’ <span class="font-italic">objective</span> intentions as expressed in the WD Documentation. Insofar as reference was made to extrinsic documents – namely, the CE Agreement – I have found them to be irrelevant for the reasons set out at [35] above. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 If there is nothing to displace the presumptive interpretation to be applied, it would then generally be no answer to challenge that interpretation on grounds that an unreasonable result will follow. This is because <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">hypothesi</span> the parties themselves objectively intended for that result. In this regard, I gratefully adopt Peter Gibson LJ’s observations in <span class="font-italic">Kazakstan</span><span class="font-italic"> Wool Processors (Europe) Ltd v Nederlandsche Credietverzekering Maatschappij NV </span>[2000] Lloyd’s Rep IR 371 (at [49]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The court is entitled to look at those consequences because the more extreme they are, the less likely it is that commercial men will have intended an agreement with that result. But the court is not entitled to rewrite the bargain which they have made merely to accord with what the court thinks to be a more reasonable result, and the best guide to the parties’ intentions remains the words which they have chosen to use in the contract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 In any event, I am not persuaded that the decision I have reached would produce an outcome that can be fairly described as unreasonable. The interpretation that I have arrived at may be more onerous than the one advanced by WDL, but it has never been the law that the least onerous of competing interpretations should be preferred. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 Finally, I reject WDL’s submission that the relevant terms of the WD Documentation should be read <span class="font-italic">contra proferentem</span>. It was held in <span class="font-italic">Mohammed Shahid Late </span><span class="font-italic">Mahabubur Rahman v Lim Keenly Builders Pte Ltd </span>[2010] 3 SLR 1021 (at [68]) that the <span class="font-italic">contra proferentem </span>rule “does not permit the artificial creation of an ambiguity in order to reach a particular result”.<span class="font-italic"> </span>The relevant terms which I have construed in this case <span class="font-italic">have</span> a clear presumptive meaning that was not expressly modified or departed from. I do not find those terms ambiguous and there is, accordingly, simply no room to read them <span class="font-italic">contra proferentem</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 This application would have been obviated had the parties used words in the WD Documentation to expressly and specifically indicate that the mortgage should extend to the “gaming equipment” on board the Vessel. To that extent, I accept that the extract from <span class="font-italic">The Law of Ship Mortgages</span> cited by Ms Ang offers useful, practical advice to mortgagors and mortgagees of ships (see [98] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 Nonetheless, in the circumstances of this case, the fact that the WD Documentation is silent on the matter is not fatal to KfW’s case. For the reasons I have given, the words that were used are, in my judgment, sufficient to reveal the parties’ objective intention that the mortgage of the Vessel should include the “gaming equipment”. I therefore dismiss SUM 2787.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 I shall hear the parties separately on the issue of costs and any further orders to be made in respect of the remaining proceeds of sale that are subject to the Ringfencing Order.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">S Mohan<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="Judg-Sign text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Edgar Chin Ren Howe, Ch’ng Cheng Yi Samantha and Teo Jim Yang (Ascendant Legal LLC) for the claimant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Ang Hui Ming Vivian, Douglas Lok Bao Guang, Ho Pey Yann and Whang Yixuan Rennie (Allen &amp; Gledhill LLP) for the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
