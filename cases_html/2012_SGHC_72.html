        Quentin Loh J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant,
                    DBS Bank Ltd, (“DBS”), extended banking facilities to Marine
                    Accomm Pte Ltd (“MAPL”), a company started and incorporated by Mr
                    Tong Guan Teck (“Mr Tong”) and his partner Mr Tan Teck Ming
                    (“Mr Tan”) sometime in late 1988 or early 1989. As was usual, DBS
                    required Mr Tong and Mr Tan to guarantee repayment by MAPL of any sums due to
                    DBS. Mr Tong and Mr Tan signed the guarantee (“the Guarantee”) on
                    4 October 2005.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Alleging a default, DBS then sued MAPL, Mr Tan
                    and Mr Tong for liquidated sums under the Guarantee. Judgment in default of
                    appearance was entered against MAPL and Mr Tan on 15 and 24 June 2011
                    respectively. DBS took out Summons No 3764/2011/K (“Summons 3764”)
                    applying for summary judgment against Mr Tong under O 14 r 1 of the Rules of
                    Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) (“Rules of Court”) and an order
                    that Mr Tong’s counter-claim against DBS be struck out under O 18 r 19 of
                    the Rules of Court with indemnity costs paid to DBS.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Mr Tong vigorously opposed DBS’s
                    application for summary judgment. The learned Assistant Registrar granted Mr
                    Tong conditional leave to defend and refused to strike out Mr Tong’s
                    counter-claim. Against that decision, Mr Tong appealed in RA 350 of 2011,
                    (“RA 350”), contending that DBS’s application in Summons
                    3764 should be dismissed or alternatively that he be given unconditional leave
                    to defend the claim. DBS also appealed in RA351 of 2011, (“RA
                    351”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The 2<sup>nd</sup> and
                        3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants in the counterclaim entered an
                    appearance, but were not directly involved in these appeals, nor did they seek
                    judgment in their favour.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       After hearing the parties, I dismissed both
                    appeals with costs in the cause. Mr Tong has appealed against my decision and I
                    now issue my grounds.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The following facts are not in dispute. MAPL
                    defaulted in its payment obligations to DBS under the banking facilities. These
                    proceedings arise out of the Guarantee signed by Mr Tong and Mr Tan on 4 October
                    2005 in favour of DBS, which was followed by a Deed of Confirmation dated 29 May
                    2009 (“Deed of Confirmation”). At the time of signing the
                    Guarantee and Deed of Confirmation, Mr Tan held 50% of the shares in MAPL, with
                    the remaining 50% held by Brosea Pte Ltd (“Brosea”), a company
                    started by Mr Tong and in which Mr Tong was both a director and shareholder. The
                    Guarantee and its terms are not in dispute, and are not in issue in this case.
                    On 24 May 2011, DBS issued a letter of demand to Mr Tong and Mr Tan as
                    guarantors for a liquidated sum due and owing under the Guarantee.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The case turned on what happened after the
                    signing of the Deed of Confirmation and the Guarantee, specifically, whether Mr
                    Tong’s liability under the Guarantee was discharged. DBS maintained in
                    Suit 406 that his liability under the Guarantee had not been discharged. Mr Tong
                    filed a counter-claim against DBS, which also included two other defendants, UOB
                    Bank (“UOB”), in whose favour he had also executed a guarantee,
                    and Viking Offshore and Marine Limited (“Viking”), a company that
                    had bought over Mr Tong’s share in MAPL. The claims against Viking and UOB
                    are not the subject of this appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The basis of Mr Tong’s counter-claim
                    against DBS was that DBS had notice of both the transfer of his shares in MAPL
                    to Viking, and of the Sale and Purchase Agreement (“the
                    Agreement”) on 19 July 2010 effecting that transfer. A Memorandum of
                    Disclosure (“Disclosure Memorandum”), executed on 30 July 2010,
                    which Mr Tong argued formed an appendix to the Agreement, stated at Clause 15
                    that “all personal guarantees granted by Tong Guan Teck in respect of the
                    Company shall be discharged... and the Purchaser [<em>ie</em> Viking] shall grant a corporate guarantee for the equivalent
                    amount in substitute of the aforementioned personal guarantees”. Mr Tong
                    contended that DBS owed him a duty to ensure that Viking executed this transfer
                    as agreed. By failing to fulfil this duty, and by way of its assurances in
                    letters and a meeting in August or September 2010, DBS had effectively
                    discharged Mr Tong from the Guarantee and was estopped from claiming against him
                    the liquidated sums owing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On appeal, DBS contended that no such duty
                    existed in law or in fact, nor had it given Mr Tong any assurance that they
                    would take him off the Guarantee. DBS further contended that Mr Tong’s
                    attempts to establish such a duty was wholly unmeritorious, vexatious and
                    frivolous, and should be struck out under O 18 r 19 of the Rules of Court, with
                    judgment entered for DBS.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     This appeal turns on whether or not there is a
                    triable issue that Mr Tong had been discharged from the Guarantee. This hinges
                    on:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_a"></a>(a)     Whether DBS gave Mr Tong any express
                        assurance that they would take him off the Guarantee;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_b"></a>(b)     Whether the granting of further
                        facilities after the Agreement and the Disclosure Memorandum had been
                        executed was enough to discharge the Guarantee; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_c"></a>(c)     Whether it is a triable issue that DBS
                        owed a duty to Mr Tong to ensure that Viking executed a corporate
                        guarantee.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Evidence of an express assurance given by DBS</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     I found that there was no evidence of any
                    assurance by DBS, even on the low threshold of proof required under O 14 r 1 of
                    the Rules of Court, that it would discharge Mr Tong from the
                Guarantee.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Mr Tong relies on two matters to support his
                    assertion that this assurance was given:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_a"></a>(a)     A letter from DBS on 6 January 2011
                        (“the 6<sup>th</sup> January Letter”) agreeing
                        to a conditional discharge of the Guarantee; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_b"></a>(b)     A meeting with DBS around
                        August/September 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The 6<sup>th</sup> January Letter</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The 6<sup>th</sup> January
                    Letter was primarily a letter of offer issued by DBS for revisions to the limits
                    on its Banking Facilities to MAPL and allowing of Foreign Exchange Transactions
                    from time to time. This made reference to the fact that there had been a request
                    for a discharge of the Guarantee. In paragraph (a) of the pre-amble, the
                        6<sup>th</sup> January Letter stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We are agreeable to discharge Tong Guan Teck as guarantor <em>subject to</em> the provision of the guarantee from Tan
                        Teck Ming and corporate guarantee from VIKING OFFSHORE AND MARINE
                        LIMITED.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The wording of the letter of offer is clear;
                    it was not an agreement to discharge Mr Tong as guarantor unconditionally, but
                    only “subject to” the provision of substitute guarantees. If this
                    letter were to stand on its own, Mr Tong’s contention must fail. I accept,
                    however, that there may have been discussions preceding the writing of the
                        6<sup>th</sup> January Letter which may have provided
                    further assurances, and it is to this issue that I now turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Meeting with DBS</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Mr Tong relied on a meeting with DBS, which
                    took place in August or September 2010. This is the only meeting he relied on to
                    claim that DBS gave assurances that he would be discharged under the Guarantee.
                    He claims that during this meeting, DBS’s Ms Tan Soh Leng (“Ms
                    Tan”) and Ms Low Kia Min (“Ms Low”) had requested him and
                    Mr Tan to loan MAPL a sum of $1,000,000 as payment towards DBS’s
                    outstanding facilities to MAPL, in exchange for DBS expediting the procurement
                    of the corporate guarantee from Viking.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> This was flatly denied by DBS, and Ms Tan
                    deposed that DBS had never made such a request of Mr Tong and Mr Tan. Rather,
                    DBS claims that the meeting was to settle “overdue bills under the
                    Banking Facilities” before the commencement of legal action against Mr
                    Tong and Mr Tan as guarantors.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> Mr Tan, who has since
                    left the country, was unavailable to testify as to what happened at the
                    meeting.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     It should be noted that, even taking Mr
                    Tong’s affidavit evidence at its highest, his evidence falls short of
                    saying that DBS undertook to discharge him from the Guarantee. In any case, he
                    deposed that he had “turned down the request to loan the
                        money”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> He does not
                    use this as evidence, therefore, that DBS had assured him that he would be
                    discharge from the Guarantee, but as evidence only that DBS was “fully
                    aware of Viking’s Transfer obligation and that DBS itself appeared to be
                    taking steps to procure the corporate guarantee from Viking”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>
                    This is consistent with Ms Tan’s evidence, which was that a conditional
                    discharge had been offered by the 6<sup>th</sup> January Letter,
                    but it was not accepted and the offer eventually lapsed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     It would have been clear to Mr Tong, and his
                    affidavit indicates that he was aware, that he would not be discharged from the
                    Guarantee before and unless a substitute guarantee was obtained. Clause 12 of
                    the Guarantee states this clearly:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Guarantor agrees and acknowledges that the obligation and liabilities
                        of the Guarantor hereunder shall be <em>absolute and

                        Guarantee, shall <em>not be abrogated, prejudiced, affected

                            credit compounding, compromise, waiver, variation, renewal, release,
                            discharge or other advantage or indulgence;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    by the Bank failing, neglecting or deciding not to

                            otherwise or in the event of enforcement by the Bank of any collateral
                            or other security or any remedy or otherwise, by any act, omission,
                            negligence or other conduct or failure on the part of the Bank or any

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Mr Tong does not plead rectification or
                        <em>non est factum</em>, and indeed affirmed the
                    Guarantee in the Deed of Confirmation. He even signed a very similar guarantee
                    with UOB, who were the co-defendants in his counter-claim, on
                        14<sup>th</sup> June 2010, and this also contained a similar
                    clause, Clause 16.18, which stated that he “shall not assign all or any
                    of its rights and liabilities under this Agreement without the prior written
                    consent of [UOB]”. Mr Tong appeared to be an experienced businessman and
                    was dealing with more than one bank; he never pleaded that he was not <em>au fait</em> with the implications of signing either of these
                    guarantees and the subsequent Deed of Confirmation. He would have been and was
                    aware that something more than a conditional offer would be required for him to
                    be discharged from the Guarantee.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     There is no evidence either on the face of the
                    documents or on the affidavits filed by Mr Tong that DBS had ever assured him
                    that they would discharge the Guarantee. As the evidence before me on the
                    August/September 2010 Meeting stands, Mr Tong does not really fulfil the
                    threshold of a triable issue however given his contentions and having regard to
                    Mr Tong’s right to have his day in court, I agreed with the learned
                    Assistant Registrar’s decision to give Mr Tong conditional leave to
                    defend.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether granting of further facilities was enough to discharge the
                Guarantee</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Mr Tong claimed that further facilities were
                    to be granted to MAPL after the shares had been transferred to Viking, and DBS
                    was aware that Viking, and not Mr Tong, was now behind MAPL. He thus contended
                    that DBS impliedly discharged the Guarantee by making an offer to grant further
                    facilities on the strength of MAPL’s new controlling shareholder,
                    Viking.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Clause 22 of the Guarantee states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...<em>Notwithstanding the bank’s receipt of notice
                            of the Guarantor’s intention to revoke this Guarantee, the Bank
                            shall be entitled to continue to make advances to the Borrower in
                            respect of the Facilities </em><em>and the
                            Guarantor irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that he shall continue
                            to be liable for all such advances</em> until all monies hereby
                        guaranteed are paid to and received by the Bank in full.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It is clear from the Guarantee that the granting of further facilities
                    or advances does not thereby discharge Mr Tong from liability under the
                    Guarantee, even if he notified the Bank that he intended to revoke the Guarantee
                    or obtain a substitute guarantee from Viking. Mr Tong did not even claim that he
                    had notified the bank of any intention to revoke the Guarantee. Instead, in his
                    affidavit, he only stated that DBS was aware that the shareholding of MAPL had
                    changed, and that DBS had approved of such change. If a notice of intention to
                    revoke was not enough, how could a notice of change in shareholding in MAPL
                    suffice to discharge Mr Tong from the Guarantee?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     It is also clear from the documents that all
                    that was “accepted” by DBS was a change in the shareholding in
                    MAPL. The letter from Mr Tan to DBS’s Ms Tan on behalf of MAPL and his
                    co-guarantor Mr Tong, dated 29 July 2010, was a notification “in
                    accordance with Clause 7” of the facility letter to inform DBS of
                    “the proposed change in ownership of the Company”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> The letter further stated
                    that, upon completion of transfer of ownership to Viking, MAPL
                    “undertakes to set aside $1.5 mil from the loans given by Brosea PL
                    and/or Viking Offshore and Marine Limited to MAPL to settle the loan outstanding
                    at DBS Bank”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> I note that the reference
                    to the duty to inform in Clause 7 was mistakenly taken from the terms attached
                    to UOB’s letter of facility, rather than DBS’s, and the clause in
                    UOB’s letter of facility stated that any reorganisation or substantial
                    change of shareholders shall not be taken without the bank’s prior written
                    consent. This was with reference to the banking facilities. There was no mention
                    of the Guarantee, or any indication that the new ownership should or would
                    discharge the Guarantee. DBS’s letter in reply was brief and clear; it
                    merely consented to the proposed change in shareholding in the company. Insofar
                    as Mr Tong alleges that the granting of further facilities on the basis of the
                    new shareholding was enough to discharge the Guarantee, there is no evidence for
                    such a proposition either in the affidavits, pleadings, or documents. This is
                    not a triable issue and cannot constitute a basis for allowing RA 351 or for
                    striking out Summons 3764.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">DBS’s alleged duty to Mr Tong</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Mr Tong’s final effort in bringing his
                    counter-claim is built on the evidence mentioned in the preceding paragraphs, in
                    order to found a claim of estoppel. He argued that DBS’s early attempts to
                    have Viking sign the corporate guarantee, coupled with their representations
                    during the August/September 2010 Meeting and the 6<sup>th</sup>
                    January letter, was effectively a representation to Mr Tong that they were in
                    the midst of discharging and transferring the Guarantee from him to Viking.
                    While not strictly provided for in the Guarantee itself, he contended that this
                    supported a claim of estoppel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Mr Tong brought up a number of preliminary
                    claims to support this, and among them, the contention that DBS sent “a
                    Letter of Facilities and related correspondence stipulating and/or requiring
                    Viking to sign as a corporate guarantor in accordance with Viking’s
                    Transfer Obligation”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> Mr Tan, who was still involved as sole
                    director of the then Viking-owned MAPL, informed Mr Tong of these letters. This
                    was denied by DBS.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> Presumably if DBS’s appeal
                    were dismissed, Mr Tong would ask for discovery of these documents. I am of the
                    view that in a situation such as this where it was Mr Tong’s word against
                    DBS’s, Mr Tong should be given the benefit of the doubt to get discovery
                    of these documents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     This was not the only evidence that Mr Tong
                    relied upon. He also claimed that the August/September 2010 Meeting included
                    some discussion of the procurement of the corporate Guarantee. DBS did not deny
                    that this meeting took place, although they denied that there had been a request
                    for a sum of $1,000,000 for expedition of this procurement. I note that Ms Tan,
                    in her reply affidavit on behalf of DBS denying the request for this sum, did
                    not say that the procuring Viking’s corporate guarantee was not mentioned
                    at this meeting. On my reading, the 6<sup>th</sup> January
                    Letter did indicate that there must have been some discussion, or at a least a
                    mention, of the transfer of this guarantee to Viking, as it stated that DBS was
                    agreeable to such a transfer. What was unclear from the evidence was the nature
                    of the discussion. If this discussion included mention of an express undertaking
                    from DBS that it would secure the corporate guarantee from Viking, this could
                    have placed Mr Tong under the impression that there was no need for strict
                    compliance with the terms of the Guarantee which required him to expressly
                    assign the Guarantee to Viking. Without knowing more about what transpired
                    during the August/September 2010 meeting, or whether there was, indeed
                    correspondence between DBS and Viking which was referenced during this meeting,
                    I was of the view that summary judgment ought not to be given in favour of
                    DBS.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     DBS has strenuously objected to this
                    contention, arguing that banks do not owe a general duty to guarantors to secure
                    the transfer of a Guarantee simply because they knew that such transfer had been
                    agreed upon. DBS made much of the fact that the Agreement between Viking, Mr
                    Tong, and Mr Tan for the sale of their shares was not binding on DBS, and this
                    is confirmed in Clause 24 of the Agreement. This argument was admittedly
                    persuasive, and even more so when I considered that the Disclosure Memorandum
                    was only signed on 30 July 2010, 11 days after the execution of the Agreement
                    and a day after the letter was sent from Mr Tan to DBS requesting DBS’s
                    consent to a change in ownership of MAPL. The latter document was intended to
                    record the accounts of the parties for disclosure purposes, and not to discharge
                    any guarantees, as seen from Clause 8.4 of the Agreement. However, Mr
                    Tong’s argument is not that DBS was bound by the Agreement, but that DBS
                    took positive steps on strength of the notice given under the Agreement and the
                    letters sent by Mr Tong and Mr Tan, to secure the corporate guarantee, and that
                    DBS kept Mr Tong apprised of such developments and actively gave the impression
                    that Mr Tong need do nothing further. Whether DBS was a third party to the
                    Agreement was therefore a red herring.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Following a comprehensive multi-jurisdictional
                    review of case law in its submissions, DBS admitted that a duty of care between
                    a bank and a guarantor may arise “where the creditor has taken <em>positive</em> steps such that the law imposes on the creditor
                    a duty to act reasonably in taking these positive steps as the interests of the
                    surety might be affected” [emphasis in original].<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> Mr Tong contended that DBS, by
                    indicating to him at the August/September 2010 meeting that they were in the
                    midst of discussions with Viking to execute a corporate guarantee, and by in
                    fact initiating correspondence with Viking, did take such a positive step as to
                    affect his interests. In order for DBS to succeed in RA 351, it must show that
                    this alleged cause of action is certain to fail: <em>Gabriel
                        Peter &amp; Partners v Wee Chong Jin</em> [1998] 1 SLR 374
                        (“<em>Gabriel Peter &amp;
                    Partners</em>”). For the reasons given above (<em>supra</em><a href="#p1_24">[24]</a> to <a href="#p1_26">[26]</a>), I find that DBS has not shown this in relation to the
                    issue of estoppel. Neither has it convincingly shown that Mr Tong’s
                    counter-claim disclosed no reasonable cause of action or defence (O 18 r 19(a)
                    of the Rules of Court); is scandalous, frivolous or vexatious (O 18 r 19(b) of
                    the Rules of Court); would prejudice or delay fair trial of the action (O 18 r
                    19(c) of the Rules of Court); or is otherwise an abuse of the process of the
                    court (O 18 r 19(d) of the Rules of Court). While DBS is right to point out that
                    estoppel operates as a shield and not a sword, I note that Mr Tong used the
                    estoppel claim as part of his defence to DBS’s original suit, and the fact
                    that he does so by a counter-claim should not prejudice him by an order to
                    strike out what was essentially part and parcel of his defence to Suit
                    406.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     DBS claimed that no assurance was pleaded by
                    Mr Tong.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> To the contrary, the claims in Mr
                    Tong’s affidavit<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> and written
                        submissions<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> that DBS had indicated that it would
                    expedite the procurement of the corporate guarantee were effectively claims that
                    there was an assurance given that DBS would take care of the transfer of the
                    Guarantee from Mr Tong to Viking. Whether this also amounts to an assurance that
                    DBS would waive its rights under the Guarantee is a matter to be decided at
                    trial. I note, in passing, that Mr Tong is on thin ice, as it is not at all
                    clear that the action that DBS had taken constituted such positive steps as to
                    raise a claim of estoppel, and there was clearly no express assurance that the
                    Guarantee would be discharged. I note, however, the observations in <em>Gabriel Peter &amp; Partners</em> at [18]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In general, it is only in plain and obvious cases that the power of
                        striking out should be invoked. This was the view taken by Lindley MR in
                            <em>Hubbuck &amp; Sons v Wilkinson, Heywood and
                            Clark</em> [1899] 1 QB 86, at 91. It should not be exercised by a
                        minute and protracted examination of the documents and facts of the case in
                        order to see if the plaintiff really has a cause of action. The practice of
                        the courts has been that, where an application for striking out involves a
                        lengthy and serious argument the court should decline to proceed with the
                        argument unless, not only does it have doubts as to the soundness of the
                        pleading but, in addition, it is satisfied that striking out will obviate
                        the necessity for a trial or reduce the burden of preparing for a
                        trail.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It is immaterial that Mr Tong has not made out his case at this stage,
                    as this can only be done with the benefit of discovery, further preparation, and
                    evidence adduced at trial. What is important is that Mr Tong is, in claiming his
                    right to have his day in court, acting <em>bona fide</em>
                    and not merely attempting to “annoy or embarrass his opponent, or
                    [conducting the case in a manner] not calculated to lead to any practical
                    result”: <em>Goh Koon Suan v Heng Gek Kiau &amp;
                        Ors</em> [1990] SLR 1251. DBS has not, in its affidavits or in its
                    written submissions, suggested or given any evidence that Mr Tong is acting
                        <em>mala fides</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     In relation to DBS’s application for
                    summary judgment, I have already set out above, all the facts and evidence that
                    points to the strength of DBS’s case and the paucity of any facts or
                    evidence in Mr Tong’s favour. Mr Tong however refers to that one meeting
                    in August/September 2010 where he claims certain assurances were given by DBS.
                    In my view, he is entitled to his day in court but should only be given
                    conditional leave to defend. I accordingly dismiss DBS’s appeal, RA 351,
                    for an order for summary judgment and to strike out Mr Tong’s defence and
                    counter-claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     I also agree with the decision of the learned
                    Assistant Registrar and dismissed RA 350. I have already said that I can find no
                    evidence that DBS gave an express assurance to Mr Tong that he would be
                    discharged from the Guarantee. I have also noted the dubiousness of Mr
                    Tong’s leap of logic that the mere fact that DBS told him they were
                    expediting the procurement of Viking’s corporate guarantee amounted to an
                    implied assurance that he need do no more to be discharged from the Guarantee. I
                    accordingly find no basis for a dismissal of DBS’s application in Summons
                    3764 altogether, nor a granting of unconditional leave to defend. Unconditional
                    leave would be unwarranted on the facts and circumstances as they now stand
                    before me at this interlocutory stage.</p>
