</div> As seen from the Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Quah</span><span class="font-italic"> Kay Tee v Ong and Co Pte Ltd </span>[1996] 3 SLR(R) 637 at [45], in an action for conspiracy by <span class="font-italic">lawful </span>means where no unlawful act is involved, there is however an additional requirement of a “predominant purpose” to cause loss to the plaintiff:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The tort of conspiracy comprises two types: conspiracy by unlawful means and conspiracy by lawful means. A conspiracy by unlawful means is constituted when two or more persons combine to commit an unlawful act with the intention of injuring or damaging the plaintiff, and the act is carried out and the intention achieved. In a conspiracy by lawful means, there need not be an unlawful act committed by the conspirators. But there is the additional requirement of proving a “predominant purpose” by all the conspirators to cause injury or damage to the plaintiff, and the act is carried out and the purpose achieved.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Similar pronouncements were also made in the High Court decisions of <span class="font-italic">Swiss Butchery</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [13] and <span class="font-italic">Nagase Singapore Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Ching Kai Huat</span> [2008] 1 SLR(R) 80 at [23].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Third, the Defendants argue that the tort of conspiracy is “outmoded” and thus should not be accepted as a valid cause of action.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify"> Defendants’ Closing Submissions at para 51. </div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> This argument similarly stems from a misunderstanding of the nature of the present action. The Plaintiff’s claim is based on the tort of conspiracy by <span class="font-italic">unlawful</span> means, not conspiracy by <span class="font-italic">lawful </span>means. The decision of <span class="font-italic">Panatron</span><span class="font-italic"> Pte Ltd v Lee Cheow Lee </span>[2000] SGHC 209 relied on by the Defendants only suggested that the tort of conspiracy by <span class="font-italic">lawful </span>means may be outmoded (at [85]). Lai Kew Chai J did not, in that case, doubt the tort of conspiracy by<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">unlawful</span> means. The Defendants’ reliance is therefore misplaced.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 As for the tort of conspiracy by <span class="font-italic">unlawful</span> means, the Court of Appeal considered the question in <span class="font-italic">EFT Holdings</span> at [90] but decided not to rule on the point: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A preliminary question is whether unlawful means conspiracy continues to have any relevance in our law as a basis of civil liability. Should we continue to recognise its existence, as well as that of lawful means conspiracy? We do not propose to answer that question in this appeal as it was not argued, but a future case might well present the opportunity for this to be carefully considered. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Nonetheless, the Court of Appeal in the subsequent case of <span class="font-italic">Simgood</span> implicitly acknowledged the existence of the tort of unlawful means conspiracy by applying the elements laid down in <span class="font-italic">EFT Holdings</span> to determine whether the tort had been established on the facts of that case (see <span class="font-italic">Simgood</span> at [14]–[19]). Given the present state of affairs, it appears that the tort of unlawful means conspiracy still exists within our law. Before me, no credible arguments questioning the existence of the tort were made. I therefore defer to the apex court’s position in <span class="font-italic">EFT Holdings</span> and <span class="font-italic">Simgood</span> accepting that the tort of unlawful means conspiracy continues to exist in our law. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 To recapitulate, on the present facts, the key question is whether the Defendants had intended to cause loss to the Plaintiff when they acted pursuant to their conspiracy agreement. This requires a consideration of two issues: first, whether there was an agreement to unlawfully conspire to cause loss to the Plaintiff; and if so, what actions were taken by the conspirators in furtherance of this agreement. I turn to consider the first issue.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issue 1: Conspiracy to injure the Plaintiff</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 The Plaintiff has to show that the conspiracy and the unlawful means employed pursuant to that conspiracy were intended specifically to cause loss to the Plaintiff. A conspiracy usually takes the form of an agreement (and in appropriate cases, may even include a sufficiently clear arrangement or understanding) of some kind reached by the alleged conspirators on how they should act together to cause loss to the claimant. The existence of a conspiracy can be inferred from the circumstances and the acts of the conspirators.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The Plaintiff’s case is essentially that there was an agreement amongst the conspirators to enrich the SSI group at the expense of the Plaintiff by divesting the Plaintiff of both its existing and prospective clients as well as by defrauding the Plaintiff through the procurement of various commissions and payments to the SSI group (“the conspiracy agreement”). The Defendants’ case denies the existence of this agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 I find on a balance of probabilities that such an agreement existed. In my view, the existence of this agreement can be inferred from two sets of evidence:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The first set shows the 1st Defendant’s undue preferential treatment of the SSI group as compared to other agents and distributors. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The second set shows the particularly close financial relationship of the conspirators. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Undue preferential treatment </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 In order to appreciate the extent of preferential treatment in this case, it is important to first understand the role of agents and distributors in the Plaintiff’s business (“Third Party Agents”). As explained by the Plaintiff’s witnesses, these Third Party Agents are employed specifically to source, secure and manage <span class="font-italic">new</span> customers in markets that the Plaintiff has yet to establish a presence in. Hence, it would make no commercial sense for the Plaintiff to divert its <span class="font-italic">own</span> <span class="font-italic">existing</span> and <span class="font-italic">prospective</span> customers to a Third Party Agent; this entirely undermines the purpose of appointing such agents in the first place.

</div> This point was also not contested by the Defendants at trial. Instead, the Defendants only attempt to <span class="font-italic">justify</span> these diversions on the following three bases, none of which is backed up by any reliable evidence:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, these customers had specifically requested to deal through the SSI group instead of the Plaintiff. However, the Plaintiff’s first witness, Mr Huang Wei (“Mr Huang”) – who was employed by the 1st Defendant on behalf of the Plaintiff and held the position of Head of Sales for China – testified during cross-examination that no customers had specifically requested as such.

In fact, there is evidence to the contrary: the Plaintiff’s second witness, Ms Goh Siew Hoon (“Ms Goh”) – the finance and human resources manager for the Plaintiff – explained that these presentations were nothing more than proposals that had been discussed but were never implemented or approved.

</div> In response, the Defendants argue (again without adducing any evidence) that the cost prices appear lower because they have not been adjusted and normalised to Cost, Insurance and Freight (“CIF”) rates. However, two of the Plaintiff’s witnesses, Ms Goh and Mr Huang, explained that the rates had in fact been normalised, by cross referencing the various invoices of the products sold by the Plaintiff (“the invoices”).

</div> The above comparison reveals that in both these sets of emails, the description of the mirror item, the date on which it was broken and the manner in which it had been broken were worded very similarly. It is clear to me from this evidence that the 1st Defendant was in fact corresponding from the email address admin@ssiasia.com.sg and was also operating under the alias “Henry” when corresponding from this email address in internal emails of the SSI group and in emails to the Plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 This is made all the more clear on a consideration of Mr Huang’s testimony on the identity of “Henry” in the email correspondence.

I am fortified in this conclusion by an examination of Goh Boon Eng’s employment contract with the 2nd Defendant.

Since 2005, the Plaintiff had maintained Faxolif as one of its main distributors through a written agreement for their services (“agreement with Faxolif”). However, within three months of the 1st Defendant’s employment, this agreement with Faxolif was terminated (see [5]–[7] above). The Plaintiff argues that this termination was done by the 1st Defendant without any valid reasons, especially because there had been no problems in the working relationship between the Plaintiff and Faxolif. In fact, there were upcoming plans for the year of 2008.

Such an interpretation is also consistent with the testimonies of Ms Goh and Mr Richard Ho (“Mr Ho”), the technical support manager of the Plaintiff, where they explained that the agreement with Faxolif would be automatically renewed so long as neither party openly elects to terminate it.

This argument qualifies the abruptness in termination but does not address the nub of the Plaintiff’s submission that the termination of Faxolif’s services without a good reason was in fact a preparatory step in the conspiracy. I need not make a finding as to whether the termination was abrupt in order to find that the termination of the agreement with Faxolif was the formative act in the scheme of the conspiracy. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Seen in totality, I find that the agreement with Faxolif was terminated by the 1st Defendant in order to pave the way for the SSI group to be appointed as a distributor of the Plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Establishing systems of control within the Plaintiff</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 I also agree with the Plaintiff’s submission that the 1st Defendant had established systems for his direct and tight control within the Plaintiff as part of the preparatory steps in the conspiracy.

I agree with this submission and find that the SSI group had much to gain financially from the conspiracy agreement. This is especially because the SSI group were newcomers to the industry. As argued by the Plaintiff, the conspirators intended to benefit the SSI group in two key ways. First, the conspiracy agreement enabled the SSI group to pocket the amounts the Plaintiff would otherwise have made had the clients dealt directly with the Plaintiff. This profit was also greatly maximised by virtue of the fact that the SSI group was given undue preferential treatment and enjoyed lower prices vis-à-vis other distributors (see above at [31]–[32] above). Second, the conspiracy agreement also provided the SSI group (which started with very few customers of its own) with a vast array of customers which it otherwise would not have had. If the SSI group had not been given this leg up by the 1st Defendant, it would probably have taken several years to develop its customer base to the same extent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 In the circumstances, I also find that that the SSI group was heavily or even solely reliant on the Plaintiff for its business. As admitted by the 5th Defendant in his affidavit, the SSI group faced difficulties in finding its own revenue streams and clients after the Plaintiff terminated the distribution agreements with the SSI group in 2011.

</div> Drop shipment arrangement is a supply chain management system under which the Plaintiff would provide its customers’ orders and shipment details to the entity making or supplying the goods so as to allow that entity to ship the goods directly to the Plaintiff’s customers. The Plaintiff would thus avoid having to warehouse these goods in stock. Ms Goh testified that the rented space was unnecessary to cater to only one client.

</div> Thus, it is not open for the conspirators to claim that they were unaware of the warehouse space actually required by the Plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 In the absence of a credible explanation from the Defendants, I fail to understand how it would have been necessary or even reasonable for the Defendants to cause the Plaintiff to rent a space several times larger than that required by the Plaintiff. Given the control the 1st Defendant wielded over the Plaintiff’s management decisions during that time (see above at [52]–[53]), I draw the adverse inference that the 1st Defendant caused the Plaintiff to rent far more warehouse space in China than that actually required by the Plaintiff so that there would be spare warehousing space made available, likely for the SSI group’s own use, and again at the Plaintiff’s expense. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 In sum, I find that the preparatory steps, diversion of clients, commissions paid, sale of imitation goods as well as the rent of the excessive warehouse space were actions taken in furtherance of the conspiracy agreement to cause loss to the Plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Even though the Defendants do not specifically contest the issue of the unlawfulness of these acts, for completeness, I shall briefly give my views on this element in relation to a claim in unlawful means conspiracy. I find all of these acts to be unlawful either in tort or criminal law. As further discussed below at [83]–[87], the preparatory steps, diversion of clients, payment of commissions and sale of imitation goods were all acts in breach of the 1st Defendant’s duty to act honestly in the discharge of his duties under s 157(1) of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the CA”), which is a criminal offence as provided under s 157(3) of the CA. The manufacturing of imitation chemical products for sale using confidential technical information belonging to the Plaintiff could also potentially be an infringement under the tort of breach of confidence. The warehouse space was rented property of the Plaintiff’s and entrusted to the 1st Defendant in his capacity as director to use for the Plaintiff’s purposes. If the 1st Defendant had allowed unused warehouse space to be used by the SSI group free of charge, and if SSI did in fact do so, then this could constitute a case of criminal breach of trust as defined under s 405 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed). It may also be a breach of the 1st Defendant’s duty to act honestly in the discharge of his duties under s 157(1) of the CA since he acted in a conspiracy with the others and caused the Plaintiff to enter into such a sub-lease with the SSI group.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 For the above reasons, I find that the Plaintiff has proved its case of unlawful means conspiracy against the Defendants and I thus allow the Conspiracy Claim. This now brings me to the discussion on the losses suffered by the Plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Losses suffered by the Plaintiff </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 At the outset, I would like to clarify that the aim of this section is only to establish in principle which heads of losses the Plaintiff is entitled to. Thereafter, the quantum of losses under the respective heads of losses are to be assessed at a separate hearing before the Registrar. As such, I reject the Defendants’ argument that the Plaintiff has to prove its exact quantum of loss at trial since the trial has been bifurcated.

</div>
</div> This argument stems from a misunderstanding of the nature of the damages sought. In a claim for loss of profit, it is entirely unnecessary to consider the financial position of the victim: doing so would conflate two separate inquiries and thus be fundamentally flawed. The Plaintiff’s contention is not that the conspiracy agreement had caused its absolute volume of sales to decline, but that the Defendants’ actions resulted in a loss of <span class="font-italic">profits</span> the Plaintiff could have made from an even higher absolute volume of sales at the prices sold by the SSI group, had some of the Plaintiff’s clients not been diverted to the SSI group.

</div> These commissions were irrational as the Plaintiff was essentially made to pay the 4% management fee in respect of its <span class="font-italic">existing</span> customers that had been diverted to the SSI group to manage (see above at [59]).

Given that the Plaintiff had been made to pay for a much larger space than it actually required, I find the rental paid for the warehousing space to be another loss suffered by the Plaintiff pursuant to the conspiracy agreement and find that the Plaintiff should be compensated for all losses in connection with the rental of the space not needed by the Plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 The last head of loss under the Conspiracy Claim is that arising from the sale of imitation goods by the SSI group.

</div> As explained above at [73], it is unnecessary for the Plaintiff to prove its loss at this stage of the action. I thus find that this is another loss caused by the Defendants pursuant to the conspiracy agreement to benefit themselves at the Plaintiff’s expense (see above at [65]). Accordingly, I allow the Plaintiff’s claim for this loss. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 For the avoidance of doubt, in respect of each head of loss, I allow the Plaintiff to elect whether to claim damages or an account of profits. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Breach of Directors’ Duties Claim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 In the alternative to the Conspiracy Claim, the Plaintiff also submits that the 1st Defendant has breached his directors’ duties owed to the Plaintiff. This claim is only brought against the 1st Defendant. In this regard, the Plaintiff claims that the 1st Defendant breached three distinct duties:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The duty to act honestly and with reasonable diligence in the discharge of his duties as a director of the Plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The duty not to make improper use of his position as an officer of the company; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The duty to disclose all conflicts of interest to the Plaintiff’s board of directors. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 It is undisputed that the 1st Defendant owed the Plaintiff fiduciary duties as a director of the latter. The question to be determined is whether the 1st Defendant breached any of these duties. The 1st Defendant does not make any relevant submissions in relation to this claim other than that the Breach of Directors’ Duties Claim should similarly fail if the Conspiracy Claim fails.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 In <span class="font-italic">Intraco</span><span class="font-italic"> Ltd v Multi-Pak Singapore Pte Ltd </span>[1994] 3 SLR(R) 1064, the Court of Appeal (at [28]–[29]) enunciated an objective test for the purposes of s 157(1) of the CA. The question is whether an “honest and intelligent man in the position of the directors, taking an objective view, could reasonably have concluded that the transactions were in the interests of [the company].” In applying this test, where the transaction is “not objectively in the company’s interest”, the court may draw an inference that the directors were not acting honestly: <span class="font-italic">Ho Kang Peng</span><span class="font-italic"> v Scintronix Corp Ltd (formerly known as TTL Holdings Ltd) </span>[2014] 3 SLR 329 (“<span class="font-italic">Ho Kang Peng</span>”) at [38]. Further, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Ho Kang Peng </span>referred to the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Vita Health Laboratories Pte Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> and others v Pang Seng Meng </span>[2004] 4 SLR(R) 162 (at [17] and [19]) and remarked at [39] that “the requirement of <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> or honesty will not be satisfied if the director acted <span class="font-italic">dis</span>honestly even if for the purported aim of maximising profits for the company” (emphasis in original). It is thus no defence for a director to claim that his actions were, in his view, in the best interest of the company if he is found to have acted dishonestly. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 Applying these principles to the facts of this case, it is clear beyond a balance of probabilities that the 1st Defendant had acted dishonestly, especially in view of my finding above that he was a party to the conspiracy to injure the Plaintiff and in so doing, to also benefit himself and his co-conspirators. In fact, based on the evidence before me, I take the view that the 1st Defendant played a major role in the conspiracy. Without the 1st Defendant orchestrating the unlawful acts within the Plaintiff, not only as its director, but also as its Regional Head of Sales for Asia, I do not believe that the other conspirators could have succeeded in injuring and causing loss to the Plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 I am unable to see how a director participating in such a conspiracy to harm the Plaintiff can ever be said to have acted honestly in the discharge of his duties as a director. Accordingly, I find that the abrupt termination of Faxolif’s services, the appointment of Wecorp, the SSI group, and Trinity Chemical (thereby facilitating the production of imitation goods), the rental of the warehouse space in China, the diversion of customers as well as the commissions paid to the SSI group were all actions that were clearly not in the interest of the Plaintiff. Insofar as the 1st Defendant was responsible for effecting or making the decisions on behalf of the Plaintiff to enable those actions to be carried out, he had clearly acted in breach of his duties as a director of the Plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 The 1st Defendant would therefore be statutorily liable to the Plaintiff under s 157(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the CA for any profit made by him or for any damage suffered by the Plaintiff as a result of his failure to act honestly in the discharge of his duties to the Plaintiff as a director. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Making improper use of his position as an officer of the company</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 The second duty the Plaintiff asserts has been breached is contained in s 157(2) of the CA:

Given my finding above at [86] that the 1st Defendant had acted dishonestly, I find that the 1st Defendant did make improper use of his position in the Plaintiff either as a director and/or as the Regional Head of Sales for Asia to effect an abrupt termination of Faxolif’s services, the appointment of Wecorp, the SSI group, and Trinity Chemical (thereby facilitating the production of imitation goods), the rental of the warehouse space in China, the diversion of customers as well as the commissions paid to the SSI group. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 The only question remaining is whether by making improper use of his position, the 1st Defendant directly or indirectly derived any “advantage for himself or for any other person” or caused “detriment to the company”. In view of my findings above in relation to the Conspiracy Claim, there is sufficient evidence to prove on a balance of probabilities that the 1st Defendant had not only obtained an advantage for himself as well as the other four defendants, but also caused detriment to the Plaintiff. Thus in my view, s 157(2) of the CA has been breached.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Again, pursuant to s 157(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the CA, the 1st Defendant is statutorily liable to the Plaintiff for any profit made by him or for any damage suffered by the Plaintiff on account of his breach of s 157(2).  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Non-disclosure of director’s interest in related transactions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92  The final duty that the Plaintiff relies on is the duty of disclosure contained in s 156(1) of the CA: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Subject to this section, every director or chief executive officer of a company who is in any way, whether directly or indirectly, interested in a transaction or proposed transaction with the company shall as soon as is practicable after the relevant facts have come to his knowledge ─ </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) declare the nature of his interest at a meeting of the directors of the company; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) send a written notice to the company containing details on the nature, character and extent of his interest in the transaction or proposed transaction with the company.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 As I have found (at [34]–[39] above), the 1st Defendant had a financial interest in the success of the SSI group, which was involved in numerous commercial transactions with the Plaintiff. This financial interest may have been sufficient for the 1st Defendant to come under an obligation to disclose the same to the Plaintiff and his failure to do so may constitute a breach of s 156(2) of the CA. However, this is a matter that pertains to the 1st Defendant’s potential liability for a criminal offence under s 156(15) of the CA. Unlike s 157, there is nothing within s 156 which imposes any statutory liability on the 1st Defendant for any profit made by him or damage suffered by the Plaintiff as a result of his breach of s 156(2) by failing to disclose his financial interest in the SSI group. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 In any event, there remains liability at common law for the breach of this duty of disclosure. However, in view of my conclusions on the other claims made by the Plaintiff, it will be duplicitous to consider in detail the remedies that follow from this breach. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Secret profit</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 The Plaintiff also submits that the 1st Defendant made a secret profit in a transaction involving the Plaintiff and one of its agents (“the kickback”).

The Plaintiff supplies Bombardier with kapton-covered wires. Sometime in 2010, Bombardier ceased to do business with the Plaintiff. The 1st Defendant then tasked Mr Huang to appoint an agent to recover the business with Bombardier and also expressed his ability to pay a commission to the agent who could successfully revive the business relationship between the Plaintiff and Bombardier. Subsequently, Mr Huang introduced one Mr Dai, who had a good relationship with the top management of Bombardier. Mr Dai then successfully assisted in regaining Bombardier as a customer for the Plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 In his cross-examination, Mr Huang explained that the Plaintiff’s normal policy is to pay a 5% commission to its agents. However, Mr Huang confirmed that in relation to Mr Dai, the 1st Defendant deviated from this policy. The 1st Defendant used his power, in his position as a director of the Plaintiff, to award 8% commission, envisioning that the additional 3%<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>was to be split between himself and Mr Huang.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 Mr Huang also testified that it is the normal practice in China for an agent to pay 20% of his commission to the government, presumably as tax on the commission earned. Thus, Mr Dai should have had to pay 1% of the commission fee (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 20% of the 5% commission) to the Chinese government and would be allowed to keep the remaining 4%. However, this was not what transpired. Despite only receiving 5% of the commission, Mr Dai had to pay 20% of the <span class="font-italic">actual</span> commission fee of 8% (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 1.6% of the commission fee) to the Chinese government. That being the case, Mr Dai could only keep 3.4%. Eventually, Mr Huang explained that he only collected 1.5% of the commission fee from Mr Dai for the 1st Defendant, but did not take his own share of 1.5%. This meant that Mr Dai was able to keep 4.9% of the commission fee (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 3.4% + 1.5%).

Specifically, counsel for the Defendants did not cross-examine Mr Huang in respect of the actual physical transfer of the envelope containing the kickback to the 1st Defendant. Rather, counsel for the Defendants put to Mr Huang that his sister had been involved in the entire arrangement and subsequently only contested the quantum of the kickback in the Defendants’ closing submissions. However, neither of these points go towards refuting the fact that the 1st Defendant received a kickback and was in effect personally and secretly profiting from the commission paid out to an agent by the Plaintiff. In my view, the 1st Defendant abused his position as a director and an officer of the Plaintiff to cause the Plaintiff to pay out a commission to its agent that was higher than the norm so as to secretly profit from that inflated commission via a kickback to himself. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 Even on the point of quantum, I have no reason to doubt Mr Huang’s testimony that the kickback was valued at RMB50,000 as this represented the 1.5% commission that he handed over to the 1st Defendant.

It is uncontroversial that a director cannot do so (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Industrial Development Consultants Ltd v Cooley</span> [1972] 1 WLR 443 and <span class="font-italic">Regal </span><span class="font-italic">(Hastings) Ltd v Gulliver</span> [1967] 2 AC 134 (“<span class="font-italic">Regal Hastings</span>”)). This “no profit” rule has been applied in Singapore in several High Court decisions such as <span class="font-italic">Higgins, </span><span class="font-italic">Danial Patrick v Mulacek, Philippe Emanuel and others and another suit </span>[2016] 5 SLR 848 (“<span class="font-italic">Higgins</span>”) at [96] and <span class="font-italic">Hytech</span><span class="font-italic"> Builders Pte Ltd v Tan Eng Leong</span> [1995] 1 SLR(R) 576 at [58]–[59]. It is irrelevant that the company itself could not have obtained that profit or no loss is caused to the company by the director’s gain of the profit (see <span class="font-italic">Higgins</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [96], citing <span class="font-italic">Regal Hastings</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at 144–145). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 For these reasons, I allow the Plaintiff’s claim against the 1st Defendant for an account of profits in respect of the kickback. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Dishonest assistance</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 Additionally, the Plaintiff submits that the 3rd Defendant is liable for dishonest assistance rendered in relation to the 1st Defendant’s breach of fiduciary duties.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 The following elements must be satisfied for a claim in dishonest assistance to succeed (see <span class="font-italic">George Raymond </span><span class="font-italic">Zage III v Ho Chi Kwong</span> [2010] 2 SLR 589 (“<span class="font-italic">George Raymond</span>”) at [20] for the analogous elements in relation to dishonest assistance rendered by a third party towards a breach of trust):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the presence of a fiduciary duty owed to the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) a breach of that duty; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) assistance rendered by the third party towards the breach; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) such assistance was rendered dishonestly. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 Since I have found that the 1st Defendant had breached his fiduciary duties owed to the Plaintiff, the first two elements are readily satisfied. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 In view of my finding in the Conspiracy Claim that the 3rd Defendant is a co-conspirator together with the rest of the defendants, I also have no hesitation in concluding that the 3rd Defendant (controlled by the 5th Defendant) had rendered assistance in relation to the 1st Defendant’s breach of fiduciary duties, specifically in relation to the abrupt termination of Faxolif’s services, the appointment of Wecorp, the SSI group, and Trinity Chemical (thereby facilitating the production of imitation goods), the rental of the warehouse space in China, the diversion of customers as well as the commissions paid to the SSI group. I am excluding the breach of fiduciary duty in relation to the kickback (see above at [95]–[102]) from this analysis as that appears to have been singlehandedly committed by the 1st Defendant without any assistance from the other defendants. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 On the final element of dishonesty, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">George Raymond </span>at [22] clarified that the standard of what constitutes honest conduct is an objective one, entailing an inquiry as to whether the defendant had “such knowledge of the irregular shortcomings of the transaction that ordinary honest people would consider it to be a breach of standards of honest conduct if he failed to adequately query them” (see also <span class="font-italic">Barlow </span><span class="font-italic">Clowes International Ltd (in liquidation v Eurotrust International Ltd</span> [2006] 1 All ER 377 at [15]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 I find that the 5th Defendant, who was a co-conspirator, undoubtedly had such dishonest knowledge when assisting the 1st Defendant as part of the conspiracy. He did not merely passively benefit from the conspiracy. He controlled the SSI group and actively engaged and dealt with the Plaintiff’s clients that had been transferred to the SSI group. Given that the 5th Defendant was the controlling director of the SSI group at the material time and thus the directing mind and will of these companies, his knowledge can be imputed to the three companies comprising the SSI group (see <span class="font-italic">Parakou</span><span class="font-italic"> Shipping Pte Ltd (in liquidation) v Liu Cheng Chan </span>[2017] SGHC 15 (“<span class="font-italic">Parakou</span><span class="font-italic"> Shipping</span>”) at [147], citing <span class="font-italic">Bilta</span><span class="font-italic"> (UK) Ltd (in liquidation) v Nazir (No 2) </span>[2015] 2 WLR 1168). Accordingly, I find that the 3rd Defendant’s assistance is dishonest. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 Given that all the elements for a claim in dishonest assistance are satisfied, I find that the 3rd Defendant is liable for dishonestly assisting the 1st Defendant in the breach of his directors’ duties to the Plaintiff.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Plaintiff’s Statement of Claim dated 19 January 2012 at para 31(c) and Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at para 183.  </div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 This claim raises the legal question as to whether an account of profits can be ordered as a remedy against a dishonest assistant, even where no corresponding loss has been suffered by the victim. Other than the decision of <span class="font-italic">Parakou</span><span class="font-italic"> Shipping</span> which tangentially discussed this issue at [189], there does not appear to be any local decision on this point to date. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 Thus examining the English position, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Novoship</span> <span class="font-italic">(UK) Limited v Yuri </span><span class="font-italic">Nikitin </span>[2015] 1 QB 499 (“<span class="font-italic">Novoship</span>”) decided this question in the affirmative at [93] and in so doing confirmed a string of first-instance authorities deciding likewise. Longmore LJ, writing for the court, gave several justifications for the position. First, the basic starting premise of the analysis is that “both a liability to make good a loss and a liability to account for profits ‘follow from the premise that the defendant is held liable to account as if he were truly a trustee to the claimant’” (at [75], citing John McGhee QC, <span class="font-italic">Snell’s Equity</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 32nd Ed, 2010) at para 30-079). Second, this position is supported by a series of English cases which equated, in principle, the responsibilities of a knowing recipient or dishonest assistant with that of an express trustee (at [82]). Third, permitting liability to account to follow from a claim in dishonest assistance, in an appropriate case, would ensure the prophylactic function of the equitable principles governing the liability of one who dishonestly assisted in a breach of fiduciary duty (at [76]–[77]). Fourth, the Court of Appeal observed at [84] that, since equity has long recognised the inadequacy of damages as the appropriate remedy in some situations,</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [w]here, as here, the equitable wrong is itself linked with a breach of fiduciary duty we see no reason why a court of equity should not be able to order the wrongdoer to <span class="font-italic">disgorge his profits in so far as they are derived from the wrongdoing.</span> </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 I am of the view that such logic should apply equally in Singapore. Although this issue has yet to arise squarely for consideration, both the Court of Appeal and High Court have observed that a dishonest assistant’s liability is as “a constructive trustee” (see <span class="font-italic">George Raymond </span>at [19] and [29] and <span class="font-italic">Parakou</span><span class="font-italic"> Shipping</span> at [188]). This observation dovetails with the starting premise identified by Longmore LJ in <span class="font-italic">Novoship</span>. I also agree that to distinguish between the nature of remedies that exist against a primary fiduciary in breach and a dishonest assistant who aided that breach would compromise the prophylactic nature of accessory liability.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 In any event, such alternative liability to account is not unduly harsh to the dishonest assistant as it is more restricted than the remedy of account available against a fiduciary, who is primarily liable. As is made clear in <span class="font-italic">Novoship</span>, unlike a fiduciary’s liability to account which “does not depend on any notion of causation” (at [96]), a dishonest assistant will only be liable to account for profits gained as a result of a “sufficiently direct causal link” to its assistance (at [120]). It is also discussed in <span class="font-italic">Novoship</span> at [119] that this remedy is not “automatic” as against the dishonest assistant: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">We consider that where a claim for an account of profits is made against one who is not a fiduciary, and does not owe fiduciary duties then, as Lord Nicholls said in <span class="font-italic">Blake</span>, the court has a discretion to grant or withhold the remedy. We therefore agree with Toulson J in <span class="font-italic">Fyffes</span> that the ordering of an account in a non-fiduciary case is not automatic. One ground on which the court may withhold the remedy is that an account of profits would be disproportionate in relation to the particular form and extent of wrongdoing …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 The 3rd Defendant profited in the form of commissions as well as from the diversion of the Plaintiff’s clients to it, effected by the 1st Defendant whilst he was a director of the Plaintiff. It is beyond doubt that these profits bear a sufficiently direct causal link with the 3rd Defendant’s misconduct in assisting the 1st Defendant to breach his fiduciary duties. In fact, the 3rd Defendant was one of the corporate vehicles through which the breaches of fiduciary duties were committed. I also see no reason to exercise my discretion to withhold the remedy of account of profits as against the 3rd Defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 I fully appreciate that there may be difficulties in delineating the precise contours of a dishonest assistant’s liability to account. For instance, whether the primary fiduciary in breach and the dishonest assistant share joint and several liability not only for the beneficiary’s loss but also for their gains (see, <span class="font-italic">e</span><span class="font-italic">g</span>, Pauline Ridge, “Justifying the Remedies for Dishonest Assistance” [2008] 124 LQR 445 at p 457). Nevertheless, I am of the view that these difficulties are not of a nature as to defeat the validity of the general rule. Although a claim in dishonest assistance is <span class="font-italic">usually</span> associated with joint and several liability in respect of the <span class="font-italic">losses</span> suffered by the plaintiff, it seems to me that in an appropriate case, the dishonest assistant should be made liable to account, at least in respect of the <span class="font-italic">profits</span> made by him. If such an alternative remedy were denied, it would allow the dishonest assistant to enjoy an unjustified windfall, particularly where the loss suffered by the victim is insignificant compared to the profits made by the dishonest assistant. Such a conclusion would be a perverse one as the dishonest assistant would stand to gain despite having acted dishonestly in rendering assistance to the fiduciary’s breach of his duty.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 Therefore, on the facts of this case, I find that the 3rd Defendant, as the dishonest assistant, is liable to account to the Plaintiff for profits it made pursuant to its dishonest assistance. However, as to the question of whether the 3rd Defendant is also jointly and severally liable for the 1st Defendant’s profits, I need not decide this question as the Plaintiff has not asked for the 3rd Defendant to be made so liable in respect of the 1st Defendant’s profits. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 I accordingly allow, in the alternative to its claim for losses, the Plaintiff’s claim against the 3rd Defendant for an account of profits. The Plaintiff is to elect between the two aforementioned remedies. For the avoidance of doubt, the 3rd Defendant is only liable to account for its own profits with no order made on any joint and several liability for any profits made by the 1st Defendant with the 3rd Defendant’s assistance. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 For the reasons mentioned above, I find that the Plaintiff’s Conspiracy Claim succeeds. Accordingly, I allow the Plaintiff’s claim for damages or account of profits against the Defendants arising from the Conspiracy Claim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 I find that the 1st Defendant is also in breach of his fiduciary duties owed to the Plaintiff and is thus liable to account for any profit made by him or for any damage suffered by the Plaintiff resulting from the breach of his fiduciary duties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 I also find that the 3rd Defendant dishonestly assisted the 1st Defendant in breaching his fiduciary duties. It is thus liable for any damages arising from such dishonest assistance. In the alternative, the 3rd Defendant is liable to account for any profit made by it in relation to its dishonest assistance. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 In addition, I also allow the Plaintiff’s claim against the 1st Defendant for an account of profits in relation to the kickback.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 I further order the assessment of damages and/or account of profits to be heard by the Registrar. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 I will hear the parties on costs if there is no agreement.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Chan Seng Onn<br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Godwin Gilbert Campos and Chan Qing Rui, Bryan (Godwin Campos LLC) for the Plaintiff;<br/>Gopalan Raman (KhattarWong LLP) for the Defendants.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
