The Mother renounced her rights to the probate and execution of the Will on 6 September 2022.

</div> On or around 23 September 2022, the application for grant of probate to Mr Tan as the sole executor was filed. Probate was extracted on 23 November 2022 and Mr Goh was informed on 30 November 2022. It was envisaged that there were two main assets in Singapore for distribution:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) 23 Thomson View; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the Father’s 36% shareholding in the Company.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 Interactions between the respective parties were initially cordial and uneventful. On or around 28 October 2022, however, Mr Goh wrote to the Malaysian solicitors to revoke all the documents he had previously signed in respect of the administration of the Father’s estate in Malaysia. Mr Goh alleged for the first time on 4 November 2022 that the Mother was “unable in her state of mind at the material time to consent to the documents”. At the end of the exchange, the Malaysian solicitors stated that they would withdraw the application for a grant of letters of administration over the Father’s estate in Malaysia. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 On 30 November 2022, Mr Tan wrote to the Goh Siblings about 23 Thomson View. He asked if any of the Goh Siblings would like to purchase the property, and if not, he would put the property up for sale. Mr Goh responded in two separate emails on 30 November 2022 and 1 December 2022. He contended that the Will did not provide any legal basis for Mr Tan’s proposal, and that it was premature to put the property up for sale while the Mother was still alive. Mr Goh mentioned in this email that the Mother was “medically incapable of giving her legal consent as it is difficult to ascertain whether [she] understands the issues …”. This appeared to be the first time Mr Goh raised an issue regarding the Mother’s mental capacity in the context of the Singapore assets and with Mr Tan. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 On 23 December 2022, Mr Tan emailed the Goh Siblings, proposing that the Company be voluntarily wound up. This was because, on 29 July 2022, a few days before the Father’s unexpected death from a heart attack, the Father had shared his plan to shut down the Company’s operations with Mr Tan.

The main issue raised by Mr Goh was that the Mother lacked mental capacity when she signed the Letter of Appointment, the Directors’ Resolution in Writing, and the Proxy Form. These documents had a bearing on Mr Tan’s authority to attend and vote at the board meeting that resolved that the Company be wound up as the alternate of the Mother and Mr Tan’s ability to vote on the special resolution at the EGM as the proxy of the Mother. During the hearing, Mr Goh also alleged fraud on the part of Mr Tan in procuring the special resolution and alleged that Mr Teh was complicit in Mr Tan’s “deceit”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 SUM 2196 sought orders for: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the assessment of the mental capacity of the Mother; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) to prohibit the respondents from using the assets of the Estate to fund their defence in these proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Both OA 637 and SUM 2196 were dismissed. The first prayer in SUM 2196 was related to the Mother’s mental capacity, and will be addressed in that context. The substantive decision in OA 637 had a bearing upon and should be dealt with before the second prayer in SUM 2196. I deal with that issue together with the last prayer in OA 637. These grounds of decision therefore explain my views on the relevant issues in the following sequence:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the validity of the resolutions to wind up the company and the appointment of Mr Teh as liquidator;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the mental capacity of the Mother;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the assertions as to fraud; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) indemnity and costs issues.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Validity of the resolutions </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Mr Goh asserted at the hearing that he had not signed a board resolution and was not present at the EGM where the disputed resolutions were passed.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 At the hearing, Mr Goh contended that the Directors’ Resolution in Writing, which appointed Mr Tan as the Mother’s alternate director, was defective as he did not sign it. The appointment was made pursuant to Art 84 of the constitution, which entitled any director to appoint an alternate “with the approval of the directors” and empowered the alternate to attend and vote at board meetings. The appointment of an alternate required written notice by the director making the appointment, which the Mother duly provided by way of the Letter of Appointment. Mr Goh’s signature was unnecessary as the Directors’ Resolution in Writing was passed pursuant to Art 92 of the Company’s constitution, which provided that “[a] resolution in writing signed by a majority of the Directors of the Company shall be as valid and effectual as if it had been passed at a Meeting of the Directors duly called and constituted”. The Directors’ Resolution in Writing was signed by the Mother and Ning, who together constituted a majority of the directors of the Company. Mr Goh’s signature was therefore unnecessary for the passing of the Directors’ Resolution in Writing, and Mr Tan was therefore validly appointed as the Mother’s alternate. As for the board’s decision to convene an EGM, this decision was reached at the board meeting on 25 April 2023. The quorum required under Art 85 of the Company’s constitution for the transaction of the business of the directors was two.

</div> As I have found, Mr Tan had previously been appointed by the Mother as her alternate director pursuant to the Letter of Appointment and Directors’ Resolution in Writing signed on 2 February 2023. Mr Tan (as the Mother’s alternative) and Ning were thus the two directors necessary to form a quorate board meeting. Mr Goh’s attendance at the board meeting was therefore unnecessary. Pursuant to Art 82 of the Company’s constitution, decisions at a board meeting were to be made by a simple majority of votes.

This presumption was explained by Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports at the Second Reading of the Mental Capacity Bill (Bill No 13/2008) with specific reference to the tendency of the mental capacity of patients to “wax and wane”. In particular, “[a patient] may be capable of making a decision on this specific topic today, but [the patient] may not be tomorrow, or [he/she] may recover the day after”: <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</span> (15 September 2008) vol 85 at col 153). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 In the specific context of dementia, the <span class="font-italic">Code of Practice: Mental Capacity Act 2008</span> (Office of the Public Guardian, 3rd Ed, 2023) (“<span class="font-italic">Code of Practice</span>”) lists some conditions that may cause a lack of capacity, including dementia and mental health problems, but emphasises that “it must not be assumed that a person who suffers from any of these conditions necessarily lacks mental capacity” (at [4.2]). [4.3.2] of the <span class="font-italic">Code of Practice </span>also<span class="font-italic"> </span>states that “[m]ental capacity must be assessed on a case-by-case basis and cannot be assumed based only on the person suffering from a particular medical condition.” </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The prayer in SUM 2196 for a medical examination of the Mother</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 In aid of his case in OA 637, Mr Goh prayed in SUM 2196 for an order to compel the Mother to undergo a medical assessment to determine her mental capacity: this was misconceived.

In Penang, when the Mother and Father moved there in 2019, Ning had arranged for the Mother to be under the care of Dr Irene Looi (“Dr Looi”) and Dr Ch’ng Swee Hock (“Dr Ch’ng”) at Loh Guan Lye Specialist Centre.

Dr Prem conducted another MoCA test, for which the Mother scored 27/30. A Mini-Mental State Examination was conducted in addition, where the Mother scored 28/30. He assessed that the Mother suffered mild cognitive impairment after taking into consideration her three-year history and the brain lesions that were visible from scanning, and stated that her family should put in place “early contingency plans in the event she experiences rapid cognitive decline later”.

</div> I disagree. Dr Prem, a consultant neuropsychiatrist, was qualified to opine on matters concerning mental capacity. That his examination of the Mother was completed for the purposes of a report was not a reason to doubt its soundness or his independence as a doctor. Dr Prem’s examination on 16 December 2022 and 16 February 2023 was the nearest in time to the Mother’s signing of the Letter of Appointment, Director’s Resolution in Writing, and Proxy Form. It was clear from his report that he had considered the Mother’s history and either conducted a scan of his own or used previous scans which reflected her brain lesions. There was therefore no reason to doubt the veracity of Dr Prem’s report.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Accordingly, the relevant evidence did not support Mr Goh’s assertion that the Mother lacked mental capacity when she signed the relevant documents.

</div> This was not relevant as the desire to wind up the Company had been expressed by the required three-fourths majority of shareholders.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 At the hearing, Mr Goh’s view was that Mr Tan had procured the special resolution fraudulently as Mr Tan had represented to Mr Goh and the Mother that the Father wished to wind-up the Company, when this was false.

</div> There was no evidence supporting Mr Goh’s assertion that it was untrue that the Father had expressed a wish to wind up the Company. Mr Goh made this oral assertion mainly because Mr Tan had used in his affidavit a WhatsApp message that the Father had sent Mr Goh, which the Father had later forwarded to Mr Tan. Mr Goh’s main point was that this was a private message between the Father and himself. Notwithstanding, it was the Father who had forwarded it to Mr Tan. I did not consider this relevant to an allegation of fraud. A further assertion was made that the Father had a mental condition arising from opioid withdrawal at the material time. There was no evidence of this. When I explained that an originating claim, rather than an originating application was more appropriate for dealing with allegations of fraud, Mr Goh declared that he was “happy to leave the police to deal with fraud. I am not going to spend my time in court on fraud”.

</div> In any event, the Father’s wish was not material to the validity of the special resolution, which was passed by the requisite majority vote of the shareholders of the Company. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 In relation to Mr Teh, Mr Goh alleged that Mr Teh was complicit in Mr Tan’s “deceit” by deliberately excluding Mr Goh from the decision-making process as regards the Company and that Mr Teh had lied that he did not know the Mother had been receiving treatment for dementia since 2013.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 There was nothing to suggest that Mr Teh had colluded with Mr Tan or Ning to “forcibly” wind up the Company despite knowing that the Mother allegedly suffered from a lack of mental capacity. The facts were to the contrary. First, Mr Teh wrote to the Mother’s neuropsychiatrist, Dr Prem, to satisfy himself that the Mother possessed the requisite mental capacity at the material time. Second, after satisfying himself that the Mother had the capacity to sign the Proxy Form, Mr Teh asked Mr Tan to confirm with Mr Tan’s lawyer that the Mother could appoint Mr Tan as her alternate director.

Mr Goh premised his submission on a claim that Mr Tan had breached his statutory duties under s 3A of the Trustees Act (“Trustees Act”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Section 3A of the Trustees Act relates to a trustee’s duty to use reasonable care and skill in respect of the exercise of “any power, carrying out any duty or doing any act referred to in the First Schedule”. The First Schedule of the Trustees Act in turn sets out an exhaustive list of acts in relation to: investment; acquisition of land; agents, nominees and custodians; compounding of liabilities; insurance; and reversionary interests, valuations and audits. It was not clear that Mr Tan’s exercise of his powers in taking steps to cause the Company to be wound up was an act listed in the First Schedule. Notwithstanding this, Mr Tan did not object to the application of s 3A of the Trustees Act. The more important point is that I have found no basis, in my analysis above, for Mr Goh’s assertions that Mr Tan had breached any duties to the Estate.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Regarding Mr Teh, the special resolution of 18 May provided that Mr Teh would be indemnified by the Estate as liquidator.  Mr Goh contended that this indemnity should not apply because Mr Teh had breached his fiduciary duties “by the very active part he had played to facilitate [Mr Tan’s] breach of trust in relation to the forcible winding-up of the Company”.

</div> I disagreed with this contention. The error in the title was a technical non-compliance that did not affect the substance of the application or cause Mr Teh any injustice.
