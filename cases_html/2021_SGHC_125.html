The regulatory authority, the Personal Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”), is empowered to, among other things, administer and enforce the PDPA. In addition, s 32 PDPA creates a right of private action. It gives any person who suffers “loss or damage”, as a result of contraventions of certain provisions in the PDPA, a right of action for relief in civil proceedings in a court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The references to the PDPA in these grounds of decision are to the PDPA as it stood in 2018 when the acts complained about took place. Amendments have been made to the PDPA since then.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">3 This was an appeal against the District Judge’s decision granting an injunction against the appellant, Mr Alex Bellingham (“Bellingham”), in civil proceedings commenced by IP Investment Management Pte Ltd (“IPIM”) and IP Real Estate Investments Pte Ltd (“IP Real Estate”) under s 32(1) PDPA. The respondent, Mr Michael Reed (“Reed”), was subsequently added as a plaintiff in those proceedings. As the scope of s 32(1) PDPA was being decided for the first time, Mr Liu Zhao Xiang Daniel (“Mr Liu”) was appointed as young <span class="font-italic">amicus curiae</span> to assist the Court in this appeal.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">4 I concluded that Reed did not have a right of private action under s 32(1) PDPA because he had not suffered any loss or damage within the meaning of that provision. Accordingly, I allowed the appeal and set aside the order made by the District Judge. </div><div class="txt-body text-justify">5 As the issue was decided for the first time, I subsequently granted Reed leave to appeal against my decision. Reed filed his appeal pursuant to the leave granted.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts </span></div><div class="txt-body text-justify">6 IPIM is a fund management business that creates real estate private equity funds.

He subsequently rose to the position of Director. On 1 March 2016, IP Real Estate seconded Bellingham to IPIM HK. Among other things, Bellingham’s role involved taking charge of and managing an investment fund known as the “Edinburgh Fund”.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">9 The Edinburgh Fund was an investment fund that was set up in 2015 by IPIM and IPIM HK to acquire, develop and manage a student property.

Before me, Bellingham conceded that he obtained Reed’s name in the course of his work with IPIM and/or IP Real Estate and that he was not entitled to use or disclose this data without Reed’s consent. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 As for Reed’s email address, Bellingham explained that he obtained the same from Reed’s LinkedIn account, which was a public source. It was not disputed that at the relevant time, Reed’s LinkedIn account did show his email address. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, I accepted Bellingham’s explanation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The collection, use or disclosure of personal data about an individual that is publicly available does not require the consent of the individual: s 17 read with the Second Schedule para 1(<span class="font-italic">c</span>), the Third Schedule para 1(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) and the Fourth Schedule para 1(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the PDPA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 However, Bellingham conceded that he would not have been able to find Reed’s email address without the use of Reed’s name. In my view, where personal data that is publicly available is obtained only through the unlawful use of other personal data, s 17(1) PDPA cannot apply and the personal data so obtained cannot be collected, used or disclosed without consent. In the present case, therefore, Bellingham was not entitled to collect, use or disclose Reed’s email address without his consent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 As for the fact that Reed had invested in the Edinburgh Fund, this information constituted personal data since it identified Reed. Bellingham claimed that the information was obtained through guesswork. I rejected Bellingham’s claim. I agreed with Reed that it was clear from Bellingham’s email dated 15 August 2018 (see [12] above) that Bellingham knew of Reed’s investment in the Edinburgh Fund; it was not just guesswork. Hence, Bellingham could not use or disclose the information without Reed’s consent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 In conclusion, Bellingham had contravened s 13 PDPA by:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) using Reed’s name to obtain his email address without his consent; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) obtaining Reed’s email address without his consent;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) using Reed’s name and email address to contact him without his consent; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) using the fact that Reed was an investor in the Edinburgh Fund, without his consent, to market QIP’s services to Reed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The use of Reed’s personal data for the above purposes exceeded what a reasonable person would have considered appropriate in the circumstances and thus also contravened s 18 PDPA.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">What is the scope of “loss or damage” under s 32(1) PDPA</span></div><div class="txt-body text-justify">40 The PDPA does not define “loss or damage”. It is not clear from the GD what the DJ’s interpretation of the term “loss or damage” was. Reed submitted that “loss or damage” under s 32(1) PDPA includes distress and loss of control over personal data. Bellingham contended that it does not. The scope of “loss or damage” is unclear. </div><div class="txt-body text-justify">41 Section 9A of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 2002 Rev Ed) mandates the purposive approach in the interpretation of a provision of a written law – an interpretation that would promote the purpose or object underlying the written law shall be preferred to an interpretation that would not promote that purpose or object.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">42 The purposive interpretation of a legislative provision involves three steps. The court must start by ascertaining the possible interpretations of the provision, having regard to the text of the provision as well as the context of the provision within the written law as a whole. The court must then ascertain the legislative purpose or object of the specific provision and the part of the statute in which the provision is situated. The court then compares the possible interpretations of the provision against the purpose of the relevant part of the statute. The interpretation which furthers the purpose of the written text is to be preferred to one which does not. See <span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock v Attorney-General</span> [2017] 2 SLR 850 (“<span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [54(b) and (c)]. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Possible interpretations of “loss or damage”</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The court ascertains the possible interpretations of the provision by determining the ordinary meaning of the words; this can be aided by rules and canons of construction: <span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock</span> at [38]. Section 32(1) PDPA is the only provision in the PDPA that refers to “loss or damage”. The question was whether the term “loss or damage” should be interpreted narrowly to refer to the heads of loss or damage under common law (pecuniary loss, damage to property, personal injury including psychiatric illness) or widely to include distress and loss of control over personal data. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 The text of s 32(1) PDPA and the context of the provision within the PDPA did not assist in ascertaining whether the term “loss or damage” should include or exclude <span class="font-italic">distress</span>. However, in my view, read in context, the term “loss or damage” excludes <span class="font-italic">loss of control over personal data</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Section 32 PDPA is found under Part VII of the PDPA which deals with the enforcement of Parts III to VI of the PDPA. Part VII of the PDPA also provides for enforcement by the Commission. Under s 29 PDPA, the Commission may give all or any of the following directions to ensure compliance with Parts III to VI of the PDPA:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) to stop collecting, using or disclosing personal data in contravention of the Act;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) to destroy all personal data collected in contravention of the Act;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) to comply with any direction of the Commissioner under s 28(2) (which deals with access to personal data); and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) to pay a financial penalty of such amount not exceeding $1m as the Commission thinks fit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The Commission’s power to give the above directions arises in <span class="font-italic">every</span> case of a contravention of any provision in Parts III to VI of the PDPA; there is no requirement that the data subject must have suffered any loss or damage. In contrast, s 32(1) PDPA requires “loss of damage” <span class="font-italic">in addition</span> to a contravention of any provision in Parts IV to VI of the PDPA. Clearly, looked at in context, the intent of s 32(1) PDPA is not to give the right of action in <span class="font-italic">every</span> case whenever there is a contravention of any provision in Parts IV to VI of the PDPA without more. Doing so would render the term “loss or damage” otiose.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In every case where there has been a contravention of any provision in Parts IV to VI, there would inevitably be loss of control over personal data. In my view, therefore, s 32(1) PDPA cannot have been intended to apply where the alleged loss or damage is simply a loss of control over personal data.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Ascertaining the legislative purpose</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 As “loss or damage” could be interpreted to either include or exclude distress, the next step was to ascertain the legislative purpose of s 32(1) PDPA. The purpose should ordinarily be gleaned from the text itself, before evaluating whether consideration of extraneous material is necessary: <span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock </span>at [54(c)(ii)]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Section 32(1) PDPA is described as a right of private action but I agreed with Mr Liu that it creates a statutory tort. This, too, is the view expressed in <span class="font-italic">Data Protection Law in Singapore</span> (Simon Chesterman ed) (Academy Publishing, 2nd Ed, 2018) at para 4.78. As explained in Gary Chan Kok Yew &amp; Lee Pey Woan, <span class="font-italic">The Law of Torts in Singapore </span>(Academy Publishing, 2nd Ed, 2016), an action for breach of statutory duty is also viewed as a tortious action (at paras 09.001–09.004). It can therefore be said that the specific purpose of s 32(1) is to create a statutory tort and to allow a right of action on that basis.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Moving on to considerations of extraneous material, the Court of Appeal in held in <span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock </span>that such considerations may only be had in three situations (at [54(c)(iii)]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) If the ordinary meaning of the provision is clear, extraneous material can only be used to confirm the ordinary meaning but not to alter it.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) If the provision is ambiguous or obscure on its face, extraneous material can be used to ascertain the meaning of the provision.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) If the ordinary meaning of the provision leads to a result that is manifestly absurd or unreasonable, extraneous material can be used to ascertain the meaning of the provision.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The parties and Mr Liu referred me to statements made in Parliament. On 13 August 2012, the Minister for Information, Communication and the Arts (“MICA”) explained in Parliament that the “development of a data protection law for Singapore was motivated by two key considerations – enhanced protection of consumers’ personal data against misuse, and the potential economic benefits for Singapore”.

</div>
</div> but no specific response was provided.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Clearly, the Minister’s statements in Parliament did not evince an intention that the PDPA should follow the positions adopted in the jurisdictions that were studied in every respect. Whilst the PDPA was intended to be in line with international standards for data protection, it was nevertheless developed to suit Singapore.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 In fact, as will be discussed in detail below, there were express references to some form of emotional harm (humiliation, loss of dignity, injury to feelings and distress) in the relevant legislative provisions in Canada, New Zealand, Hong Kong and the United Kingdom (“UK”). Cases in the UK had also interpreted the relevant provision in the European Union (“EU”) to include compensation for distress, and the relevant provision in UK to include compensation for distress and loss of control over personal data. Yet, Parliament decided to refer only to “loss or damage” in s 32(1) PDPA without <span class="font-italic">any</span> reference to any form of emotional harm or loss of control over personal data. In my view, Parliament’s intention was to exclude emotional harm and loss of control over personal data from s 32(1) PDPA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 There is good reason for not adopting the positions in Canada, New Zealand, Hong Kong, the EU and the UK, As Mr Liu pointed out, the positions in Canada, New Zealand, Hong Kong, the EU and the UK have been driven primarily by the need to recognise the right to privacy. The position in Singapore is different.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Canada is a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (189 UNTS 137) (“ICCPR”). Article 17(1) ICCPR provides that “[n]o one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, not to unlawful attacks on his honour and reputation”. Article 2(1) ICCPR requires each State Party to “ensure to all individuals … subject to its jurisdiction the rights recognized” in the ICCPR. Article 2(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) requires each State Party to the ICCR to ensure “an effective remedy” for persons whose rights under the ICCPR have been violated. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 In Canada, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, SC 2000, c 5 (Can) (“PIPEDA (Can)”) lays down standards for how organisations collect, use and disclose personal information in the course of commercial activity. The PIPEPDA (Can) also provides a civil claims framework (ss 14–16) in respect of contraventions of relevant provisions under it. The Canadian court may, pursuant to s 16(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) PIPEDA (Can), “award damages to the complainant, including damages for any humiliation that the complainant has suffered”. One of the factors considered in awarding such damages is the vindication of privacy rights: <span class="font-italic">Rabi </span><span class="font-italic">Chitrakar v Bell TV</span>, 2013 FC 1103 at [26]; <span class="font-italic">Nammo</span><span class="font-italic"> v TransUnion of Canada Inc </span>[2012] 3 FCR 600 at [72].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 New Zealand is also party to the ICCPR. The Human Rights Review Tribunal (the “HRR Tribunal”) was established under the Human Rights Act 1993 (NZ) to promote the protection of human rights in New Zealand in accordance with, among other things, the ICCPR. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 In New Zealand, under s 66(1) of the Privacy Act 1993 (NZ) (“PA (NZ)”), an action is an interference with the privacy of an individual <span class="font-italic">only if</span>, among other things, the action: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) has caused, or may cause, loss, detriment, damage, or injury to that individual;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) has adversely affected, or may adversely affect the rights, benefits, privileges, obligations, or interests of that individual; or</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) has resulted in, or may result in, significant humiliation, significant loss of dignity, or significant injury to the feelings of that individual.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Under s 83 of the PA (NZ), an aggrieved individual may bring proceedings before the HRR Tribunal for an interference with his privacy. Under s 88(1), the HRR Tribunal may award damages in respect of pecuniary loss and expenses reasonably incurred, loss of any benefit, and “humiliation, loss of dignity, and injury to the feelings of the aggrieved individual”. It can be seen that the remedies available under s 88(1) reflect the elements of an interference with privacy under s 66(1). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 In <span class="font-italic">Karen May Hammond v Credit Union </span><span class="font-italic">Baywide</span> [2015] NZHRRT 6, the HRR Tribunal noted (at [170.8]) that the “award of damages must be an appropriate response to adequately compensate the aggrieved individual for the humiliation, loss of dignity or injury to feelings he or she has suffered” and referred to Art 2(3) of the ICCPR, “which makes specific reference to a duty to provide ‘an effective remedy’ to persons whose rights (under the Covenant) have been violated”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Hong Kong enacted the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (Cap 486) (HK) (“PDPO (HK)”) to implement the protection of the right to privacy guaranteed under Art 17(1) ICCPR: Report of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China in the light of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, at paras 305–309.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 In Hong Kong, the PDPO (HK) provides for statutory control of the collection, holding and use of personal data in both the public and private sectors. Section 66 of the PDPO (HK) provides for compensation to an individual who suffers damage by reason of a contravention of a requirement under the PDPO (HK) and expressly provides that such damage “may be or include injury to feelings”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 As for the EU, at the time when the PDPA was passed in 2012, the applicable data protection law in the EU was Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (“Directive 95”). Article 1 of Directive 95 sets out the object of the directive and provided that “Member States shall protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons, and in particular their right to privacy with respect to the processing of personal data”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Article 23 of Directive 95 further required Member States to provide that “any person who has suffered damage as a result of an unlawful processing operation or of any act incompatible with the national provisions adopted pursuant to this Directive is entitled to receive compensation from the controller for the damage suffered”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 As the UK was a member of the EU then, it passed the Data Protection Act 1998 (c 29) (UK) (“DPA (UK)”) in compliance with its obligations under Directive 95. Section 13 DPA (UK) provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">13<span class="font-weight-bold"> Compensation for failure to comply with certain requirements</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(1) An individual who suffers damage by reason of any contravention by a data controller of any of the requirements of this Act is entitled to compensation from the data controller for that damage.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) An individual who suffers distress by reason of any contravention by a data controller of any of the requirements of this Act is entitled to compensation from the data controller for that distress if ––</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) the individual also suffers damage by reason of the contravention, or </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) the contravention relates to the processing of personal data for the special purposes.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Section 3 DPA (UK) defines “special purposes” in s 13(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) to refer to purposes of journalism, the arts or literature.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 In <span class="font-italic">Vidal-Hall and others v Google Inc (Information Commissioner intervening)</span> [2016] QB 1003 (“<span class="font-italic">Vidal-Hall</span>”), the English Court of Appeal held that damages could be awarded under s 13 DPA (UK) for distress even though the claimants had not suffered any pecuniary loss and the contravention of the DPA (UK) was not related to special purposes. In coming to this conclusion, the Court of Appeal reasoned that:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) since what Directive 95 purported to protect was privacy rather than economic rights, it would be strange if Directive 95 could not compensate those individuals whose data privacy had been invaded so as to cause them emotional distress (but not pecuniary damage) (at [77]);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Article 23 of Directive 95 did not distinguish between pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage; a restrictive interpretation would substantially undermine the objective of Directive 95, which was to protect the right to privacy of individuals with respect to the processing of their personal data (at [79]); </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) section 13(2) (which required damage in addition to distress) had not effectively transposed Article 23 into the PDA (UK) (at [84]) and could not be interpreted compatibly with Article 23 of Directive 95 (at [94]); and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) what was required in order to make s 13(2) compatible with EU law was the disapplication of s 13(2), leaving compensation to be recoverable under s 13(1) for <span class="font-italic">any</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>damage suffered (at [105]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 In <span class="font-italic">Lloyd v Google </span><span class="font-italic">llc </span>[2020] 2 WLR 484 (“<span class="font-italic">Lloyd</span>”), the English Court of Appeal went further than <span class="font-italic">Vidal-Hall </span>and held that damages could be awarded for loss of control over data under s 13 DPA (UK) without proof of pecuniary loss or distress. The Court of Appeal emphasised (at [44]) that the question as to the kind of damage that could be compensated under Art 23 of Directive 95 and s 13 DPA (UK) was an EU law question. An appeal against the Court of Appeal’s decision is currently awaiting the judgment of the Supreme Court of UK.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 It can be seen from the above that, as Mr Liu submitted, the positions taken in Canada, New Zealand, Hong Kong, the EU and the UK are primarily due to the recognition of the right to privacy under the ICCPR or Directive 95 and the need to comply with the ICCPR or Directive 95. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 I agreed with Mr Liu that the PDPA was not driven by a recognition of the need to protect an absolute or fundamental right to privacy. Although specific statutes deal with certain aspects of privacy, there is no discrete right to privacy that is protected under the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (1985 Rev Ed, 1999 Reprint) (the “Constitution”). The protection against deprivation of “life or personal liberty” save in accordance with law under Art 9(1) of the Constitution does not extend to the right to privacy: <span class="font-italic">Lim Meng </span><span class="font-italic">Suang and another v Attorney-General and another appeal and another matter </span>[2015] 1 SLR 26 at [44]–[49]. Singapore is not bound by the ICCPR or Directive 95. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 The purpose of the PDPA was as much to enhance Singapore’s competitiveness and to strengthen Singapore’s position as a trusted business hub as it was to safeguard individuals’ personal data against misuse (see [52] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Further, s 3 PDPA describes the purpose of the PDPA as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Purpose</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">3.</span> The purpose of this Act is to govern the collection, use and disclosure of personal data by organisations in a manner that recognises both the right of individuals to protect their personal data and the need of organisations to collect, use or disclose personal data for purposes that a reasonable person would consider appropriate in the circumstances.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 Section 3 PDPA shows that the PDPA takes a balanced approach and that it was not driven by any recognition of the right to privacy as a fundamental right. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Comparing the possible interpretations against the legislative purpose</span></div><div class="txt-body text-justify">76 The interpretation which furthers the purpose of the written text should be preferred to the interpretation which does not. As stated in [49] above, s 32(1) created a statutory tort. It seemed to me that interpreting the term “loss or damage” in s 32(1) PDPA narrowly to refer to the heads of loss or damage applicable to torts under common law (<span class="font-italic">eg</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>pecuniary loss, damage to property, personal injury including psychiatric illness) would further the specific purpose of s 32(1) PDPA as a statutory tort. There was nothing in the PDPA that indicated otherwise.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">77 That Parliament’s intention was for common law principles to apply in determining the scope of “loss or damage” under s 32(1) PDPA, is supported by Parliament’s expressed intention in respect of the Protection from Harassment Act (Cap 256A, 2015 Rev Ed) (“POHA”). Section 11 POHA provides that the victim of harassment may bring civil proceedings in a court against the respondent and the court may award “such damages … as the court may, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, think just and equitable”. In answer to questions raised in Parliament as to whether damages for emotional distress will be available under the civil remedies provision, the Minister for Law said that the issue of damages would be left to the courts to decide by applying <span class="font-italic">common law principles</span>.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> It seemed to me that it would be strange that Parliament would have had a different intention with respect to the PDPA when it had decided not to make any express reference to distress or loss of control over personal data in s 32(1) PDPA.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">78 In addition, the narrow interpretation of “loss or damage” would also further the intention ascertained from a consideration of the extraneous material, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that Parliament’s intention was to exclude emotional harm and loss of control over personal data from s 32(1) PDPA (see [56] above).</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">79 Finally, the intention ascertained from a consideration of the extraneous material also confirmed the interpretation that “loss or damage” in s 32(1) PDPA excludes loss of control over personal data.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">80 Reed submitted that since MICA had studied the data protection frameworks in Canada, New Zealand, Hong Kong and the EU (of which the UK was then a member), to develop the most suitable model for Singapore, the authorities from these jurisdictions were relevant in the interpretation of “loss or damage” in s 32(1) PDPA. I disagreed with Reed for the reasons set out earlier in [56]–[75].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 Reed also relied specifically on <span class="font-italic">Lloyd</span> for his submission that loss of control over personal data is sufficient to constitute damage for purposes of s 32(1) PDPA. As discussed earlier, <span class="font-italic">Lloyd </span>involved s 13 DPA (UK). The English Court of Appeal gave a more liberal interpretation to “damage” under the DPA (UK) because of the explicit recognition of the right to privacy in Directive 95, having noted (at [44]) that it was “answering an EU law question”. <span class="font-italic">Lloyd</span> has to be understood in this context. The position in Singapore is different; there is no general right to privacy under Singapore law as explained above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 In addition, I was of the view that <span class="font-italic">Lloyd </span>should not be followed in Singapore in any event. The High Court in <span class="font-italic">Lloyd</span> found that the pleaded case (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>that loss of control over personal data constituted compensatable damage) was circular because it asserted that the commission of the tort had caused compensatable damage, consisting of the commission of the tort (<span class="font-italic">Lloyd </span>at [29]). The Court of Appeal disagreed that it was circular (at [45]) but, in my respectful view, did not explain why it was not circular. I found the High Court’s decision in this respect to be more persuasive. The High Court had also noted that there was no European authority that the pleaded types of loss constituted damage within Art 23 of Directive 95 (<span class="font-italic">Lloyd </span>at [30]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Decision in My Digital Lock Pte Ltd</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 In support of his position, Reed also relied on certain views expressed by the Deputy Commissioner for Personal Data Protection in <span class="font-italic">My Digital Lock Pte Ltd </span>[2018] SGPDPC 3 (“<span class="font-italic">My Digital Lock</span>”), concerning <span class="font-italic">Jones v Tsige </span>(2012) ONCA 32 (“<span class="font-italic">Tsige</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">Kaye v Robertson</span> [1991] IPR 147 (“<span class="font-italic">Kaye</span>”).

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 <span class="font-italic">Tsige</span> was a decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal. There, the defendant was in a relationship with the claimant’s former husband. The defendant worked in the same bank as the claimant and used her workplace computer to gain access to the claimant’s private banking records, at least 174 times over a period of four years, for the alleged<span class="font-italic"> </span>purpose of confirming whether the claimant’s former husband was paying child support. The defendant did not publish, distribute or record the information in any way. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 The Ontario Court of Appeal held that a right of action for intrusion upon seclusion should be recognised in Ontario. The court was of the view that jurisprudence under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms recognised (a) privacy as being worthy of constitutional protection (at [39]), and (b) three distinct privacy interests – personal privacy, territorial privacy and informational privacy (at [41]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 <span class="font-italic">Kaye </span>was an English case that was decided before the DPA (UK) was enacted. There, journalists and a photographer intruded into the hospital room of a well-known actor, interviewing him and taking photographs of him. The English Court of Appeal acknowledged (at p150) that there was no right to privacy in English law and accordingly there was no right of action for breach of a person’s privacy. However, the court granted injunctive relief on the basis of the tort of malicious falsehood. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 In <span class="font-italic">My Digital Lock</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the Deputy Commissioner expressed the view (at [33]) that the facts in <span class="font-italic">Tsige</span> and <span class="font-italic">Kaye</span> could give rise to breaches under the PDPA, and that these breaches could be enforced as private actions under s 32 PDPA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 With respect, I did not find <span class="font-italic">My Digital Lock</span> helpful in determining the scope of “loss or damage” in s 32(1) PDPA. The Deputy Commissioner gave his view in passing and, apart from emphasising that the right of private action under the PDPA protects informational privacy, did not analyse the scope of “loss or damage” or give any explanation as to what the “loss or damage” in <span class="font-italic">Tsige </span>or <span class="font-italic">Kaye</span> was that would have satisfied s 32 PDPA. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether Reed suffered loss or damage directly as a result of Bellingham’s contraventions of ss 13 and 18 PDPA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 It was indisputable that Reed had to prove that he suffered loss or damage within the meaning of s 32(1) PDPA. It was not clear from the GD what was the loss or damage that the DJ found Reed to have suffered. The DJ noted that Bellingham’s counsel did not contend that Reed should be denied relief because he had suffered no loss (GD at [140]). However, as Bellingham pointed out, the DJ’s observation was at odds with another statement in the GD (at [115]), which acknowledged that Bellingham had submitted that the plaintiffs in OSS 170 (which would have included Reed) had not established that they had suffered loss or damage. That said, this was not an issue before me and the hearing of the appeal proceeded on the basis that there was nothing to stop Bellingham from arguing before me that Reed had suffered no loss or damage.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">90 It was not disputed that Reed had not suffered any financial loss, psychiatric injury or nervous shock as a result of Bellingham’s contraventions of ss 13 and 18 PDPA. Before me, Reed submitted that he suffered emotional distress and loss of control over his personal data directly as a result of Bellingham’s contraventions of ss 13 and 18 PDPA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 I agreed with Bellingham that there was no evidence that Reed suffered distress. Reed’s affidavits did not show evidence of any distress. As for loss of control over personal data, Reed’s emails showed that he was concerned over the security of his personal data and Bellingham’s misuse of that data (see [13], [14] and [18] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 In any event, for reasons set out earlier, Reed’s distress and loss of control over personal data did not constitute “loss or damage” within the meaning of s 32(1) PDPA. Reed therefore had not shown that he had suffered “loss or damage” such as to give rise to a right of action under s 32(1) PDPA. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 For the above reasons, I concluded that the term “loss or damage” in s 32(1) PDPA is limited to the heads of loss or damage under common law, and does not include distress or loss of control over personal data. I therefore allowed the appeal and set aside the orders made by the DJ. I ordered Reed to pay Bellingham costs of the appeal fixed at $10,000 and costs of the hearing below fixed at $4,000, plus disbursements to be fixed by me if not agreed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 Although Reed had no right of private action under s 32 PDPA, he was not without remedy. As mentioned earlier, Bellingham’s obligations under the PDPA in respect of Reed’s personal data can be enforced by the Commission. The Commission’s powers under s 29 PDPA include, among others, giving directions to (a) stop collecting, using or disclosing personal data in contravention of the Act, and/or (b) destroy all personal data collected in contravention of the Act. The exercise of these powers would have achieved the same objective as the injunction order sought by Reed in this case. The Commission is not empowered to award damages but Reed was not seeking damages in any event. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 I would also like to place on record my appreciation for the assistance given to this court by Mr Liu and the counsel for Reed and Bellingham.</div><div class="txt-body text-left"> <span class="font-weight-bold"> Application for leave to appeal</span></div><div class="txt-body text-justify">96 Reed subsequently sought leave to appeal against my decision allowing Bellingham’s appeal. It is well established that leave to appeal may be granted if there is (a) a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case of error, (b) a question of general principle decided for the first time, and (c) a question of importance upon which further argument and a decision of a higher tribunal would be to the public advantage: <span class="font-italic">Lee </span><span class="font-italic">Kuan Yew v Tang Liang Hong and another</span> [1997] 2 SLR(R) 862 at [16]. Whilst these three grounds are not exhaustive, they are usually the grounds relied upon by an applicant seeking leave to appeal.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">97 In the present case, Reed’s application for leave to appeal was based on all three grounds. Bellingham agreed that the present case involves a question of general principle decided for the first time, and that the question is one of importance upon which a decision of the Court of Appeal would be to the public advantage. I agreed that these two grounds were satisfied and I granted leave on these two grounds.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">98 As for the ground of <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case of error, Reed relied on <span class="font-italic">Essar Steel Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Bayerische Landesbank and others </span>[2004] 3 SLR(R) 25 (“<span class="font-italic">Essar Steel</span>”) for the proposition that the error may be one of fact or of law. In <span class="font-italic">Abdul Rahman bin Shariff v Abdul Salim bin Syed </span>[1999] 3 SLR(R) 138 (“<span class="font-italic">Abdul Rahman</span>”), the High Court held (at [30]–[32]) that the error must be one of law because if facts have to be examined in detail to demonstrate the error, the court hearing the leave application might as well hear the appeal proper. </div><div class="txt-body text-justify">99 The High Court in <span class="font-italic">Essar Steel </span>acknowledged the concern expressed in <span class="font-italic">Abdul Rahman</span> and decided that an error of fact can be relied on to seek leave to appeal if it has been demonstrated that the error of fact is clear beyond reasonable argument and has contributed or led to a judgment. </div><div class="txt-body text-justify">100 I respectfully agree with <span class="font-italic">Essar Steel</span>. Leave to appeal ought to be granted if it is shown that a decision has been made in error, be it an error of fact or of law. However, bearing in mind the concern expressed in <span class="font-italic">Abdul Rahman</span>, an error of fact must be one that is clear beyond reasonable argument (<span class="font-italic">Essar Steel </span>at [26]); the court should not have to delve into the facts in detail.<span class="font-italic"> </span>An applicant for leave to appeal who alleges a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>error must demonstrate something more than just his disagreement with the decision. Otherwise, this ground would be satisfied in <span class="font-italic">every</span> case in which leave to appeal is sought. As for error of law, an applicant seeking leave to appeal on the ground of <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>error of law must show something more than just disagreement with the court’s decision on the law. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 Most of the time, the applicant who relies on the ground of <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>error shows nothing more than that he disagrees with the court’s decision. In my view, this cannot be sufficient to show a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case of error to warrant the grant of leave. </div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Chua Lee Ming<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Ong Ziying Clement and Khoo Shufen Joni (Damodara Ong LLC) for the appellant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Tay Yong Seng, Yap Wei-Ming Alexander, Ang Ann Liang (Hong Anliang) and Alyssa Png (Allen &amp; Gledhill LLP) for the respondent; </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Liu Zhao Xiang Daniel (WongPartnership LLP) as young <span class="font-italic">amicus</span><span class="font-italic"> curiae</span>.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
