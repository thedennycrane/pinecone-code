<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an appeal by the Prosecution against
                    sentence. The respondent, a 35-year-old police officer holding the rank of
                    Sergeant, claimed trial to five charges under s 6(<em>b</em>) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241,
                    1993 Rev Ed) (“the Act”). Four of these charges were for
                    corruptly giving gratification to four of his fellow police officers as
                    inducement for forbearing to report him to his supervisor for misappropriating a
                    wallet containing a stack of $50 notes and a carton of cigarettes which were
                    found during an unscheduled raid. The remaining charge was for corruptly
                    offering gratification to another fellow police officer for the same
                    purpose.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The punishment prescribed for an offence of
                    corruptly offering or giving gratification under s 6(<em>b</em>) of the Act is imprisonment of a term of up to five years, or
                    a fine up to $100,000, or both. The appellant has no criminal
                    antecedents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       A District Judge (“DJ”) found that
                    the Prosecution had proved its case against the respondent beyond reasonable
                    doubt on the five charges. Accordingly, she convicted and sentenced the
                    respondent to three months’ imprisonment for each of the five charges,
                    with the sentences for two charges ordered to run consecutively, making a total
                    sentence of six months’ imprisonment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       I allowed the Prosecution’s appeal and
                    enhanced the sentence for each of the five charges before me to six months
                        <em>per charge</em>, with the imprisonment sentences
                    for three of the charges to run consecutively to give an aggregate sentence of
                    18 months’ imprisonment. These are my detailed grounds of decision that
                    explain why I allowed the Prosecution’s appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Factual background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The detailed facts of this case have already
                    been comprehensively set out by the DJ in her grounds of decision at <em>Public Prosecutor v Tay Sheo Tang Elvilin (Zheng Shaodong,
                        Elvilin)</em> [2011] SGDC 27. I will therefore set out only the
                    salient facts which are necessary for an understanding of the context of the
                    present appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The respondent initiated an unscheduled raid on
                    24 January 2009 to arrest illegal immigrants in the forested area near the
                    Seletar Range (“the forested area”). During this raid, which
                    involved three other officers, a number of makeshift huts were found. Upon
                    searching the huts, the respondent found a carton of contraband cigarettes and a
                    wallet containing a stack of $50 notes. He removed the money, and threw the
                    wallet into the bushes. Upon leaving the scene, he also took the carton of
                    cigarettes with him. Only one police officer, Woman Sergeant Norhasidah binte
                    Mohamed Said (“WSgt Norhasidah”), knew that the respondent had
                    found and misappropriated the two items. The respondent instructed WSgt
                    Norhasidah to lodge the arrest report for an illegal immigrant arrested in this
                    raid “as per normal”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> –
                    her eventual report stated that the arrest had taken place along Upper Thompson
                    Road, and not in the forested area. It also did not mention the items which were
                    misappropriated by the respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       That afternoon, the respondent took out some
                    packets of cigarettes at the Neighbourhood Police Post (“NPP”)
                    rest area in the presence of three other officers. He told them that he had
                    found these contraband cigarettes in the forested area and intended to give them
                    to another officer as a present. The respondent then offered Staff Sergeant
                    Zulkifli bin Mohamad (“SSgt Zulkifli”), who was his group
                    leader and an officer of superior rank, $50 in exchange for his silence about
                    the respondent’s actions, but the respondent was rebuffed. The respondent
                    then gave $50 to the two other officers present and told them not to disclose to
                    anyone what had transpired in the forested area.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       When the respondent met WSgt Norhasidah
                    later, he also gave her $50 and told her not to reveal what had happened in the
                    forested area. He also gave her another $50 to hand to another officer involved
                    in the raid, stating that this was to keep him quiet. WSgt Norhasidah later
                    handed the money to that officer. These four gifts and one offer of $50 were the
                    subject of the five charges of corruption which the respondent was convicted
                    on.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The DJ’s decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The DJ rightly acknowledged that the aggravating
                    factors in this case were serious and that there were substantial and compelling
                    circumstances that justified the imposition of a deterrent sentence here,
                    especially since the respondent’s behaviour resulted in the corruption of
                    four fellow officers and compromised their police duties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Nevertheless, she felt that the facts of this
                    case were distinguishable from the precedent cases where sentences of nine
                    months and above had been imposed. She observed that the sentences of nine
                    months’ imprisonment and upwards were often imposed in cases which
                    involved more serious corrupt conduct on the part of the police officers as
                    compared to the corrupt conduct in this case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Here, the respondent’s corrupt conduct
                    did not involve solicitation of gratification from members of public, and
                    therefore did not publicly undermine the integrity of the police force. The
                    respondent also did not compromise any police investigations or operations.
                    Further, while the respondent was mainly motivated by greed when he corrupted
                    the four junior officers, his conduct was not as serious as the conduct of those
                    officers who blatantly and deliberately assisted illegal moneylenders, importers
                    of uncustomed goods or owners of massage establishments in escaping criminal
                    liability.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Hence, the DJ sentenced the respondent to
                    three months’ imprisonment on each of the five charges, with two charges
                    ordered to run consecutively, making a total sentence of six months’
                    imprisonment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Prosecution’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The Prosecution forcefully contended that the
                    DJ had erred in her approach. In particular, the Prosecution submitted that the
                    DJ had failed to accord due weight to the aggravating factors surrounding the
                    commission of the offences (despite correctly identifying them), and this
                    resulted in her finding that the present case was not as serious as the
                    precedent cases and in her failure to appreciate the serious adverse impact of
                    the appellant’s corrupt acts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     My attention was also drawn to the cases of
                        <em>Lim Poh Tee v Public Prosecutor</em> [2001] 1
                    SLR(R) 241 (“<em>Lim Poh Tee</em>”), where
                    the fact that a police officer drew two junior officers into a web of corruption
                    was regarded by the Court as being highly aggravating, and <em>Pandiyan Thanaraju Rogers v Public Prosecutor</em> [2001] 2 SLR(R)
                    217 (“<em>Pandiyan Thanaraju Rogers</em>”),
                    where a police officer accepted $2,000 as a bribe from a moneylender in exchange
                    for future help in police matters. In <em>Pandiyan Thanaraju
                        Rogers</em>, Yong Pung How CJ observed at [49] that in recent
                    cases, the sentences meted out to police officers convicted of corruption have
                    ranged from nine months and upwards, before dismissing the police
                    officer’s appeal against sentence and enhancing the sentence to nine
                    months’ imprisonment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     While acknowledging that the benchmark for
                    members of the public offering bribes to police officers is between six
                    weeks’ to three months’ imprisonment, the Prosecution submitted that
                    the present case should be distinguished as the respondent himself was the
                    offender in question, and was a police officer of some seniority, holding the
                    rank of Sergeant. The Prosecution submitted that the sentence should be enhanced
                    to nine months’ imprisonment per charge, and that three sentences should
                    run consecutively as general deterrence is the most important consideration for
                    such offences.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In response, the respondent, who was
                    unrepresented, pleaded that he had been adequately punished and the amounts
                    involved were small.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Court’s decision on sentence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     I agreed with the Prosecution that the DJ had
                    failed to accord due weight to the aggravating factors surrounding the
                    commission of the offences, which were:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_a"></a>(a)     the offences involved a serious
                        abuse of position and betrayal of public trust by a police officer who had
                        committed criminal misappropriation of property during a police raid when he
                        was expected to uphold the law with integrity;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_b"></a>(b)     the respondent perverted the course of justice
                        when he went a step further to instigate his fellow police officers to act
                        contrary to their enforcement duties by offering them bribes so that they
                        would conceal the crime he had committed. I also note that the respondent
                        had sufficient time, from the time he found the items in the forested area
                        in the morning of 24 January 2009 until he showed the cigarettes to his
                        fellow police officers at the NPP rest area in the afternoon of the same
                        day, to report the items he found in accordance with proper police
                        procedure, but he made a conscious decision not to do so;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_c"></a>(c)     the respondent initiated and organised
                        the unscheduled raid, and decided to misappropriate the items found in the
                        raid instead of reporting the exhibits in accordance with police
                        procedure;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_d"></a>(d)     the
                        respondent preyed on the vulnerability of the illegal immigrants as he would
                        be aware, as a police officer, that it would be very difficult for them to
                        prove that the items had been wrongfully removed from their makeshift huts.
                        Moreover, given their status as illegal immigrants, they were also unlikely
                        to report the loss of the items to the authorities and thereby expose his
                        misconduct; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_e"></a>(e)     the respondent was brazen in distributing his ill-gotten proceeds and
                        enticing his fellow police officers with bribes in the very place where the
                        sanctity of the law is supposed to be upheld – a police
                        station.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     More importantly, the DJ erred in finding that
                    the present case was distinguishable from the precedent cases where sentences of
                    nine months and above had been imposed because the offence in question here was
                    of a less serious nature.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In <em>Public Prosecutor v
                        Loqmanul Hakim bin Buang</em> [2007] 4 SLR(R) 753
                        (“<em>Loqmanul Hakim bin Buang</em>”), I
                    observed at [43] and [76] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">43    … Public confidence in the enforcement
                            agencies can be corroded by the irresponsible criminal acts of
                            avaricious, reckless and foolish like offenders. <b><em>The
                                abuse of the trust and confidence placed in CISCO and/or police

                                in general, having diminished legitimacy and public
                                acceptance</em></b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">76    As the guardians and enforcers of the law, law

                            are expected to conduct themselves in a befitting manner that would
                            uphold their legitimacy to enforce such laws. It should be intuitively
                            commonsensical that the members of the police force and auxiliary police
                            force must be seen to <em>obey</em> the law
                            themselves if they are to possess any legitimacy in <em>upholding</em> it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original, emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Although the respondent’s corrupt
                    conduct did not involve solicitation of gratification from members of public,
                    this did not mean the integrity of the police force was not being seriously
                    undermined. Corruption within the police force is no less serious than
                    corruption involving the solicitation of gratification by a police officer from
                    members of the public, and both have the effect of publicly undermining the
                    integrity of the police force. Indeed, if anything, it is even more disturbing.
                    If police officers such as the respondent who engage in corrupt activities
                    within the police force itself to cover up their wrongdoings are left unchecked,
                    the abuse of trust and confidence placed in the police force could, as pointed
                    out in <em>Loqmanul Hakim bin Buang</em>, result in
                    enforcement agencies, in general, having diminished legitimacy and public
                    acceptance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The DJ erred in concluding that because the
                    respondent did not compromise any police investigations or operations or
                    interfere with the proper administration of justice, his conduct was less
                    odious. Here, the respondent had blatantly instigated his fellow police officers
                    to commit several breaches of police procedure and to compromise their duties in
                    the course of police operations. For example, not only did the respondent
                    instruct WSgt Norhasidah to lodge an inaccurate record of the raid, he also
                    made repeated attempts to offer a bribe to his group leader and superior
                    officer, SSgt Zulkifli, so that the latter would “keep quiet”
                    about the respondent’s illegal actions. It was unfortunate that the
                    respondent eventually succeeded in bribing some of his fellow police officers so
                    that they would remain silent about his reprehensible actions. <em>Such corrupt conduct by a police officer must be unequivocally
                        denounced as it will have an adverse effect on the discipline of the police
                        force and the proper administration of justice</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     I also disagreed with the DJ’s finding
                    that the respondent’s conduct was not as serious as the conduct of those
                    officers in the precedent cases who flagrantly assisted illegal moneylenders,
                    importers of uncustomed goods or owners of massage establishments to escape
                    criminal liability. The very purpose of the respondent’s actions in
                    bribing his fellow police officers was to facilitate and conceal his own
                    criminal act of misappropriating the items found in the raid. <em>More importantly, the serious adverse impact of the respondent’s
                        conduct in drawing his fellow police officers into this “web of
                        corruption” cannot be underestimated</em>. With the exception
                    of SSgt Zulkifli, all the other police officers were junior in rank to the
                    respondent; indeed, one of the police officers was a young policeman serving his
                    national service at the material time. Instead of setting a good example to
                    these junior officers, the respondent cloaked his corrupt behaviour with a veil
                    of normalcy and acceptability by intimating that wrongdoing in the police force
                    could be tolerated. The respondent informed them that such conduct could be
                    concealed because “if everyone keeps quiet then nothing will
                        happen”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> I agreed with the Prosecution
                    that the deplorable attitude and conduct displayed by the respondent must be
                    unequivocally denounced and nipped in the bud. Condign punishment was
                    required.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     
          <em>Lim Poh Tee</em> made
                    it clear that stiff sentences will be imposed when police officers draw fellow
                    officers into a web of corruption within the police force. In that case, the
                    Court observed, <em>inter alia</em>, that it was
                    “highly reprehensible” and an aggravating factor that the police
                    officer intentionally drew two junior officers into the web of corruption and
                    accordingly rendered more police officers beholden to the corrupt gratification
                    given by one Chua Tiong Tiong, a notorious illegal moneylender (at <a href="#p1_31">[31]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Here, as in <em>Lim Poh
                        Tee</em>, not only did the respondent misappropriate the money and
                    cigarettes while on duty as a police officer, he took the further step of
                    corrupting the junior officers in his team who would have regarded him as a role
                    model and for guidance. It was precisely because the junior officers looked up
                    to him that all of them complied with his instructions to keep quiet about what
                    had happened at the forested area in breach of their solemn duties as police
                    officers. If not for an unnamed informant who stepped up to do the right thing,
                        <em>ie</em>, report the respondent’s actions to
                    the Corrupt Practices Investigations Bureau, the respondent’s corrupt
                    actions may not have seen the light of the day. A sentencing court should bear
                    in mind that offences of this nature that are often hard to detect and that is a
                    factor which must factor in the sentencing equation (<em>see
                        Public Prosecutor v Law Aik Meng</em> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 814 at [27]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     I note with interest that the approach adopted
                    here is not dissimilar to that taken in other jurisdictions. They usually come
                    down hard on corruption in law enforcement agencies such as the police
                    force.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In <em>R. v Mark Edward
                        Bohannan</em> [2010] EWCA Crim 2261, where a police officer provided
                    assistance to a drug-dealer in his drug-dealing activities in return for a free
                    supply of cocaine for the consumption of the officer’s wife and also cash
                    payments, the English Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) declared at [64]
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">First, punishment and deterrence are always important elements …
                        <em>not only must police officers be deterred from
                            misconduct, but also the public must see that condign punishment will be
                            visited on police officers who betray the trust reposed in them and do
                            not live up to the high standards of the police service</em>.
                        Secondly, <em>an incentive (usually money but it need not be)
                            inevitably increases the seriousness of the offence</em>. Third,
                        misconduct, which encourages or permits criminals to behave in the belief
                        that they will be kept informed of areas to avoid in connection with their
                        criminal activities, or of those who might be informing on the police also
                        increases its gravity … Fourth, any misconduct that impacts on police
                        operations moves the offence into a different category of gravity. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In <em>Director of Public
                        Prosecutions v Mark Armstrong</em> [2007] VSCA 34, a police officer
                    engaged in corrupt behaviour in dealing with criminals by extorting money from
                    them in return for the police officer’s silence about their criminal
                    activities. In enhancing the sentence meted out to the police officer, the Court
                    of Appeal of the Supreme Court of Victoria held at [34]–[35] that;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">34    Corruption in those responsible for enforcing the
                            law has significant social consequences. As was discussed by the learned
                            sentencing judge, <em>it may undermine public confidence
                                in the police force, erode the morale of honest police officers and
                                encourage other police to turn a blind eye to similar behaviour. The
                                community is entitled to rely on the integrity of members of the
                                police force in investigating and prosecuting offenders</em>.
                            Mr Armstrong's moral culpability is not reduced because, as counsel
                            for the respondent put it, Mr On and Mr Coombes were not
                            “lily whites” themselves.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">35    The temptation to extort money or abuse power is
                            likely to be considerable when police are dealing with offenders who are
                            reluctant to complain about corruption, because this will reveal that
                            they themselves had committed offences. For this reason corrupt
                            practices in dealing with criminals may be even more insidious than the
                            corruption which affects honest members of the community, who are more
                            likely to report police attempts to extort money from them. <em>Sentences imposed for such offences must reflect public
                                denunciation of the behaviour of the offender and deter other police
                                from committing similar offences. General deterrence must therefore
                                be given significant weight in sentencing a member of the police
                                force for offences involving corruption or
                            extortion</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     A similarly stiff approach was also adopted by
                    the Hong Kong Court of Appeal in <em>HKSAR v Lau Kwowk &amp;
                        others</em> [2003] HKEC 674. In that case, two police officers
                    participated in an elaborate and well-planned scheme to help several suspects in
                    a wounding case avoid conviction in return for cash payments for their
                    “efforts”. In dismissing the police officers’ appeal against
                    their sentences of four years’ imprisonment respectively, the Court held
                    at [35]–[36] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">35.    A1 and A2 were both police officers. A2 was the
                            investigating officer in the wounding case. Instead of carrying out
                            their duties properly, they chose to assist suspects to escape justice
                            for monetary rewards. What they did had the result of allowing criminals
                            in a wounding case to go unpunished. <em>What A1 and A2
                                did is despicable. It is an affront to the rule of law and the
                                administration of justice. It must be
                        deterred</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">36.    With respect, the judge was fully justified in
                            imposing heavier sentence on A1 and A2.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Court concluded with the important observation at [50]
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">50.    Integrity of law enforcement officers is the
                            linchpin of the proper administration of justice and the corner stone of
                            a just and fair society. <em>Law enforcement officers who
                                abuse their positions and conspire to defeat the end of justice must
                                be punished severely or else the confidence of the public cannot be
                                maintained</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     In light of the above considerations, it was
                    clear that the actions of the respondent were at the very least as serious as
                    the precedent cases involving the corruption of police officers even though the
                    amounts involved were small. <em>I was satisfied that a stiff
                        custodial sentence was necessary in the present case so as to send a clear
                        message to other serving officers that such transgressions will not be
                        condoned and that there is no place for any form of corruption in our
                        enforcement agencies</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In <em>ADF v Public Prosecutor
                        and another appeal</em> [2010] 1 SLR 874, I stated at [146]
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A decision to impose more than two consecutive sentences ought not to be
                        lightly made and, indeed, should usually only be imposed in compelling
                        circumstances. … On the other hand, the totality principle cannot be
                        unthinkingly invoked to minimise punishment for those who maliciously pursue
                        a deliberate course of criminal behaviour. … [A]n order for <em>more than</em> two sentences to run consecutively ought
                        to be given serious consideration in dealing with distinct offences
                            <b><em>when one or more of the following circumstances are

                        reiterate that the above circumstances are non-exhaustive and should not be
                        taken as rigid guidelines to constrain or shackle a sentencing court's
                        powers.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original, emphasis in bold italics added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In the present case, there is a clear pressing public interest concern
                    in discouraging the type of criminal conduct being punished, <em>ie</em>, corruption within law enforcement agencies. In the
                    circumstances, I find that this is an appropriate case whereby more than two
                    sentences imposed on the respondent ought to run consecutively.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In the result, I allowed the appeal and set
                    aside the DJ’s sentence, substituting it with a sentence of six
                    months’ imprisonment for each of the five charges. The sentences for
                    District Arrest Case Nos 61472, 61473 and 61474 of 2009 were to run
                    consecutively, making a total sentence of 18 months’ imprisonment. These
                    sentences reflect society’s particular condemnation for such offences,
                    which if unchecked, could corrode the integrity and high standing of the police
                    force.</p>
