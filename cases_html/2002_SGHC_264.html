        This was an application by the second defendant

Fujitrans (Singapore) Pte Ltd (‘Fujitrans’) for a stay of all proceedings

commenced by the plaintiff, a bank known as Banque Cantonale Vaudoise (‘BCV’).</font>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">2.        From

about September 1998 to about April 2002, BCV had been financing the purchases of metal

commodities by the first defendant, which was known as Allied Deals Plc and then RBG

Resources Plc (‘RBG’). During arguments, Counsel have referred to the metal

commodities as ‘metal cargo’ and I will adopt this description but in plural as

there are different lots of cargo and different types of metal cargo involved, for

example, nickel cathodes, tin ingots, zinc ingots and copper cathodes. BCV says that it

financed the purchase of the metal cargoes in reliance on documents emanating from various

warehousemen, one of whom was Fujitrans, confirming that the metal cargoes were held to

the order of BCV. BCV also alleges that from time to time, RBG would inform it that RBG

had sold the metal cargoes, purchased with financing from BCV, and consequently BCV would

send stock releases to Fujitrans to instruct it to release the metal cargoes.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">3.        

BCV’s claims against Fujitrans relate to various groups of metal cargoes, one of

which is listed in Schedule 3 of its Statement of Claim (‘the Schedule 3 claim’

and ‘the Schedule 3 cargoes’ respectively). BCV alleges that the Schedule 3

cargoes never existed or, if they did, are no longer in the warehouse of Fujitrans. As

regards the metal cargoes which are still in Fujitrans’ warehouse, and over which BCV

claims security, BCV has agreed to a stay of this claim pending the determination by the

court of competing claims to such cargoes. However, BCV does not agree to a stay of its

claim in respect of the Schedule 3 cargoes.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">4.        RBG

is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom. Winding up orders over RBG have been made

in the United Kingdom and in Singapore and liquidators appointed. Similar orders may have

also been made in other jurisdictions in which RBG conducted business.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">5.        It

is alleged by various parties that RBG had obtained financing from various banks to

purchase metal cargoes and operated a fraudulent scheme whereby it, inter alia, obtained

financing to purchase non-existent metal cargoes and/or obtained financing from more than

one bank to purchase the same metal cargoes without informing the banks involved of this.

Accordingly, the security which it purportedly granted to each bank over each metal cargo

was in respect of non-existing metal cargo, metal cargo subsequently sold but for which

the bank or banks have not been paid or metal cargo still remaining in warehouses,

including Fujitrans’ warehouse, for which there is more than one claimant.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">6.        

According to Mr Kenneth Lie, Counsel for Fujitrans, six banks have filed six actions

against Fujitrans. In three of them, RBG is named as a defendant too. I understand that

one of the banks is claiming not as a secured creditor but as a purchaser of certain metal

cargoes. As there were several claimants over the metal cargoes in its warehouse,

Fujitrans applied for interpleader relief and for a stay of the actions. The application

for interpleader relief was in respect of existing metal cargoes in its possession,

custody or control, and not in respect of non-existent metal cargoes or cargoes which no

longer exist. I have given directions in respect of the application for interpleader

relief in that RBG is to file a fresh action as plaintiff and name the various claimants

as defendants. RBG has filed such an action in Suit No 1175 of 2002/F (‘the RBG

action’). However, my direction pertains only to the competing claims for existing

metal cargoes.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">7.        

Fujitrans had sought a stay of the Schedule 3 claim on the basis that the RBG action to

determine the validity of the various claims over the existing cargoes should be heard

first as it may be that some of the existing cargoes form part of the Schedule 3 cargoes

and therefore would affect the Schedule 3 claim. However, Fujitrans faced several

obstacles.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">8.        

First, BCV itself is not claiming that any of the existing cargoes is part of the Schedule

3 cargoes. Secondly, one Lim Tau Hee (‘LTH’), who was an employee of Fujitrans

had signed a statement dated 15 May 2002 in the presence of Fujitrans’ own solicitors

in which he said that the Schedule 3 cargoes do not exist. The Schedule 3 cargoes are set

out in Schedule 4 of his statement, but Schedule 3 contains some more metal cargoes after

BCV’s own investigations. Thirdly, even if LTH’s statement should be treated

with caution because he had allegedly assisted RBG with the fraud, Fujitrans itself could

and should have checked whether any of the Schedule 3 cargoes is found among the existing

cargoes in its warehouse. On this significant point, Fujitrans could not even make a

positive assertion that any of the Schedule 3 cargoes was still in its warehouse. It could

only say that this may be so even though it had records regarding the movement of cargo in

and out of its warehouse. True, if Mr Lim had been involved in the fraud, it may well be

that Fujitrans is also a victim of the fraud. However, the point is that Fujitrans could

and should have made its own investigations and ascertain the facts for itself. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">9.        On

this third point, Mr Jainil Bhandari, Counsel for BCV submitted that in various affidavits

filed for Fujitrans, Fujitrans had adopted LTH’s statement. On the other hand, Mr Lie

submitted that Fujitrans had been busy with various bank claims, dealing with LTH and

applying for court orders since events have come to light. Fujitrans were also waiting for

a survey on the metal cargoes in its own warehouse, done on the instructions of the

Singapore liquidators of RBG, to be completed. I did not find this explanation to be

persuasive. When Fujitrans filed its application for interpleader relief on 7 August 2002,

it must have known what metal cargoes are in its warehouse. Furthermore, if it did not

know by the time it filed its application, it must know by the date of the hearing of the

stay application before me i.e 30 October 2002. Therefore, I did not accept Mr Lie’s

argument that the only basis for BCV’s allegation that the Schedule 3 cargoes do not

exist is the statement by LTH. I reiterate that Fujitrans itself has not asserted

otherwise.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">10.        It

seemed to me that Fujitrans had made its own investigations and was aware that none of the

Schedule 3 cargoes is part of the existing cargoes but it is using the RBG action as an

excuse to delay the progress of the Schedule 3 claim.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">11.        In

the circumstances, I did not accept Mr Lie’s argument about multiplicity of

proceedings and the risk of an inconsistent decision if the Schedule 3 claim was not

stayed pending the outcome of the RBG action. I would add that the probability of claims

by other banks who do not succeed in their claims to existing metal cargoes in the RBG

action or who, in any event, also have claims for non-existing cargoes or cargoes already

sold, does not constitute multiplicity of proceedings by the same plaintiff i.e BCV.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">12.        It

may be neater for BCV to await the outcome of the RBG action so that it knows how much of

its claim to existing cargoes is unsuccessful and then carry on with its claim for the

unsuccessful part together with the Schedule 3 claim. However, in my view, BCV is not

obliged to wait for the outcome of the RBG action.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">13.        Mr

Lie also submitted that there was no prejudice to BCV if the Schedule 3 claim is stayed.

In my view, it is not for BCV to justify why it wishes to proceed with the Schedule 3

claim. The burden is on Fujitrans to satisfy the court why a stay should be granted.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">14.        Mr

Lie also added that it would only be after the RBG action was concluded before it is

determined how much BCV would recover from its security and BCV may succeed in recovering

enough from its security to cover part or all of the Schedule 3 claim. In my view, this

argument does not justify a stay of the Schedule 3 claim. It is for BCV to decide when it

wishes to pursue the Schedule 3 claim against Fujitrans and not have to wait to see if its

security over existing metal cargoes is valid and enough to cover part or all of the

Schedule 3 claim as well.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">15.        In

the circumstances, I did not grant a stay in respect of the Schedule 3 claim.</font></p>
