The respondent submitted that the applicant had no cause of action and locus standi against the respondent under the Contract because it was not a party thereto. The respondent argued that the Contract was entered into between Mr Loke, trading as Afone International, and not the applicant, trading as Afone International. When Mr Loke sold the business to the applicant, the business of Mr Loke, trading as Afone International, ceased to exist. Since there was no novation or assignment agreement between the applicant, trading as Afone International, and the respondent, there was no contractual relationship between them. Therefore, there was no basis for the applicant to bring the AA under SOPA. Thus the resulting AD was invalid for want of jurisdiction.

The respondent asserted that since Afone International is a sole proprietorship, the proper party for the applicant should have been named in the OS as Sito Construction Pte Ltd (trading as Afone International). The applicant’s counsel, upon realising the mistake, made an oral application on the first hearing of the setting aside application to amend the name of the applicant in the OS.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 I shall first deal with the two preliminary issues before addressing the principal issues in turn.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the applicant should be allowed to amend the name of the applicant in the OS</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 This issue requires the analysis of Order 77 rule 9 of the Rules of Court which states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">An individual carrying on business within the jurisdiction in a name or style other than his own name may be sued in that name or style as if it were the name of a firm, and Rules 2 to 8 shall, so far as applicable, apply as if he were a partner and the name in which he carries on business were the name of his firm.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 This rule means that a sole proprietor who is carrying on a business as a sole proprietorship under a business name different from his name can be sued under his business but he, in turn, cannot sue under his business name (<span class="font-italic">Mason &amp; Son v </span><span class="font-italic">Morgridge</span> (1892) 8 T.L.R 805 cited in <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2016) at para 77/9/3).

Thus, the respondent knew that it was Sito Construction Pte Ltd (trading as Afone International) that provided its services to the respondent under the Contract when the OS was being contested.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> The respondent argued that the Rules of Court applied to an adjudication application under SOPA and since the AA was brought under the name of Afone International and not Sito Construction Pte Ltd (trading as Afone International), the AA was invalid (see above at [13]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 With respect, I disagreed with the respondent. The Rules of Court do not apply to adjudication proceedings under SOPA. First, the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) provides at s 80(1) the purpose of the Rules of Court which is to govern the procedures of the High Court and the Court of Appeal:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Rules of Court</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">80.</span> – (1) The Rules Committee constituted under subsection (3) may make Rules of Court regulating and prescribing the procedure (including the method of pleading) and the practice to be followed in the High Court and the Court of Appeal respectively in all causes and matters whatsoever in or with respect to which those courts respectively have for the time being jurisdiction (including the procedure and practice to be followed in the Registry of the Supreme Court) and any matters incidental to or relating to any such procedure or practice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Second, the Rules of Court unambiguously affirmed this position under Order 1 rule 2(1) which states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Subject to this Rule, these Rules shall have effect in relation to all proceedings in the Supreme Court and the State Courts, in so far as the matters to which these Rules relate are within the jurisdiction of those Courts and, unless the Court otherwise orders, apply to pending proceedings therein. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">However, the only provision in the Rules of Court that makes reference to SOPA is Order 95, which deals with the application for enforcement of adjudication determinations and to set aside the adjudication determinations.  Hence, the Rules of Court do not apply to the adjudication proceedings under SOPA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Third, there is no reference in SOPA or its attendant regulations, the Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment Regulations (Cap 30B, Rg 1, 2006 Ed) (“SOPA Regulations”) that the Rules of Court apply to a payment claim and to an adjudication application brought under SOPA. The relevant procedures for issuing a payment claim can be found under s 10 of SOPA and reg 5 of SOPA Regulations. The relevant procedures for an adjudication application under SOPA are provided for under s 13 of SOPA and reg 7 of SOPA Regulations. Neither SOPA nor SOPA Regulations states that an adjudication application cannot be brought by a sole proprietorship and neither does SOPA nor SOPA Regulations state that a sole proprietorship cannot issue a payment claim or adjudication application under its business name. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Therefore, the Rules of Court do not apply to the procedure under SOPA. The Payment Claim issued by the applicant and the AA filed by the applicant under the name of Afone International was valid as it complied with ss 10 and 13 of SOPA as well as regs 7 and 10 of SOPA Regulations. Hence, the resulting AD was valid. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 I would like to mention that at the material time, <span class="font-italic">during the adjudication proceedings</span>, the respondent was aware that the applicant, Sito Construction Pte Ltd, was trading as Afone International and that it was the applicant that brought the claim. The respondent was represented at all times by the same counsel who argued at the setting aside application and the adjudication proceedings. The respondent had made an ACRA Business Profile search on 19 July 2018 and knew that Afone International was owned by Sito Construction Pte Ltd one day after the adjudication application was served on the respondent (see above at [1] and [5]). Hence, the respondent was not prejudiced nor was it under a misapprehension as to who brought the Payment Claim and the AA against it. This further explained why the respondent did not raise any objections as to the identity of the claimant in the adjudication proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Having already found that the Payment Claim and the AA were properly filed and having already granted the applicant leave to amend the OS to properly reflect the name of the applicant, I now turn to the substantive issues in dispute between the parties. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether there was a contract between the applicant and the respondent</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35  On this issue the respondent argued that there was no contract between the parties. Thus, the AD was invalid for want of jurisdiction and it must be set aside along with the Court Order in the OS.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 It is axiomatic that a sole proprietorship or a firm does not have a distinct and separate legal entity from its sole proprietor. Therefore, when the sole proprietorship enters into a contract, at law, it is the sole proprietor himself who enters into the contract (<span class="font-italic">Walter Woon on Company Law</span> (Tan Cheng Han SC gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, Revised 3rd Ed, 2009) at para 1.8). However, in applying this principle it is necessary to examine the true intention of the parties when they had executed the Contract and on whom the parties intended the contractual burden to fall. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 In this case, the parties to the Contract were Afone International and the respondent. Mr Loke was merely the “Managing Director” who signed on behalf of Afone International. The respondent argued that this could only mean that the Contract was between Mr Loke personally and the respondent by virtue of Afone International being a sole proprietorship. From the evidence, the respondent’s true intention was to contract with Afone International, as a business, to carry out the works under the Contract. The fact that Afone International was a sole proprietorship and that Mr Loke was the sole proprietor when the Contract was executed was merely a legal technicality which the parties never considered. I found that this was only brought up now at such a late stage with the benefit of hindsight and it was the respondent’s attempt to rewrite what was in its mind at the relevant time to defeat the applicant’s Payment Claim under the AD. Further, it was clear that the respondent was <span class="font-italic">not </span>engaging Mr Loke for his personal goodwill or reputation but rather, the respondent was engaging the entire sole proprietorship of Afone International when the Contract was executed. Hence, the respondent’s intention was for Afone International to carry out the works under the Contract and not Mr Loke. If the respondent’s intention was to contract with only Mr Loke and not Afone International, the Contract would have clearly indicated this. This was not the case here. Thus, it seemed that it did not matter to the respondent <span class="font-italic">who</span> was the sole proprietor or owner of Afone International, provided that the Contract was fulfilled by the business run under the name “Afone International”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 This is consistent with the findings of this court in <span class="font-italic">Chiah</span><span class="font-italic"> Huat Foodstuffs and Packaging (a firm) v Ng Bin Hua (formerly trading as Tjun Fong Enterprise)</span> [1992] 3 SLR(R) 270 (“<span class="font-italic">Chiah</span><span class="font-italic"> Huat</span>”). In that case, the plaintiffs supplied ginseng tea leaf to a business known as “Tjun Fong Enterprise” from January 1990 to June 1990. The delivery orders and invoices made out by the plaintiffs stated that the goods were “Sold to Tjun Fong Enterprise”. Tjun Fong Enterprise was registered as a sole proprietorship. Tjun Fong Enterprise had three sole proprietors in control of the business at different periods of time. The relevant period was when Ng Bin Hua, the defendant in <span class="font-italic">Chia</span><span class="font-italic">h Huat</span>, was the sole proprietor, which was from 5 December 1989 to 3 April 1990. During that time, the plaintiffs had supplied $49,198.20 worth of ginseng tea leaf to Tjun Fong Enterprise. G P Selvam JC held that the defendant was clearly liable for the goods supplied during the time the defendant was the sole proprietor. Although it is not clear on the facts of <span class="font-italic">Chiah</span><span class="font-italic"> Huat</span> whether the supply agreement was governed by an overarching contract or was on an order and invoice basis, what is clear is that the plaintiffs in that case understood that it was dealing with Tjun Fong Enterprise and continued to supply ginseng tea leaf to Tjun Fong Enterprise despite the change in the sole proprietors of Tjun Fong Enterprise.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Likewise, in this case, the respondent contracted with Afone International to carry out the works stipulated under the Contract. Afone International, indeed, honoured its part of the Contract by providing the necessary contractual services to the respondent who failed to make the necessary payment for the services rendered. Notwithstanding the change of ownership in Afone International in the early part of the Contract, the parties had held themselves to be bound by the Contract. When Mr Loke sold Afone International to Sito Construction Pte Ltd one month after the Contract was signed, the consideration must also have included the performance of the Contract with the respondent. The sale of Afone International was an internal matter of Afone International which had nothing to do with the respondent. Given what transpired in this case leading up to the issuance of the Payment Claim, it could hardly be said that the respondent was concerned about the sale of Afone International between different sole proprietors provided that Afone International <span class="font-italic">as a business</span> remained in operation and fulfilled the Contract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Furthermore, the fact that the respondent so readily admitted in its adjudication response that the Contract was binding between the applicant and the respondent reinforced my findings. I note that although the applicant only lodged a change in ownership of Afone International with ACRA on 16 July 2018, the respondent did an ACRA search on 19 July 2018 and learnt of the identity of the new sole proprietor of Afone International.

These simply mean that for any novation or assignment of the Contract by Afone International to a different party other than Afone International, written consent by the respondent is required. These provisions do not deal with the change of ownership of Afone International. These clauses were not relevant to this case. Therefore, I did not agree with the respondent’s argument that the change of ownership of Afone International without prior written consent from the respondent was in breach of cll 6.1 and 6.2.

</div> First, I did not place any weight to this argument because this was outside the scope of the setting aside application. Second, having already found that the Contract bound the parties, this argument is moot. Finally, the respondent’s argument on this point was unsustainable. Having already accepted the applicant’s works hitherto, without complaint and paid for most of it, it was no longer opened to the respondent to argue that the applicant had been unjustly enriched at the respondent’s expense. It was the respondent that had enjoyed the applicant’s services and now used legal technicality to unjustly deprive the applicant from being paid. The law cannot be allowed to be unfairly manipulated by the respondent on technical grounds.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the respondent had waived its rights to raise a jurisdictional objection against the AD at the setting aside application</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Having found that the Contract bound the parties, I shall now consider whether the respondent had, nonetheless, waived its rights to raise a jurisdictional objection against the AD at this setting aside application. To determine this issue, guidance must be had from the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Audi Construction Pte Ltd v Kian </span><span class="font-italic">Hiap Construction Pte Ltd</span> [2018] 1 SLR 317 (“<span class="font-italic">Audi Construction</span>”). First, the court must determine whether the adjudicator has the power to decide on the matters raised in the jurisdictional objection which go towards his jurisdiction. Second, if the court finds that the adjudicator has such power, the court must then determine whether the respondent had waived its rights to raise the jurisdictional objection because it failed to raise it at the earliest possible opportunity during the adjudication.<span class="font-italic"> </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 I shall first consider whether the adjudicator in a SOPA adjudication has the power to decide matters which go towards his own jurisdiction. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Audi Construction</span> held at [45]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In brief, we affirm the view expressed in <span class="font-italic">Grouteam</span> (at [67]) that <span class="font-italic">an adjudicator has the power to decide matters which go towards his jurisdiction</span>. <span class="font-italic">Fundamentally, it is [SOPA] which governs the scope of matters which he is entitled to decide, and nothing in [SOPA] takes jurisdictional matters out of that scope.</span> In fact, s 17(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of [SOPA] expressly gives him the power, in determining an adjudication application, to consider the payment claim which initiated the process leading to the adjudication. <span class="font-italic">Having regard to the purpose of [SOPA], which is to facilitate the speedy and efficient resolution of disputes in the building and construction industry, s 17(3)(c) must be read as conferring on an adjudicator the power to decide, among other things, whether a payment claim has been validly served</span><span class="font-italic">.</span> …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46  The respondent contended that the Payment Claim and the AA were invalid because there was no contract between the parties. The issue here is whether the adjudicator had the power to decide whether a contract existed between the applicant and the respondent. This was a critical issue that underpinned the Payment Claim and the subsequent AA. Applying the principle in <span class="font-italic">Audi Construction </span>cited above, regard must be had to s 17(3) of SOPA and I found that the relevant provisions are s 17(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), (<span class="font-italic">b</span>), (<span class="font-italic">g</span>) and (<span class="font-italic">h</span>) of SOPA which provide:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Subject to subsection (4), in determining an adjudication application, an adjudicator shall only have regard to the following matters:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) the provisions of this Act;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) the provisions of the contract to which the adjudication application relates; </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">g</span>) the submissions and responses of the parties to the adjudication, and any other information or document provided at the request of the adjudicator in relation to the adjudication; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) any other matter that the adjudicator reasonably considers to be relevant to the adjudication. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In light of the above provisions, an adjudicator has the power to decide whether a contract exists between the parties. This is important because it allows the adjudicator to consider whether the payment claim and the subsequent adjudication application brought for his consideration under SOPA should be adjudicated in the first place. Such power to make a finding on the existence of a contract between the claimant and the respondent lies at the very heart of the adjudicator’s power to make a determination under an adjudication application brought under SOPA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 This finding comports with the legislative intention of SOPA which is to “facilitate the speedy and efficient resolution of disputes in the building and construction industry” (<span class="font-italic">Audi Construction</span> at [45]). Therefore, the adjudicator can rule on whether there exists a contract between the parties as this would determine the validity of the adjudicated claim and to summarily dismiss an application when no written contract exists.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The next issue was whether the respondent, by not raising the argument during the adjudication that the Payment Claim and the subsequent AA were invalid because of the absence of a contract between the parties, had effectively waived its rights to raise this jurisdictional objection. Here, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Audi Construction</span> ruled at [65] to [67] as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">65 The question then arises as to whether a respondent’s failure to object to an adjudicator’s jurisdiction or on a breach of a mandatory provision may be regarded as an unequivocal representation for the purpose of waiver by election and equitable estoppel. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">This in turn raises the issue whether he has a duty to speak – that is, to speak by raising such objection – and</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">, if so, by when that duty should be discharged, failing which he may be regarded as having waived his right to make that objection or as being estopped from doing so</span><span class="font-weight-bold">.</span> </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">66 Both questions, in our judgment, may be answered by reference to the legal context of the issue, in particular, to s 15(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of [SOPA]. By that provision, [SOPA] restricts the issues which can be raised before an adjudicator to the issues stated in the payment response provided by the respondent to the claimant. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">It follows that if a respondent </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">wants to raise a jurisdictional objection before the adjudicator, he must include that objection in the payment response</span><span class="font-weight-bold">.</span> Reading s 15(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) as requiring a respondent to raise any jurisdictional objection it has in its payment response is, again, entirely in line with the purpose of [SOPA], which need not be repeated (see [1], [49] and [52] above). <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Section 15(3)(</span><span class="font-weight-bold">a</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">) and the general regime of expeditious dispute resolution being the relevant legal context of this case, we have no hesitation in holding that a respondent has a duty to raise jurisdictional objections in his payment response.</span> </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">67 In this connection, we note that in <span class="font-italic">Grouteam</span> ([12] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), we considered (at [64]) that a respondent should raise such objections at the “earliest possible opportunity”. While this would be ideal, we acknowledge that silence at literally the earliest possible opportunity (<span class="font-italic">eg</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> the day on which the payment claim is received) may not be sufficiently unequivocal for the purpose of waiver by election or equitable estoppel. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Accordingly, we are of the view that a failure to object would amount to an unequivocal representation of a decision to forgo one’s right to raise that objection only when such a failure subsists at the time a claimant would reasonably expect the respondent to air his objection</span><span class="font-weight-bold">.</span> For the reasons stated at [66] above, that time is the time by which the respondent is to file his payment response. This is consistent with our view in <span class="font-italic">Grouteam</span> at [68] that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the appropriate time for the respondent to raise such an objection [<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> an objection to the time of service of a payment claim] would generally be the time at which it receives that payment claim or, <span class="font-italic">at the latest, by the deadline for it to submit its payment response</span> … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 I pause here to deal with the respondent’s arguments that the Court of Appeal intended the principles in <span class="font-italic">Audi Construction</span> to only be “limited to the broad meaning of jurisdictional objections pertaining questions of irregularity of procedure or contingent jurisdiction or non-compliance with the statutory condition precedents to the validity of a step in the litigation”.

</div> The respondent further cites the Court of Appeal decision in <span class="font-italic">Comfort Management Pte Ltd v OGSP Engineering Pte Ltd </span>[2018] 1 SLR 979 (“<span class="font-italic">Comfort Management</span>”) to say that not every failure to raise a jurisdictional objection at an adjudication would preclude the same jurisdictional objection from subsequently being raised before a reviewing court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 I did not agree with the respondent because first, such a narrow reading of <span class="font-italic">Audi Construction</span> would go against the grain of the “general regime of expeditious dispute resolution” which undergirds SOPA. At the risk of sounding repetitive, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Audi </span><span class="font-italic">Construction </span>ruled that whether the adjudicator is competent to decide matters that go towards his substantive jurisdiction is a matter to be decided based on the governing legislation, which is SOPA in this case. As I had found above, the adjudicator is competent under SOPA to determine whether there exists a contract between the parties. This is crucial because it lies at the very heart of the adjudicator’s power to make a determination under an adjudication application brought under SOPA and to summarily dismiss claims which are beyond his jurisdiction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 In <span class="font-italic">Audi Construction,</span> the respondent failed to raise the jurisdictional issue in the payment response as required under s 15(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of SOPA. This failure meant that the respondent in that case could not raise this issue before the adjudicator as s 15(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) is a mandatory provision. Accordingly, the respondent in <span class="font-italic">Audi Construction</span> was prohibited from raising the jurisdictional issue before the court for the purpose of setting aside the AD. However, in this case the respondent also did not raise its jurisdictional objection in its payment response. But the situation is different here because when the Payment Claim was served on the respondent on 14 July 2018, the applicant had not lodged a change of sole proprietor of Afone International with ACRA as this was only done on 16 July 2018. Thus, it would not be fair to expect the respondent to raise its jurisdictional objection in its payment response. Notwithstanding the fact that the respondent was not able to raise this issue in the payment response, I found that it had waived its rights to raise the jurisdictional objection. I shall explain this below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Second, I found that <span class="font-italic">Comfort Management</span> did not limit the ambit of the principles laid down in <span class="font-italic">Audi Construction</span>. In <span class="font-italic">Comfort Management</span>, the Court of Appeal ruled that in the absence of a payment or adjudication response, a respondent to an adjudication application can nonetheless argue before the reviewing court that the adjudication determination was invalid by highlighting patent errors in the adjudication determination to the reviewing court (<span class="font-italic">Comfort Management </span>at [67]). Patent errors are errors on the face of the documents or evidence before the adjudicator. This ground of challenge is different from a jurisdictional objection. Thus, I did not give any weight to the respondent’s arguments on this point which I found was a misunderstanding of <span class="font-italic">Audi Construction</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Turning now to whether the respondent had waived its rights to raise the jurisdictional objection (<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> that there was no contract between the parties), in my view, the respondent ought to have raised the objection in its adjudication response as the respondent had by then learnt of the change in ownership of Afone International on 19 July 2018 and it had filed its adjudication response on 26 July 2018 (see above at [38]). Thus, with due respect, I did not accept the respondent’s argument that it could not be estopped from raising this jurisdictional objection because it “was not possible for the [respondent] here to have known at the material times (<span class="font-italic">sic</span>) that there had been a change in sole proprietorship of the business known as Afone International”.

</div> What is significant here is that <span class="font-italic">despite</span> knowing the change in the sole proprietor of Afone International, the respondent <span class="font-italic">relied</span> on it. The respondent <span class="font-italic">did not</span> raise any arguments that there was no contract between the applicant and the respondent and that the Contract was not binding on them. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Finally, I would like to highlight that the law on raising jurisdictional objections is well laid down in <span class="font-italic">Audi Construction</span>. The principles in <span class="font-italic">Audi Construction</span> are trite as they preserve the <span class="font-italic">raison d’</span><span class="font-italic">être</span> of SOPA which is to facilitate the speedy and efficient resolution of disputes in the building and construction industry. Therefore, it is imperative on the parties to raise all jurisdictional objections when they can at the earliest possible stage of the adjudication process under SOPA. In light of the admissions made, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that there was a valid contract between the parties, and the arguments made by the respondent at the adjudication proceedings, the respondent’s jurisdictional arguments raised at the setting aside application were afterthoughts. They were made in the hope of having a second bite at the cherry. Allowing such objections would defeat the regime of speedy and efficient resolution of disputes under SOPA. For this reason and in light of the foregoing, I found that the respondent had effectively waived its rights to raise these jurisdictional objections. Hence, the respondent was not entitled to raise it at the setting aside application.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether there is merit in the respondent’s submission that the adjudicator was wrong in finding that there was no settlement agreement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The respondent argued that the AD was invalid because there had been a patent error in the finding of the adjudicator. In particular, the adjudicator was mistaken in finding that there was no settlement agreement between the parties.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 In considering the relevance of patent errors for a reviewing court, guidance must be had to the principles laid down by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Comfort Management</span>. As mentioned above at [51], the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Comfort Management</span> ruled that in the absence of a payment or adjudication response, a respondent to an adjudication application can nonetheless argue before the reviewing court that the adjudication determination was invalid by highlighting patent errors in the adjudication determination to the reviewing court (<span class="font-italic">Comfort Management </span>at [67]). This is because where there are patent errors, the court will find that the adjudicator had breached his duty under SOPA to adjudicate because he had failed to properly consider the documents before him (<span class="font-italic">Comfort Management </span>at [81] – [84]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 In <span class="font-italic">Comfort Management</span>, the Court of Appeal agreed with the adjudicator that “even in the absence of a payment response or an adjudication response, [the adjudicator] must not merely rubber stamp a claim. [The adjudicator] must consider the material properly before [him] <span class="font-italic">and</span> consider if there are patent errors” [emphasis in original] (<span class="font-italic">Comfort Management</span> at [86]). However, the Court of Appeal also emphasised that the adjudicator must not merely look for patent errors but must also be independently persuaded that there was a positive basis for granting the adjudication award (<span class="font-italic">Comfort Management </span>at [86]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Applying the above principles, I found that there were no patent errors in the adjudicator’s decision. First, the adjudicator had considered the submissions the respondent made in the respondent’s adjudication response, the respondent’s reply to the claimant’s further submissions and the respondent’s oral submissions at the adjudication conference in his AD.

</div> Therefore, the adjudicator was correct in finding that there was no settlement agreement between the parties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Finally, and as a general observation, the thrust of the respondent’s argument on this issue was actually to invite the court to set aside the AD because the adjudicator had arrived at a conclusion different from what the respondent desired even after both parties had amply ventilated their cases before the adjudicator. This was tantamount to asking this court to review the merits of the adjudicator’s decision. This, the respondent conceded, the court could not do.
