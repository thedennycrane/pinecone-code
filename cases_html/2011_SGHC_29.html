<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The defendant (also referred to as [AOM])

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       After considering the defendant’s
                    mitigation plea, the aggravating factors, the sentencing precedents, the
                    Prosecution’s submissions on sentencing, and the TIC charges, I imposed
                    the following sentences on the defendant:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">13 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of
                            the cane for each charge of statutory rape under s 376(1) of the
                            Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed) and s 375(2) of the
                            Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed); and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">7 years’ imprisonment for the charge of
                            sexual penetration (penile-vaginal) of a minor below 16 years of age
                            under s 376A of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev
                            Ed).</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       I ordered the sentences for the two charges
                    under s 376(1) to run consecutively, with the other sentences to run
                    concurrently. In total, the defendant was ordered to serve 26 years’
                    imprisonment (with effect from the date of arrest on 6 October 2009), and
                    ordered to suffer 24 strokes of the cane. The defendant has since appealed
                    against the sentences imposed. I now set out the reasons for the
                    sentences.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Sometime in 2005, the victim’s parents
                    were divorced and the victim’s mother was granted sole custody of the
                    victim. The defendant was in a sexual relationship with the victim’s
                    mother. The defendant resided at [the Flat] with the victim and the
                    victim’s mother. The victim was entrusted to the defendant’s care,
                    acting as her <em>de facto</em> guardian and the victim
                    effectively regarded the defendant as her father. As the victim was afraid of
                    the dark, she would at times sleep with her mother and the defendant in their
                    bedroom on the same bed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The victim was only 12 years old when she was
                    first sexually assaulted by the defendant. The defendant started touching the
                    victim’s breasts and vulva in 2007 when she was a Primary Six student. The
                    first act of statutory rape took place in mid-2007. At that time, the victim did
                    not know what sexual intercourse entailed. The defendant continued to commit
                    statutory rape on the victim on several occasions when the victim’s mother
                    was not at home.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Sometime in 2008, the victim’s mother
                    obtained employment in a company located in Jurong. The victim’s mother
                    moved to an address in Jurong to be closer to her office. Thereafter, the
                    relationship between the victim’s mother and the defendant came to an end.
                    The victim, however, continued to reside with the defendant at the Flat on
                    weekdays as the Flat was closer to the victim’s school. The victim would
                    spend weekends and school holidays at her mother’s place in Jurong.
                    Throughout this period of time, the victim’s mother had entrusted the
                    victim to the defendant’s care. In August 2009, the victim moved out of
                    the Flat to stay with her mother permanently after the defendant had informed
                    the victim’s mother that the power supply to the Flat might be cut off as
                    he had not paid the power bill. The victim would return to the Flat from time to
                    time to collect her belongings. On occasions when the victim and the defendant
                    were alone in the Flat between February and October 2009, the defendant repeated
                    his acts of sexual penetration on the victim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The defendant exploited the naivety of the
                    victim by misleading her into believing that he had sex with her so that she
                    would not be curious about sex and be cheated in the future. The defendant had
                    also instructed the victim not to reveal their sexual intercourse to anyone, as
                    he would be arrested, jailed and caned. It appeared that the victim did believe
                    what she was told by the defendant. After receiving sex education in school when
                    she was in Secondary Two (in 2009), the victim realised that what the defendant
                    had been doing to her was wrong. Thereafter, the victim actually tried to stop
                    the defendant on a few occasions when the defendant sexually assaulted her, but
                    was at the same time fearful that the defendant would be annoyed with her. In
                    the meantime, the victim did not tell anyone about the sexual assaults as she
                    did not want the defendant to go to jail. She cared for the defendant and had
                    treated him like her own father.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On 5 October 2009, the victim’s mother
                    asked the victim whether she was still a virgin. That was when the victim first
                    disclosed to her mother the details of the multiple sexual assaults committed by
                    the defendant. On 6 October 2009, the victim’s mother confronted the
                    defendant. The defendant initially denied having ever touched the victim.
                    However, after some probing by the victim’s mother, the defendant
                    eventually admitted that he had had sexual intercourse with the victim. The
                    victim’s mother asked him to turn himself in to the police, but the
                    defendant asked for one month to settle his personal matters. The victim’s
                    mother initially agreed to the defendant’s request on condition that the
                    defendant handed over his passport to her and on his written confirmation that
                    he would turn himself in. Subsequently the victim’s mother changed her
                    mind and insisted that the defendant surrendered himself to the police
                    immediately.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On 6 October 2009, the defendant was arrested
                    after he turned himself in at a police post. The defendant confessed to the
                    police that he had been having sex with the victim. Thereafter a police report
                    was lodged by the victim after the police contacted the victim’s mother
                    following the defendant’s surrender. The defendant is at present 43 years
                    of age. He admitted to the Statement of Facts tendered by the Prosecution
                    (“SOF”) without qualification.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     At the hearing before me, the Prosecution
                    pressed for a sentence in excess of 24 years’ imprisonment with 24 strokes
                    of the cane. At the hearing, the defendant submitted a written mitigation plea.
                    In paragraph two of his mitigation plea, the defendant alleged that the facts as
                    presented by the Prosecution were “unfair, unreasonable, falsely
                    incriminated and distorted with many doubtful points”. When I highlighted
                    to him that this aspect of his mitigation plea was in direct conflict with his
                    unqualified admission to the SOF, the defendant informed the Court that he
                    wished to delete it from his mitigation plea. I however advised the defendant
                    that the decision was entirely up to him, and he should proceed as he deemed
                        appropriate<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>.
                    He then confirmed his decision to delete the second paragraph of his mitigation
                        plea<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>. In the
                    defendant’s mitigation, he alleged that the sexual intercourse was
                    consensual. He also sought to emphasise that no force, weapons, drugs or alcohol
                    was used in the commission of the offences. He also sought to attach weight to
                    his guilty plea. I have considered and dealt with each of these alleged
                    mitigating factors in my decision below. Before embarking on an examination of
                    these factors, it would be appropriate to set out the sentencing benchmarks that
                    are relevant to the present case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Sentencing precedents</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     In <em>Public Prosecutor v
                        NF</em> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 849 (“<em>PP v
                        NF</em>”), the accused pleaded guilty to a charge of rape under
                    s 376(1) of the Penal Code (1985 Rev Ed). The accused was the
                    biological father of the 15 year old victim. V K Rajah J (as he then was)
                    expressed the opinion that a review of the sentencing practice for rape cases
                    was due and necessary. He set out four broad categories of rape. For the first
                    category of rape ("Category 1 rape"), it was observed that (see [20]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">At the lowest end of the spectrum are rapes that feature no aggravating or
                        mitigating circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The second category of rape includes rape
                    where aggravating factors are present ("Category 2 rape") (see <em>PP v NF</em> at [20]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The second category of rapes includes those where any of the following
                        aggravating features are present:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The third category pertains to <b><em>repeated rape of the same victim</em></b> (such as that of the
                    present case) or of multiple victims (“Category 3 rape”) (sees
                        <em>PP v NF</em> at [37]). Finally, the fourth category
                    of rape involves rape where the offender had displayed perverted or psychopathic
                    tendencies or gross personality disorder, and where he was likely, if at large,
                    to remain a danger to women for an indefinite period of time ("Category 4
                    rape"). The Court then proceeded to set out the benchmark sentence for each
                    category, as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_a"></a>(a)     For Category 1 rape, the benchmark
                        sentence would be 10 years' imprisonment and not less than 6 strokes of the
                        cane, in light of the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in <em>Chia Kim Heng Frederick v PP</em> [1992]
                        1 SLR(R) 63 (“<em>Frederick
                            Chia”</em>) (see <em>PP v NF</em> at
                        [24]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_b"></a>(b)     For
                        Category 2 rape, the benchmark sentence would be 15 years' imprisonment and
                        12 strokes of the cane (<em>id</em> at
                    [36]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_c"></a>(c)     For Category
                        3 rape, the benchmark sentence would be the same as that for Category 2
                        rape, <em>ie</em>, 15 years' imprisonment and 12
                        strokes of the cane (<em>id</em> at [37]). Rajah J
                        explained (<em>ibid</em>) that there was no overriding
                        need to commence sentencing at a higher benchmark in respect of Category 3
                        rape. This was because the Prosecution would, in most cases, proceed with
                        multiple charges against the offender and, where the offender was convicted
                        of three or more distinct offences, the sentencing judge would have to order
                        at least two (with the discretion to order more than two) of the sentences
                        to run consecutively.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_d"></a>(d)     For Category 4 rape, the maximum sentence of 20 years' imprisonment
                        and 24 strokes of the cane was, in Rajah J's view, not inappropriate if the
                        circumstances so dictated (see <em>PP v NF</em> at
                        [38]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The stated categories of rape and the
                    corresponding sentencing benchmarks for each category were endorsed by the Court

                    factors in each case, in deciding the situations which may warrant a departure
                    from the benchmark sentences as set out in <em>PP v
                    NF</em>, the courts should be guided by three broad principles in
                    assessing the appropriate sentence to impose (see <em>Liton</em> at [95]):</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In <em>PP v UI</em>, the
                    offender (the biological father of the victim), pleaded guilty to three charges
                    of rape under s 376(2) of the Penal Code (1985 Rev Ed). Two other
                    charges of rape under s 376(2) and five charges of outrage of modesty were
                    taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. The Court of Appeal
                    considered the offences to be a betrayal of the familial relationship of trust
                    and authority between the accused and the victim, and regarded it as an
                    aggravating factor. The Court of Appeal also took into consideration the serial
                    nature of the offences and the accused’s further acts of perversion. The
                    accused was convicted and sentenced to 12 years’ imprisonment on each
                    charge, with two charges to run consecutively for a global sentence of 24
                    years’ imprisonment. He was spared from caning because he was above 50
                    years old.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The decision of <em>Public
                        Prosecutor v ABJ</em> [2010] 2 SLR 377 (“<em>PP v ABJ</em>”) is a relevant precedent for the
                    offence of sexual penetration (penile-vaginal) under s 376A(1)(a) of the
                    Penal Code (2008 Rev Ed). The accused was charged with 44 counts of
                    multiple sexual assaults against his friend’s daughter at the
                    victim’s home over a period of seven years when the victim was between
                    eight and 15 years old. He pleaded guilty to nine charges: five charges of rape
                    under s 376(2) and one charge of carnal intercourse against the order of
                    nature under s 377 of the Penal Code (1985 Rev Ed), one charge under
                    s 7 of the Children and Young Persons Act (Cap 38, 2001 Rev Ed)
                    (“CYPA”), and two charges under s 376A(1)(b) and
                    s 376A(1)(a) of the Penal Code (2008 Rev Ed). The remaining 35 charges
                    were taken into account for the purposes of sentencing. The Court of Appeal held
                    that, in view of the deplorable and systemic nature of the offences committed,
                    as well as the severe harm caused to the victim, the conduct of the accused
                    ought to be denounced in the strongest possible terms. The Court of Appeal
                    upheld the trial judge’s decision that the following sentences were
                    appropriate: 16 years’ imprisonment for each of the five charges under
                    s 376(2) of the Penal Code, one year imprisonment for the CYPA charge, 8
                    years’ imprisonment for the s 377 charge; and 8 years’
                    imprisonment for each of the charges under s 376A(1)(b) and
                    s 376A(1)(a) of the Penal Code. The Court of Appeal ordered the first
                    charge (one charge under s 376(2)), the 29<sup>th</sup>
                    charge (the charge under s 377) and the 42<sup>nd</sup>
                    charge (the charge under s 376A(1)(b)) to run consecutively, resulting in a
                    global sentence of 32 years’ imprisonment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     In <em>Public Prosecutor v
                        YD</em> [2009] 1 SLR(R) 261 (“<em>PP v
                        YD</em>”), the accused was charged with and claimed trial to 16
                    charges of statutory rape under s 376(1) of the Penal Code (1985 Rev
                    Ed), and 26 charges of having carnal intercourse against the course of nature
                    under s 377 of the Penal Code (1985 Rev Ed). The offences were
                    committed against the accused’s step-daughter, who was below 14 years
                    of age. The Court held at [96] that the accused was “practically in the
                    same position as her natural father”, and found that such abuse of trust
                    and authority to be an aggravating factor. The accused was sentenced to 10
                    years’ imprisonment with 12 strokes of the cane for each of the 16 rape
                    charges, and 5 years’ imprisonment for each of the 26 charges of
                    having carnal intercourse against the course of nature. The imprisonment terms
                    for the first rape charge, the third rape charge, and the
                        42<sup>nd</sup> charge of having carnal intercourse against
                    the course of nature were ordered to run consecutively, making a global sentence
                    of 25 years’ imprisonment with 24 strokes of the cane.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Consideration of the facts in the present case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The present case falls within Category 3 rape
                    as it involved repeated rape of the same victim. As such, the appropriate
                    sentence would <em>prima facie</em> be 15 years’
                    of imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane for <em>each</em> charge of rape. It is nonetheless imperative that the
                    actual factual matrix be considered for the purposes of
                sentencing.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Period of the sexual offences</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     As admitted in the SOF, the defendant
                    committed the first act of sexual assault by touching the private parts of the
                    victim when she was only in Primary six (see SOF at [11]). The offences of
                    statutory rape were committed when the victim was only 12 years old (see SOF at
                    [16]–[21]). The defendant committed statutory rape on the victim on
                    multiple occasions over a period of close to three years.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Abuse of position of trust and authority</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Apart from the above, I found the
                    defendant’s betrayal and abuse of trust and authority to be a significant
                    aggravating factor. It is clear that the defendant was in a position of trust
                    and authority <em>vis-à-vis</em> the victim. The victim had
                    initially addressed the defendant as “<em>Gan
                        Die”</em> (“Godfather” in Mandarin). Later the
                    victim’s mother asked the victim to address the defendant as
                    “Daddy” (see SOF at [5]). Indeed, the defendant made the following
                    material admissions in the SOF (at [9]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The victim’s mother trusted the accused, and frequently left the
                        victim in the accused’s care while she was at work. The victim treated
                        the accused as her father, and both the victim’s Primary and Secondary
                        school administrations knew that the accused was her guardian.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     It is therefore clear that the defendant was
                    in effect in the position of a father figure to the victim. On one occasion in
                    2007, after the victim’s birthday, the victim had asked the defendant to
                    pat her to sleep as she was afraid of the dark. This, in my view, is an example
                    of how the victim had regarded the defendant as her father figure. However, the
                    defendant abused the trust placed in him and had sexually assaulted her while
                    patting her to sleep. Although the defendant was entrusted with the trust, care
                    and responsibility of the victim, he repeatedly violated this
                trust.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Exploitation of the victim’s innocence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In addition, the defendant had exploited the
                    victim’s innocence by deceiving her into believing that the sex with her
                    was to satisfy her curiosity so that she would not be cheated in future (see SOF
                    at [29]). Ironically it was the defendant who “<em>cheated</em>” the victim in a most vile manner. The victim had
                    clearly believed him as she only realised that what the defendant had been doing
                    to her was wrong after receiving sex education in school (see SOF at [30]). This
                    deception is, in my view, an extreme aggravating factor.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Serious emotional and psychological harm caused</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     I am also mindful that the depraved acts
                    caused not only physical harm to the victim, but also inflicted serious
                    emotional and psychological scars on the victim, some of which are long-term and
                    could lead to interpersonal difficulties in her adult life. This reflects the
                    gravity of the harm caused by the defendant, which was one of the major
                    considerations highlighted by the Court of Appeal in <em>Liton</em> at [95]. It was stated in the SOF that (at [32]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Before the victim realised what the accused was doing to her, the victim
                        trusted her family and friends. However, after she understood what the
                        accused had done, the victim felt angry and sad. She also felt
                        ‘dirty’ or unclean. She feared that boys would despise her and
                        no one would want to be her boyfriend.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Dr [GH], consultant psychiatrist of the
                    [TY clinic] also highlighted the long term detrimental effects on the
                    victim’s interpersonal relationships in her report dated 5 November
                    2009 (see Tab D, annexed to SOF):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[The victim] has been feeling sad and angry since she had sex education in
                        secondary school and realized that what the accused had done was wrong.
                            <em>She has been having recurrent thoughts about the
                            alleged abuse and is fearful of adult males</em>. <em>This could lead to interpersonal difficulties as well as
                            problems with intimacy later in life</em>. She also feels guilty
                        about having disclosed the abuse and causing him to be in prison.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In view of such unfortunate consequences
                    caused by the defendant’s depraved acts, the demands of retributive
                    justice would require a sentence that is commensurate with the degree of harm
                    caused to the victim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Transmission of sexual disease</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The Prosecution also highlighted another
                    noteworthy aggravating factor. The defendant had infected the victim with a
                    sexually transmitted disease (“STD”). The victim was examined by
                    Dr [RW] from [hospital 1] on 19 October 2009, and it was stated in
                    Dr RW’s report dated 18 November 2009 that the tests done on the
                    victim revealed that she had Chlamydia trachomatis DNA (see Tab C annexed to the
                    SOF). At around the same time, the defendant was also found to have Chlamydia
                    Urethritis (see medical report dated 27 January 2010 of Dr [KH], a
                    physician with Changi Prison Complex, Tab E, annexed to the SOF). It was not
                    alleged by the defendant that the victim had sexual intercourse with persons
                    other than himself. As such, the irresistible inference to be drawn is that the
                    defendant must have transmitted the STD to the victim. Evidently his callousness
                    in engaging in unprotected sex with the victim had caused her to contract the
                    STD.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Having considered the relevant facts and
                    aggravating factors, I now turn my attention to consider the alleged mitigating
                    factors raised by the appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Consideration of mitigating factors</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Is consent a relevant mitigating factor</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     In his mitigation plea, the defendant sought
                    to impress upon me that the sex with the victim was consensual (see
                        4<sup>th</sup> paragraph of the mitigation plea):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…the victim has agreed [it was] consensual sex and she repeatedly
                        say that she had sex with me…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     This raised two important questions: to
                        <em>what extent</em> should consent be <em>accepted</em> as a <em>relevant</em>
                    mitigating factor for offences of statutory rape and sexual penetration of a
                    minor; and secondly, <em>even if</em> accepted as a
                    relevant mitigating factor, <em>how much weight</em> should
                    be accorded to this factor?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In <em>Tay Kim Kuan v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [2001] 2 SLR(R) 876, the appellant pleaded
                    guilty to a charge under s 140(1)(i) of the Women's Charter (Cap 353,
                    1997 Rev Ed) of having carnal connection with the victim, who at the
                    material time was under 16 years of age. The appellant submitted before the
                    court that the victim’s consent was a mitigating factor. The Court,
                    however, found that consent was not a relevant mitigating factor in determining
                    the sentence for the offence under s 140(1)(i) of the Women’s
                    Charter:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">13    In my view<em>, issues of consent
                                are entirely irrelevant to offences under s 140(1)(i) of the
                                Women's Charter, the policy of which is to afford blanket protection
                                to young girls who are regarded by the statute as being mentally and
                                emotionally unprepared to handle relationships of a sexual nature.
                                Girls under the age of 16 are thus deemed by the law to be incapable
                                of giving valid consent to a sexual act, and, in my view, rightly
                                so, as many at that age are ill-equipped to handle the serious
                                social consequences which often arise out of just one single night
                                of reckless passion</em>. These girls often lack not just the
                            resources but the emotional strength of mind to cope with the heavy
                            responsibilities of an unplanned pregnancy and worse, the physical and
                            psychological trauma of having to undergo an abortion. The spectre of
                            unwanted children, its links to juvenile delinquency and the concomitant
                            effects on the progress of modern society all collectively favour the
                            legislative policy of strict liability where sexual intercourse with
                            underaged girls is concerned. Much as these girls may have procured or
                            actively initiated the encounter, the purpose of s 140(1)(i) is to
                            place the onus on the male adult to exercise restraint and discipline in
                            curbing his carnality. In this respect, the law may be said to be
                            paternalistic, and perhaps even overprotective in seeking to guard young
                            girls from a precocious desire for sexual experience. Nevertheless the
                            social and humane reasons for such a welfare state of the law are too
                            compelling to be ignored. In my view, the court has to send out a clear
                            signal to the public that men who engage in sexual intercourse with
                            girls under 16 do so at their own peril.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">16    While I accepted counsel's argument that the extent
                            to which a victim agreed to and encouraged what was done is relevant to
                            an accused's mitigation, it was not the be-all and end-all of the
                            matter. Many other factors also have to be looked at at the same time.
                            As already alluded to, consent <em>per se</em> is
                            not a defence to an offence under s 140(1)(i) of the Women 's
                            Charter. Quite frankly, <em>I found the whole argument
                                about consent to be difficult to comprehend since a lack of consent
                                in the first place would have attracted a charge of rape under the
                                more serious provisions of the Penal Code (Cap 224), rather
                                than merely the statutory offence prescribed by the Women's
                                Charter</em>. Similarly if there had indeed been any trickery,
                            deception or violence, then any consent given by the woman would clearly
                            have been vitiated, thus warranting a charge of rape as well. As a
                            result, I am of the view that <em>consent of the girl
                                should not be treated as a mitigating factor in cases under
                                s 140(1)(i)</em> as it appears to me that such consent
                            would in any event have been forthcoming in a majority of the cases
                            brought under s 140(1)(i) anyway.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     In <em>Annis bin Abdullah v
                        Public Prosecutor</em> [2004] 2 SLR(R) 93, the appellant
                    pleaded guilty to one charge of having carnal intercourse against the order of
                    nature under s 377 of the Penal Code (1985 Rev Ed). The victim was 15
                    years old at the time the offence was committed. The Court likewise held that
                    consent was irrelevant for the purposes of determining the sentence for offences
                    under s 377 of the Penal Code:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">50    In my view, as a general guide, "young victims"
                            should be those under 16 years of age. This would be consonant with the
                            protection of young women under s 140(1)(i) of the Women's Charter
                            which was enacted on the basis that girls under the age of 16 are deemed
                            to be incapable of giving valid consent to a sexual act. I was of the
                            view that this principle should be extended to s 377 offences, such
                            that in cases where the victim is under the age of 16 years, his or her
                            consent is irrelevant for the purposes of sentencing. The underlying
                            principle in this regard is that <em>young girls under
                                the age of 16 may not have the experience or the maturity to make
                                decisions in their own best interests about their own sexuality and
                                that the law must step in to prevent their exposure to sexual
                                activity regardless of their purported
                        consent</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">51    The present case would fall under this category of
                            cases and the fact that the victim had agreed to the act of fellatio
                            should not be accorded mitigating weight.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The Court in <em>Public
                        Prosecutor v Soh Lip Yong</em> [1993] 3 SLR(R) 364 similarly
                    took the view that consent was immaterial in determining the appropriate
                    sentence for the offence of statutory rape under s 376(1) of the Penal Code
                    (1985 Rev Ed). If the offence was committed without consent, a charge of
                    aggravated rape could be brought under s 376(2) of the Penal Code
                    (1985 Rev Ed) (the equivalent of which is found in s 375(3) of the
                    Penal Code (2008 Rev Ed)) (at [26]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In my view, this would mean that since the underaged victim's consent is
                        immaterial in determining whether the offence has been committed, it should
                        also make no difference in considering what sentence to impose on the
                        offender. This is clear from the fact that, where there is no consent given
                        to sexual intercourse by the underaged victim, the offence is in fact
                        considered to be aggravated and a charge can be brought under s 376(2)
                        of the Penal Code which attracts a minimum sentence of eight years'
                        imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane. As such, it must be the case that,
                        even when the underaged victim has consented, the benchmark sentence in
                            <em>Chia Kim Heng Frederick v PP</em> [[1992]
                        1 SLR(R) 63] applies in full force. Where she has not consented
                        but the charge is nonetheless framed under s 376(1), it becomes an
                        aggravating factor in determining the appropriate sentence to impose on the
                        offender.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In my view, the considerations stated above
                    with regard to the offence of statutory rape under s 376(1) or carnal
                    intercourse against the order of nature under s 377 of the Penal Code
                    (1985 Rev Ed) are applicable with equal force to the determination of
                    sentences for the offence of statutory rape punishable under s 375(2) of
                    the Penal Code (2008 Rev Ed); and for the offences of sexual penetration of
                    a minor under 16 punishable under s 376A of the Penal Code (2008 Rev
                    Ed). The underlying rationale behind these provisions is to protect young and
                    vulnerable girls from being sexually exploited. Indeed, as a matter of societal
                    morality and legislative policy, girls below 16 years of age are, due to their
                    inexperience and presumed lack of sexual and emotional maturity, considered to
                    be vulnerable and susceptible to coercion and hence incapable of giving informed
                    consent. This is epitomized by the fact that the offences of statutory rape and
                    sexual penetration of a minor are <em>strict liability</em>
                    offences as far as consent is concerned. This was also alluded to by the Court
                    of Appeal in <em>PP v UI</em> where it was commented that
                    (at [60]) the “law <em>imputes an inability to
                        consent</em> to the sexual acts committed against [the victim] as she
                    is a minor”. It would therefore be contrary to such considerations for
                    the court to treat consent as a relevant mitigating factor for such offences.
                    There will also be several <em>practical</em> problems if
                    consent is to be regarded as a relevant mitigating factor: evidence would have
                    to be adduced to show the degree of sexual and emotional maturity of the victim,
                    the degree of coercion on the offender’s part, and even whether the acts
                    (if any) of the victim were allegedly sexually provocative or not<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>. Furthermore, an
                    offender’s contention of consent is irrelevant because if there is indeed
                        <em>no consent</em>, the offender would have committed
                    the graver offences of rape under s 375(1)(a) or of aggravated rape under
                    s 375(3) of the Penal Code (2008 Rev Ed).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     I add here, parenthically, that I do not
                    discount the possibility of <em>exceptional</em> cases
                    where consent <em>may</em> be regarded as a relevant
                    mitigating factor for statutory rape or sexual penetration of a minor,
                    especially where the victim and the offender was of the <em>same
                        or similar age</em> at the time the offences were committed (even in
                    such cases however, the court should look at the age gap between the offender
                    and the victim; the greater the age gap, <em>the lesser the
                        mitigating weight</em> that may possibly be accorded to the purported
                    consent). However, given that this is not the situation before me, I shall say
                    no more.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Turning to the facts of the present case, to
                    begin with, I am unable to accept the defendant’s assertion that the
                    sexual acts were consensual in the sense of <em>positive
                        consent</em>. I am mindful that in the victim’s first
                    information report, it was stated that she had “been having <em>consensual</em> sex” with the defendant for over two
                    years. However this statement must be read together with the SOF in which the
                    defendant admitted that, sometime in 2007 when the defendant first touched the
                    private parts of the victim while they were on the same bed with the
                    victim’s mother, the victim had moved her body in the hope that the
                    defendant would stop (see SOF at [12]). Further the defendant also admitted that
                    the victim had even tried to stop the defendant on a few occasions in 2009 but
                    was afraid that the defendant would be angry with her (see SOF at [30]). What
                    the defendant is effectively saying is that no force or violence was used by him
                    in committing the offences. That is quite different from saying it was truly
                        “<em>consensual</em>”. This is a separate
                    point which is dealt with below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Absence of force or violence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The defendant also sought to emphasise in his
                    mitigation plea that <em>he did not use any</em> force,
                    weapons, alcohol or drugs during the commission of the offences. The
                    defendant’s contention is wholly misconceived. The consideration and
                    balancing of mitigating and aggravating factors is not a zero-sum process. As a
                    matter of jurisprudential logic, the <em>absence of an
                        aggravating factor</em> cannot <em>ipso
                        facto</em> constitute a mitigating factor. This is because a
                    mitigating factor is something which an accused is given credit for (see
                        <em>Krishnan Chand v Public Prosecutor</em> [1995]
                    1 SLR(R) 737 at [7]; <em>Public Prosecutor v Lim Hoon
                        Choo</em> [2000] 1 SLR(R) 221 at [14]; <em>Public Prosecutor v Ong Ker Seng</em> [2001] SGHC 226 at
                    [29]; <em>Public Prosecutor v Chew Suang Heng</em> [2001]
                    1 SLR(R) 127 at [18]), and it cannot be said that the absence of an
                    aggravating factor is something which the defendant should be <em>given credit for</em>. In the present case, it would be incongruous
                    for any sentencing judge to give credit to the defendant for his omission to use
                    force, weapons, drugs or alcohol in the commission of the statutory rape and
                    sexual penetration. If the position was otherwise, an offender could conceivably
                    compile a list of <em>negatives</em> (what he <em>did not do</em>) in order to gain a discount in sentence.
                    This, in my view, does not serve any sentencing principle or objective. On the
                    other hand, there is no doubt that had force, weapons, alcohol or drugs been
                    used in the commission of the offences, it would have amounted to a severe
                    aggravating factor.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The defendant’s plea of guilt</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     In his mitigation plea, the defendant also
                    sought to emphasise his plea of guilt (see 3<sup>rd</sup> and
                        4<sup>th</sup> paragraph of the mitigation plea):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…my strong guilt…and conscience has spurred me to
                        voluntarily surrender [<em>sic</em>] myself …I
                        even go to the extent to share the consequences with the victim [and] to let
                        her know what I’ve done is wrong[.]…[S]he has the right to
                        expose me to bring me to justice…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…I believe my action of making my confession, voluntarily

                        repentance…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     It is accepted that a mere plea of guilt does
                    not <em>ipso facto</em> entitle the defendant to a discount
                    in the sentence (see <em>Fu Too Tong and others v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [1995] 1 SLR(R) 1 at [12]–[14],

                    apposite observation that (at [57]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...a plea of guilt does not <em>ipso facto</em>
                        entitle an offender to a discount in his sentence. Whether an early plea of
                        guilt is given any mitigating value depends on whether it is indicative of
                        genuine remorse and a holistic overview of the continuum of relevant
                        circumstances: <em>Angliss Singapore Pte Ltd v PP</em>
                        [2006] 4 SLR(R) 653 at [77]. A court should also carefully examine
                        the conduct of the offender after the commission of the offence in order to
                        determine whether the offender is genuinely contrite.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     I was not persuaded that the defendant’s
                    plea of guilt was indicative of his genuine remorse. The defendant had committed
                    statutory rape and sexual penetration on <b><em>11</em></b>
                    occasions over a span of <b><em>close to three years</em></b>,
                    and never once did he stop to reflect upon his actions, or to consider turning
                    himself in. In fact, the defendant’s conduct is symptomatic of someone who
                    had no regard for the gravity of his actions. For example, the defendant even
                    had the temerity to ask the victim whether the sexual assault was
                    “nice” (see SOF at [15]). Sometime between 5 February 2009 and 5
                    October 2009, the defendant instructed the victim not to disclose the statutory
                    rape and sexual penetration to anyone because he would be arrested, jailed and
                    caned (see SOF at [29]). In other words, he emotionally
                    “blackmailed” her to maintain her silence. Indeed the defendant
                    had initially denied ever having touched the victim when he was first confronted
                    by the victim’s mother. Even after his admission to the victim’s
                    mother, the defendant had <em>asked the victim’s mother for
                        a delay of one month</em> before turning himself in to the police. The
                    victim’s mother had agreed on condition that the defendant surrendered his
                    passport and acknowledged in writing that he would turn himself in to the
                    police. In the letter, the defendant wrote that he “committed <b><em>a</em></b> sinful crime of <b><em>sexual
                        harassment</em></b>” (see Tab B, annexed to the SOF). This was
                    quite far from the truth since he had committed statutory rape and sexual
                    penetration on the victim on multiple occasions. Finally, I was also disturbed
                    by an allegation made by the defendant to Dr [QR] from [hospital 2] during
                    the assessment of the victim’s fitness to plead on 23 October 2009
                    (see Dr QR’s report dated 3 November 2009 at Tab G, annexed to
                    SOF):</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">13.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">…[the accused] reported surprise that [the
                            victim] would initiate intimacy on occasion, and they began to have
                            regular intercourse…</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The defendant’s disconcerting attempt to
                    lay some blame on the victim is unsupported by the facts stated in the SOF, the
                    mitigation plea and the oral submissions before me. Indeed, the attempt to lay
                    blame on the victim is contrary to the facts admitted to by the defendant in the
                    SOF. For example, the defendant admitted that the victim had hoped that the
                    defendant would stop the sexual assaults (see SOF at [12]); and the victim had
                    even tried to stop the defendant a few times in 2009 but she was afraid that the
                    defendant would be angry with her (see SOF at [30]). In view of the
                    defendant’s conduct in totality, I was not satisfied that the defendant
                    was genuinely remorseful of his actions. Nevertheless, I acknowledged that the
                    defendant’s plea of guilt did obviate the need for a trial and had thus
                    spared the victim of the ordeal of revisiting the distasteful events in
                    court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Lack of antecedents</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Finally, the defendant’s lack of
                    antecedents cannot be accorded any mitigating weight of significance in the
                    circumstances of this case, given that the offences were carried out on 11
                    occasions over a period of close to three years.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The sentences</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     In the light of the undisputed facts, the
                    present situation would fall under “Category 3” rape (see
                        <em>PP v NF</em> at [37]) since it involved repeated
                    acts of rape. The relevant sentencing benchmark for each charge would <em>prima facie</em> be 15 years’ imprisonment and 12
                    strokes of the cane. The Court in <em>PP v NF</em> however
                    observed that there is no requirement to increase the benchmark <em>beyond</em> 15 years’ imprisonment for Category 3 rape
                    for each charge as the sentencing court already has the discretion to impose
                    consecutive sentences where multiple offences were committed (at [37]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Category 3 rapes are those involving repeated rape of the same victim or
                        of multiple victims. I agree with the courts in Millberry ... that such
                        offenders pose more than an ordinary danger to society and therefore ought
                        to be penalised severely with draconian sentences. However, in most cases
                        where the offender has terrorised the same victim multiple times or where he
                        has assaulted multiple victims, the Prosecution would proceed with multiple
                        charges against the accused. <em>A sentencing judge has then
                            the option to exercise his discretion to order more than one sentence to
                            run consecutively in order to reflect the magnitude of the offender's
                            culpability. As such, there is no overriding need for judges to commence
                            sentencing at a higher benchmark than that applied to category 2 rapes.
                            In fact, to do so may in many cases result in double accounting and
                            excessive sentences</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Indeed, this exercise of judicial discretion
                    to calibrate the appropriate sentence for each charge in situations where
                    consecutive sentences were imposed for repeated rape is exemplified in several
                    precedents already discussed above (at <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a>
                    –
                    <a href="#p1_18">[18]</a>). In <em>PP v
                        UI</em> (see above at <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a>), the
                    offender pleaded guilty to three charges of rape under s 376(2) of the
                    Penal Code (1985 Rev Ed) and two other charges of rape were taken into
                    consideration. He was convicted and sentenced to <em>12
                        years’ imprisonment</em> on each charge with two charges to run
                    consecutively with a global sentence of 24 years’ imprisonment. In
                        <em>PP v YD</em> (see above at <a href="#p1_18">[18]</a>), the offender was sentenced to <em>10
                        years’ imprisonment</em> with 12 strokes of the cane for each of
                    the 16 rape charges under s 376(1) of the Penal Code (1985 Rev Ed),
                    and 5 years’ imprisonment for each of the 26 charges of having carnal
                    intercourse against the course of nature under s 377 of the Penal Code
                    (1985 Rev Ed). Two rape charges and one charge of having carnal intercourse
                    were ordered to run consecutively, which resulted in a global sentence of 25
                    years’ imprisonment with 24 strokes of the cane.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Furthermore, in <em>Public
                        Prosecutor v MW</em> [2002] 2 SLR(R) 432, the offender
                    pleaded guilty to three charges of rape under s 376(2) of the Penal Code
                    (1985 Rev Ed). The victim was his 13 year old biological daughter. He was
                    sentenced to <em>12 years’ imprisonment</em> with 12
                    strokes of the cane per charge. Two of the sentences were ordered to run
                    consecutively for a global sentence of 24 years’ imprisonment with 24
                    strokes of the cane.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     In <em>Public Prosecutor v
                        MX</em> [2006] 2 SLR(R) 786, the accused pleaded guilty to 5
                    charges of rape under s 376(1) and 4 charges of aggravated rape under
                    s 376(2) of the Penal Code. The accused's victims were his five daughters
                    from his various wives. The accused was sentenced to <em>10
                        years' imprisonment</em> and 8 strokes of the cane for each of
                    the charges under s 376(1) and <em>12 years'
                        imprisonment</em> and 12 strokes of the cane for each of the charges
                    under s 376(2). Two of the sentences for the s 376(1) charges and one
                    of the sentences for the s 376(2) charges were ordered to run
                    consecutively, totalling 32 years' imprisonment and 24 strokes of the
                    cane.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     As can be seen from the above decisions, where
                    consecutive imprisonment sentences were imposed, the calibration of the
                    individual sentences brought the individual imprisonment sentence for <em>each</em> charge of rape below the <em>prima
                        facie</em> benchmark of 15 years’ imprisonment set out in
                        <em>PP v NF</em>. The sentences imposed for such cases
                    typically ranged between 10 to 12 years’ imprisonment <em>per charge</em> resulting in a global sentence between 24 to 32
                    years’ imprisonment. Nevertheless, this should not be taken as a rigid and
                    mechanical application of any sentencing formulae. It is pertinent to highlight
                    that <em>PP v NF</em> merely observed that it would
                    ordinarily not be necessary to go beyond the 15 years benchmark <em>per charge</em> for Category 3 rape. Accordingly, I do not
                    rule out situations where a sentence of 15 years’ imprisonment (or more)
                    can be ordered for <em>each</em> charge <em>even where</em> consecutive sentences are imposed, especially where
                    the offences were committed with egregious depravity or repulsive perversion to
                    warrant the resolute force of the law such as in <em>PP v
                        ABJ</em> (see <a href="#p1_17">[17]</a> above) where
                    the accused sexually assaulted the victim on 44 occasions, and was sentenced to,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, 16 years’ imprisonment for
                    each charge of rape under s 376(2) of the Penal Code (1985 Rev Ed).
                    Ultimately, in considering the relevant precedents (as set out above) where the
                        <em>totality principle</em> was adhered to, the
                    sentencing court should be mindful that the precise calibration of the sentences
                    for each offence where consecutive sentences are ordered must be tailored to the
                    specific factual circumstances of each case. The underlying principle is that
                    the totality of the sentence imposed must fit the overall gravity of the
                    offences committed (see also <em>ADF v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [2010] 1 SLR 874 at [146] and <em>Public Prosecutor v Law Aik Meng</em> [2007]
                    2 SLR(R) 814 at [60]). In the present case, there were two additional
                    aggravating factors which were absent from the earlier precedents. The defendant
                    had infected the victim with an STD and had deceived her into believing that the
                    sexual intercourse was in her interest to prevent her from being cheated in
                    future. In view of the aggravating factors as well as the lack of mitigating
                    factors in the present case, and having considered the seriousness of the harm
                    caused to the victim, I accepted the Prosecution’s submission that a heavy
                    sentence was warranted (the Prosecution had sought for a sentence in excess of
                    24 years’ imprisonment with 24 strokes of the cane). Taking into
                    consideration the multiple charges and s 18 of the CPC which mandates at
                    least two consecutive imprisonment terms, I could have sentenced the defendant
                    to 15 years’ imprisonment for each charge resulting in a global sentence
                    of 30 years’ imprisonment. However, taking into account the totality
                    principle and the fact that his plea of guilt did at least spare the victim of
                    reliving the traumatic ordeal, I decided to sentence the defendant to 13
                    years’ imprisonment (instead of 15 years per charge) and 12 strokes of the
                    cane for each charge of statutory rape under s 376(1) of the Penal Code
                    (1985 Rev Ed) and s 375(2) of the Penal Code (2008 Rev Ed); and 7
                    years’ imprisonment for the charge of sexual penetration (penile-vaginal)
                    of a minor under 16 years of age under s 376A of the Penal Code
                    (2008 Rev Ed). I ordered the sentences for the two charges under
                    s 376(1) to run consecutively, with all other sentences to run
                    concurrently, making a total of 26 years’ imprisonment with 24
                    strokes of the cane. I am of the view that the overall sentence of 26
                    years’ imprisonment with 24 strokes of the cane would adequately reflect
                    the gravity of the offences committed by the defendant.</p>
