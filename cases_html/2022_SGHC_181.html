</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 The decision in <span class="font-italic">Seah Teong Kang</span>, a judgment of the Court of Appeal, is binding upon me. I would note though that the rationale underlying s 130 of the IRDA may need to be refined in future. The proposition that the rationale of the provision is to protect against evasion of liabilities by contributories can be traced back to the 19th century case of <span class="font-italic">Rudge,</span> which has been relied upon in various authorities in stating the same. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 However, as noted in Andrew R. Keay, <span class="font-italic">McPherson’s Law of Company Liquidation</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 5th Ed, 2021) at para 7-062, in a discussion of the Cayman Islands Court of Appeal decision, <span class="font-italic">Tianrui (International) Holding Company Ltd v China Shanshui Cement Group Ltd</span>, 2020 (1) CILR 417, the Court therein observed at [22] that the use of partly paid shares is very rare in modern times:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">22. Undoubtedly, there is authority that [the equivalent provision of s 130 of the IRDA in the Cayman Islands] did have that purpose in relation to calls on a shareholder in respect of partly paid up shares (see e.g., <span class="font-italic">Rudge v Bowman</span> (1868) LR 3 QB 689). But the days of partly paid up shares are long gone. The purpose of [the equivalent provision of s 130 of the IRDA in the Cayman Islands] cannot be so confined. The statutory analogue in the United Kingdom has been re-enacted many times, (in 1908, 1929, 1984 and 1985), into a period long after the days of partly paid up shares. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">As contributories rarely have to cough up anything anymore, the objective of s 130 as characterized in <span class="font-italic">Rudge </span>would be rarely frustrated, and s 130 should hardly ever bar any disposition. It would be effectively moribund.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 It may be that a more appropriate rationale in present circumstances is the maintenance of <span class="font-italic">status quo</span> of a company’s position pending resolution of the winding-up petition. I had previously noted in <span class="font-italic">Re Rooftop Group International Pte Ltd</span> <span class="font-italic">and another (Triumphant Gold Ltd and another, non-parties) </span>[2020] 4 SLR 680 at [34], citing Ian Fletcher, <span class="font-italic">The Law of Insolvency</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 5th Ed, 2017) at para 26-004, that the primary objective appears to be “to maintain the <span class="font-italic">status quo</span>” [emphasis added] and “any change of the membership of the company or transfer of its shares would go against the freezing of the position of the company as at the point of winding up by the court”. Perhaps one benefit of maintaining the situation is that it reduces the burden on the liquidator in taking stock of the affairs of the company and allows examination of these dispositions to ensure that there is no undue prejudice in the winding-up of the company, particularly to its creditors. There may be, however, dispositions that are neutral in effect, or where there is some countervailing benefit: the court will have to weigh the circumstances. Such was similarly contemplated by Buckley LJ in <span class="font-italic">Re Gray’s Inn Construction Co Ltd</span>, in the context of observing that certain disposals under s 227 of the Companies Act 1984, which is of the same language as s 130 of the IRDA, may be of benefit to the company and unsecured creditors, though this would ultimately be subject to the overarching consideration that the interests of unsecured creditors are not prejudiced: at 819H–820B. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 As a rule of thumb, given the language of s 130 of the IRDA which renders dispositions void unless the court orders, to my mind the court should lean in favour of not granting the application under s 130 of the IRDA in order to maintain the <span class="font-italic">status quo</span>, unless an applicant can demonstrate reasons for the court to exercise its discretion otherwise.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Exercise of the Court’s discretion on the facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 For the reasons set out below, I accepted that the applicant was able to demonstrate why the application should be granted and that the status quo would not be adversely affected.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The power of the court to approve a transfer is not delimited by detailed conditions, and I would be hesitant to circumscribe it unnecessarily. There is language in <span class="font-italic">Seah Teong Kang</span> that, as the second respondent had argued, possibly broadened the consideration to cover matters going to the detriment of others. The second respondent, however, went further, essentially arguing that the court had a broader discretion, to prevent wrongdoing against the company. I did not think that the court’s discretion could be exercised so widely, as to be unconstrained. The relevant factors ought to be limited to those that are related to the disposition of property in the context of winding up of the company; after all, s 130 of the IRDA is parked under Part 8, Division 2 of the IRDA, which concerns provisions applicable to winding ups by the court. The court cannot embark on an unconstrained exploration of allegations of wrongdoing if they are irrelevant or only tenuously connected to such a disposition of property. For these reasons, I was doubtful that a factor that was not tied to the insolvency of the company or the impact flowing out of it, would be material to the court’s exercise of discretion. I did not understand the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Seah Teong Kang </span>as going as far as the second respondent had argued.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 I was reinforced in my approach by the observations of the English Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Re Gray’s Inn Construction</span>, interpreting s 227 of the Companies Act 1948, which has the same language as s 130 of the IRDA. Buckley LJ said, at 819F, referring to <span class="font-italic">Re Stean</span><span class="font-italic">e’s (Bournemouth) Ltd </span>[1950] 1 All ER 21, that any discretion should be exercised in the context of the liquidation provisions of the Companies Act 1948. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 With this, I turn to the various allegations raised by the second respondent in resisting the application. They may be categorized as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) matters relating to the allegations of corporate wrongs by various persons including the applicant; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) whether the present application was made for a collateral purpose; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) matters relating to the Liquidators and conduct of the liquidation; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) whether s 130 of the IRDA may be applied retrospectively.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 I was satisfied that none of these issues should bar the granting of leave under s 130 of the IRDA by the Court.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Matters relating to allegations of corporate wrongs by various persons including the applicant</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The second respondent argued that allowing the application would allow the applicant to perpetuate a wrong, as the loss of the second respondent’s shares would prevent him from pursuing an action to hold the applicant and OTC accountable for breaches of fiduciary duties.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 I rejected the second respondent’s contentions. Firstly, the allegations of wrongdoings were already ventilated in previous proceedings and determined by the court, both in Suit 1086 (as well as CA 29) and SUM 5154. The subject matter of SUM 5154, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, a stay of the WSS, was not before me, and I was only concerned with the question of the application under s 130 of IRDA. Put simply, these complaints made by the second respondent were irrelevant to the present determination. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Furthermore, these allegations went to the relationship with the shareholders and did not appear to engage issues pertaining to the winding-up and distribution of assets to the creditors of the Company. If there are any unresolved matters remaining after the decision in CA 29, these should be pursued by the Liquidators. In so far as there are any other corporate actions that remain, those may also be pursued by the Liquidators. I would note that the second respondent can no longer bring a derivative action under s 216A of the Companies Act 1894 as that avenue for a minority shareholder is only available when the company is a going concern: <span class="font-italic">Petroships Investment Pte Ltd v Wealthplus Pte Ltd </span><span class="font-italic">and others and another matter </span>[2016] 2 SLR 1022 at [35]. As the Company is in liquidation, the statutory derivative action is barred.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Thus, in considering whether there was reason to maintain the status quo in an application under s 130, I was doubtful that the pursuit of matters already considered and determined in the courts would be a relevant factor. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether the application was made for a collateral purpose</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Related to the above point was the contention that the application was made for a collateral purpose, which the applicant has denied. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 An abuse of process would be a bar to a grant of leave under s 130 of IRDA, but the evidence adduced must be sufficiently cogent to give rise to the conclusion that abuse was committed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The second respondent referred to <span class="font-italic">Re Gray’s Inn </span><span class="font-italic">Construction </span>for the proposition that the disposition of assets needed to be carried out in good faith. The applicant, in turn, argued in oral submissions that <span class="font-italic">Re Gray’s Inn </span><span class="font-italic">Construction,</span> was distinguishable as it was concerned with the disposition of “pure assets”, which would attract greater vigilance from the court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 What I understood the applicant to be referring to was the context of <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Gray’s Inn Construction</span>, where the English Court of Appeal was concerned with payments of moneys into and out of the bank account of the company after the presentation of a winding up petition for the said company. In contrast, the present application concerned the transfer of shares between members of the Company. On the supposition that dispositions of shares would rarely engage the same issues as disposition of assets, the applicant submitted that a different level of vigilance would be applied.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 In <span class="font-italic">Re</span> <span class="font-italic">Gray’s Inn</span><span class="font-italic"> Construction, </span>Buckley LJ did state that a disposition carried out in good faith in the ordinary course of business when parties were unaware that a petition for winding up had been presented, would normally be validated. But that statement was made in the context of a wider discussion emphasizing that the interests of unsecured creditors were not prejudiced in the grant of validating orders, by ensuring there was no unfair or undue preference, and the need for <span class="font-italic">pari passu</span> distribution: at 820H-820J. It was in this specific context that the notion of good faith was raised. His Lordship’s earlier statement, referenced above at [27], referring to the need to have the discretion exercised in the context of liquidation, must also be borne in mind. It is thus not a general duty of good faith, but good faith in the context of winding up and liquidation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Other than this, I did not think a substantial distinction would arise whether the disposition is one of the shares of the company or its assets; on the approach I have outlined above at [23], the court would need to consider all the circumstances. A transfer of assets would have to be justified just as much as a transfer of shares. But I did not think that <span class="font-italic">Gray’s Inn </span>encapsulated a different approach for disposition of shares <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis </span>disposition of assets: the court’s scrutiny would be one geared to the context of the winding up.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 The second respondent also referred to a number of other cases, including <span class="font-italic">I</span><span class="font-italic">n re a Debtor</span>, <span class="font-italic">Lai Shit Har</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> and <span class="font-italic">R</span><span class="font-italic">e John Waymouth Ahern.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 These cases stand for the proposition that a winding up application brought for a collateral purpose would be dismissed as an abuse of process. The circumstances of these cases, however, were quite different from the present one: the applicant here is able to point to outstanding cost orders, which remain unpaid. And as noted above, the Liquidators would in any case be able to pursue matters against the applicant and OTC for any misdemeanors in respect of the Company, if they determined it was desirable.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The cases cited by the second respondent involved egregious conduct. <span class="font-italic">Lai Shit Har</span> concerned a winding up petition against the backdrop of an ongoing suit just about to be heard after various delays; the Court of Appeal at [27] was able to readily infer that the winding-up application was brought to smother the suit. In the present case though, prior proceedings had been concluded, and costs had been outstanding for some time. In <span class="font-italic">r</span><span class="font-italic">e a Debtor</span>, the petitioners tried to foist on the debtor an obligation to pay someone else’s debt and costs which he was not required to pay: at 205. The conclusion of the court that there was abuse of process is perfectly understandable. As for <span class="font-italic">R</span><span class="font-italic">e John Waymouth Ahern</span>, that appears to be primarily concerned with the <span class="font-italic">bona fides</span> of a bankruptcy application as well.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 In contrast, the present case was not about winding up of the Company but a transfer of its shares under s 130 of the IRDA, and as I have emphasized, the discretion of the court and what counts as abuse or an application made not in good faith, must be weighed in that context. The primary concern was the prejudice of the interests of the creditors and the Company. In any event, as I have similarly emphasized, in respect of the unhappiness of the second respondent in his relations with the other shareholders, and the Company’s right to pursue matters against the shareholders, these proceedings may also be contemplated by the Liquidators if necessary. I did not see the present situation as raising any ready inference of the nature in <span class="font-italic">r</span><span class="font-italic">e a Debtor</span>, <span class="font-italic">Lai Shit Har</span>, or <span class="font-italic">Re</span><span class="font-italic"> John Waymouth Ahern</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Thus, the evidence before me did not show that the application was made for a collateral purpose within the context of s 130 of the IRDA.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Alleged conduct of the Liquidators</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The second respondent seemed to be imputing some possible misconduct on the part of the Liquidators. The applicant denied any collusion with the Liquidators and pointed out that the Liquidators chose not to be present at the hearing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 There was nothing to show that the Liquidators acted improperly. In any event, the proper course would have been to apply for relief against the Liquidators through the proper process. This, the second respondent did not do. And similarly, if there were any issues going to the winding up itself, it should have been raised in the proper way rather than in the course of resisting the present application.   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether s 130 of the IRDA may be applied retrospectively</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 The second respondent characterized the present application as one seeking retrospective approval. The applicant denied this.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 I accepted the applicant’s arguments that there is nothing in the language of s 130 of IRDA to bar it from being applied retrospectively, though such a late application may be a reason for the court to refuse to grant the application. I note that in <span class="font-italic">Re Gray’s Inn</span><span class="font-italic"> Construction</span>, Buckley LJ contemplated some situations in which retrospective leave may be granted: 820F–820J. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 In any event, as argued by the applicant, the present application was not in fact sought late: the Shares had been seized but no transfer has purportedly been done to date.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Other matters</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 The fact that the Liquidators might have been inclined to continue the proceedings, by initially filing a protective writ did not assist the second respondent in the present application. Any such decision was by the Liquidators in their assessment at the time. And similarly, the fact that they discontinued thereafter once the present application was made, would also be a matter for the Liquidators to determine. These were all outside the ambit of the determination under s 130. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 There were also some questions as to whether there would be anyone interested in the shares of an insolvent company. I noted, as argued by the applicants, the second respondent himself had on occasions alleged that the Shares were valuable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The second respondent also argued that the transfer of shares would run up against the fact that the Company was, as I understood it, a family run entity, and there was an understanding that the shareholding of the Company would remain within the family. If the Shares were sold in the open market to a third-party <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> purchaser for value, this would be a step that cannot be undone.
