Dr Heah kept the Board updated about the Complaint. There was no suggestion that he did not do so or that he failed to disclose relevant information about the Complaint to the Board.

</div> In this regard, Dr Heah and the Board were of the view that the Put Options provided sufficient safeguards.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 The plaintiff challenged the position taken by Dr Heah and the Board that the Put Options were important safeguards against adverse findings by the SMC. The plaintiff argued that the Put Options were designed solely to replace the Profit Guarantees. In my view, there was a disconnect in the plaintiff’s argument. It was true that the Put Options were intended to replace the Profit Guarantees. However, that did not mean that Dr Heah and the Board could not take the view that the Put Options provided sufficient safeguards against any adverse finding by the SMC. What was ultimately important in this regard was the fact that the Put Options existed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 It was clear that the Board had considered the benefits and risks (including the risk that the allegations in the Complaint might be true) and concluded that the 19% Acquisition was nevertheless still in the interests of the Company. The fact that Dr Heah did not ask for the relevant documents or cause the Company to commence a formal internal investigation was irrelevant to the Board’s decision. The Board decided to let the SMC’s investigation take its course and assessed the 19% Acquisition on the basis that the allegations in the Complaint might be true. Clearly, the Board concluded that the 19% Acquisition was still in the interest of the Company even if the allegations were true.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 It seemed to me that the plaintiff’s real grievance was that she disagreed with the Board’s assessment of the risks associated with the Complaint. Obviously, the plaintiff’s view was that the Company should not have proceeded with the 19% Acquisition, and/or should not have paid $3,795,000 for it. However, it is not for the plaintiff or indeed, this court, to second-guess corporate decisions that are made by those in charge of a company who believe in good faith that the decisions are in the best interests of the company. As the court said in <span class="font-italic">ECRC Land Pte Ltd v Ho Wing On Christopher </span>[2004] 1 SLR(R) 105 at [49]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The court should be slow to interfere with commercial decisions taken by directors (see <span class="font-italic">Intraco Ltd v Multi-Pak Singapore Pte Ltd</span> [1994] 3 SLR(R) 1064). It should not, with the advantage of hindsight, substitute its own decisions in place of those made by directors in the honest and reasonable belief that they were for the best interests of the company, even if those decisions turned out subsequently to be moneylosing ones.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">There was no suggestion or evidence that the Board’s decision to proceed with the 19% Acquisition was not made in good faith. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 It is for a company’s directors to weigh the risks against the benefits and decide if a transaction is worth entering into. A Court should not interfere so long as the decision has been made in good faith. As the High Court rightly cautioned in <span class="font-italic">Vita Health Laboratories Pte Ltd v Pang Seng Meng</span> [2004] 4 SLR(R) 162 at [17], “[u]ndue legal interference will dampen, if not stifle, the appetite for commercial risk and entrepreneurship”.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Allowing Dr Ong’s release from the Profit Guarantees</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 In her affidavit, the plaintiff stated as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">31. The consideration of S$3,795,000.00 was a huge premium over the S$2,175,000.00 the Company paid for the first 51% (S$2,175,000.00). Crucially, it was a term of the 2nd Acquisition that the Profit Guarantees which Dr Ong provided under the 1st Acquisition as a safeguard for the Company would be removed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The suggestion seemed to be that Dr Heah was negligent in allowing the  removal of the Profit Guarantees, which had been included in the 1st SPA as a safeguard for the Company, and that this was especially so given the “huge premium” paid for the 19% Acquisition. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 However, the plaintiff’s affidavit painted an incomplete picture. First, there was a simple explanation as to why the consideration for the 19% Acquisition under the 2nd SPA was higher than that paid for the 51% Acquisition under the 1st SPA. As stated earlier, under the 1st SPA, the Company was legally bound to purchase the remaining 49% of the shares in JOES by 1 April 2021 at a price to be computed based on JOES being valued at ten times its audited profit after tax for the financial year ended 31 May 2020 (see [4(b)] above). The 2nd SPA brought forward the acquisition of 19% to September 2019 whilst postponing the acquisition of the remaining 30% to October 2021.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 The consideration for the 19% Acquisition was based on the valuation of JOES computed using the formula agreed to under the 1st SPA, except that for obvious reasons, the profit after tax figure was that for the financial year ended 31 May 2019. The consideration was higher than that paid for the 51% acquired under the 1st SPA because (a) under the 1st SPA, the agreed multiplier for the 51% Acquisition was seven whereas the agreed multiplier for the remaining 49% was ten, and (b) JOES’ profit for the financial year ended 31 May 2019 had grown by more than 250% compared to its profit at the time of the 51% Acquisition.

The plaintiff did not explain what “all the important decisions” referred to. The decision to proceed with the 19% Acquisition was made by the Board. Dr Heah did propose the 19% Acquisition to the Board. However, that was unexceptional; after all, he was the CEO of the Company. In my view, the plaintiff had not provided any credible reason as to why Dr Heah had to recuse himself from the decision-making for the 19% Acquisition.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on alleged breaches of duties</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 In the circumstances, in my view, the intended claim against Dr Heah simply did not meet the “legitimate and arguable” threshold. Therefore, it did not satisfy the requirement under s 216A(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Companies Act. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the plaintiff was acting in good faith</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Ang Thiam Swee </span>also established the following principles with respect to the requirement of good faith under s 216A(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Companies Act (at [23], [29], [30] and [31]): </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) No presumption of good faith applies in favour of an applicant under s 216A; instead, the onus is on the applicant to establish good faith.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The test of good faith is a subjective one, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, whether the applicant honestly or reasonably believed that a good cause of action exists. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The applicant’s good faith and the merits of his application may be, but are not necessarily, connected. The court may find that the applicant lacks good faith if no reasonable person in his position could believe that a good cause of action existed (citing <span class="font-italic">Swansson v R A Pratt Properties Pty Ltd</span> (2002) 42 ACSR 313). An applicant might seek to bring a statutory derivative action in good faith even where there is no arguable or legitimate case to be advanced (although the proposed action in this scenario would arguably not be <span class="font-italic">prima </span>facie in the interests of the company). An applicant with a legitimate case may be found to be lacking in good faith if he is “so motivated by vendetta, perceived or real, that his judgment will be clouded by purely personal considerations” (citing <span class="font-italic">Pang Yong Hock v PKS Contracts Services Pte Ltd </span>[2004] 3 SLR(R) 1 (<span class="font-italic">“Pang Yong Hock</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [20]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Hostility alone cannot constitute bad faith but an applicant would lack good faith where his collateral purpose amounts to an abuse of process. In this regard, it should be borne in mind that the purpose of the statutory derivative action is to provide (see <span class="font-italic">Pang Yong Hock</span> at [19]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… a procedure for the protection of genuinely aggrieved minority interests and for doing justice to a company while ensuring that the company’s directors are not unduly hampered in their management decisions by loud but unreasonable dissidents attempting to drive the corporate vehicle from the back seat.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) The onus is on the applicant to demonstrate that he is or may be a genuinely aggrieved shareholder and that his collateral purpose is sufficiently consistent with the purpose of doing justice to the company, so that he is not abusing the statute, and by extension, also the company, as a vehicle for his own aims and interests.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 In <span class="font-italic">Chong Chin Fook v Solomon Alliance Management Pte Ltd and others and another matter</span> [2017] 1 SLR 348, the Court of Appeal explained (at [60]) that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the mere presence of a collateral purpose would not preclude an application under s 216A if the [applicant] could demonstrate that his collateral purpose was sufficiently consistent with the purpose of doing justice to the Company. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The applicant bears the legal burden of satisfying the court on the balance of probabilities that it is acting in good faith; this carries with it the evidential burden of producing evidence to establish its good faith: <span class="font-italic">Petroships Investment Pte Ltd v Wealthplus Pte Ltd</span> [2018] 3 SLR 687 (“<span class="font-italic">Petroships</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [67]–[68]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Applying the above principles to the present case, I concluded that the plaintiff failed to discharge her burden of proof. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 First, the plaintiff asserted that she believed that the intended claim was legitimate and arguable. The reasons why the intended action did not meet the legitimate and arguable threshold have been dealt with earlier. The Court may find that the applicant lacks good faith if no reasonable person in his position could have believed that a good cause of action existed. The test remains a subjective test but in such a case, the applicant’s claim of an honest belief in the merits of the intended action may be disbelieved. In my view, the present case was just such a case. The plaintiff has simply persisted in ignoring the fact that the Board had considered the risk that the contents of the Complaint may be true.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Second, the plaintiff was not concerned about the interests of the Company. The plaintiff showed no concern about the commercial aspects of the 19% Acquisition or with the Board’s considerations. As stated at [29] above, when Ms Ong spoke to the plaintiff after the AGM, the plaintiff asked if the Company would be proceeding to complete the 19% Acquisition and Ms Ong replied that this was a commercial decision, which would be made by the Company’s management. The plaintiff did not ask for any explanations on the commercial aspects of the 19% Acquisition.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Clearly, the plaintiff was trying to stop the 19% Acquisition. In my view, her objective in doing so was to punish Dr Ong by preventing Dr Ong from receiving the consideration, which was worth $3,795,000. However, the plaintiff failed to achieve her objective and she held Dr Heah responsible for this. The plaintiff’s case was that a formal internal inquiry (which Dr Heah did not commence) would have established that the allegations in the Complaint were true, and this would have had an impact on whether the Company should have continued with the 19% Acquisition and/or the determination of the purchase consideration (see [51] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 The plaintiff now had Dr Heah in her crosshairs. In my view, the plaintiff’s intended statutory derivative action against Dr Heah was motivated by her desire to punish him. She held him responsible for the fact that the Company proceeded with the 19% Acquisition and consequently Dr Ong received the consideration of $3,795,000 (in cash and shares). However, as discussed earlier, the plaintiff’s case was founded on the incorrect premise that the Board had ignored the Complaint. It was clear that in deciding on the 19% Acquisition, the Board (including Dr Heah) did not ignore the Complaint and had instead assumed that the allegations in the Complaint may be true. In the circumstances, in my view, the plaintiff’s collateral purpose (<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>to punish Dr Heah) was not “sufficiently consistent with the purpose of doing justice to the Company”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Third, the evidence pointed inexorably to the conclusion that the plaintiff was “so motivated by vendetta, perceived or real, that [her] judgment will be clouded by purely personal considerations”. The plaintiff had argued that she was the “most eminently sensible person” to take the lead on the intended action against Dr Heah because she is well acquainted with the facts that are the genesis of the problem. I disagreed. The primary issue in the intended action was whether Dr Heah had breached his duties as a director of the Company by failing to ask for the relevant documents and failing to commence a formal internal inquiry. The plaintiff’s knowledge of the misconduct that she had alleged against Dr Chan and Dr Ong did not make her the “most eminently sensible person” to take charge of the intended action against Dr Heah. On the contrary, in my view, her position as the victim and her anger against Dr Chan and Dr Ong (justified though it may have been) would have clouded her judgment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Finally, the plaintiff was hardly the “genuinely aggrieved shareholder” that s 216A is meant to protect. She was not even a shareholder of the Company when she contacted the Company on 5 September 2019 to tell Ms Ong about the Defamation Action. She requested but did not get to meet Dr Heah. She had no personal knowledge of Dr Heah’s or the Board’s internal deliberations leading up to the 19% Acquisition. She then became a shareholder by buying the minimum traded lot of 100 shares in order to attend the Company’s AGM so that she could tell the shareholders about the Complaint and the Defamation Action. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 For the above reasons, I concluded that the plaintiff had not satisfied the requirements for leave under ss 216A(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and (<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Companies Act. Accordingly, I dismissed the application and ordered her to pay costs to both the Company and Dr Heah, fixed at $10,000 each plus disbursements to be fixed by me, if not agreed.  </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Chua Lee Ming<br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Ong Ying Ping and Kenneth Chua Kok Siong (Ong Ying Ping Esq) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Tan Chee Meng <span class="font-italic">SC, </span>Paul Loy Chi Syann and Janie Hui (WongPartnership LLP) for the first defendant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Chua Sui Tong and Gan Jhia Huei (Rev Law LLC) for the second defendant.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
