She allegedly paid $750,000 as her initial cash payments followed by $500,000 in mortgage repayments. She explained that in 1997 the couple purchased their first home, a HDB flat located at Woodlands (“the Woodlands flat”). She contributed her savings of $50,000 towards the purchase from working for three years after the couple returned from the UK after the Husband obtained his MBA from [H] University. The Woodlands flat was sold in 2001 and part of the sale proceeds were utilised in the purchase of the semi-detached property at [15] at $1.2m. The balance purchase price was funded by cash from the couple’s joint account and a joint CPF loan. The semi-detached property was sold for $3.2m in September 2012. The profits derived therefrom of about $2m were used partly to purchase the matrimonial property at about $1.3m (with a loan) and partly to finance the acquisition of their first Japanese property, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Suganami property.

She disputed the Husband’s claim that he is a retiree pointing out he was only 56 years of age then. Based on the official minimum retirement age of 65 years, the Husband can work for another seven years. She alleged his retirement is by choice and not by circumstances. She pointed out that the Husband does not suffer from any debilitating medical conditions that would prevent him from seeking gainful employment.

She produced no evidence whatsoever to support her claim that she contributed $50,000 towards its purchase in 1997. That was a very substantial sum then as it amounted to almost 23% of the purchase price of $220,000. Based on the history of the Wife’s earnings, it is highly unlikely that she could have contributed such a big sum back in 1997.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 For the above reasons, the court took the view that the Husband should be taken to be responsible for 95% of the direct contributions made towards the acquisition or improvement of the matrimonial assets. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Next, the court found that a ratio of 60%:40% in favour of the Husband best represented the parties’ respective indirect contributions. In the light of [B]’s affidavit, the court was of the view that both the Husband and the Wife made equal non-monetary contributions towards the marriage as they were a working couple with the Husband contributing more as a full-time homemaker since his retirement in 2016. The Husband would also have contributed more by way of indirect financial contributions, such as by paying for the various expenses of the household and the children. As such, even accepting the Wife’s argument that she helped source for some if not all of the parties’ properties (which again was not substantiated), the court found that the Wife was only responsible for 40% of the parties’ indirect contributions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 According equal weight to each ratio, the court was satisfied that the overall ratio of apportionment should be 77.5%:22.5% in favour of the Husband: </div><table class="table table-sm table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">Contributions</span></div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">Husband</span></div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">Wife</span></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">Direct</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">95%</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">5%</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">Indirect</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">60%</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">40%</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">Overall ratio</span></div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">77.5%</span></div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">22.5%</span></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 The court and counsel for the parties went through the laborious process of going through the items in the June joint summary at the second hearing. At the morning’s hearing, the court advised the parties to try to resolve their disagreements and sort out the figures between themselves. Otherwise, the hearing would be prolonged unnecessarily if each and every item in the June joint summary had to be dealt with. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 When the hearing resumed in the afternoon, the court was informed by counsel for the Husband that the parties had agreed that their joint assets totalled $2,844,188.61, which excluded the matrimonial home and the overseas properties. The figure also excluded the sum of $250,000 that the Wife had disclosed

The Wife’s assets totalled $956,687.16 (including the $250,000 she took). The couple’s total assets were therefore $5,661,560.77. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 The court asked for confirmation of the foregoing figures from the Wife’s counsel. She confirmed that she accepted the figures as told to the court but she did not accept the Husband’s assets as declared. The Wife’s figure of what the Husband’s assets should be if it was not $1,860,685 was, however, unsupported. The court accepted the Husband’s figure.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Using the percentages of 77.5% and 22.5% the court had awarded to the Husband and the Wife respectively, the Wife’s share of the total assets came to $1,273,851.17 ($5,661,560.77 x 22.5%). Less her own assets of $956,687.16, the Wife should receive the difference of $317,164.01 and the court so ordered.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 The court adopted a practical and broad-brush approach with regard to [D]’s maintenance. In determining the quantum of child maintenance to be ordered, the court must have regard to all the circumstances of a case, including factors such as the financial needs of the child and the standard of living previously enjoyed by the child: s 69(4) read with s 127(2) of the Women’s Charter. In other words, how much does a secondary school student in Singapore need in order to live reasonably well given his family’s standard of living? The court thought a fair figure would be $1,500 and so ordered. In this regard, the court is of the view that healthcare and assessment books are one-off items that are not incurred on a monthly basis. Although the court made little or no provision for those items, the savings for not incurring those expenses can be channelled to other items. It seems to the court that the Wife’s figure of $1,100 is excessive for [D]’s tuition in two subjects. The Husband’s figure of $800 is also generous. If indeed [D]’s tuition costs more than what the court has awarded, the Wife can always apply for an upward variation of that and other items or the Husband can voluntarily pay the increase. The Husband did not strike the court as being a person who will begrudge his son what the latter needs so long as it is justified and reasonable. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic">(2)  Maintenance for the Wife</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 The court accepted the Husband’s submission that no maintenance, let alone a lump maintenance award of $252,000,
