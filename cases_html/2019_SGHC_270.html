It is undisputed that “issue” refers to the descendants of the Settlor’s daughter in all degrees. I find that there is nothing to displace this ordinary meaning of “issue”: <span class="font-italic">OCBC Trustee Ltd v Koh Boon Leong Francis and others </span>[1995] 1 SLR(R) 375 (“<span class="font-italic">OCBC Trustee</span>”) at [34]. Thus, the ordinary meaning of this aspect of Clause 3(3) is that upon Aisha’s death, her children will take her interest in the <span class="font-italic">same </span>portion (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, her one portion) of the Settlement. The means by which her children are to divide Aisha’s portion will be according to a 2:1 ratio, where the sons of Aisha would take “a share double the amount of the share of a female child of such daughter”.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, until the death of Aisha’s child, who takes a share of her portion, the children of Aisha’s child (<span class="font-italic">ie, </span>Aisha’s grandchildren) will not take any share in the Settlement Income, as “a child of such daughter [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Aisha] shall take during his or her life <span class="font-italic">to the</span> <span class="font-italic">exclusion of and not concurrently with his or her issue</span>” [emphasis added].</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Fourth, upon the death of Aisha’s child, the children of such a child, who is referred to as an “issue remoter” (but whom I shall refer to as a remoter issue), will take a share of his/her parent’s share in Aisha’s portion, provided that each male will take double the share of a female.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 From the above observations, it can be seen that Aisha’s issue, which refers to her descendants in <span class="font-italic">all degrees </span>(<span class="font-italic">OCBC Trustee </span>at [34]), are to take a share of Aisha’s one portion in the Settlement. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Shares originate from a portion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 It thus appears from the above analysis that the income is divided into “portions” and further sub-divided into “shares”. The shares stem from a portion such that shares are fractions of either two portions or one portion. Shares are accordingly a sub-genre of a portion. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 However, the applicant submits that since Clauses 4, 5 and 9 of the Settlement only utilise the word “shares” to the exclusion of the word “portions” it shows that both words may be used interchangeably or loosely.

From such a portion, clauses like Clause 3(3) of the Settlement then states that each remoter issue (such as Aisha’s descendants) is to take a <span class="font-italic">share </span>of the “same portion”. Hence, a “share” is the more general<span class="font-italic"> </span>term that refers to any<span class="font-italic"> </span>beneficiary’s entitlement under the Settlement, whereas a “portion” is a specific term that is used to measure the entitlement of the children of the Settlor himself. A share thus stems from a portion, but a portion does not stem from a share. In other words, a share is a sub-genre of a portion under the Settlement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Such an interpretation of shares as a sub-genre of a portion is consistent with the sole use of “shares” in Clauses 4, 5 and 9 of the Settlement, since those clauses were fully intended to apply to <span class="font-italic">all </span>beneficiaries, whether they were the Settlor’s children holding full-portions or merely shareholders who derived their beneficial share from a child of the Settlor.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 However, this does not <span class="font-italic">ipso facto </span>explain what happens to Shafeeq’s share upon his decease without leaving any issue of his own. My observations of Clause 3(3) at [17] above show that the clause does not appear to directly provide for such a situation.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Each portion is to remain intact along the same familial line </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Nonetheless, a closer inspection of Clause 3(3) does reveal that “after [Aisha’s] decease, the Trustees <span class="font-italic">shall </span>hold the <span class="font-italic">same </span>portion [being Aisha’s portion] of the net income for her issue then living or born afterwards” [emphasis added]. In my view, this means that Aisha’s one portion is to remain intact even after the death of one or more of her children, so long as there remains at least one issue “living or born afterwards” that stems from her familial line.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 The effect of such an interpretation is that Shafeeq’s share will accrue to his siblings, thereby increasing their share in Aisha’s portion. This accords with the last section of Clause 3(3), which provides that “through all degrees issue remoter than a child of such daughter shall take by substitution the share <span class="font-italic">whether original or accruing </span>which such issue’s parent if living would for the time being have taken in <span class="font-italic">the</span> <span class="font-italic">same </span><span class="font-italic">portion </span>of the net income” [emphasis added]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 While drafted in archaic terms, this section of Clause 3(3) is significant, as it tells that “all degrees issue remoter than a child of such daughter”, which refers to issue other than Aisha’s own children (<span class="font-italic">ie, </span>Aisha’s grandchildren onwards), shall take their parent’s “original or <span class="font-italic">accruing</span>” share in the same portion of the net income. The use of the word “accruing” as an alternative to “original” shows that the parents of such a remoter issue, such as Shafeeq’s siblings, may accrue a larger share of Aisha’s one portion than they inherited originally. It also shows that Shafeeq’s share ought not to be distributed to other beneficiaries of the Settlement who are <span class="font-italic">not </span>Aisha’s issue. Doing so would mean that Aisha’s <span class="font-italic">same portion </span>would in fact be diluted, and thus no longer the “same”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Hence, upon Shafeeq’s death, his one-third share of Aisha’s portion ought to accrue to his siblings, or other issue of Aisha (assuming his siblings have passed on), so that Aisha’s one portion remains the <span class="font-italic">same </span>portion.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 In this regard, Prof Tang Hang Wu (“Prof Tang”) has opined that the words “or accruing” in the last section of Clause 3(3) is insufficient to amount to an “accruer clause” in favour of Shafeeq’s siblings. This is because Clause 3(3) does not contain a detailed “accruer clause”, unlike Clause 7 of a separate Relations Settlement that was also executed by the Settlor. According to Prof Tang, the lack of a detailed “accruer clause” in the Settlement gives rise to the inference that he did not intend for the plain words “or accruing” to operate as an “accruer clause” in favour of Shafeeq’s siblings.

Similarly, in <span class="font-italic">OCBC </span><span class="font-italic">Trustee</span>, it was observed at [37] that the phrase “<span class="font-italic">per stirpes</span>” means that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[T]he issue of such deceased child of the testator, if there are more than one, shall take the benefit which their parent would have taken, and shall share that benefit equally. In other words, their claim is through their parent, the parent being a child of the testator. They together cannot take more <span class="font-italic">or less </span>than what their parent would have taken if he or she were alive. Thus, the six Tan children would <span class="font-italic">together </span>take what their mother … would have taken if she was alive. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Distribution “<span class="font-italic">per stirpes</span>” therefore signals that issue of the original beneficiary collectively take the <span class="font-italic">same </span>interest as the original beneficiary. The original beneficiary’s interest is to be kept within her family, and her issue collectively cannot take more or <span class="font-italic">less </span>than what she would have taken. Hence, the use of the words “<span class="font-italic">per stirpes</span>” in Clause 3(3), which deals with the distribution of Aisha’s one portion, shows that the intention was for the shares of her portion to be distributed within <span class="font-italic">her </span>family, among her issue through <span class="font-italic">all </span>degrees. This would carry on in the proportion of shares as stipulated in Clause 3(3) (two shares for each male, and one share for each female).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 That the original beneficiary’s portion (such as Aisha’s) is to remain intact until she has no more surviving issue is supported by Clause 3(2) of the Settlement, which deals with the distribution of the <span class="font-italic">two portions </span>allotted to a son of the Settlor upon his passing:

</div> This, the applicant argues is precisely the case here, since Shafeeq passed on without leaving any issue, and his share may thus be deemed to have failed. Accordingly, Clause 3(7) of the Settlement shows that “the total number of portions into which the net income shall thenceforth be divisible shall be accordingly reduced and the amount of each remaining portion accordingly increased”. Therefore, the applicant submits that the pari passu interpretation ought to be preferred.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 With respect, I do not agree with this submission. While it is linguistically attractive, the result of such an interpretation is to ignore the words “or accruing” in Clause 3(3), which, in my finding, shows that Shafeeq’s share has not failed notwithstanding his passing without offspring. Instead, his share has accrued to other issue of Aisha, being his siblings. As Poidevin QC rightly pointed out, “you never get to [C]lause 3(7) if the deceased grandchild [<span class="font-italic">viz</span>, Shafeeq] had one or more siblings who survive him.”

</div> There is thus no failure of Shafeeq’s share, and Clause 3(7) is not at present relevant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Furthermore, a full reading of Clause 3(7) shows that it refers to portions as a <span class="font-italic">whole</span>, rather than sub-genres of such a portion, being a share. It does not deal with the accrual of a share; rather, it deals with the accrual of a portion. This is why Clause 3(7) contemplates an eventuality where there is “only two portions or a single portion of the net income” remaining. The reference to “two portions or a single portion” is in my view significant, since a share is defined in Clause 1 as “a share … in any <span class="font-italic">two portions</span> of the net income or in any <span class="font-italic">single portion</span> thereof” [emphasis added].

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> Clause 1 makes it clear that a share originates from a single portion or two portions, depending on whether the original beneficiary of the portion is a male or female heir of the Settlor. Thus, that Clause 3(7) repeats the words “two portions or a single portion” without including the words “or part thereof” after the word “portion” shows that the Settlement does not contemplate the failure of a <span class="font-italic">share </span>within a portion, unless the share constitutes the entirety of the portion. My view is reinforced by the fact that nowhere in Clause 3(7) are <span class="font-italic">parts </span>of a portion referred to, and portions are always referred to as a whole (be it a single portion or two portions).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In this regard, I do not agree with Prof Tang’s observation that the interchanging use of the terms “one portion” and “single portion” in the Settlement suggests that “one portion” refers to the Settlor’s children’s entitlement, while “single portion” refers to the Settlor’s grandchildren’s entitlement.

</div> Apart from giving no regard to the great-grandchildren of the Settlor, such a reading suggests that <span class="font-italic">every single </span>child of the Settlor <span class="font-italic">must </span>have left issue. Otherwise, their portion would be held in abeyance indefinitely, since Clause 3(7) only refers to a “single portion”, and never to “one portion”. Furthermore, if the Settlor indeed intended a “single portion” to refer to his grandchildren’s interest, why did “two portions” apply irrespective of whether he was referring to his children or grandchildren? In other words, why did the Settlor <span class="font-italic">never </span>utilise the term “double portion” to refer to his grandchildren’s interest? I thus find that “one portion” and “single portion” were used interchangeably to mean the same thing in the Settlement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 With respect, I am also unable to agree with the opinion of Mr Eric Choa (“Mr Choa”), tendered in 1980, in which he opined that Clause 3(7) of the Settlement operates to support the pari passu approach.

</div> or if there are no remaining issue under the portion(s). In such a case, Clause 3(7) of the Settlement provides that such a portion is to be extinguished and the “number of portions into which the net income shall thenceforth be divisible shall be accordingly reduced and the amount of each remaining portion accordingly increased”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Therefore, the branch interpretation is to be preferred. Shafeeq’s share shall remain within his mother Aisha’s portion, in the sense that it accrues to his siblings, who are the surviving issue of Aisha. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 This accords with the plain wording of Clause 3(3), which provides that “the Trustees shall hold the same portion [being Aisha’s portion] of the net income for her issue then living or born afterwards”, provided that “a child of such daughter [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, of Aisha] shall take during his or her life to the exclusion of and not concurrently with his or her issue”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 For completeness, I find the cases of <span class="font-italic">In re Tate </span>[1914] 2 Ch 182 (“<span class="font-italic">Tate</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">In re Hey’s Settlement Trusts </span>[1945] 1 Ch 294 (“<span class="font-italic">Heys</span>”), which were cases relied on by the applicant, to be irrelevant to the facts of this case. In <span class="font-italic">Tate, </span>the testator had died, leaving three children, namely Elijah, Emile, and Frances, surviving him. Emile died shortly after the testator, leaving one child, who inherited her share under the will. Frances subsequently died without issue. The question was whether Frances’ one-third share was to be divisible in equal shares between Emile’s issue and Elijah, or whether it was payable exclusively to Elijah. Sargant J held that, on his construction of the will, it was clear that Emile’s issue substituted her in respect of the shares, and that Emile’s issue was thus “equally so substituted in respect of an accruing share [from Frances] given over by way of cross-remainder” (<span class="font-italic">Tate </span>at 185). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 In <span class="font-italic">Heys</span>, the similar question of cross-remainder arose, and the Judge agreed with Sargant J’s reasoning in <span class="font-italic">Tate </span>(<span class="font-italic">Heys </span>at 303–304), holding therefore that if a child of the testator died without issue, “her share will thenceforth be divisible among the surviving children and the issue of any child then dead leaving issue” (<span class="font-italic">Heys </span>at 306). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Therefore, <span class="font-italic">Heys </span>and <span class="font-italic">Tate </span>both stand for the proposition that remoter issue (being the issue of the original beneficiaries) can substitute the original beneficiaries, and thus obtain by accrual the share of another original beneficiary who passes without leaving issue. This is referred to as a “cross-remainder”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 This question does not arise in the present case, as none of Shafeeq’s siblings has passed. Hence, there is no claim for Shafeeq’s share from any remoter issue with a share stemming from Aisha’s portion. In any case, should the question of a “cross-remainder” arise in future (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>upon the passing of Shafeeq’s siblings), Clause 3(3) is clear that such remoter issue “shall take by substitution the share whether original or accruing which such issue’s parent [being Shafeeq’s siblings] if living would for the time being have taken in the same portion of the net income.” Hence, Shafeeq’s nephews and nieces would simply inherit the shares of their parent, whether original or as accrued from Shafeeq. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 I will hear parties on the consequential orders, and the question of costs at a later date.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Vincent Hoong  <br/>Judicial Commissioner  </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Mak Wei Munn and Ong Hui Fen, Rachel (Allen &amp; Gledhill LLP) for the applicant;<br/>Daryl Ong Hock Chye and Valerie Seow Wei-Li (LawCraft LLC) for the first and second respondents;<br/>Lem Jit Min Andy and Ng Hua Meng, Marcus (Eversheds Harry Elias LLP) for the third to sixth respondents. </div><div class="HN-CaseName text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
