<p align="left" xmlns=""><font color="#800000"><u><strong>GROUNDS OF DECISION</strong></u></font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b><font size="4">
<p align="justify"></p></font><font size="3">INTRODUCTION</font>
<p></p></b></i><font size="3" xmlns="">1.    The Plaintiff Datawork Pte Ltd (Datawork) is a

company incorporated in Singapore and carries on business, inter alia, as a manufacturer and

distributor of computer related products.</font><i xmlns=""><b>
<p></p></b></i><font size="3" xmlns="">2.    The Defendant Cyberinc Pte Ltd (Cyberinc) is

also a company incorporated in Singapore and carries on business, inter alia, as a manufacturer of

computer and telecommunication apparatus.</font>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">3.    In about January 2000, the parties entered into an agreement

in which Cyberinc appointed Datawork as the sole distributor of certain products of Cyberinc called

Z-station, Z-media and Z-pac. The Z-pac comprised one Z-station and one or

two Z-media. It is a mobile hand-held karaoke device.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">4.    The relevant terms of the Distributorship Agreement were:</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">        (a) The distributorship

would be for a minimum of six months plus one month.</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(b) The minimum purchase quantity by Datawork was 3,000 units of

  Z-pac. If this target was reached, the      distributorship would

  continue for another six months with another minimum quantity to be purchased.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">        (c) The commencement

date of the sole distributorship was the date of the first delivery of the products.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">        (d) Datawork was

obliged to order 1,000 units of Z-pac for the first three months.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">5.    There was also a provision i.e Clause 5 of Cyberincs

obligations (Clause 5) which provided for Cyberinc to buy the unsold units from Datawork and

its dealers should Cyberinc terminate the distributorship prior to its expiry. In view of the

emphasis which Datawork placed on this provision, I set it out below:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p> <font size="3">5)    In the event that CyberInc Pte Ltd decides to early

    terminate the sole distributorship agreement with Datawork Pte Ltd, it will have to buy up all

    the remaining stock of the product from Datawork Pte Ltd and its dealers (if Datawork Pte Ltd

    deems necessary) at the same price Datawork Pte Ltd has paid to CyberInc Pte Ltd.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">6.    It was common ground that the first delivery of the products

was on 31 March 2000. Hence the Distributorship Agreement commenced then and expired on 31 October

2000.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">7.    Datawork alleged that:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(a) In breach of the Distributorship Agreement, Cyberinc

  appointed TV Media Pte Ltd (TV Media) on or about September 2000 to distribute and/or sell

  and/or market the products.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(b) In so doing, Cyberinc had evidenced an intention not to be

  bound by the Distributorship Agreement and had repudiated the same.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(c) By an e-mail dated 5 October 2000, Datawork had accepted the

  repudiation and required Cyberinc to re-purchase the unsold products still in the possession of

  Datawork and/or its dealers.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3"> (d) The acceptance of the repudiation was repeated on 12

  December 2000 by a letter from Dataworks solicitors to Datawork.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">8.    Thus, in so far as the remaining products in the possession

of Datawork and its dealers had not yet been paid for by Datawork, Cyberinc was effectively to take

them back through the re-purchase. In so far as such products had already been paid for by Datawork,

Cyberinc had to pay for them in its re-purchase.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">9.    There was also a claim for miscellaneous expenses but this

was eventually resolved when the parties appeared before me. Hence, I need say no more about it.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">10.    The defence was that Datawork was granted only a sole

distributorship instead of an exclusive distributorship. This meant that while Cyberinc could not

legally have appointed another distributor, it could sell the products itself or through its own

agents. Cyberinc had contracted with TV Media to, inter alia, produce a TV commercial to promote the

products. TV Media would also sell the products at its outlets and such sales were made on behalf of

Cyberinc for which TV Media would receive a commission.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">11.    Cyberinc also alleged that Datawork was estopped from

alleging any breach by Cyberinc and that Datawork had acquiesced in Cyberincs intention to

contract with TV Media. This was because Dataworks SC Ang had known of and had agreed to the

same.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">12.    Lastly, Cyberinc denied that it was obliged to re-purchase

the remaining products in the possession of Datawork and its dealers under Clause 5 as Cyberinc did

not terminate the Distributorship Agreement.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">13.    Cyberinc also counterclaimed:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(a) payment from Datawork for the unpaid purchase price of 400

  Z-pac units which had been delivered to Datawork,</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(b) damages for 600 units which Datawork had ordered but did not

  want delivery of,</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(c) damages for failure to order a minimum quantity of 3,000

  units.</font></p>
</ol>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">TRIAL JUDGES DECISION</font></p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">14.    The trial judge, District Judge Tan Peck Cheng, decided that

Cyberinc was in breach of contract and there was no acquiescence by Datawork. However she also

concluded that Clause 5 requiring Cyberinc to re-purchase the products from Datawork did not apply

because it was not Cyberinc who terminated the Distributorship Agreement but Datawork and the

provision applied only in the former, but not the latter, situation.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">15.    The trial judge also decided that Datawork suffered only

nominal damages as its sales of the products were not doing well in any event.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">16.    Accordingly, the trial judge fixed the damages for Cyberincs

breach at S$2,500 to be paid by Cyberinc to Datawork and dismissed the other reliefs sought by

Datawork. She also granted judgment against Datawork to pay Cyberinc the purchase price of the 400

units delivered but not yet paid for. The rest of the reliefs sought by Cyberinc were disallowed.

Datawork was required to pay costs to Cyberinc which the trial judge fixed at S$18,000.</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">THE APPEALS</font></p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">17.    Datawork appealed to the High Court against that part of the

trial judges decision which:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(a) ordered payment of only $2,500 to Datawork as damages,</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(b) dismissed the other reliefs sought by Datawork,</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(c) granted Cyberinc judgment for the purchase price of the 400

  units, and</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(d) costs.</font></p>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">18.    Cyberinc also appealed to the High Court. Its appeal was

against that part of the decision which:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(a) ordered Cyberinc to pay $2,500 as damages to Datawork,</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(b) disallowed the rest of the reliefs sought by Cyberinc, and</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(c) the quantum of costs fixed by the trial judge.</font></p>
</ol>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">MY DECISION</font></p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">19.    Both appeals were heard by me on 13 May 2002. After hearing

arguments, I dismissed the appeal by Datawork and allowed the appeal by Cyberinc in part (because

Cyberincs computation of the balance number of units to make up the minimum quantity was

incorrect). My decision meant that:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(a) Cyberinc was not in breach of contract and did not have to

  pay any damages to Datawork.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(b) Cyberinc was still entitled to be paid for the 400 units

  delivered to Datawork (an earlier batch of 300 units had been delivered and paid for already).</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(c) Cyberinc was entitled to damages to be assessed in respect

  of 600 units which Datawork had ordered but did not want delivery of.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(d) Cyberinc was entitled to damages to be assessed for Dataworks

  failure to order 1,700 sets to make up the minimum quantity of 3,000 units.</font></p>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">20.    I also granted costs of Cyberincs appeal and of the

hearing below to Cyberinc and costs of Dataworks appeal to Cyberinc.</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">MY REASONS</font></p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">21.    Although much time and effort was spent by both Counsel for

Datawork and Cyberinc on arguments as to whether TV Media was or was not a distributor of Cyberinc

and the interpretation of Clause 5, I decided the appeals on the ground that Datawork was estopped

from alleging that Cyberinc was in breach of contract. Datawork had also acquiesced in the

appointment of TV Media by Cyberinc to promote and sell the products.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">22.    On this issue, the trial judge had ruled against Cyberinc. I

set out below the reasons why I reached the opposite conclusion.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">23.    Mr Tan Peng Khoon (PK Tan) had joined Cyberinc in

September 1999. He was its Marketing Director. The managing director was Mr Ng Kai Kong (KK Ng).</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">24.    Datawork is run by PK Tans sister Lucillia Tan Sok Cheng,

also referred to as SC Ang, and their brother Larry Tan. It was PK Tan who introduced Datawork to

Cyberinc as his sisters company. At all material times, all parties were aware of PK Tans

relationship with SC Ang.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">25.    Consequently the Distributorship Agreement was entered into.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">26.    SC Ang did not dispute that she was aware of Cyberincs

intention to use TV Media to promote and sell the products. Indeed, she learned of this from a

meeting with KK Ng and her brother PK Tan. However she claimed that she had thought that TV Media

would be buying the products from Datawork and not from Cyberinc.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">27.    In her Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief (AEIC), she said

at paras 32 and 33:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font size="3">32. Sometime in or around the 2<sup>nd</sup> or 3<sup>rd</sup>

  week of September 2000, KK Ng and my brother came to the Plaintiffs    offices

  to discuss advertising the Defendants products on television. They informed me that the

  Defendant was          intending to advertise on

  television through TV Media . He gave me the impression that TV Media would

  be          producing the advertisements and selling

  the Defendants products at their retail outlets as well as through mail

  order     and that any sales by TV Media would be made from stock purchased

  from the Plaintiff. In effect, the

  impression          which he gave me was that TV

  Media would purchase its stock from the Plaintiff directly. Given the practice in

  the        previous marketing efforts outlined above and our

  understanding of both parties obligations under the

  Distribution         Agreement, I naturally assumed that

  this would continue to be the case.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">33. I was therefore quite pleased when I heard the news from KK

  Ng and my brother as I believed that our sales        

  would improve after the advertisements. I had no reason to object to the advertisements as I

  understood that the           terms of the

  Distribution Agreement would be adhered to by the Defendant.</font></p>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">28.    KK Ngs evidence on this point was in para 42 of his AEIC

where he said:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font size="3">42. Thus, sometime in August 2000, PK, SC Ang and I had a

  meeting to discuss advertising through TV Media.  I recall that SC Ang was pleased to hear

  about the advertisement. She felt that any efforts to promote the product would be worth trying.

  She also expressed the view that if the product was put into the

  market,        <u>albeit by the Defendant</u>, it would still

  increase awareness of the product and possibly boost the Plaintiffs         

  own sales of the product.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">        [Emphasis added.]</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">29.    In cross-examination, KK Ng accepted that he did not know

whether SC Ang was aware that Cyberinc was selling the products directly to TV Media (NE 189). At NE

190, he also said:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font size="3">Q: Because she does not know TV Media getting (sic) for

  defendant</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">A: That is possible but not 100% sure.</font></p>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">30.    PK Tan did not have an AEIC. He gave evidence for Datawork,

and not Cyberinc which he had by then left. He said that SC Ang was told that TV Media was being

used to help promote her sales (NE 72). He claimed that Cyberinc did not tell Datawork that it would

be selling the products directly to TV Media. If it had told Datawork, Datawork would have jumped

(NE 74). He was the one who had negotiated with TV Media on behalf of Cyberinc and who signed the

agreement with TV Media but he claimed that the agreement with TV Media was a breach by Cyberinc of

the Distributorship Agreement. He alleged that he did not protest to KK Ng because of fear over his

own salary (NE 102).</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">31.    The trial judges conclusion was as follows:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font size="3">21. . With regard to paragraph 20(a), Mr K K Ngs

  evidence was that he did not tell Mdm Lucilla Tan ("Mrs S C Ang") that TV Media would be

  purchasing the products directly from the defendant or showed Mrs S C Ang the agreement with TV

  Media. He was not sure if Mrs S C Ang was aware. He assumed that the plaintiff must have known. He

  was asked if it was reasonable for Mrs S C Ang to assume that TV Media would obtain the products

  from her, he replied that it was. Mrs S C Ang in her evidence stated that she knew that the

  defendant was speaking to TV Media. She was pleased because she assumed that TV Media would be

  buying from her. I found Mrs S C Angs evidence credible and that there is no evidence to show

  that the plaintiff had acquiesced to the relationship between the defendant and TV Media.</font></p>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">32.    I found it difficult to accept that PK Tan had thought that

what Cyberinc was doing was in breach of the Distributorship Agreement and that he went ahead to

negotiate and sign the agreement on behalf of Cyberinc with TV Media without even attempting to

advise KK Ng that this would cause a breach of the Distributorship Agreement or informing his own

sister, whom he had introduced to Cyberinc, about the true situation. After all, there was no

evidence that KK Ng was trying to hide the truth about the sales from Cyberinc to TV Media and, in

any event, he would have been foolish to think that he could get away with it given that he knew PK

Tans relationship with SC Ang.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">33.    Secondly, KK Ng did not say that it was reasonable for SC

Ang to assume that TV Media would obtain the products from Datawork. All he said was that it was

possible that she had this assumption but he was not 100% sure (see NE 190 which I cited in para 29

above). In any event, even if KK Ng had said what was attributed to him by the trial judge, that

would have been merely an opinion of his and not evidence of a fact which he had personal knowledge

of.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">34.    Thirdly, and most importantly, the evidence of SC Ang as to

when she first came to know that TV Media was obtaining the products directly from Cyberinc was

highly improbable and was also contradicted by documentary evidence. I elaborate below.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">35.    In SC Angs AEIC, paras 34 to 35, she said:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font size="3">34. On 24 September 2000, I saw the advertisement screened by

  TV Media on television for the first time. I clearly    recall that the

  advertisement stated that the Defendants products were being sold through the retail

  outlets              

  operated by TV Media. No mention was made of the Plaintiff or its authorised dealers.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">35. <u>I expected TV Media to contact the Plaintiff shortly

  after the advertisement was screened</u>. As explained previously, I had been given the impression

  that we would be supplying TV Media with the Defendants products which

  TV          Media managed to sell. However, nothing

  was heard from TV Media even after the advertisement was screened. I     

  made several unsuccessful attempts to contact KK Ng and PK Tan to ask for an explanation. <u>Finally</u>,

  PK Tan          returned my calls sometime towards

  the end of September 2000. It was only <u>then</u> that he informed me that

  the          Defendant had been selling directly to

  TV Media and by passing the Plaintiff.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">[Emphasis added.]</font></p>
</ol>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">First sub-point</font></p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">36.    It was common ground that SC Ang had considerable experience

in her business. Yet, when she learned that TV Media would be appointed, she did not ask KK Ng or PK

Tan as to when she should contact TV Media or when TV Media would be contacting Datawork to order

the products from Datawork. There was also no query by her about the volume and timing of the

purchases by TV Media from Datawork which would in turn affect the volume and timing of purchases by

Datawork from Cyberinc. I found this lack of interest telling. It suggested that she must have known

all along that TV Media were obtaining the products directly from Cyberinc.</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">Second sub-point</font></p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">37.    I found it incredulous that SC Ang could have been under the

impression that TV Media would be contacting Datawork shortly after she noticed an advertisement by

TV Media on television on 24 September 2000. The advertising campaign had already begun. The public

were being urged to buy from TV Media. There was no suggestion that the public were told that the

products would be on sale only in the future. Therefore the advertisements would suggest that the

products were immediately available from TV Media. It was quite absurd for SC Ang to suggest that

while the public were going to TV Medias outlets to buy the products, TV Media would not have the

products and had still not contacted her to obtain the products. Indeed, by then, there was still no

discussion between TV Media and Datawork even on the price which TV Media was supposed to pay for

the products from Datawork. How then would TV Media know what price to adopt for its sales to the

public?</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">Third sub-point</font></p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">38.    SC Angs assertion that she had assumed that TV Media

would be contacting Datawork shortly after the advertisement to obtain the products was contradicted

by a second e-mail from her on 5 October 2000, there being two e-mail from her on that day.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">39.    For completeness, I set out below the first e-mail she sent

on 5 October 2000 at 10:58am and the second e-mail she sent on the same day at 2:44pm.</font>

  $500,000 paid up capital company. They have already bought 4 sets of Z-station, normal version

  from us at $257.50/= each and tested it. Now, they are coming back to us on this proposal which I

  think is a good opportunity to create the awareness but of course with modifications and

<p align="justify"><font size="3">Second e-mail</font></p>
</u>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">Subject: Termination of sole distributorship of Z-station in

  Singapore</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">Dear KK &amp; PK</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">On 24<sup>th</sup> September 2000, TV Media Pte Ltd has begun

  the screening of its advertisement of Z-station on TCS - channel 5. This <u>meant</u> that

  Cyberinc would have sold the Z-station to them <u>much earlier on</u>. This in turn meant that

  Cyberinc has broken one of the major clauses in the letter of understanding. Under the term

  duration of sole distributorship and quantity commitment of the letter of understanding, it stated

  the sole distributorship will be for a minimum period of seven months beginning from the date of

  first receipt of the stock of Z-station from Cyberinc which is 30<sup>th</sup> March 2000. The

  exclusive period should only expire on 29-10-2000. This demonstrated the fact that Cyberinc has

  decided to terminate the sole distributorship agreement.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">Under number 5 of the list of things that Cyber Inc Pte Ltd must

  do as stated in the letter of understanding is as follows: in the event that CyberInc Pte Ltd

  decides to early terminate the sole distributorship agreement with Datawork Pte Ltd, it will have

  to buy up all the remaining stock of the product from Datawork Pte Ltd and its dealers (If

  Datawork Pte Ltd deems necessary) at the same price Datawork Pte Ltd has paid to CyberInc Pte Ltd.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">We have thought about the past few months business relationship

  with your company and the above-mentioned clause, we have decided to exercise it, i.e to demand

  CyberInc Pte Ltd to buy up the remaining stock of Datawork and its dealers. However if CyberInc

  would like to continue to sell to the dealers, Datawork, with the consent of the dealers, will go

  with CyberInc to visit the dealers to expedite the taking over of dealers.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">We look forward to (<i>sic</i>) letting us know when we can

  return the products to your company and also about your decision with regards to the dealers.

  Thank you.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">Yours truly,</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">S.C.Ang</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">Datawork Pte Ltd</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">[Emphasis added.]</font></p>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">40.    The second e-mail from SC Ang clearly stated that when TV

Media had begun to screen the advertisement, This <u>meant</u> that Cyberinc would have sold the

Z-station to them <u>much earlier on</u> [my emphasis]. This was a logical assertion but it

contradicted what SC Ang had said in her AEIC.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">41.    Mr David Chan, Counsel for Datawork, submitted that this

sentence in the second e-mail was the result of SC Angs subsequent telephone discussion with PK

Tan in which PK Tan informed her that Cyberinc had been selling direct to TV Media and by-passing

Datawork. However, the second e-mail did not attribute this knowledge to any telephone discussion

with PK Tan. On the contrary, the second e-mail attributed this knowledge to logic and there was no

mention of any recent telephone discussion with PK Tan.</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">Fourth sub-point</font></p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">42.    The first e-mail from SC Ang on 5 October 2000 to PK Tan and

KK Ng was also revealing. It reinforced a point made by Ms Valerie Tan, Counsel for Cyberinc, that

Datawork was having difficulty in effecting sales of the products and was looking for a way out.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">43.    The first e-mail suggested that Datawork was going to make a

proposal and there was no hint therein that Datawork had thought that Cyberinc was in breach of

contract even though, by then, 10 to 11 days had lapsed after SC Ang had first noticed the

advertisement of TV Media on 24 September 2000 and TV Media had not contacted Datawork to make

purchases.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">44.    About 3 hours later, the substance and tone of the second

e-mail was significantly different. The heading of the second e-mail was also different from the

first. The second e-mail was not the anticipated follow-up from the first. In my view, Datawork had

by then changed its mind and decided to use the sale by TV Media as an excuse to get out of the

Distributorship Agreement and to require Cyberinc to re-purchase the products in the possession of

Datawork and its dealers.</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">Summary</font></p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">45.    With respect, the trial judge did not consider the points I

have mentioned above and the two e-mail from SC Ang of 5 October 2000. In my view, her conclusion

was plainly wrong.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">46.    In the circumstances, it was clear to me that SC Ang and

Datawork were aware and had acquiesced in TV Medias involvement in the promotion of the products

as well as the purchase thereof from Cyberinc. They were even enthusiastic about the involvement of

TV Media as they had thought that this would give a boost to their own flagging sales. Datawork was

also estopped from alleging a breach of contract arising from the sales of the products by Cyberinc

to TV Media.</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">SUBSEQUENT DEVELOPMENTS - SUMMONS-IN-CHAMBERS NO 600900 OF 2002</font></p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">47.    Subsequent to my decision, Datawork sought to appeal against

my decision.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">48.    Section 34(2) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap

322) (SCJA) states:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(2) Except with the leave of the Court of Appeal or a Judge,

  no appeal shall be brought to the Court of Appeal in any of the following cases:</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">        (a) where the amount

  or value of the subject-matter at the trial is $250,000 </font></p>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">49.    It was common ground that the jurisdiction of the District

Court is $250,000 and that this figure was inserted as an amendment in the SCJA to meet the increase

in the jurisdiction of the District Court to $250,000.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">50.    In view of s 34(2), Datawork applied for leave to appeal

against my decision to the Court of Appeal by way of Summons-in-Chambers No 600900 of 2002. However,

at the first hearing of this application on 31 May 2002, Mr Vinodh Coomaraswamy, who was appearing

with Mr David Chan for Datawork, made an oral application for a declaration that no leave was

necessary. However, if leave was necessary, then, he would seek leave to appeal. As this oral

application took his opponent by surprise, I adjourned the application to a date to be fixed.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">51.    At the next hearing on 12 June 2002, Mr Coomaraswamy

proceeded with both points. After hearing arguments, I decided that leave was required but that no

such leave should be granted. Accordingly, I dismissed the application with costs.</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">ARGUMENTS FOR DATAWORK</font></p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">52.    As I have mentioned, Mr Coomaraswamys first position was

that no leave was required under s 34(2) SCJA. He mounted his argument in the following manner.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">53.    In Dataworks claim, it was seeking:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(a) a declaration that Cyberinc was obliged to purchase the

  unsold products held by Datawork and its dealers    pursuant to the Clause 5 which

  I have mentioned</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">        (b) an order that

Cyberinc pay US$32,819 for the purchase under Clause 5</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">        (c) alternatively,

damages for loss suffered as a result of Cyberincs breach of the Distributorship Agreement.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">54.    In Cyberincs counterclaim, it was seeking:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(a) US$58,318.60 being the price of the 400 units of Z-pac which

  had been delivered to Datawork but had remained unpaid</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">        (b) damages for

Dataworks failure to purchase 1,000 units of Z-pac within the first three months</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">        (c) damages for

Dataworks failure to order the minimum quantity of 3,000 units.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">55.    Cyberinc had alleged that its damages exceeded S$250,000 but

as its counterclaim was filed in the District Court and not in the High Court, the District Court

would not grant it judgment and the assessment would not be for a sum which would exceed $250,000,

after taking into account the US$58,318.60.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">56.    Mr Coomaraswamy submitted that as Cyberincs damages had

not yet been assessed, I should adopt the maximum amount under the District Court jurisdiction as

the putative amount of its damages, including the US$58,318.60. Taking the difference between this

maximum amount i.e S$250,000 on the one hand and the US$32,819 which Datawork itself was claiming on

the other hand, the resultant figure would be in excess of S$250,000. This was the value of the

subject matter for the purpose of s 34(2)(a) and, therefore, no leave to appeal was required.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">57.    Mr Coomaraswamy relied on 2 cases, <i>Augustine &amp; anor v

Goh Siam Yong</i> <nobr>[1992] 1 SLR 767</nobr> and the Malaysian case of <i>Yai Yen Hon v Teng Ah Kok &amp; Sim

Huat Sdn Bhd </i><nobr>[1997] 1 MLJ 136</nobr>.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">58.    In the <i>Augustine </i>case, the respondent commenced an

action in the Magistrates Court to recover damages in respect of a traffic accident. The

appellants did not enter an appearance and the respondent obtained interlocutory judgment with

damages to be assessed. Such damages were assessed by a deputy registrar of the subordinate courts

at $4,780.89. The appellants appealed to a district judge-in-chambers who reduced the damages to

$1,177.50. The respondent filed a notice of appeal to the High Court against the reduced assessment.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">59.    The appellants applied to strike out the notice of appeal on

the ground that under O 55 r 1(5) of the Subordinate Courts Rules 1986, the respondent had no right

of appeal. This application was heard by the Deputy Registrar of the High Court who made no order on

the application so as to allow the respondent to apply to a judge of the High Court for a

declaration that she had such a right of appeal. After hearing arguments, that declaration was made

and the appellants then appealed to the Court of Appeal against that declaration.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">60.    The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal because O 55 r 1(5)

was ultra vives the then s 21 SCJA. The arguments and the ruling on the effect of the then s 21 SCJA

on O 55 r 1(5) were not relevant to the case before me. However, one of the arguments raised by the

appellants in that case was that the respondent would in any event require leave to appeal under the

then s 21(1) SCJA. That provision stated:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(1) Subject to the provisions of this or any other written

  law, an appeal shall lie to the High Court from a decision of a  District Court or Magistrates

  Court in any suit or action for the recovery of immovable property or in any

  civil           cause or matter where the amount

  in dispute or the value of the subject matter exceeds $2,000 or with the leave

  of      the High Court if under that amount.</font></p>
</ol>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">The appellants there contended that since the district

judge-in-chambers had reduced the damages to $1,177.50, that was the amount in dispute. The

Court of Appeal disagreed with that contention and held that as the respondent was disputing the

reduction in the original order made by the deputy registrar, the amount in dispute was the

difference between the $4,780.89 assessed by the deputy registrar and the $1,177.50 allowed by the

district judge i.e $3,603.39.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">61.    However the facts in that case were different from those

before me. First, the provisions were different, i.e one pertained to the then s 21(1) SCJA while

the present case pertained to the current s 34(2)(a) SCJA which was a different provision.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">62.    Secondly, and more importantly, that was not a case

involving a counterclaim as well.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">63.    As for the Malaysian case of <i>Yai Yen Hon</i>, that case

was one in which leave to appeal was required when the amount or value of the subject matter of

the claim was less than RM100,000. There, the plaintiffs claim was well in excess of RM100,000

but the High Court gave judgment to the plaintiff for RM62,400. The Federal Court held that whether

or not there was a right of appeal depended on the value of the claim and not the amount given by

the trial judge.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">64.    As can be seen, the provision in that case was different and

the facts were also different. Again, there was no counterclaim there.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">65.    In addition, it seemed to me that despite Mr Coomaraswamys

submission, his approach was not one in which the difference between what Datawork might obtain and

what Cyberinc might obtain is taken. What he had done was to add the two together to derive a higher

figure in excess of $250,000.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">66.    As for the existence of the counterclaim, Mr Coomaraswamy

submitted that even though there was a counterclaim by Cyberinc, this arose from the same facts and

it was not possible to separate one from the other. He stressed that I should take into account the

entire subject matter of the suit and not just the value of Dataworks claim. According to him,

the reference to a trial in s 34(2) SCJA includes a case where there is a claim and

counterclaim heard in one trial.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">67.    Mr Coomaraswamy further submitted that this was not a case

in which Datawork might obtain judgment for US$32,819 on the one hand, and, on the other hand,

Cyberinc might obtain judgment for US$58,318.60 and damages so that the amount adjudged to Datawork

would effectively abate the amount adjudged to Cyberinc. It was like an all or nothing scenario.

Either Datawork would obtain judgment for US$32,819 or Cyberinc would obtain judgment for

US$58,318.60 and damages. In his submission, this reinforced his argument that the difference

between what Datawork might obtain and what Cyberinc might obtain was the amount or value of the

subject matter at the trial.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">68.    Mr Coomaraswamys alternative position was that if leave

to appeal was required, then such leave ought to be granted to Datawork.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">69.    In <i>Lee Kuan Yew v Tang Liang Hong </i><nobr>[1997] 3 SLR 489</nobr>,

the Court of Appeal considered whether leave to appeal should be granted in respect of an order of

costs under s 34(2)(b) SCJA. After referring to Justice Lai Kew Chais judgment in <i>Anthony s/o

Savarimiuthu v Soh Chuan Tin </i><nobr>[1989] SLR 607</nobr>, Chief Justice Yong Pung How enunciated three limbs

to be considered when leave to appeal is sought:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(a) prima facie case of error,</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(b) question of general principle decided for the first time,</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(c) question of importance upon which further argument and a

  decision of a higher tribunal would be to the public advantage.</font></p>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">70.    Mr Coomaraswamy submitted that there was a prime facie case

of error of law or an important question of law for the Court of Appeal to decide. It was not clear

to me whether the latter was under the second or third limb enunciated by Yong CJ.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">71.    As regards the alleged important question of law, Mr

Coomaraswamy submitted that it was important to establish how the High Court, sitting as an

intermediate appellate court, should approach findings of fact by a District Court. According to

him, the High Court, as an appellate court, may be required to approach findings of facts

differently from the Court of Appeal as the latter was the final appellate court. While the Court of

Appeal can in certain situations find itself to be in as good a position as the trial judge to

determine facts, Mr Coomaraswamy was suggesting that the High Court, sitting as an appellate court,

should be even slower to find itself in as good a position as the trial judge to determine facts. He

submitted that while the precise test for the High Court was difficult to formulate, the High Court

should only reverse the finding of a trial judge if the finding was manifestly erroneous or in some

way perverse. He emphasized that the High Courts intermediate role will become more important as

the jurisdiction of the District Court increases in future.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">72.    As regards the alleged error of law, Mr Coomaraswamy relied

on two local cases for the proposition that a trial judges finding of fact should not be

disturbed unless he was plainly wrong. They were <i>Seah Ting Soon v Indonesian Tractors Co Pte Ltd</i>
<nobr>[2001] 1 SLR 521</nobr> and <i>Peh Eng Leng v Pek Eng Leong</i> <nobr>[1996] 2 SLR 305</nobr>. However, that principle

was not in issue. Besides, in the case of <i>Peh Eng Leng</i>, Karthigesu JA said that the evidence

of a witness should be tested against inherent probabilities or improbabilities and against

uncontroverted facts (see p 312 at H/I of the report). Mr Coomaraswamy did not dispute this

principle but he submitted that the finding of the trial judge would stand up to scrutiny even when

so tested.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">73.    He also relied on a decision of the Australian High Court in

<i>Baumgartner v Baumgartner</i> 76 ALR 75 for the proposition that it was not legitimate for an

appellate court to ignore the resolution of conflicting evidence by a trial judge and to draw

inferences from the surrounding area of common ground only.</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">ARGUMENTS FOR CYBERINC</font></p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">74.    Ms Tan submitted that as regards the issue whether leave to

appeal was required, Dataworks own application was initially for leave to be granted.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">75.    Secondly, she relied on s 9A (1) Interpretation Act (Cap 1)

which provides that:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font size="3">9A. (1) In the interpretation of a provision of a written

  law, an interpretation that would promote the purpose or object underlying the written law

  (whether that purpose or object is expressly stated in the written law or not) shall be preferred

  to an interpretation that would not promote that purpose or object.</font></p>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">76.    Thirdly, under s 9A(3), a speech made in Parliament by a

Minister on the occasion of the moving of a Bill and any relevant material in any official record of

debates in Parliament could be considered in the interpretation of a provision of written law.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">77.    She then referred to the speech of the Minister of Law on s

34(2)(a) as cited in the judgment of L P Thean JA in <i>Spandeck Engineering (S) Pte Ltd v Yong

Qiang Construction</i> <nobr>[1999] 4 SLR 401</nobr> and Thean JAs summary of the purpose of s 34(2)(a):</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font size="3">15 Prior to the amendments made by the Supreme Court of

  Judicature (Amendment) Act 1998, s 34(2) read as follows:</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(2) Except with the leave of the Court of Appeal or a Judge, no

  appeal shall be brought to the Court of Appeal in any   of the following cases:</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">        (a) where the amount

  or value of the subject-matter at the trial is $30,000 or less;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">The amending Act of 1998 amended para (a) by deleting the sum of

  $30,000 and substituting therefor the words $250,000 or such other amount as may be

  specified by an order made under subsection (3). All that the amendment did was to increase the

  monetary limit from $30,000 to $250,000 and no other changes were made. However, the underlying

  purpose of this amendment was to bring it in line with the jurisdiction of the District Court. The

  jurisdiction of the District Court had as from 1 August 1997, been increased to $250,000 and the

  amendment made to s 34(2)(a) in 1998 was to bring it in line with the increased jurisdiction of

  the District Court and to allow an appeal to be brought to this court only where leave to appeal

  is obtained from this court or a judge of the High Court. This was evident from the speech of the

  Minister for Law, Professor Jayakumar, when he moved the Second Reading of the Supreme Court of

  Judicature (Amendment) Bill on 26 November 1998. He said:</font></p>
</ol>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">On 1 August 1997, the District Courts jurisdiction in civil

    matters was raised from $100,000 to $250,000  In view of the enhanced District Courts

    jurisdiction to $250,000 in civil matters, the Chief Justice has proposed that the existing

    $30,000 limit in s 34(2)(a) be raised to $250,000. In other words, bring its limit in line with

    the enhancement. If the limit is not raised to $250,000, District Court cases of less than

    $250,000 can first go on appeal to the High Court and then Court of Appeal. This would strain

    the limited resources of the Court of Appeal.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font size="3">16    It seemed to us abundantly clear that the

  intention of Parliament in making the amendment to s 34(2)(a) of the SCJA was to limit the right

  of appeal to this court. Hence, in any appeal from the decision of the High Court, in which the

  value of the subject matter involved does not exceed $250,000, leave to appeal must be obtained

  either from this court or a judge of the High Court.</font></p>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">78.    To reinforce the above summary, Ms Tan referred to a speech

by a Member of Parliament Mr R. Ravindran in the Singapore Parliament Report when the appropriate

Bill was being debated. In Parliament No 9, Session No 1, Volume No 69, Sitting No 11 of 26 November

1998, Mr Ravindran said (at column 1634):</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font size="3">Sir, the effect of the present limits is that cases within

  the jurisdiction of the Magistrates Court are appealable as of right to the High Court, but are

  not appealable as of right to the Court of Appeal. This is a two-tier system. This position is

  satisfactory, as there is no real need for a three tier-system for Magistrate Court suits.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">Sir, cases within the jurisdiction of the District Courts are

  appealable as of right to the High Court and are also appealable as of right to the Court of

  Appeal. This position is unsatisfactory as there is a three-tier system and it is not something

  that is really needed. Indeed, the proposed amendments may have been intended to do away with this

  anomaly. Cases within the jurisdiction of the High Court are appealable as of right to the Court

  of Appeal. Here again, there is a two tier system. This position is satisfactory and was

  consciously adopted with the cessation of appeals to the Privy Council.</font></p>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">79.    It seemed to me that this view was implicit in the intention

to limit the right of appeal from a decision of the District Court to primarily the High Court.

Indeed this was also recognised by Chao Hick Tin JA in para 13 of his judgment in <i>Tan Chiang

Brothers Marble (S) Pte Ltd v Permasteelisa Pacific Holdings Ltd</i> <nobr>[2002] 2 SLR 225</nobr> where he

said,  Implicit in the scheme of things is that there should, as a rule, be only one tier of

appeal ..</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">80.    As for the argument that the court should assume, for

present purposes, that Cyberinc would obtain the maximum sum under the District Courts

jurisdiction after the assessment of damages, Ms Tan submitted that it was uncertain how much

Cyberinc would actually get. She argued that Mr Coomaraswamys argument would inject uncertainty.

She also submitted that such an argument would cause an unworkable or impracticable or inconvenient

result.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">81.    Lastly, Ms Tan adopted a point from a question that I had

posed to Mr Coomaraswamy. She submitted that if the cross-claim was by way of a separate action, the

argument of Mr Coomaraswamy of taking into account each figure to obtain the difference must fail as

there were two separate actions. The fact that the cross-claim was mounted as a counterclaim in the

same action should not give rise to a different outcome.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">82.    As regards the question as to whether leave to appeal, if

required, should be granted, Ms Tan did not advance any submission thereon.</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">MY REASONS ON DATAWORKS APPLICATION</font></p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">83.    I was of the view that Mr Coomaraswamy was not wrong in

adopting the maximum sum under the District Courts jurisdiction for the purpose of his argument

in relation to s 34(2)(a). After all, Cyberinc had in its affidavit alleged its damages to be more

than the $250,000 maximum sum. The situation would be different if Cyberinc was alleging a sum much

less than the maximum for its damages. I did not think that this approach was injecting an

uncertainty or would cause an unworkable or impracticable or inconvenient result. It may be based on

an assumption but the purpose was to inject some certainty into the present application and not the

other way around. On the contrary, Ms Tans suggestion that one should wait until the assessment

was concluded would itself inject uncertainty and cause an unworkable or impracticable or

inconvenient result. This is because the dead-line to appeal will often be earlier than the

conclusion of the assessment. Furthermore, after the assessment, there might be a further appeal or

appeals. In any event, for the reasons stated below, it did not matter whether the maximum sum was

used or the actual sum granted to Cyberinc was used.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">84.    In my view, the case of <i>Augustine</i> and the Malaysian

case of <i>Yai Yen Hon</i> were not relevant for the reasons I have mentioned.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">85.    It must be borne in mind that a counterclaim is a separate

and independent action. If not for O 15 r 2(1) of the Rules of Court, a separate action would have

to be filed separately. Order 15 r 2(1), however, enables, but does not compel, the separate action

to be filed as a counterclaim in an existing action.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">86.    When the separate action is filed as a counterclaim, it does

not cease to be a separate action in substance. Thus The Supreme Court Practice 1999 Volume 1 para

15/2/4 states:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font size="3">15/2/4 <b>To what extent a counterclaim is an independent

  action</b> - A counterclaim is <u>substantially a cross-action</u>, not merely a defence to the

  plaintiffs claim. <u>It must be of such a nature that the Court would have jurisdiction to

  entertain it as a separate action</u> (<i>Bow McLachlan &amp; Co. Ltd v. Ship Camosun</i> [1909]   A.C. 597; <i>Williams v. Agius</i> [1914] A.C. 522). "A counterclaim is to be treated, for

  all purposes for which justice requires it to be so treated, as an independent action" (<i>per

  </i>Bowen L.J., in <i>Amon v. Bobbett</i> 22 Q.B.D. 543 at 548). If after the defendant has

  pleaded a counterclaim, the action of the plaintiff is for any reason stayed, discontinued or

  dismissed, the counterclaim may nevertheless be proceeded with (para. (3)). Thus, where the

  plaintiffs claim was held to be frivolous, the Court still granted the defendant the relief

  prayed for by his counterclaim (<i>Adams v. Adams</i> (1892) 45 Ch.D. 426; [1892] 1 Ch. 369). <u>In

  short, for all purposes except those of execution, a claim and a counterclaim are two independent

  actions<i> </i></u>(<i>per</i> Lord Esher M.R., in <i>Stumore v. Campbell &amp; Co. </i>[1892] 1   Q.B. 314 at 317) .</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">[Emphasis added.]</font></p>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">87.    Therefore, although, as a matter of procedural convenience,

a claim and a counterclaim are dealt with together at the same directions stage and the same trial,

they are still separate actions.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">88.    The reference in s 34(2)(a) to the amount or value of the

subject matter at the trial must, in my view, be construed as referring to the trial of an

action. In the context of a claim and counterclaim, the trial is of two actions. This interpretation

would advance the purpose of the provision which is to restrict appeals from District Court actions

to the Court of Appeal. After all, claims and counterclaims are a common feature of litigation and

it could not have been the intention of Parliament to allow such appeals to proceed to the Court of

Appeal as a matter of right when Parliaments intention was to restrict such appeals generally.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">89.    In addition, if Mr Coomaraswamys argument was accepted,

it would result in an anomaly. When the cross-claim is filed as a counterclaim, the right of appeal

to the Court of Appeal would be unimpeded. However, if there were two separate actions, the right of

appeal would be restricted. This could not be right even though I accepted that, generally, the two

actions would be consolidated before the trial. However this would not always necessarily be the

case.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">90.    As for the argument that either Datawork would obtain

payment for the price of the products already paid for or Cyberinc would obtain payment of the

unpaid purchase price and damages, I was of the view that such an argument militated against the

conclusion that Mr Coomaraswamy was advocating. In such a scenario, only the higher of the two

possible judgment sums should be taken instead of adding them up.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">91.    In any event, I was of the view that it did not matter

whether one party must succeed and the other must fail or the situation was one in which each

opposing party could succeed in its respective claims. Parliament did not intend for parties and the

courts to engage in an exercise to determine which scenario was applicable for every claim and

counterclaim in order to determine whether leave to appeal was required.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">92.    Accordingly, I concluded that Datawork was required to

obtain leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">93.    As for the issue whether leave to appeal should be granted,

I was of the view that it was not open to Mr Coomaraswamy to advance the argument about the

intermediate role of the High Court when his colleague, Mr David Chan, advanced a different argument

before me when the appeal proper to the High Court was heard by me. In summary, Mr Chan had

advocated only the trite principle that an appellate court should be slow in disturbing findings of

fact of a trial court and Ms Tan did not dispute that principle.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">94.    In any event, the High Court is, as a rule, supposed to be

the final appellate court for trials in the District Court. It is only in limited situations that an

appeal may be made to the Court of Appeal. In emphasizing the likelihood of an increase in the

District Courts jurisdiction, Mr Coomaraswamy was actually reminding me of the concern which led

to the limiting of appeals from the District Court to the Court of Appeal.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">95.    Ultimately, I was of the view that however Mr Coomaraswamy

sought to couch the applicable principle for an appellate High Court, it would not have made a

difference to my conclusion. I was of the view that the finding of the trial judge was plainly wrong

or, to use Mr Coomaraswamys words, was manifestly erroneous or perverse.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">96.    The truth of the matter was that my decision and the reasons

for my decision did not involve any important question of law for the Court of Appeal to decide.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">97.    As for whether my decision involved an error of law, I was

of the view that my decision was on the facts. However, Mr Coomaraswamy had to label it as an error

of law to improve Dataworks chances of securing leave to appeal. For the reasons I have given as

to why I reached a different conclusion from the trial judge, I could not agree that her conclusion

could stand when tested against inherent probabilities or improbabilities and against uncontroverted

facts.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">98.    I also did not think that the Australian case of <i>Baumgartner

v Baumgartner</i> took the matter any further. I did not base my decision solely on what was common

ground. With respect, my decision was based more on the application of facts and points which the

trial judge had not considered.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">99.    Accordingly, leave to appeal was refused.</font></p>
