<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       Under an agreement dated 15 September 2008
                    (“the Agreement”), the plaintiff, Serge Pun (henceforth,
                    “the Purchaser”), agreed to purchase the interests of the
                    defendant, Joy Head Investments Limited (henceforth, “the
                    Vendor”), in Winner Sight Investments Limited (“WSIL”), a
                    company incorporated in Hong Kong, for a total consideration of HK$84,974,780
                    (“the Consideration”). These interests comprised 2,000 sale shares
                    in the issued capital of WSIL and an outstanding shareholder’s loan by the
                    Vendor to WSIL (henceforth collectively “the Vendor’s interests in
                    WSIL”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The Agreement was designed primarily to bring an
                    end to earlier litigation between the Vendor and Purchaser in Suit No 225
                    of 2008 (“the Initial Action”). The details of the Initial Action
                    are not relevant for present purposes; it suffices to say that that action was
                    commenced against the Purchaser by the Vendor in respect of disputes relating to
                    the purchase of the Vendor’s interests in WSIL.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       It is common ground that the Purchaser acquired
                    the Vendor’s interests in WSIL on 15 December 2008, having earlier failed
                    to complete the transaction on 9 December 2008 as agreed (“the Agreed
                    Completion Date”). This present action concerns the Vendor’s
                    retention of S$1m which it received after it called on a performance bond
                    furnished by the Purchaser in the form of an on-demand banker’s guarantee
                    pursuant to the Agreement (“the Performance Bond”) immediately
                    following the Purchaser’s breach of the Agreement on 9 December 2008. In
                    brief, the nub of the issue between the parties is whether the Vendor is
                    entitled, as it contends, to keep the full amount paid under the Performance
                    Bond even though it had suffered no loss<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> as a result of the Purchaser’s breach of
                    the Agreed Completion Date of 9 December 2008. The events leading to the breach
                    and the post-breach dealings between the parties are narrated below (see
                        <a href="#p1_4">[4]</a> to <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The material facts and the parties’ contentions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The salient facts relevant to the dispute
                    between the parties are relatively straightforward. Originally, under the
                    Agreement, the Completion Date was stipulated to be 19 December 2008.
                    However, on or about 5 December 2008, the parties agreed, at the
                    Purchaser’s suggestion, to bring forward the Completion Date to
                    9 December 2008, the Agreed Completion Date. This was consistent with the
                    terms of the Agreement, which stated that completion could take place on
                    “such other earlier date as may be agreed in writing between the Vendor
                    and the Purchaser”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> On
                    9 December 2008, the Purchaser gave instructions for the Consideration to
                    be remitted to the Vendor’s designated account. As it turned out, however,
                    due to certain technicalities with the Purchaser’s financier, the money
                    was not received in the designated account that day. Accordingly, completion did
                    not take place on 9 December 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       On 10 December 2008, the Vendor demanded
                    from the issuing bank (“OCBC Bank”) payment of the full amount of
                    S$1m payable under the Performance Bond, and OCBC Bank duly paid the S$1m to the
                    Vendor’s solicitors, M/s Rajah &amp; Tann LLP
                    (“R&amp;T”), on or about 16 December 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Between 10 December 2008 and
                    15 December 2008, the Purchaser’s representatives provided assurances
                    and copies of documents to the Vendor in an attempt to satisfy the latter that
                    instruction <em>had</em> indeed been given for the
                    Consideration to be remitted into its designated account on 9 December
                    2008. Subsequently, on 15 December 2008, the Vendor confirmed that it had
                    received the Consideration in its designated account. The parties then proceeded
                    to exchange the requisite documents to effect the sale of the Vendor’s
                    interests in WSIL to the Purchaser.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       This “completion”, however,
                    proceeded (so the Vendor argues) on the supposed basis (as per R&amp;T’s
                    letter of 15 December 2008 <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>) that it would be without prejudice to
                    the Vendor’s rights under the Agreement in respect of the
                    Purchaser’s tardiness and breach on 9 December 2008, including but not
                    limited to the alleged right to make a demand on the Performance Bond (which it
                    had done on 10 December 2008) and to retain the proceeds
                        thereof.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> In other
                    words, from the Vendor’s point of view, the exchange of documents for the
                    Consideration (the Vendor does not accept that what took place on 15 December
                    2008 was “Completion” as defined in the Agreement) was on the
                    basis that the Vendor was entitled to demand and retain the sum of S$1m under
                    the Performance Bond <em>without more</em>. Arising from
                    these facts, it is the Vendor’s case that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_a"></a>(a)     the Purchaser acquired the
                        Vendor’s interests in WSIL on the basis that the Vendor was entitled
                        to demand the sum of S$1m under the Performance Bond and would be retaining
                        the same, which the Purchaser had accepted without any protest
                            whatsoever;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>
                        and that basis constituted a new contract which was separate and distinct
                        from the Agreement and the completion of the sale as contemplated
                            therein;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>
                        and/or</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_b"></a>(b)     the S$1m
                        was separate consideration payable by the Purchaser to the Vendor under
                        cl 4.2.6 of the Agreement.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       On this second point (b), much of the present
                    dispute turns on the interpretation of several clauses in the Agreement relating
                    to the provision (and subsequent discharge) of the Performance Bond by the
                    Purchaser. Clause 4.1.1 of the Agreement provides, very broadly, for the
                    securing of “the obligations of the Purchaser under [the]
                    Agreement” via the Performance Bond, as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">At the time of the execution of this Agreement by the Parties and against
                        delivery by the Vendor of the executed copy of this Agreement to the
                        Purchaser or the Purchaser’s Solicitors, the Purchaser shall deliver
                        to the Vendor and <em>the Vendor shall receive from the
                            Purchaser a performance bond issued by a first class bank in Singapore
                            on terms acceptable to the Vendor whereunder the performance of the
                            obligations of the Purchaser under this Agreement shall be irrevocably
                            and unconditionally secured by the above bank up to the maximum sum of
                            S$1,000,000</em>“Performance Bond”). [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Based on the terms of the Agreement, it appears
                    that the Performance Bond, which was in effect an on-demand banker’s
                    guarantee, was meant as assurance for the Vendor against a multitude of
                    contingencies that might have occurred <em>pending</em> the
                    completion of the sale and purchase of the Vendor’s interests in WSIL.
                    These contingencies comprised, among other things, a failure by the Purchaser
                        to:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_a"></a>(a)     pay any money payable by the Vendor
                        towards any increase in share capital and/or any shareholder’s loan
                        (“Additional Capital Injection”) which the Vendor was required
                        to pay for pursuant to certain budget and capital proposal approvals
                        (“Approvals”) sought by the Purchaser under the Agreement and
                        given by the Vendor at the Purchaser’s request; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_b"></a>(b)     ensure that completion took place on
                        the Completion Date as provided for in the Agreement and as agreed between
                        the parties. (On the fact of this case, the Agreed Completion
                    Date.)</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In the event of any of the contingencies occurring,
                    the Vendor argues that it was entitled, pursuant to cll 4.2.6(i) and
                    4.2.6(ii) of the Agreement, to retain the full amount payable under the
                    Performance Bond. For completeness, I should mention that the Vendor in its
                    pleadings also relies on cl 5.5.2(b) as entitling it to retain the S$1m.
                    (The specific clauses of the Agreement referenced here and immediately below
                    shall be addressed in greater detail later on in this judgment.)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The Purchaser disagrees with the
                    Vendor’s contentions and is now claiming for the return of the S$1m paid
                    out under the Performance Bond. The Purchaser’s primary argument is that
                    the Agreement <em>was not terminated</em> by the Vendor
                    after the Purchaser’s default on 9 December 2008, and, as such, what
                    took place on 15 December 2008 could only have been completion proper, and
                    not a mere “exchange of documents” as alleged by the
                        Vendor.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> Consequently, the Vendor is obliged to
                    return the S$1m under cl 5.6.2 of the Agreement. (I should mention again
                    that S$1m was paid by OCBC Bank to R&amp;T on or about 16 December 2008, and
                    that R&amp;T wrote to OCBC Bank on 17 December 2008 to acknowledge receipt
                    of the payment.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span>)
                    The Purchaser’s point, in short, is that the S$1m was received <em>after</em> the Purchaser acquired the Vendor’s
                    interests in WSIL, and should, therefore, be returned to the Purchaser under
                    cl 5.6.2 or cl 4.2.6(iii) of the Agreement which provides for the
                    payment of S$1m to be deemed waived in the event of “Completion”
                    as defined in cl 1.1 of the Agreement (see <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a> below).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> On the Vendor’s further argument
                    that the exchange of documents on 15 December 2008 constituted a new contract
                    which was separate and distinct from the Agreement as “Completion”
                    under the Agreement was no longer possible,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> the Purchaser rejects the
                    Vendor’s contention of a “new contract” since the Agreement
                    was never terminated by the Vendor following the Purchaser’s breach of the
                    Agreement on 9 December 2008. As for the Vendor’s alternative argument
                    that the S$1m was a separate consideration prescribed under cl 4.2.6 and,
                    by reason thereof, the Vendor is entitled to retain the full amount payable
                    under the Performance Bond, the Purchaser says that cll 4.2.6(i) and 4.2.6(ii)
                    were not engaged because prior to 15 December 2008, there was <em>no</em> call on the Vendor by WSIL to subscribe and pay any
                    increase in its share capital and/or any shareholder’s loan. It is the
                    Purchaser’s case that, in the circumstance as described, he was under no
                    obligation to pay the separate consideration for the Approvals: he had completed
                    the purchase of the Vendor’s interests in WSIL on 15 December 2008, and by
                    virtue of cl 4.2.6(iii), the Vendor is deemed to have waived the payment of
                    the sum of S$1m as separate consideration for the Approvals.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> The relevant

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     At this juncture, a proper consideration of
                    the <em>nature</em> of the Performance Bond is in order.
                    The Purchaser argues at para 14 of his Statement of Claim (Amendment
                    No 1) that: <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… there is an implied contractual term in the Agreement that the
                        [Vendor] would account to the [Purchaser] for the proceeds received under
                        the Performance Bond and would only retain the amount of any loss suffered
                        by the [Vendor] in consequence of the [Purchaser’s] failure to
                        complete on the Completion Date.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Purchaser’s contention finds support in <em>Cargill International SA and another v Bangladesh Sugar and Food Industries
                        Corp</em> [1996] 4 All ER 563 (“<em>Cargill</em>”). In <em>Cargill</em>, it
                    was established that since a performance bond was not an <em>estimate of damages</em> that might flow from a breach of contract
                    but, rather, a <em>guarantee of due performance</em> of a
                    contract, it would be <em>implicit in the nature of such a
                        bond</em> that unless the contrary was expressly stated, there would
                    at some future stage be an accounting between the contracting parties (hereafter
                    referred to as a “subsequent mutual accounting”) in the event that
                    payment was indeed made under the bond. As was noted by Potter LJ in
                        <em>Comdel Commodities Ltd v Siporex Trade SA</em>
                    [1997] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 424 (“<em>Comdel</em>”) at 431, which applied the <em>Cargill</em> analysis in full:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If the amount of the bond is not enough to satisfy the seller’s
                        claim for damages, the buyer is liable to the seller for damages in excess
                        of the amount of the bond. On the other hand, if the amount of the bond is
                        more than enough to satisfy the seller’s claim for damages, the buyer
                        can recover from the seller the amount of the bond which exceeds the
                        seller’s damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     As a matter of intellectual consistency and
                    symmetry, this approach can only be sensible. I do not think that the Vendor
                    here would have been content to limit its claim to only S$1m without more if the
                    Purchaser had not gone ahead with the sale as contemplated by the Agreement.
                    This observation is borne out, for instance, by cl 5.5.3 of the Agreement,
                    which obliges the Purchaser to indemnify the Vendor against “any and all
                    losses, damages, costs, expenses… arising from, relating to and /or in
                    connection with this Agreement (including but not limited to any failure or
                    breach on the part of the Purchaser in respect of this
                        Agreement)”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span>
                    On the facts, the Performance Bond functioned as a form of security; and, as
                    with any secured creditor, the Vendor was entitled to the security provided, but
                    was nonetheless subject to the full extent of its claim. Any shortfall between
                    the full amount of the security and the Vendor’s loss would have to be
                    additionally made good by the Purchaser subsequently; conversely, any excess of
                    the security after taking into account the amount needed to cover the
                    Vendor’s loss would have to be accounted for by the Vendor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     
          <em>Cargill</em> was
                    subsequently affirmed on appeal (see <em>Cargill International SA
                        and another v Bangladesh Sugar and Food Industries Corp</em> [1998]
                    2 All ER 406 (“<em>Bangladesh
                    Sugar</em>”)), and the principle espoused therein has since been
                    applied in numerous other cases. Notably, in the recent case of <em>Tradigrain SA v State Trading Corp of India</em> [2006]
                    1 Lloyd’s Rep 216, Christopher Clarke J employed at [26] the
                    terminology of an implied contractual term, which terminology was also adopted
                    by the Purchaser in the present case):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In my judgment [<em>Cargill</em>] (and the citations
                        in it) are authority for the proposition that <em>there is an
                            implied term in the contract of sale that the Buyers will account to the
                            Sellers for any amount that has been paid under the bond to the extent
                            that the amount paid exceeds the true amount of the Buyer’s
                            loss</em>. The amount is due to the Sellers as a debt, whether or
                        not the Sellers have indemnified either the paying bank or the indemnifier
                        of the paying bank. In essence this is because, <em>by
                            calling for too much under the bond, the Buyers have procured payment to
                            themselves from the paying bank (acting, for this purpose, on the
                            Sellers’ behalf) of an amount that is not due, and must,
                            obviously, return it to their contractual counterparty from whom they
                            should not have procured it in the first place. Otherwise they will have
                            retained a windfall in the form of money to which they were not entitled
                            since, to the extent of the overpayment, there has been either no breach
                            or no loss entitling them to retain it</em>. This conclusion
                        appears to me to be correct in principle and has been approved by the Court
                        of Appeal. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     It should be noted that in <em>Cargill</em>, <em>Bangladesh Sugar</em> and
                        <em>Comdel</em>, the court referred to the subsequent
                    mutual accounting (as defined at <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a> above)
                    as being “<em>implicit</em> in the nature of a
                    performance bond” (<em>Bangladesh Sugar</em> at
                    406), and stated that the relevant parties concerned “very probably
                    [would] have known that that [was] a general feature of performance
                    bonds” (<em>Bangladesh Sugar</em> at 416). The
                    distinction between the words “<em>implicit</em>” and “<em>inherent</em>” is slight, but, to my mind, it is preferable to
                    regard the subsequent mutual accounting as something <em>inherent</em> in all performance bonds. This straightforward approach
                    would elide the difficulty of determining whether the particular contract at
                    hand requires the implication of an implied term in question.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     At this juncture, it is important to note that
                    the provisions in the Agreement which relate to the Performance Bond do not take
                    away the possibility – or even appropriateness – of a subsequent
                    mutual accounting. Clause 4.1 of the Agreement expressly states
                        that:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… the performance of the obligations of the Purchaser under this
                        Agreement shall be irrevocably and unconditionally secured by the above bank
                        up to the maximum sum of S$1,000,000 (the “Performance
                        Bond”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In my view, the use of the word “secured” points
                    unequivocally towards the Performance Bond constituting security for the
                    Purchaser’s performance of the contract. In this connection, it should be
                    emphasised that the limit of S$1m operated only as between the <em>Purchaser</em> and <em>OCBC Bank</em>
                        (<em>viz</em>, the issuing bank). The Purchaser would
                    still be liable to the <em>Vendor</em> if the
                    latter’s claim exceeded the stipulated sum of S$1m.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Separately, under cl 4.2.6 of the
                    Agreement, a triumvirate of possibilities are countenanced, each phrased in
                    terminology which is consistent with a subsequent mutual accounting. The opening
                    words of cl 4.2.6 reference a “consideration [of S$1m] for the
                    consent and/approval of the Vendor to any and all the
                        Proposals”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> I
                    will come to this provision later in the judgment (see <a href="#p1_31">[31]</a> - <a href="#p1_38">[38]</a> below)). First,
                    however, a consideration of cl 4.2.6(i), which states that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… in the event of failure by the Purchaser to make any such payment
                        of the Additional Capital Injection or any part thereof … the payment
                        of S$1,000,000 above shall be deemed to have been made by the Purchaser upon
                        receipt by the Vendor of the full amount payable under the Performance Bond,
                        which amount shall be retained by the Vendor for its sole benefit
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Under this sub-clause, therefore, if the Purchaser failed to provide
                    the required Additional Capital Injection, the secured sum of S$1m would be used
                    to offset (presumably in part since the Additional Capital Injection was
                    contemplated to be more that S$1m) that payment; <em>ie</em>, the S$1m would not be paid over <em>in
                        vacuo</em>. Similarly, cl 4.2.6(ii), which provides for the S$1m
                    to be retained by the Vendor should the Purchaser fail to effect completion on
                    the Agreed Completion Date, is also consistent with a subsequent mutual
                    accounting to the extent that “the Vendor shall be entitled to retain all
                    Rights and Assets from the Additional Capital Injection by the Purchaser
                    … all of which shall be for the Vendor’s sole
                        benefit”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Separately, cl 4.2.6(iii) states that in
                    the event that completion takes place, the Vendor is deemed to have waived the
                    payment of the S$1m, “without prejudice to any rights or remedies which
                    the Vendor may have under this Agreement, and/or any other rights or remedies
                    which the Vendor may have in law and/or equity”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> This language employed
                    certainly does not preclude the existence of a duty to carry out a subsequent
                    mutual accounting <em>vis-a-vis</em> any amount paid out
                    under the Performance Bond; indeed, the reservation to the Vendor of rights and
                    remedies in law and/or equity for prior breaches on the part of the Purchaser in
                    the plain wording of cl 4.2.6(iii) encourages the possibility of subsequent
                    mutual accounting.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Finally, it should be noted in passing that
                    according to the proviso (2) to cl 5.5.2(d) of the Agreement:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… no credit, set-off or deduction whatsoever shall be attributable
                        and/or given to, and <em>the Purchaser shall have no interest
                            … in respect of … any monies received by the Vendor
                            pursuant to and/or under the Performance Bond</em>. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">However, it must be noted that the wording of sub-clause (d) of
                    cl 5.5.2 is confined to the situation where the Vendor commences action
                    against the Purchaser and enters final judgment therein against the Purchaser
                    for <em>non-completion</em> on the part of the Purchaser of
                    the Purchaser’s completion obligations under cl 5.3 of the
                        Agreement.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span>
                    Thus, proviso (2) to cl 5.5.2(d) quoted above applies <em>only where the Vendor has sued on the Agreement and is subsequently
                        executing on the judgment</em>. Pursuant to cl 5.5.1 of the
                    Agreement, the Vendor can sue on the Agreement where: (a) it has elected to
                    terminate the Agreement as against the Purchaser; (b) it has decided to
                    effect completion so far as practicable, having regard to the defaults which
                    have occurred; or (c) it is seeking specific performance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Here, the Vendor did not terminate the
                    Agreement and bring an action against the Purchaser when it did not receive the
                    Consideration on 9 December 2008. In the circumstances, I do not see how
                    the provisions of proviso (2) to cl 5.5.2(d) can apply to the countenanced
                    duty of carrying out a subsequent mutual accounting.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Legal effect of non-termination of the Agreement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     By cl 6.6 of the Agreement, time was
                    stated to be of the essence.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> Since completion did not take place on
                    the Agreed Completion Date of 9 December 2008, the Purchaser had <em>prima facie</em> committed a repudiatory breach. This was
                    readily agreed on and acknowledged by both the Purchaser and the Vendor in their
                        submissions.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     It should be borne in mind that the Vendor
                    itself saw the various terms and clauses countenanced in the Agreement as
                        “water-tight”,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> and the Agreement itself as
                    conclusive in anticipating and resolving any possible disputes. It is only
                    apposite, therefore, that the four options laid out by cl 5.5.1 of the
                    Agreement be taken into consideration by this court <em>before</em> any ad hoc, unilateral improvisations by the Vendor,
                    acting alone, can be seriously contemplated and relied upon.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Clause 5.5.1 provides four options to an
                    innocent party in the event of non-completion.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> These options reflect the standard
                    contractual rights available at common law, and permit the non-defaulting
                    party:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_a"></a>(a)     to elect to terminate the Agreement
                        as against the party in default;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_b"></a>(b)     to effect [c]ompletion so far as practical, having regard
                        to the defaults which have occurred;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_c"></a>(c)     to seek specific performance of the Agreement;
                    or</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_d"></a>(d)     to fix a new
                        date for [c]ompletion (being not more than 14 days after the Agreed
                        Completion Date), in which case the provisions of cll 5.3 and 5.4
                        (which spell out the Purchaser’s and the Vendor’s respective
                        [c]ompletion obligations) shall apply to [c]ompletion as so
                    deferred.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In the present case, after the
                    Purchaser’s default on 9 December 2008, the Vendor <em>did not</em> expressly elect to adopt any of the four options open to
                    it under cl 5.5.1 for non-completion on the part of the Purchaser of its
                    completion obligations under cl 5.3. In particular, it <em>did not choose to terminate the Agreement</em>. Therefore, on
                    15 December 2008, when the sale of the Vendor’s interests in WSIL to
                    the Purchaser went ahead, the Agreement remained very much alive.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The law in this area is settled, and the
                    authorities, conclusive. <em>Chitty on Contracts</em> (HG
                    Beale Gen Ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 30th Ed, 2008) (“<em>Chitty</em>”) sets out the position succinctly at
                    para 24-003:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The conduct by the Vendor in going ahead with
                    the exchange of documents on 15 December 2008 to effect the sale of its
                    interests in WSIL to the Purchaser would seem to amount to affirmation of the
                    contract as described in the above passage from <em>Chitty</em>. By way of rebuttal, the Vendor might argue (and indeed,
                    has argued) that it had, by R&amp;T’s letter dated 15 December 2008
                    to the Purchaser’s solicitors, reserved its rights in respect of the
                    Purchaser’s breach, in particular, its right to make a demand on the
                    Performance Bond and to keep the proceeds. To elaborate, the Vendor’s
                    argument was that there was no total affirmation of the Agreement despite the
                    Purchaser’s repudiatory breach on 9 December 2008.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> It was further
                    submitted that the Purchaser subsequently acquired the Vendor’s interests
                    in WSIL on the basis that the Vendor was entitled to demand the sum of S$1m
                    under the Performance Bond and would be retaining the same, a premise which the
                    Purchaser had accepted without any protest whatsoever. On that basis, as the
                    Vendor’s argument develops, a new contract, separate and distinct from the
                    Agreement and the completion of the sale as contemplated therein, would have
                    been constituted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In my view, this argument is neither here nor
                    there. The <em>un-terminated</em> existence of the
                    Agreement between 10 December 2008 and 15 December 2008 and the
                    subsequent affirmation of this Agreement (and I so find, through the sale and
                    purchase of the Vendor’s interests in WSIL on 15 December 2008) were
                    not just chronologically prior to the purported “reservation” by
                    the Vendor of its rights – they were also <em>logically</em> prior. In my judgment, the Vendor had on
                    15 December 2008 purported to reserve its right to claim on the Performance
                    Bond when <em>that right had not yet properly accrued</em>
                    (see further explanation at <a href="#p1_27">[27]</a> below). I
                    make the same point and finding in respect of the other purported oral
                    reservation of rights made in the course of telephone conversations between the
                    respective parties’ solicitors on or about 15 December 2008 to the effect
                    that the demand on the Performance Bond stood and that notwithstanding any
                    subsequent performance by the Purchaser of his completion obligations under
                    cl 5.3, the Vendor would keep the S$1m received under the Performance
                        Bond.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> In this connection, <em>Chitty</em> is instructive once again (see
                    para 24-002):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">An innocent party, faced by a repudiatory breach, is
                        therefore given a choice<em>: he can either treat the
                            contract as continuing (“affirmation” of the contract) or
                            he can bring it to an end (“acceptance of the
                            repudiation”)</em>. He must “elect” or choose
                        between these options. Further, it is sometimes said that there is no other
                        option open to the innocent party; that is to say, there is no
                        “middle way” or “third choice”. This is true in
                        the sense that <em>there is no</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">
<em>“… third choice, as a sort of via
                                media, to affirm the contract and yet be absolved from tendering
                                further performance</em> unless and until [the breaching
                            party] gives reasonable notice that he is once again able and willing to
                            perform.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">But <em>the proposition that there is no middle way can be
                            over-stated. There is a sense in which there is a middle way open to the
                            innocent party in that he is given a period of time in which to make up
                            his mind whether he is going to affirm the contract or
                            terminate</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The length of the period given to the innocent party in order to make up
                        his mind will very much depend on the facts of the case. The period may not
                        be a long one because a party who does nothing for too long may be held to
                        have affirmed the contract. The length of time will also depend upon the
                        time at which the innocent party’s obligations fall due for
                        performance. <em>A contract remains in force until it has
                            been terminated for breach so that a contracting party who has not
                            elected to terminate the contract remains bound to perform his
                            obligations unless the effect of the other party’s breach is to
                            prevent performance of the innocent party’s obligation becoming
                            due</em>.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In <em>Stocznia Gdanska SA v
                        Latvian Shipping Co</em> [2002] 2 Lloyd’s Law Rep 435,
                    Rix LJ at [87] helpfully laid out the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In my judgment, there is of course a middle ground between acceptance of
                        repudiation and affirmation of the contract, and that is the period when the
                        innocent party is making up his mind what to do. If he does nothing for too
                        long, there may come a time when the law will treat him as having affirmed.
                            <em>If he maintains the contract in being for the moment,
                            while reserving his right to treat it as repudiated if his contract
                            partner persists in his repudiation, then he has not yet
                            elected</em>. As long as the contract remains alive, the innocent
                        party runs the risk that a merely anticipatory breach, a thing ‘writ
                        in water’ until acceptance, can be overtaken by another event which
                        prejudices the innocent party’s rights under the contract – such
                        as frustration or even his own breach. <em>He also runs the
                            risk, if that is the right word, that the party in repudiation will
                            resume performance of the contract and thus end any continuing right in
                            the innocent party to elect to accept the former repudiation as
                            terminating the contract</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It should be noted that the Vendor’s general reservation of
                    rights in R&amp;T’s letter dated 15 December 2008 could have been
                        <em>effective only if</em> the Vendor had chosen to
                    exercise the rights <em>provided for under
                        cl 5.5.1</em> (as set out at <a href="#p1_22">[22]</a> above), which are the only rights prescribed by the parties
                    themselves to address the precise contingency of non-completion. In the present
                    case, the Vendor’s act of calling on the Performance Bond was not, in any
                    way, an acceptance of the repudiatory breach and/or act to rescind the Agreement
                    which was very much in force even after the breach on 9 December 2008. If
                    anything, that act, viewed in conjunction with the fact that the Vendor did not
                    elect to terminate the Agreement pursuant to cl 5.5.1(a), evidenced quite
                    the converse.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     It is worthwhile to note two possible
                    scenarios that could have been at play on 15 December 2008. First, the
                    Vendor’s course of action on 15 December 2008 most closely mirrored
                    option (d) under cl 5.5.1 (see <a href="#p1_22">[22]</a> above). In the absence of any express election, the Vendor
                    could ostensibly have chosen that particular option by agreeing, in writing, to
                    sell its interests in WSIL to the Purchaser on 15 December 2008. Second, it
                    is also possible that the Vendor’s behaviour (<em>ie</em>, by calling on the Performance Bond on 10 December 2008
                    and reserving its rights to the same in subsequent letters on 12 December
                    2008 and 15 December 2008) after the Purchaser’s breach on
                    9 December 2008 impliedly constituted option (b) – it had, in a
                    sense, chosen to “effect [c]ompletion so far as practicable having regard
                    to the defaults which have occurred” (see cl 5.5.1(b) quoted at
                        <a href="#p1_22">[22]</a> above). However, this line of
                    reasoning might raise some potentially thorny issues; presumably, a temporal
                    allowance for the Agreement’s satisfactory conclusion would have been
                    entirely provided for by option (d), leaving option (b) open to
                    address the possibility of any waivers of defaults that had occurred <em>on 9 December 2008</em> itself. That said, I am mindful
                    that it is not the Vendor’s case that it chose either options (b) or (d)
                    on 15 December 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Indeed, if what took place on 15 December
                    2008 was not “Completion” under the Agreement, what else could it
                    have been? The Vendor asserts that it was an “exchange of
                    documents”, but this merely labels – without defining – a
                    persisting, unknown quantity. There was no argument that completion <em>had</em> to, by definition, take place strictly on
                    9 December 2008. Indeed, cl 1.1 of the Agreement defines
                    “Completion” to mean only “the sale and purchase of the
                    sale shares and … the assignment of the [s]hareholder’s
                        [l]oan”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span>
                    There was also no evidence before me to show any intention or indication of the
                    Vendor’s allegation of a new contract being formed between the parties
                    having concluded for the reasons stated in this judgment that the purported
                    reservation of rights was ineffective. If anything, the “exchange of
                    documents” exemplified, at best, only an act of mitigation, on the
                    (unproven) assumption that the Vendor had accepted the Purchaser’s breach
                    and terminated the Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The Vendor, therefore, was bound by its
                    obligation of waiving the payment of the sum of S$1m by the Purchaser (as
                    stipulated under clause 4.2.6(iii)) <em>in so far as the
                        Purchaser subsequently performed its obligations under the Agreement and the
                        Vendor elected not to terminate the Agreement, which remained extant between
                        10 December 2008 and 15 December 2008</em>. The
                    Vendor’s purported reservation of an ostensible right to demand payment
                    under the Performance Bond in that same intervening period, as well as its
                    subsequent retention of the amount paid out contrary to cl 4.2.6(iii) of
                    the Agreement, was ineffective; it was at best, a misguided attempt at
                    exercising an illusory and unsubstantiated “third choice”
                        (<em>per Chitty</em> at para 24-002 which is
                    quoted at <a href="#p1_26">[26]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the Performance Bond was valid consideration for the
                Approvals </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The Vendor’s other main plank of
                    argument hinges on its assertion that “[t]he scope and purpose of the
                    Performance Bond … was to facilitate the [Purchaser’s] payment of
                    the sum of [S$1m] which constituted the separate consideration payable by the
                    [Purchaser] to the [Vendor] for certain specific [A]pprovals from the [Vendor]
                    which were sought and required by the [Purchaser] as set out by
                        Clause 4.2.6”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> In other words, by the Vendor’s
                    reckoning, the Performance Bond was no more than the mode by which payment of
                    the sum of S$1m was to be made by the Purchaser to the Vendor.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span>
                    By this logic, therefore, it would appear that the S$1m would have been payable
                    to the Vendor <em>regardless</em> of any extrinsic issues
                    relating to completion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Yet, the Vendor argues at para 120 of its
                    closing submissions:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Instead, it is clear from Clause 4.2.6 that <em>the sum of S$1 million constitutes a separate
                            consideration for the Approvals</em>, and Clause 5.5.2(b)
                        (read with Clause 4.2.6(ii) &amp; (iii)) clearly serves: -</p>

                                [Purchaser] fails to effect “<em>Completion</em>” under the terms of the Settlement

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It is difficult to understand the Vendor’s arguments here. On
                    the one hand, it insists that the S$1m “constitutes a <em>separate</em> consideration for the Approvals” [emphasis
                    added]; yet, on the other hand, it appears to link this <em>separate</em> consideration to the event of completion, establishing
                    it as an “incentive” for the Purchaser to effect the same (timely
                    or otherwise).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     This conflict is problematic for various
                    reasons. Taking the Vendor’s case at face value, we have on our hands a
                    situation where the consideration for the Approvals was one that was both
                        <em>waivable</em> and <em>non-specific</em> – that is to say, the S$1m due under the
                    Performance Bond, liable as it was to be paid out pursuant to a multiplicity of
                    “other bases for demand” (see for example the use of this phrase
                    in cl 4.2.3(a) and cl 5.5.2(b) of the Agreement) <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> was also
                    perfectly relinquishable for reasons <em>entirely unrelated to
                        the bargain concerning the Approvals themselves</em>. With respect,
                    this cannot be right. At one level of this conflict is a sum of S$1m that seeks
                    to serve different purposes (some of which were conditional upon the occurrence
                    of specified defaults stipulated in cl 4.2.6(i) and cl 4.2.6(ii)
                    rather than tied to a specific promise). At another higher level is the question
                    whether “consideration” that is indeterminate and comprising one
                    promise to be enforced under two non-mutually exclusive scenarios can amount to
                    good and proper consideration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The orthodox interpretation of consideration
                    is that it is based upon the idea of reciprocity: <em>viz</em>, a promisee should not be able to enforce a promise unless
                    he has given or promised to give something in exchange for the promise, or
                    unless the promisor has obtained (or been promised) something in return. Here,
                    however, the Agreement as construed by the Vendor appears to countenance the
                    legitimacy of a catch-all performance bond (beholden, as it were, to myriad
                    bases of demand and, therefore, quite possibly subject to dissipation pursuant
                    to <em>other</em> intervening catalysts) masquerading as a
                    valid reciprocal promise for “<em>specific</em>
                    [A]pprovals”. Indeed, the requisite sum of S$1m appears to be arguably
                    nothing more than a slightly more difficult variety of illusory consideration,
                    which consideration is unenforceable given the uncertainty and impossibility of
                    its ambit <em>at the time of the
                contract</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     For all of the above reasons, I do not accept
                    the Vendor’s argument that in the light of the opening words of
                    cl 4.2.6, the sum payable under the Performance Bond can effectively amount
                    to a “separate” consideration for the Approvals. The specific
                    trigger for the S$1m falling due on demand pursuant to the Performance Bond
                    simply could not have been both independent of completion (as alleged) and yet,
                    at the same time, contingent on completion taking place as per the Agreement. As
                    has already been discussed at <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a>–<a href="#p1_19">[19]</a> above, it
                    was clear to me that the sum payable under the Performance Bond was a form of
                    security ensuring the Purchaser’s performance, rather than any sort of
                    “consideration” for the Approvals. It would have been somewhat
                    more straightforward for all involved if the Vendor had simply called a spade a
                    spade from the outset.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Nonetheless, an alternative gloss on the issue
                    appears to remain. Reading the Agreement strictly, there seems to be room for
                    the argument that the S$1m due under the Performance Bond could have merely been
                        <em>a fungible sum that would go towards constituting a
                        generic payment of S$1m due under cll 4.2.6(i) and 4.2.6(ii) of the
                        Agreement</em>. Clause 4.2.6 states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The consideration for [the Approvals] shall be:-</p>

                                    amount payable under the Performance Bond, which amount shall be

                                    be deemed to have been made by the Purchaser upon receipt by the
                                    Vendor of the full amount payable under the Performance Bond
                                    …</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-3">(iii)   in the event of Completion under Clause
                                    5 below taking place, the Vendor shall forthwith be deemed to
                                    have waived the payment of <em>the sum of
                                        S$1,000,000</em> above by the Purchaser
                                    …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-3">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">On this view, the S$1m due under the
                    Performance Bond would <em>not</em> have constituted
                    “consideration” for the Approvals <em>per
                        se</em>; instead, it would merely have gone towards discharging the
                        <em>separate</em> sum of S$1m due under cl 4.2.6
                    (as emphasised in italics above). In other words, the Performance Bond would
                    have been simply a <em>means</em> of effecting payment of
                    the stipulated sum of S$1m where payment was triggered under cl 4.2.6. On
                    this construction, therefore, there would no longer appear to be any issue with
                    respect to the Performance Bond having to perform a duplicity of consideration
                    roles (as discussed earlier).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     In my view, however, this interpretation is
                    still unsatisfactory. Whether the amount due under the Performance Bond was
                    meant <em>directly</em> as consideration for the Approvals,
                    or whether the amount due was meant to go towards <em>discharging</em> a stipulated sum payable under cl 4.2.6, the
                    fact remains that in both cases, the sum of S$1m could have <em>only been in respect of part-payment</em> since it is entirely
                    conceivable, for instance, that the requisite Additional Capital Injection under
                    clause 4.2.6(i) would have surpassed S$1m based on the Vendor’s
                        evidence<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> – had that been the case, I do not
                    think the Vendor would have been content to limit itself to only the S$1m due
                    under the Performance Bond. This point has already been elaborated on at
                        <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a> &amp; <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a> above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     In view of this, I find that the sum due under
                    the Performance Bond must have necessarily remained in the nature of a <em>security</em>, albeit a security that was not exhaustive in
                    terms of quantum or remedy and which served only to guarantee the performance of
                    the Purchaser under the Agreement. It should be noted in passing here that had
                    the Vendor suffered greater losses for which it wished to bring a claim under an
                    action of its own, it was entirely entitled to do so pursuant to cl 6.8 of
                    the Agreement, which expressly left the door open to the Vendor with respect to
                    other remedies “otherwise available at law, in equity, by statute or
                        otherwise”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the provisions in the Agreement relating to the Performance
                Bond amounted to a penalty clause</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The contortions of the Vendor’s
                    arguments in relation to the terms of the Performance Bond stem, it would seem,
                    largely from its wish <em>not</em> to have those self-same
                    provisions struck down as constituting a penalty clause.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> Indeed the Vendor
                    cites proviso (2) to cl 5.5.2(d) where the Purchaser had, <em>inter alia</em>, agreed that the “benefits conferred
                    to the Vendor under Clause 5.5.2 …are fair and reasonable, and do not
                    constitute any penalty”. <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> Although I need not rule on this issue
                    as I have already found that the Performance Bond was a form of security aimed
                    at ensuring the Purchaser’s performance, the penalty clause arguments
                    canvassed on both sides have been spirited and deserve brief
                comment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The legal test for assessing whether a clause
                    amounts to a penalty clause is largely settled. In <em>Dunlop
                        Pneumatic Tyre Co Ltd v Garage and Motor Co Ltd</em>
                    [1915] AC 79 (“<em>Dunlop
                    Pneumatic</em>”), Lord Dunedin put forward the following
                    formulation (at 86–87):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>The essence of a penalty is a payment of money
                            stipulated as in terrorem of the offending party; the essence of
                            liquidated damages is a genuine covenanted pre-estimate of
                            damage</em> … The question whether a sum stipulated is [a]
                        penalty or liquidated damages is a question of construction to be decided
                        upon the terms and inherent circumstances of each particular contract,
                        judged of as at the time of the making of the contract, not as at the time
                        of the breach … [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Lord Dunedin also provided the following gloss “to assist
                    this task of construction” (at 87):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>There is a presumption (but no more) that it is [a]
                            penalty when “a single lump sum is made payable by way of
                            compensation, on the occurrence of one or more of several events, some
                            of which may occasion serious and others but trifling
                            damage”</em> (Lord Watson in <em>Lord
                            Elphinstone v Monkland Iron and Coal Co</em> [11App.Cas.332)).
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Lord Parmoor, in agreeing with Lord Dunedin, stated the
                    following (at 101):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The agreed sum, though described in the contract as
                        liquidated damages, is held to be a penalty if it is extravagant or
                        unconscionable in relation to any possible amount of damages that could have
                        been within the contemplation of the parties at the time when the contract
                        was made. No abstract rule can be laid down without reference to the special
                        facts of the particular case, but when competent parties by free contract
                        are purporting to agree a sum as liquidated damages there is no reason for
                        refusing a wide limit of discretion. <em>To justify
                            interference there must be an extravagant disproportion between the
                            agreed sum and the amount of any damage capable of
                            pre-estimate</em>. In the case of <em>Clydebank
                            Engineering and Shipbuilding Co. v. Don Jose Ramos Yzquierdo y
                            Castaneda</em>, Lord Halsbury gives an apt illustration of
                        what would probably render a sum agreed by the parties unconscionable, and
                        therefore a penalty:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">“For instance, if you agreed to build a house in a year, and
                            agreed that if you did not build the house for [£50] you were to
                            pay a million of money as a penalty, the extravagance of that would be
                            at once apparent.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The analogy here is an easy one to draw; just as the builder of a
                    house fails by one day to deliver possession within a specified period of time
                    for a specific price (but not a <em>completely</em>
                    defaulting builder) would be extravagantly punished with a million dollar
                    penalty, so would the purchaser of shares who has rendered late payment (but not
                        <em>no</em> payment). I shall elaborate on this point,
                    as it applies to the present facts, in further detail below (see <a href="#p1_45">[45]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     It should be noted that the test in <em>Dunlop Pneumatic</em> has been affirmed and wholeheartedly
                    applied by the Singapore courts on several occasions (see, for example,
                        <em>Banner Investments Pte Ltd v Hoe Seng Metal Fabrication
                        &amp; Engineers (S) Pte Ltd</em> [1996] 3 SLR(R) at [14] and
                        <em>Orchard Twelve Investments Pte Ltd v Golden Bay Realty
                        Pte Ltd</em> [1985-1986] SLR(R) 723 at
                    [14]–[16]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The Vendor, however, submits an alternative
                    test for determining whether a contractual clause which imposes payment in the
                    event of a default is a penalty clause –
                    <em>viz</em>, a test that relies on the relatively untested
                    concept of “commercial justification”. It cites the case of
                        <em>Euro London Appointments Limited v Claessens
                        International</em> [2006] 2 Lloyd’s Law Rep 436
                        (“<em>Euro London</em>”) as support for
                    the proposition that a contractual provision, the effect of which was to
                    increase the consideration payable under an executory contract upon default,
                    should <em>not</em> be “struck down as a penalty
                    clause if the increase could, in the circumstances, be explained as commercially
                    justifiable, provided always that its dominant purpose was not to deter the
                    other party from breach” (see Chadwick LJ in <em>Euro
                        London</em> at [30], citing with approval the opinion of Coleman J in
                        <em>Lordsvale Finance Plc v Bank of Zambia</em>
                    [1996] QB 752 at 763H-764A). <em>Euro London</em>
                    has not yet been applied in Singapore to date, and, in my view, it should
                    likewise not be applied in the present case for the following
                reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     In the first place, it is not at all clear,
                    precedent threshold objections aside, why this alternative test should be
                    preferred in our present situation. Clause 5.5.2 of the Agreement provides
                    the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5.5.2 If Completion

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     In its submissions, the Vendor argues
                        that:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Clause 5.5.2(b) provides for the retention of monies already
                        ‘paid-over’ by a 3<sup>rd</sup> party issuing
                        bank pursuant to a well-recognised tripartite commercial arrangement ...
                        such monies were primarily intended as consideration for the Approvals and
                        not an ‘estimate’ of the amount of damages which the [Vendor]
                        would be entitled in the event of the [Purchaser’s] breach of the ...
                        Agreement. The classic test as expounded in <em>Dunlop
                            Pneumatic</em> of whether the payment of a stipulated sum upon
                        breach is a ‘genuine pre-estimate of loss’ is therefore
                        inapplicable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In other words, the Vendor is contending that because the stipulated
                    sum of S$1m under the Performance Bond was <em>not</em> a
                    genuine pre-estimate of damages, a separate, novel test should be adopted.
                    Effectively, all the Vendor has done is to concede that it has failed to satisfy
                    the traditional criteria which delineate what type of contractual clauses are
                    not penalty clauses without offering any genuine or compelling reason for the
                    court to prefer the alternative “commercial justification”
                    test.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     For the avoidance of doubt, even without the
                    Vendor’s concession as noted in <a href="#p1_44">[44]</a>
                    above, it would appear that the provisions under cl 5.5.2 (addressing the
                    event of a failure of completion) would have <em>in and of
                        themselves</em> easily constituted a penalty clause.
                    Clause 5.5.2(a) provides for “interest [to] accrue on the
                    Consideration for the Sale Transaction or any unpaid portion thereof at the rate
                    of 12% per annum compounded on a daily basis from 1 April 2008”,
                    while cl 5.5.2(b), the much disputed Performance Bond clause, provides that
                    the Vendor may make a demand under the Performance Bond “without
                    prejudice to other bases for demand”. The fact that these two sub-clauses
                    are phrased <em>conjunctively</em> and are capable of
                    taking effect <em>cumulatively</em> only points to the
                    inherently penal nature of the entire cl 5.5.2. This observation is
                    consistent with cl 6.8 which provides that “…each and every
                    other remedy is cumulative and shall be in addition to every other remedy given
                    hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law, in equity, by statute or
                        otherwise.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span>
                    When we consider how the interest accruing under cl 5.5.2(a) would have
                    entirely outstripped the sum of S$1m due under the Performance Bond, and how the
                    sum of S$1m for a few days’ delay is grossly disproportionate in respect
                    of the (unproven) harm or inconvenience ostensibly suffered by the Vendor, we
                    see even more clearly the extravagantly penal ramifications of cl 5.5.2. In
                    this regard, Lord Halsbury’s example of a penalty clause (see the
                    quotation at <a href="#p1_40">[40]</a> above) is both germane and
                    instructive.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Separately, it is also clear that <em>even on its own “commercial justification” test, the
                        Vendor fails to show why the provisions in the Agreement relating to the
                        Performance Bond are insufficient to constitute a penalty clause</em>.
                    In <em>Euro London</em>, the court considered the standard
                    terms of a contract between an employment agency and its client. That contract
                    provided for a graduated refund of fees in the event of a termination of the
                    contract of employment of an employee whom the employment agency introduced to
                    its client. One of the disputed terms was structured such that the refund was
                    dependent upon the client making payment of the employment agency’s fees
                    within 7 days of the employee’s employment and serving notice of the
                    termination of that employee’s employment within the same 7-day period.
                    Another disputed term of the contract provided that should the terminated
                    employee be re-engaged by the client within six months following termination of
                    his prior engagement <em>in circumstances where the client would
                        have been entitled to a refund</em>, the full agency fee would become
                    payable by the client to the employment agency, with no further entitlement to a
                    refund.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Clearly, then, the commercial imperative for
                    the disputed terms in <em>Euro London</em> was to avoid a
                    situation in which, within a few weeks after employing the employee introduced
                    by the employment agency, the client terminates the employee’s contract of
                    employment, claims a refund of the employment agency’s fee and <em>then</em> re-engages the employee without more, thereby
                    obtaining an unfair benefit at the employment agency’s expense. The court
                    in <em>Euro London</em>, therefore, was arguably correct in
                    holding that the disputed clauses were “commercially justifiable,
                    provided always that [their] dominant purpose [were] not to deter the other
                    party from breach” (see <a href="#p1_42">[42]</a>
                    above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     In contrast, it is readily apparent that the
                    provisions in the Agreement relating to the Performance Bond, on a reasonable
                    construction of their “dominant contractual purpose” (see
                        <em>Euro London</em> at [32]), were drafted
                    specifically for deterrence, <em>viz</em>, “to deter
                    the other party from breach”. In so far as the Vendor has conceded that
                    the sum of S$1m was not intended to be a genuine pre-estimate of damages, and
                    inasmuch as the proposition for the S$1m being “separate”
                    consideration for the Approvals has already been rejected (see <a href="#p1_31">[31]</a>–[38) above), it is difficult to see how
                    the requirements for penalty clause elision under <em>Euro
                        London</em> can be satisfied here by the largely one-dimensional
                    provisions in the Agreement relating to the Performance Bond.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     However, since I reached the conclusion that
                    the Performance Bond constituted a guarantee for the performance by the
                    Purchaser of its obligations under the Agreement, the fact that the Performance
                    Bond provisions are not a genuine estimate of damages that might flow from a
                    breach of contract is moot; these provisions nonetheless still do <em>not</em> constitute a penalty clause in view of the inherent
                    (subsequent) mutual accounting safeguards built into the <em>nature</em> of a performance bond (see earlier at <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a>–<a href="#p1_19">[19]</a> above). Accordingly, I do not find that the Performance
                    Bond provisions amounted to a penalty clause.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The actual document constituting the Performance Bond</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     In my judgment, it was fairly clear that the
                    primary thrust of the provisions in the Agreement relating to the Performance
                    Bond was to ensure not so much that completion took place on time, but that
                    completion actually took place. In this connection, I am guided by the actual
                    banker’s guarantee document (“Banker’s Guarantee”) for
                    the sum of S$1m, payable on demand by the Vendor. The Banker’s Guarantee
                    states specifically that it is “in consideration of [the Vendor’s]
                    entering into the Agreement dated 15 September 2008 with [the Purchaser]
                    ... pursuant to which the [Purchaser] is obliged to procure and deliver this
                    Banker’s Guarantee to [the Vendor] and in your favour”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span> The “form and
                    terms of [the] Performance Bond”, set out at schedule 2 of the
                    Agreement and specifically referenced by cl 4.1.2 of the same,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span> outlines the rationale
                    for the Performance Bond, which had undisputedly come to be fulfilled by the

                                shall be limited to the maximum aggregate sum of S$1,000,000.00

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Notably, there is no mention of any Completion Date in the
                    Banker’s Guarantee or under schedule 2.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     I am further guided by the testimony of
                    Mr Jerry Tan Chwee Lee (“Jerry Tan”), the Vendor’s
                    director and representative who negotiated the terms of the Performance Bond
                    with the Purchaser. During cross-examination, Jerry Tan insisted that
                    “Mr Pun and [he] had a deal, and the deal was that he would complete
                    the [A]greement at the [Agreed C]ompletion [D]ate, which we had agreed
                        on”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span> Accordingly, Jerry Tan
                    maintained quite rightly that the sum of S$1m due under the Performance Bond was
                    not waivable in the circumstances since the purpose of the Performance Bond was,
                    ostensibly, to ensure completion of the Agreement <em>on the
                        Agreed Completion Date</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     However, this was only a bare assertion. Upon
                    further elaboration during cross-examination, Jerry Tan’s (voluntarily
                    given) description of the “stages of negotiations”
                    <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> leading up to the Performance Bond did
                    not appear to have timely completion in mind <em>at
                        all</em>. Instead, from the transcripts,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span>
                    it was clear that to all the parties concerned, particularly the Vendor, the
                    S$1m was to <em>constitute payment for the Approvals</em>
                    (although, for the reasons stated at <a href="#p1_33">[33]</a>–<a href="#p1_38">[38]</a> above, the
                    parties were mistaken in thinking that the S$1m (as worded in the Agreement)
                    could validly and effectively serve this function):<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">So some of the directors were very unhappy, and said ‘Well, we've
                        got to protect ourselves, and we also have to get some payment for these
                        approvals.’ I suggested $1 million, but some of the directors
                        felt that we really should ask for more. But based on my negotiations with
                        Mr Pun, I felt that anything above S$1 million probably wouldn't
                        be doable, and both Mr Pun and I [<em>ie</em>,
                        Jerry Tan] did want to come to a settlement. So as for that, for the
                        payment, it was for payment of these three proposals that he wanted, that we
                        said we need a banker’s guarantee, sorry, we need payment for these
                        approvals.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The above testimony was also confirmed by the Vendor’s director
                    and primary witness, Mr Leslie Tan Chwee Lye:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I would explain that the S$1 million came about as a price to pay for the
                        approvals, and it was negotiated by Jerry Tan and Mr Serge Pun.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     In short, based on the foregoing, the
                    intention of the <em>Vendor vis-à-vis</em> the Performance
                    Bond at the time of the contract appeared to be that, first and foremost, it was
                    to constitute consideration for the Approvals (however erroneous the parties
                    were in this regard); it would <em>then</em> constitute
                    consideration generally for ensuring completion. The issue of timeliness did not
                    really operate on the parties’ minds with respect to the S$1m; in fact,
                    there was the separate cl 5.5.2(a) which provided for interest in the event
                    of delay. Additionally, as has already been noted, there was no mention made of
                    the Completion Date in the Banker’s Guarantee or under schedule 2
                    (see <a href="#p1_50">[50]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Taking all of this into consideration along
                    with the Vendor’s premature reservation of a non-accrued right and its
                    conceptually flawed characterization of the money due under the Performance Bond
                    as “separate” consideration, I would allow judgment for the
                    Purchaser’s claim of S$1m together with interest thereon at the rate of
                    5.33% per annum from 26 February 2009 to the date of this judgment, and
                    costs.</p>
