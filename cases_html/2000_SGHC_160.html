<strong>JUDGMENT:</strong>
</font>
</p>
<p xmlns=""><font color="#804040" face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>Grounds of Decision on

Further Arguments and on Costs</strong></font> </p>
<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="4" xmlns="">
<p></p></font><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">1    On 6 July 2000, I delivered my

Judgment but reserved the question of costs at the request of the Appellants.</font>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">2    The Appellants then sought further

arguments on item (e) (as defined in my Judgment) and, as regards costs, they said they

would ask for variation of the Arbitrator’s award on costs as well.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">3    I heard further arguments on item (e)

and maintained that the arbitrator’s award on item (e) was to remain.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">4    This was because even if his award on

item (e) was made because of a misapprehension of a legal principle, which principle was

determined by me, it did not necessarily follow that his conclusion was wrong.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">5    It was not seriously disputed that the

amount comprised in item (e) was paid back by the Respondents to the Appellants who had

complained that it was an over-certified sum in a certificate. However, there was no

evidence that the certificate was amended to take into account this payment, or that the

arbitrator had factored this payment in his decision of the total amount under the final

accounts and the balance due to the Respondents. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">6    Furthermore, the Appellants themselves

did not want item (e) to be remitted back to the arbitrator presumably because of the

extraordinarily long delay he had taken to publish his award.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">7    In the circumstances, I did not think

that I should interfere with his award on item (e).</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">8    As for costs, Mr Chung argued that the

court had no power to vary this part of the award and that the court could only remit this

part of the award back to the arbitrator.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">9    He cited a passage from The Law and

Practice of Commercial Arbitration in England 2<sup>nd</sup> Ed by Mustill and Boyd at p

398:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">‘First, the Court of Appeal has power

  to substitute its own order as to costs for that of the trial judge. This the High Court

  cannot do in relation to the order of an arbitrator. It can only remit the award for

  reconsideration<sup>15</sup>, unless the parties empower it by consent to direct how the

  costs of the award should be borne<sup>16</sup>.’</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">10    The case cited in footnote 15 is <i>Anglo-Saxon

Petroleum v Adamastos Shipping Co Ltd </i>(1957) 1 Lloyd’s Rep 73.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">11    However Mr Chung did not cite this

case to me. Instead he cited <i>Tramountana Armadora S.A. v Atlantic Shipping Co S.A. </i>(1978)

1 Lloyd’s Law Reports 391 at 396 and 398 and <i>Demolition &amp; Construction Company

Ltd v Kent River Board</i> (1963) 2 Lloyd’s Law Reports 7 at p 8.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">12    Mr Teh cited The Law and Practice

Relating to Appeals from Arbitration Award by D. Rhidian Thomas 1994 p 214 and the case of

<i>Cargill Inc v Margo Ltd</i> (1983) 2 Lloyd’s Rep 570 and two other cases as

illustrations where the court varied awards on costs after decisions on non-cost issues

were made.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">13    I was of the view that the cases

cited by Mr Chung did not establish the proposition he had advocated. Also, two of the

cases cited by Mr Teh did show the court varying awards on costs after decisions on

non-cost issues were made.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">14    Furthermore, if the court can vary a

substantive part of an award, it must, as a consequence, be able to vary the cost aspect

of the award.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">15    I was satisfied that items (a) to

(d), on which the Appellants had succeeded, were responsible for part of the costs of

arbitration and that the award on such costs should be varied.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">16    Once I determined that as a matter of

principle, the parties agreed that the Respondents should get 75% of the costs of the

arbitration meaning the reference to arbitration and the arbitrator’s fees. I so

ordered. In addition, the Appellants were to pay the fees of the quantity surveyor

(appointed at the request of the arbitrator to assist him) entirely as the quantity

surveyor’s work was not affected by items (a) to (d).</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">17    After considering Calderbank letters,

I awarded the entire costs of Originating Motion 12 of 1999 before me to the Appellants on

a standard basis notwithstanding that the Appellants had not succeeded on item (e) because

that item hardly involved any getting up in the context of the issue I was to determine.

Such costs would be for the Motion up to 6 July 2000.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">18    As for the hearing on 26 July 2000

regarding further arguments on item (e) and arguments on costs, I decided that each party

should bear its own costs as the Appellants had lost on the further arguments in respect

of item (e) but won on the costs issue regarding a variation of the arbitrator’s

award on costs.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">19    The costs of the hearing before

Justice Lai Kew Chai in the same Motion (for leave to appeal to the High Court) was to

follow, as previously ordered by the learned judge.</font></p>
