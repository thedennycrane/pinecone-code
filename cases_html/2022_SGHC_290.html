Accordingly, the STB found that Mr Zhang did not have an automatic right to be on the council and his appointment was therefore invalidated. The grounds of decision issued by the STB on this will be referred to as the “GD”. I allowed the appeal by the MCST.

The court cited (at [90]) the following definition of errors of law from <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s Laws of England</span> vol 1(1) (Butterworths, 4th Ed Reissue, 1989) (“<span class="font-italic">Halsbury</span>”) at para 70, which stated:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Errors of law include misinterpretation of a statute or any other legal document or a rule of common law; asking oneself and answering the wrong question, taking irrelevant considerations into account or failing to take relevant considerations into account when purporting to apply the law to the facts; admitting inadmissible evidence or rejecting admissible and relevant evidence; exercising a discretion on the basis of incorrect legal principles; giving reasons which disclose faulty legal reasoning or which are inadequate to fulfil an express duty to give reasons, and misdirecting oneself as to the burden of proof.

That a “mixed-use development” under s 53A(2) of the BMSMA is defined with reference to s 53A(1), is clear from the phrase in s 53A(2): “in the case of a management corporation of a mixed-use development mentioned in subsection (1)”.

</div> Thus, the only issue was whether Palm Gardens consisted of buildings authorised under the PA for two or more of the classes of use identified under s 53A(1) of the BMSMA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 During the second reading of the Building Maintenance and Strata Management (Amendment) Bill (Bill No 29/2017), the Second Minster for National Development explained the rationale for the proposed introduction of s 53A of the BMSMA as such (Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (11 September 2017) vol 94 (Desmond Lee, Second Minister for National Development)):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">On the issue of fair representation, clause 38 or new section 53A provides that each class of use in a mixed-use development will be given a reserved seat in the council. Different classes of uses have different needs, so it is important for each to have a “voice”. The classes of use include residential, commercial and single independent lot groups like hotels and serviced residences. There was feedback about a residential and retail development where the council was dominated by retail SPs. This resulted in a skewed decision by the council to lease common property cheaply to the retail shops in the development. The facility of reserved seats for each user class will go some way to address over-domination by any one user class, and put each group in a more equitable position in managing the MCST.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">It was thus apparent that the legislative purpose of s 53A of the BMSMA is to ensure adequate representation across different classes of use within a development. With that as the background, I examined the specific question arising in this case, of <span class="font-italic">how</span> to determine whether a development was authorised for a particular class of use. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The grant of written permission by the URA </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 The “competent authority” under the PA is defined under s 2 of the PA as “any competent authority appointed under section 5 to be responsible for the operation of [the PA]”. Section 5(1) of the PA confers on the Minister the power to “appoint any person or persons as the Minister thinks fit to be the competent authority or authorities responsible for the operation of [the PA]” by notification in the Gazette. In turn, by para 1(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Planning Act (Appointment of Competent Authority) (Cap 232, N 7, 2007 Rev Ed) (GN No S 110/2001) (“GN 110/2001”), “the Chief Executive Officer of the [URA] established under the Urban Redevelopment Authority Act (Cap 340)” was appointed to be “the competent authority responsible for the operation of the provisions of the [PA] and any rules made thereunder, except sections 7 and 8 of the [PA] and any rules made under section 10 of the [PA]”.  By para 1(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of GN 110/2001, the Chief Planner of the URA was appointed to be the competent authority for the operation of ss 7 and 8, and any rules made under s 10 of the PA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Section 14(4)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the PA states that subject to any rules, the competent authority, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the URA, may “grant written permission, either unconditionally or subject to any conditions the competent authority considers fit”. Section 2 of the PA defines “written permission” as “a planning permission … granted by a competent authority”. In other words, the URA is effectively the competent authority which determines whether buildings have been authorised for particular classes of use under the PA. Following from this, whether the development consists of “buildings authorised under the Planning Act 1998 for 2 or more of the following classes of use”, such that s 53A of the BMSMA is applicable, may be assessed by examining the written permission issued by the URA for that property. This is also common ground among the parties.

</div>  In other words, even where land is zoned as “Residential”, the URA guidelines allow for commercial shops to operate in developments built on such land, within certain parameters. It was thus clear that the URA land zoning of a particular plot of land is not determinative of whether a development has two or more authorised classes of use under the PA. Whether there is such authorisation would still have to be assessed with reference to the latest WP issued by the URA (see [21] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The defendants submitted that a shop subsisting in land zoned as “Residential” is not a “shop” that falls under the “commercial” class of use under s 53A(1) of the BMSMA. Instead, shops which are operated on land zoned as “Residential” should be classified as “ancillary shops”, which are allowed for under the URA guidelines. With respect, this went against the plain words of s 53A(1) of the BMSMA, which clearly indicates as a possible class of use “commercial … such as a shop”.  Section 53A(1) of the BMSMA does not state that <span class="font-italic">only</span> a non-ancillary shop can be authorised for commercial use. To accept the defendants’ submission would have meant imputing into s 53A(1) of the BMSMA, the restriction that “shop” only refers to a shop that is not ancillary to the development, when the plain language of s 53A(1) of the BMSMA cannot sustain such an interpretation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 In addition, if Parliament had intended that the authorised classes of use under the PA for the purposes of s 53A(1) of the BMSMA were to be determined according to the URA land zoning, the provision could have stated so expressly in those terms, but it did not.

The STB stated that replies from the BCA and the URA “unambiguously stated that [Palm Gardens] is classified as a residential development” (GD at [33]). It appears that the STB had relied on a reply from a more junior officer in the BCA, a Senior Manager in Building Management (the “BCA Senior Manager”), who stated (GD at [33]):

In any event, the central inquiry under s 53A of the BMSMA is not whether the BCA had registered the MCST as residential or otherwise, but whether under the PA, the MCST consisted of buildings authorised for two or more of the classes of use identified in s 53A(1) of the BMSMA. That must be answered with reference to the latest WP for Palm Gardens. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 In determining that Palm Gardens was not a mixed-use development, the STB also noted that the URA stated that Palm Gardens is classified as a residential development. It appears that the other correspondence relied on by the STB was from an URA officer. The defendants had written to the URA to ask, with reference to the WP, whether Palm Gardens was a mixed-use development and whether Section 53A BMSMA applied to Palm Gardens. The URA officer replied:

While s 53A of the BMSMA specifically states that the question of whether a development is “mixed-use” is assessed with reference to the authorisation under the Planning Act, the URA officer did not make reference to this, but instead simply said that she was not able to comment on the BMSMA.

Instead, a more senior BCA officer, the BCA Deputy Director, had stated that reference should be made to the written permission issued by the URA (see [33] above) and that where the written permission stated that there were housing (residence) and shop units (commercial), s 53A BMSMA would apply (see [34] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 I would add that the determination of what constitutes a “mixed-use development” for the purposes of s 53A of the BMSMA is not related to the duty or power of a MCST under s 29(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the BMSMA. In the course of submissions, the defendants highlighted that in an earlier STB decision, the STB had found that the MCST has the power pursuant to s 29(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the BMSMA to restrict members of the public who are not residents, guests of residents or related staff to enter the development and accordingly, to patronise the commercial units in the development.

</div> As this issue was not before me, I made no judgment on this. However, it appeared that there was some concern that if Palm Gardens were found to be a “mixed-use development” under s 53A of the BMSMA, that would affect the ability of the MCST to make restrictions on entry. However, there is nothing in s 29(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the BMSMA that refers to s 53A of the BMSMA, or vice versa. In my analysis, and in the submission of both counsels,
