The breakdown of the commission is as follows: </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><table class="table table-sm table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">(a)</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Commission for CAA programmes</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">$682,305.00</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">(b)</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Commission for TLI programmes</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">$64,780.00</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">(c)</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Commission for BITC programmes</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">$15,950.80</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left"></div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-right"><span class="font-weight-bold">Total:</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right"><span class="font-weight-bold">$763,035.80</span></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Consequently, the net sum payable by P to D was $763,035.80 – $345,609.30 = $417,426.50. Based on the Judgment at [26]–[27], it is not entirely clear whether the Judge took the view that of the $763,035.80 in commission owed, $15,298.55 in advance commission had already been paid by P to D. On appeal, parties do not dispute that this is the view which should be taken. Therefore, arguably, the Judge should have simply reduced the $763,035.80 by $15,298.55 and excluded the latter from the amounts to be paid by D to P. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 P has appealed but D has not. The Judge’s main reason for finding P liable to D for $763,035.80 in commission is that the MOU applies only to Leadership People Management (“LPM”) and Service Leadership (“SL”) programmes. As it is undisputed that the programmes offered by CAA, TLI and BITC were not LPM and SL programmes, the MOU did not apply to the programmes offered by CAA, TLI and BITC. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 Even if the MOU applies, the Judge was of the view that P was not entitled to rely on cl 3 to withhold payment to D. Clause 3 provides for P to pay D, “14 working days upon receiving disbursement of fund for completed [programmes] … and all terms stated on schedule1 being full filled” [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>]. In the present dispute, P alleged that he has not received his commission from CAA but he has received them from TLI and BITC.

</div> The Judge took the view that cl 3 referred to the time of payment rather than P’s obligation to make payment.

</div> In any event, the reduced quantum as mentioned by P for the TLI and BITC programmes exceed the quantum claimed by D in his Reply to Defence to Counterclaim.

</div>
</div> Although DCC at [28] refers to the Statement of Claim (Amendment No 1) (“SOC”) at [2] and [4] and SOC at [4] in turn refers to the MOU as the contractual basis, it is quite clear from the other paragraphs of DCC that D does not accept that the MOU applies. In the circumstances, it is clear from D’s pleadings that D is relying on a contract other than the MOU. Therefore, D did plead a contractual entitlement. The question of evidence will be addressed later.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 P argues that D did not elaborate on matters such as when the other contract was made. While this is true, it is not fatal to D’s claim because P himself proceeded below on the basis that there was a contract applicable to the initial LPM/SL programmes and the programmes from the three ATOs in question. It is just that P’s case was that the MOU was the contract or, at least, that the terms of the MOU apply to the contract. Furthermore, P’s affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”) elaborated on the commission structure (for the programmes from the three ATOs) between P and D.

</div> As mentioned, the Judge decided that the MOU did not apply or, alternatively, cl 3 did not preclude D’s claim (see [8]–[9] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 Based on the terms of the MOU, we agree with the Judge that the terms do not explicitly cover the programmes from the three ATOs. In reaching this conclusion, we consider the question of whether it can be said that the reference in the fourth paragraph of the MOU to “SFC” programmes (meaning Skills Future Credits) applies to programmes from the three ATOs. We note that “SFC” is not actually a programme. It is a credit that may be used for programmes. Notwithstanding the poor drafting of the MOU, the question is whether SFC could be used for CAA programmes and if so, whether this means that the MOU applies to CAA programmes. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 The Judge did not deal with this point. In P’s Reply and Defence to Counterclaim (Amendment No 1), P alleges that the MOU covers SFC programmes and the CAA (and LTI and BITC) programmes are SFC applicable.

</div> he (and P) did not adduce objective evidence to establish that SFC could be used for CAA programmes funded by IBF.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 In the circumstances, there is insufficient evidence to establish that SFC could be used for CAA programmes funded by IBF.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Since P fails on the argument that the MOU applies because SFC could be used for CAA programmes, the MOU as initially drafted does not extend to the programmes from the three ATOs including CAA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 Although the MOU states that it will be in effect from the date of signing till both parties agree to cease collaboration by written notice, this does not help P because the anterior question is whether, at inception, the MOU applies to CAA programmes. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 The second and third questions (see [16] above) may be considered together. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 P’s pleadings are vague. They say that the MOU applies but there is no elaboration as to whether it applies at inception or was extended by oral agreement or conduct to the programmes from the three ATOs. Nevertheless, we are of the view that P’s pleadings are wide enough to allow the court to consider whether the MOU was subsequently extended by the parties to such programmes orally or by conduct. Nevertheless, we find that there is no prejudice to D because D knew that P was arguing that the MOU applies (by whichever route). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 It appears that subsequent to the MOU, parties orally agreed that P would pay D commissions for the students successfully enrolled in these programmes. Even the commission structure was agreed. This is set out in P’s AEIC at [20] and is not disputed by D (see also [14] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 It should be borne in mind that the MOU does say that the contents of the MOU may be modified in writing between the parties. But we do not think that this precludes P from arguing that parties had orally agreed to or proceeded on the basis that the MOU was extended to the programmes in question. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The better view is that this term was intended to apply only if parties intend to modify the existing terms in the MOU, but not if the existing terms were to be extended to other programmes. Extending the MOU to other programmes was not inconsistent with the MOU which did not specifically say that it was to be confined to LPM and SL programmes. In fact, the purpose of the MOU appeared to be much broader. It was described as “a working agreement between the parties for the marketing of WSQ and SFC programs that will be offered by the Providers”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 In P’s AEIC, he says that at inception he told D that the MOU was to apply to other programmes not limited to LPM and SL programmes.

</div>
</div> It says, “Strictly according to our agreement signed, Comm is payable from disbursements …”. The message seems to suggest that according to an agreement signed by the parties, any commission payable to D is to be paid after the commission is paid by the ATOs to P and is consistent with P’s position. However, after some other messages between the parties, there is a message from D to P about 12 minutes later saying, “Now u forcing people To settle things where is not agreed”. It is unclear just from the series of messages whether D was disagreeing with P that according to the signed agreement (which must be the MOU as this is the only agreement signed by the parties), D is entitled to payment only after P receives his own commission. Therefore, as D was not cross-examined on this message, it is also unsafe to accept P’s submission and rely on it to D’s detriment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Nevertheless, in the circumstances and bearing in mind the WhatsApp message of 4 July 2020 and D’s omission to disagree with it, we find that the Judge had erred. The MOU applies to the programmes from the three ATOs, including the CAA programmes in question. With respect, although the Judge mentioned that the fundamental assumption of P’s case was that the MOU extends to these programmes, he had focused on whether the terms of the MOU applied at inception and not so much as to whether they were subsequently extended to the programmes. There was only a short reference by the Judge to such extension. He had also not mentioned the WhatsApp message of 4 July 2020 although it was raised in the cross-examination of D. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The parties having proceeded and arranged their affairs on the common assumption that the MOU extended to these other programmes, it would be unjust for either party to be allowed to resile from this assumption.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 We now come to the interpretation and application of cl 3 given our view that the MOU applies to the programmes from the three ATOs. In the Judgment at [18], the Judge said that the provision seems to be referring to the time of payment rather than P’s obligation to make payment. If P wanted to exonerate himself from liability to pay commission to D in the event P does not receive his own commission, P needed to draft this in clear and express terms. Applying the rules of <span class="font-italic">contra proferentem</span>, the Judge interpreted cl 3 against P. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 In our view, the Judge erred because he proceeded on the basis that the time for payment was different from P’s obligation to pay D. With respect, the two are inter-connected. If the time for payment from P to D does not arise until P himself receives payment of his commission, then P’s obligation to pay D has not yet arisen, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, P is not yet in default. It is quite clear from cl 3 (although not well-drafted) that payment to D is deferred until P receives his own commission. P then has to pay within 14 days. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Significantly, apart from asserting that the Judge did not err in saying that cl 3 referred to the time of payment,
