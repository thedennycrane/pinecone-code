This is because PC 75 was invalid as the contractor was not entitled to submit further payment claims after the final payment claim and/or final certificate had been issued. I shall refer to this objection as the “PC 75 objection”.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The adjudication application was lodged by the contractor outside of the applicable timelines, either prematurely if the contractual timelines were applicable, or out of time if the statutory timelines were applicable. I shall refer to this objection as the “adjudication application objection”.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The adjudicator exceeded his jurisdiction by assessing the contractor’s claim for additional preliminaries.

Therefore the adjudication did not concern a payment claim under s 10(1) of the SOPA and the adjudication determination was not enforceable under that Act.

</div> A respondent who fails to file a payment response should be taken to have waived its right to raise a jurisdictional objection only if the objection fell within the first category. This is because the first category of invalidity can be rectified by a claimant through issuing a new payment claim, while the second category of invalidity cannot be so rectified.

</div> According to the developer, as its PC 75 objection fell within the second category, it was not required to raise its objection in a payment response.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 I was unable to accept the developer’s submissions in this regard. In <span class="font-italic">Audi Construction</span>, the Court of Appeal clearly stated that the duty to speak arises in relation to <span class="font-italic">any</span> jurisdictional objection to a payment claim. The developer’s objection to PC 75, however classified, would fall within this broad scope where there is a duty to speak.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 As the Court of Appeal explained in <span class="font-italic">Audi Construction</span>, the reason that there is a broad duty to raise jurisdictional objections early, in the payment response, is because s 15(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the SOPA restricts the issues which can be raised before an adjudicator to issues stated in the payment response. The duty also arises on account of the general regime of expeditious dispute resolution underlying the SOPA. Section 15(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the SOPA reads:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The respondent shall not include in the adjudication response, and the adjudicator shall not consider, any reason for withholding any amount, including but not limited to any cross-claim, counterclaim and set-off, unless —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) where the adjudication relates to a construction contract, the reason was included in the relevant payment response provided by the respondent to the claimant; …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 In particular, the Court of Appeal stated in <span class="font-italic">Audi Construction</span>:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">52. … Of overriding importance to the scheme of the Act is the expeditious resolution of payment disputes, and there is no reason to allow respondents to withhold jurisdictional objections <span class="font-italic">of any nature</span> only to spring them on the claimant in court.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">66. … By that provision [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, s 15(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)], the Act restricts the issues which can be raised before an adjudicator to the issues stated in the payment response provided by the respondent to the claimant. It follows that if a respondent wants to raise a jurisdictional objection before the adjudicator, he must include that objection in the payment response. Reading s 15(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) as requiring a respondent to raise <span class="font-italic">any</span> jurisdictional objection it has in its payment response is, again, entirely in line with the purpose of the Act, which need not be repeated (see [1], [49] and [52] above). Section 15(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and the general regime of expeditious dispute resolution being the relevant legal context of this case, we have no hesitation in holding that a respondent has a duty to raise jurisdictional objections in his payment response.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Therefore, as the developer failed to file a payment response, it was estopped from raising any arguments on the invalidity of PC 75 and the corresponding lack of jurisdiction of the adjudicator in the adjudication and in the present proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the architect’s letter was a payment response or other objection to PC 75</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 The developer submitted in the alternative that it was not estopped from raising its jurisdictional objection because it had raised objections to PC 75 through the architect’s letter dated 24 November 2017.

The contractor, developer and architect were operating outside the scope of the Contract. In this regard, the developer and architect were not entitled to unilaterally treat PC 73 as the final payment claim, proceed to issue the final certificate, and prevent any further payment claims from being submitted thereafter by the contractor. To allow otherwise would result in injustice to the contractor who may have intended to include other heads of claim if the payment claim in question was to be treated as the final claim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 The facts in the present case were also distinguishable from that in <span class="font-italic">Lau Fook Hoong</span>, a case relied on by the developer<span class="font-italic">. </span>While the contractor in this case had expressly written to the architect and the developer to inform them that PC 73 should not be treated as its final payment claim,

</div> the claimant in <span class="font-italic">Lau Fook Hoong </span>had in fact provided confirmation that the payment claim in question was its “final account” document upon a request for clarification from the quantity surveyor (see <span class="font-italic">Lau Fook Hoong</span> at [8]–[9]). Thus the principle expressed, <span class="font-italic">obiter</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>in <span class="font-italic">Lau Fook Hoong</span> that no further payment claims should be submitted after the final payment claim as this would defeat the final nature of the final payment claim and accounting process (see <span class="font-italic">Lau Fook Hoong</span> at [48]–[49]) was not applicable in this case as PC 73 was not the final payment claim. I therefore rejected the developer’s submission that PC 75 was invalid as it was issued after the final payment claim and final certificate were issued.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 In any event, as PC 75 was essentially a repeat of PC 73 which had not been adjudicated upon, the contractor was also entitled under s 10(4) of the SOPA to submit PC 75 even if PC 73 was deemed the final payment claim. In <span class="font-italic">Grouteam Pte Ltd v UES Holdings Pte Ltd</span> [2016] 5 SLR 1011, the Court of Appeal held that a “payment claim which merely repeated an earlier claim” is permissible under s 10(4) of the SOPA “where a previous payment claim for the same work or goods was not in fact adjudicated on the merits” (at [57]). The Court of Appeal explained that the mechanism under s 10(4) of the SOPA addresses the potential draconian effect from the mandatory requirement under s 10(2) for payment claims to be served in accordance with stipulated timelines (at [56]–[58]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The developer argued that s 10(4) of the SOPA was applicable in the context of interim payment claims but was not applicable after the final payment claim and/or final certificate had been issued. However I found that the developer’s reading of s 10(4) was not justified by the wording of the section. Under s 10(4), the only restriction on the contractor’s right to submit a repeat claim is that the preceding claim must have been served within six years after the construction work to which the claim relates was carried out. Section 10(4) of the SOPA reads:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Nothing in subsection (1) shall prevent the claimant from including, in a payment claim in which a respondent is named, an amount that was the subject of a previous payment claim served in relation to the same contract which has not been paid by the respondent if, and only if, the first-mentioned payment claim is served within 6 years after the construction work to which the amount in the second-mentioned payment claim relates was last carried out, or the goods or services to which the amount in the second-mentioned payment claim relates were last supplied, as the case may be.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the developer was estopped from raising the adjudication application objection</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 While the developer framed its adjudication application objection as one based on the timing of the lodgement of the adjudication application which could not be raised at the payment response stage, I found that the adjudication application objection was inextricably linked to the PC 75 objection. As the developer was estopped from arguing that PC 75 was invalid under the Contract, the developer was also estopped from making submissions on the applicable timelines for the filing of the adjudication application, since this was dependent on its position on PC 75 which it did not make an election on at the payment response stage.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The adjudication application objection – being premised on the applicability of the default timelines under the SOPA – presupposes that PC 75 is an invalid payment claim under the Contract but is valid under the SOPA. For the reasons that I have stated at [34]–[39] above, the developer was under an obligation to raise its PC 75 objection early <span class="font-italic">via</span> a payment response. Had the developer informed the contractor that it objected to the validity of PC 75 <span class="font-italic">under the Contract</span>, the contractor could have filed its adjudication application in accordance with the SOPA timelines or during the period of overlap, if any, where both timelines would have been met.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 To hold otherwise would allow the developer to reserve its position on PC 75 until the adjudication proceedings and to put forward numerous alternative submissions at the proceedings, both on the validity of the payment claim and the timing of the adjudication application, as was attempted by the developer in the present case. This would put a respondent who does not file a payment response in a more favourable position than one who does so which would defeat the objectives of the SOPA. As the Court of Appeal stated in <span class="font-italic">W Y Steel Construction Pte Ltd v Osko Pte Ltd</span> [2013] 3 SLR 380 (at [33]–[34]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">33 … In view of the scheme of the Act, it is clear that WY Steel’s argument – <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, that s 15(3) applies to exclude consideration of matters not contained in a payment response only where a payment response, albeit an incomplete one, has been filed and not otherwise – cannot be right. This reading would … perversely favour a respondent who did not file a payment response at all over one who did and, thus, would incentivise conduct that defeats the very purposes of the Act.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">34 In our judgment, Parliament intended that a respondent should ventilate his reasons for withholding payment within the timelines prescribed by the Act or suffer the consequences, namely, losing the opportunity to ventilate those reasons at all at the adjudication stage. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Therefore, the developer was estopped from arguing that the adjudication application was either lodged late pursuant to statutory timelines or prematurely pursuant to contractual timelines.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the adjudicator was entitled to consider the contractor’s claim for additional preliminaries</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The contractor made a claim for additional preliminaries totalling $1,678,024.33 arising from the delay in the completion of Phase 2 of the Project.

Therefore, if the work quantities were different as a result of remeasurement or if the work quantities were carried out over a longer duration than originally contracted for, I think the breakdown of the preliminary items in Bill No. 1 were intended to be used to facilitate remeasurement, including remeasuring the preliminary items.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">132  It is therefore my view and finding that the breakdown provided in Bill No. 1 pursuant to Clause 5(2) can be used to assess additional preliminaries which arise from prolongation of the Contract in general and is not confined to prolongation from variations. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 While the developer submitted that the adjudicator had no power to award damages for breach of contract, the additional preliminaries were not awarded on this basis, but pursuant to a term of the Contract. The adjudicator was entitled to find that the contractual provision allowed the contractor to make its claim for additional preliminaries from prolongation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 In <span class="font-italic">Metropole Pte Ltd v Designshop Pte Ltd</span> [2017] 4 SLR 277, the court made a similar finding in relation to the adjudicator’s jurisdiction to interpret a term of the parties’ contract. In that case, the respondent argued that the adjudicator exceeded his jurisdiction by allowing the claimant to rely on cl 2.3(3) of the parties’ contract to make its claims. Clause 2.3(3) of the parties’ contract provided that upon termination of the contract, the respondent was to pay the claimant a minimum of two-thirds of the fee for a particular stage of work if the claimant had carried out any work at all for that stage. In relation to the respondent’s submission that cl 2.3(3) was a clause for damages for breach of contract which should be dealt with in separate dispute resolution proceedings rather than in adjudication proceedings, the court stated (at [93]–[94]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">93  … [T]he manner in which cl 2.3(3) should be interpreted is a matter that falls within the adjudicator’s jurisdiction and is an aspect of the merits of his determination. The adjudicator has interpreted cl 2.3(3) to exclude claims for stages of work for which no work has commenced. He has also found that [the claimant] commenced works for stages E and H but not for stages L, M, and N. He therefore did not allow [the claimant’s] claim for two-thirds of the fees for stages L, M, and N (see adjudication determination at [50]).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">94  Although [the respondent] has made submissions with respect to the appropriate interpretation of cl 2.3(3), the court cannot and should not go into the merits of the adjudicator’s interpretation of cl 2.3(3) or his findings on whether work had indeed commenced for each stage.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 In the present case, the adjudicator interpreted cl 5(2) of the Conditions of Contract as allowing a claim to be made for additional preliminaries from prolongation in general (not just from variation) and the court should not and cannot go into the merits of the adjudicator’s interpretation and assessment. Therefore, I rejected the developer’s submission that the adjudicator exceeded his jurisdiction in awarding the additional preliminaries under cl 5(2) of the Conditions of Contract.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 For the foregoing reasons, I dismissed the developer’s stay application and application to set aside the adjudication determination and the order of court enforcing the adjudication determination.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 In the circumstances, I ordered the sum of $2,276,284.68 and the costs of the application fixed at $17,000 (inclusive of disbursements) to be paid out to the contractor.
