<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This judgment is in relation to the costs orders
                    to be made in Suit No 46 of 2006 (“Suit 46/2006”). In that action,
                    the plaintiff company, Raffles Town Club Pte Ltd (“RTC”) sued the
                    defendants for breach of their fiduciary duties owed to RTC whilst they were
                    directors of the company (“the Main Action”). That led to three
                    third party claims and one third party counterclaim (“the Third Party
                    Claims”). On 29 May 2010, I gave judgment in favour of the
                    defendants in the Main Action and the Third Party Claims (see <em>Raffles Town Club Pte Ltd v Lim Eng Hock Peter and others (Tung Yu-Lien
                        Margaret and others, third parties)</em> [2010] SGHC 163
                    (“the <em>RTC</em> Judgment”)). In other
                    words, all the claimants in Suit 46/2006 were unsuccessful.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       At the conclusion of the <em>RTC</em> Judgment (at [247]), I invited parties to make submissions
                    on costs if these could not be agreed. At the hearing on 4 August 2010, this
                    invitation was taken up by all sides. Each party had its own take on what costs
                    orders would be fair and just in the circumstances and there was little room for
                    agreement. Having considered all their submissions, I now render my decision
                    with regard to costs in Suit 46/2006.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       All the background facts pertinent to this
                    judgment on costs have been amply laid out in the <em>RTC</em> Judgment (particularly at [3] – [31]). As this
                    judgment should be read as a corollary to the <em>RTC</em>
                    Judgment, the same references to parties and documents and the same
                    abbreviations have been employed in both judgments. The rationale for the
                    various costs orders to be made in this judgment is best understood in the light
                    of the main findings in the <em>RTC</em> Judgment and I
                    turn now to those findings, setting out also parties’ submissions on costs
                    in relation to the same.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Main findings in the <em>RTC</em> Judgment and
                parties’ submissions on costs</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Main Action</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       RTC alleged that the Defendants (<em>viz</em>, Peter Lim, Lawrence Ang, William Tan and Dennis
                    Foo) had breached duties owed to the plaintiff company as its directors at the
                    material time by conspiring on a scheme which enabled them to siphon substantial
                    sums of money from RTC for their personal benefit through the following
                    means:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_a"></a>(a)     Accepting 18,992 members into the
                        Club even though they knew or ought to have known that the maximum number of
                        initial members for an exclusive, premier club on the site was around
                        7,000;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_b"></a>(b)     Causing
                        RTC to enter into a sham Management Agreement with EH, under which $78m was
                        paid out by RTC as management fees;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_c"></a>(c)     Paying themselves some $13m by way of disguised dividends,
                        directors’ remuneration and reimbursement of private expenses;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_d"></a>(d)     Earning
                        interest from the loan of $33m that they had procured RTC to make to
                        RTCI.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       These claims were defended vigorously by the
                    Defendants on several fronts, including on the ground that the various impugned
                    transactions had been authorised by the shareholders acting collectively. In
                    particular, Peter Lim sought to distance himself from any alleged impropriety on
                    the part of the directors by denying that he was either a director or a
                    shareholder of RTC at all material times. His denial faced considerable
                    opposition from RTC. Even his alleged co-conspirators, Lawrence Ang and William
                    Tan, brought a counterclaim against Peter Lim and Dennis Foo for an indemnity or
                    contribution on the basis that Peter Lim was a director and shareholder of RTC.
                    On this issue, Lawrence Ang and William Tan aligned themselves with the position
                    taken by RTC in the Main Action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       I agreed with the Defendants in the main and
                    dismissed RTC’s claims against them. However, despite Peter Lim’s
                    strenuous disavowal of his role as a director and shareholder, I had no doubt
                    after having considered the extensive evidence led on this issue at the trial,
                    that he had been a <em>de facto</em> director and
                    beneficial shareholder of RTC (see [64] – [68] of the <em>RTC</em> Judgment).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       While RTC acknowledged in its submissions that
                    in general costs should follow the event, it submitted that where a successful
                    party has raised inappropriate claims or issues which caused delay and expense
                    that general rule should not apply. Since a substantial portion of the trial and
                    submissions was devoted to addressing Peter Lim’s position that he was
                    neither a director nor a shareholder of RTC at the material time, which position
                    was ultimately rejected, RTC proposed that the amount of costs payable to Peter
                    Lim should be reduced by at least 40%. Further, since the expert
                    witnesses’ evidence on the issue of the valuation of RTC was not dealt
                    with extensively by any of the parties or relied upon in the <em>RTC</em> Judgment, RTC proposed that each party should bear its own
                    costs occasioned by the calling of those expert witnesses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Peter Lim sought costs to be awarded to him on
                    an indemnity basis, to be borne jointly and severally by Margaret Tung and Lin
                    Jian Wei, or, alternatively, by them and RTC. Lawrence Ang and William Tan
                    proposed that their costs of defending the Main Action be paid by RTC. There was
                    no dispute that RTC had to pay Dennis Foo’s costs in litigating the Main
                    Action. In addition, Peter Lim, Lawrence Ang and William Tan sought a
                    certificate for costs of more than two solicitors under O 59 r 19 of
                    the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R5, 2006 Rev Ed) (“Rules of
                    Court”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Third Party Claims</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Third party claims were brought against Margaret
                    Tung and Lin Jian Wei, the current directors and shareholders of RTC, as well as
                    against Lawrence Ang and William Tan. The latter pair also instituted a
                    counterclaim against Peter Lim and Dennis Foo.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Lawrence Ang and William Tan v Margaret Tung and Lin Jian
                Wei</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     In their third party claim against Margaret
                    Tung and Lin Jian Wei, Lawrence Ang and William Tan alleged that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_a"></a>(a)     Margaret Tung and Lin Jian Wei had
                        breached cl 7 of the RTC S&amp;PA dated 6 June 2001, and Recital (F)
                        and cl 4.3 of the Deed dated 18 February 2002;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_b"></a>(b)     Margaret Tung and Lin Jian Wei had
                        acted in bad faith, unconscionably and conspired with RTC in commencing the
                        Main Action; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_c"></a>(c)     In so doing, they were using RTC to unjustly enrich
                        themselves.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     With regard to this third party claim, I held
                    that:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The Deed had superseded the RTC S&amp;PA (at
                            [212]);</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The Main Action did not fall within the confines
                            of cl 4.3 of the Deed and that clause had not been breached (at
                            [215]);</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Neither bad faith nor unconscionability could
                            constitute causes of action (at [218]);</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">It was not the predominant purpose of the Main
                            Action to cause damage or injury to Lawrence Ang and William Tan
                            personally, hence, the claim of conspiracy could not succeed (at [224]);
                            and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(e)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Since RTC was unsuccessful in the Main Action,
                            the issue of unjust enrichment did not arise (at [226]).</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     As for costs, Lawrence Ang and William Tan
                    submitted that their costs incurred in instituting this third party claim ought
                    to be paid by RTC. Any costs ordered against them in respect of Margaret Tung
                    and Lin Jian Wei’s successful defence of this third party claim should
                    also be recoverable from RTC.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Peter Lim v Margaret Tung and Lin Jian Wei</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Peter Lim shared Lawrence Ang and William
                    Tan’s misgivings of conspiracy amongst Margaret Tung, Lin Jian Wei and RTC
                    with the predominant intention of causing personal damage and injury to him. I
                    found (at [227]) that whatever intention they had to injure him was incidental
                    to the Main Action and dismissed this claim against them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Despite the failure of his third party claim,
                    Peter Lim submitted that there should be no order as to costs, or,
                    alternatively, that RTC should bear his costs. In respect of the costs of their
                    defending these two third party claims against them, Margaret Tung and Lin Jian
                    Wei took the position that costs should follow the event and that separate costs
                    should be awarded to them since they were represented by separate sets of
                    counsel.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(3)   Peter Lim and Dennis Foo v Lawrence Ang and William
                Tan</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Peter Lim and Dennis Foo claimed that the
                    commencement of the Main Action by RTC constituted breaches on Lawrence Ang and
                    William Tan’s part of cll 2.4(c) and 5.3 of the Deed of Settlement entered
                    into by the four of them. I decided in favour of Lawrence Ang and William Tan
                    because (a) cl 2.4(c) did not cover the loans impugned in the Main Action; and
                    (b) cl 5.3 did not apply when allegations of fraud and dishonesty have been made
                    against Peter Lim and Dennis Foo (see [231] – [232]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Even though Peter Lim and Dennis Foo’s
                    third party claim here was unsuccessful, Peter Lim proposed that there should be
                    no order as to costs, or, alternatively, that RTC should bear his costs. Dennis
                    Foo aligned himself with that position. Lawrence Ang and William Tan submitted
                    that the costs of their defending this third party claim should be payable by
                    Peter Lim and Dennis Foo.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(4)   Lawrence Ang and William Tan v Peter Lim and Dennis Foo (in
                counterclaim)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In their counterclaim, Lawrence Ang and
                    William Tan claimed contribution or indemnity from Peter Lim and Dennis Foo in
                    respect of all aspects of the Main Action on the grounds that: (a) Peter Lim was
                    the controlling mind and driving force behind the business of EH, a beneficial
                    shareholder of both EH and RTC and had received large sums of money from EH and
                    RTC through Lawrence Ang; and (b) Dennis Foo was beholden to Peter Lim and was
                    the latter’s agent. I held (at [236]) that owing to the failure of
                    RTC’s claims against the Defendants the issues of indemnity and
                    contribution, which were contingent on RTC’s success in the Main Action,
                    did not arise.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Lawrence Ang and William Tan submitted that
                    the costs of their instituting this counterclaim should be payable by RTC. Peter
                    Lim and Dennis Foo sought costs to be awarded in their favour, payable by
                    Lawrence Ang and William Tan, or recoverable from RTC.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues to be decided</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In the exercise of my discretion to arrive at
                    costs orders that are fair and just in respect of who is entitled to costs, what
                    costs are recoverable and who is liable to pay costs, I had to determine the
                    following issues:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_a"></a>(a)     In respect of the Main
                        Action:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_19-p2_a-p3_i"></a>(i)       whether Margaret Tung and
                            Lin Jian Wei should be personally liable for Peter Lim’s costs

                    non-party were summarised in the Privy Council’s decision in <em>Dymocks Franchise Systems (NSW) Pty Ltd v Todd and others
                        (Associated Industrial Finance Pty Ltd, Third Party)</em> [2004]
                    1 WLR 2807 (“<em>Dymocks</em>”)
                    delivered by Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood (at [25]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1) Although costs orders against non-parties are to be regarded as
                        "exceptional", exceptional in this context means no more than <em>outside the ordinary run of cases where parties pursue or
                            defend claims for their own benefit and at their own expense</em>.
                        The ultimate question in any such "exceptional" case is <em>whether in all the circumstances it is just to make the
                            order</em>. It must be recognised that this is inevitably to some
                        extent a fact-specific jurisdiction and that there will often be a number of
                        different considerations in play, some militating in favour of an order,
                        some against. (2) Generally speaking the discretion will not be exercised
                        against "pure funders", described in para 40 of Hamilton v Al Fayed (No 2)
                        [2003] QB 1175, 1194 as "those with no personal interest in the
                        litigation, who do not stand to benefit from it, are not funding it as a
                        matter of business, and in no way seek to control its course". In their case
                        the court's usual approach is to give priority to the public interest in the
                        funded party getting access to justice over that of the successful unfunded
                        party recovering his costs and so not having to bear the expense of
                        vindicating his rights. (3) <em>Where, however, the non-party
                            not merely funds the proceedings but substantially also controls or at
                            any rate is to benefit from them, justice will ordinarily require that,
                            if the proceedings fail, he will pay the successful party's
                            costs</em>. <em>The non-party in these cases is not
                            so much facilitating access to justice by the party funded as himself
                            gaining access to justice for his own purposes</em>. He himself is
                        "the real party" to the litigation ... [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The factors enumerated in the passage from
                        <em>Dymocks</em> quoted at <a href="#p1_23">[23]</a> above were adopted with approval by the Court of Appeal in
                        <em>DB Trustees (Hong Kong) Ltd v Consult Asia Pte Ltd and
                        another appeal</em> [2010] SGCA 21 (“<em>DB Trustees</em>”) at [26]. According to the
                    Court’s summary in <em>DB Trustees</em> (at
                    [36]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... The core consideration in relation to the court’s exercise of
                        discretion in ordering costs against a non-party is that it must be
                            <em>just</em>, in all the circumstances of the
                        case, to do so. ... Ordinarily, considerable weight would be placed on the
                        presence of two factors, <em>viz</em>, a <em>close connection between the non-party and the proceedings and
                            a causal link between the non-party and the incurring of
                            costs</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In <em>DB Trustees</em>
                    itself, the Court of Appeal ordered that costs be borne personally by one Ms
                    Florence Koh Lee Kheng (“Ms Koh”) even though it was her company
                    Consult Asia Pte Ltd (“Consult Asia”) which was the party to the
                    proceedings. In the Court of Appeal’s judgment, three critical factors
                    weighed in favour of such a costs order. First, the Court considered (at [38])
                    that she was “solely responsible” for all the underlying actions
                    that Consult Asia had participated in, actions which stemmed from Consult
                    Asia’s (and her) unreasonable lack of cooperation with the receivers over
                    Consult Asia’s business and assets. The proceedings were described (at
                    [40]) as “a delaying contrivance” and “patent abuse of
                    process”. Second, as Ms Koh was the only shareholder and director of
                    Consult Asia, she was the “real and only beneficiary of any successful
                    outcome of Consult Asia’s litigation” (at [41]). Third, it was
                    relevant that Consult Asia appeared to be “unable to satisfy the adverse
                    costs orders made” (at [42]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     On the facts before me, I was not persuaded
                    that it was just in all the circumstances to order that costs payable by RTC in
                    the Main Action should be borne personally by Margaret Tung and Lin Jian Wei.
                    First, there was an insufficiently close connection between them and the Main
                    Action. While they were indeed the <em>only</em>
                    shareholders and directors of RTC at the commencement of Suit 46/2006 and would
                    therefore be the real and <em>only</em> beneficiaries of
                    any successful outcome of the Main Action, that should not be the overriding
                    factor in consideration. Otherwise, any court which rules against any
                    closely-held company would have to order costs against its shareholders and
                    directors personally. This would drive a coach and horses through the doctrine
                    of the separate liability of the company. Fiduciary duties are owed by directors
                    to the company, not to the shareholders directly, and it is the <em>company</em> which has to enforce those duties against the
                    directors even though it may well be the present shareholders and directors who
                    are controlling the litigation. Thus, if the company has not succeeded in
                    establishing its claim of breach of fiduciary duties against the directors who
                    are not or no longer shareholders of the company, it is the company which has to
                    pay the costs of the directors who have successfully resisted its claims, not
                    the shareholders of the company. Such are the consequences of the doctrine of
                    separate legal personality. In <em>DB Trustees</em>, it was
                    Ms Koh’s lack of cooperation with the receivers, denying them access to
                    documents pertaining to the affairs and property of Consult Asia that
                    precipitated the litigation instituted by DB Trustees. The Main Action in this
                    case could not be said to have been directly precipitated by any such
                    unreasonable conduct on Margaret Tung and Lin Jian Wei’s
                part.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Second, there was no causal link between the
                    non-parties, Margaret Tung and Lin Jian Wei, and the incurring of the costs in
                    the Main Action. In <em>Dymocks</em>, the Privy Council
                    awarded costs against Associated Industrial Finance Pty Ltd
                    (“Associated”) because it was Associated who had advanced moneys
                    to the respondents on the security of an all moneys debenture over another
                    company wholly owned by the respondents to fund the appeals to the New Zealand
                    Court of Appeal and the Privy Council; <em>but for
                        Associated’s involvement</em>, the appellate proceedings which
                    led to the incurring of further costs would <em>not</em>
                    have taken place. In the instant case, there was no evidence that Margaret Tung
                    and Lin Jian Wei were funding the Main Action instituted by RTC and thereby
                    incurring extra costs unreasonably. It must be borne in mind that an
                    unsuccessful claim is not necessarily an unwarranted one. The mere fact that RTC
                    failed at first instance to establish its claims against the Defendants did not
                    necessarily mean that the controllers of RTC had acted unreasonably and
                    improperly or had engaged in speculative litigation without <em>bona fide</em> belief in their claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Third, and most importantly, RTC was at all
                    times a solvent company. There was no evidence before me that RTC could not pay
                    the costs of litigation, resulting in injustice to the receiving parties. In
                        <em>Dymocks</em>, their Lordships held that (at
                        <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a>) “where a non-party promotes
                    and funds proceedings by an <em>insolvent company</em>
                    solely or substantially for his own financial benefit, he should be liable for
                    the costs if his claim or defence or appeal fails” [emphasis added]. In
                        <em>DB Trustees</em>, the Court’s determination
                    to award costs against Ms Koh personally was “influenced by the fact that
                        <em>Consult Asia does not appear to be able to pay the costs
                        orders made against it</em> and that Ms Koh had, in fact, caused the
                    incurring of unnecessary costs” [emphasis added] (at <a href="#p1_49">[49]</a>). Apart from the “close
                    connection” and “causal link” elements, the inability of
                    the unsuccessful party to pay the costs of litigation is an important factor in
                    the determination of whether it would be just to make a non-party bear the
                    costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Indemnity basis</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Costs on an indemnity basis should only be
                    ordered in a special case or where there are exceptional circumstances: see
                        <em>Lee Kuan Yew v Vinocur John and others</em> [1996]
                    1 SLR(R) 840 at [30], citing Chao Hick Tin J’s unreported
                    decision in <em>Lee Hiok Ping v Lee Hiok Woon (sued as executors
                        and trustees of the estate of Lee Wee Nam, deceased)</em> (Suit Nos
                    1401 of 1973 and 2457 of 1981, unreported). In my judgment, this was not such a
                    special case nor were the circumstances exceptional enough to warrant the award
                    of costs on an indemnity basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Two cases may be considered as examples of
                    circumstances exceptional enough to warrant costs on indemnity basis. First, in
                        <em>Goodwood Recoveries Ltd v Breen; Breen v
                        Slater</em> [2006] 1 WLR 2723, costs were awarded against
                    the plaintiff company’s director (a non-party) personally on an indemnity
                    basis. The facts in that case were exceptional: the trial judge found that the
                    director had been dishonest in failing to disclose a key document, lied in
                    giving evidence and attempted improperly to persuade a witness not to give
                    evidence for the defence. The Court of Appeal upheld the costs order, holding
                    that the whole of the costs had been caused by his dishonesty, impropriety and
                    exceptional conduct. Second, in <em>DB Trustees</em>, costs
                    were awarded on an indemnity basis on Ms Koh personally because the Court of
                    Appeal was of the view (at [49]) that she had “plainly abused the
                    judicial process” and “dragged” the matter “without
                    plausible reasons”, causing prejudice to the other parties’ right
                    to realise their security and recover monies due to them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In other cases, costs on an indemnity basis
                    were sought but not awarded. In <em>Heng Holdings SEA (Pte) Ltd v
                        Tomongo Shipping Co Ltd</em> [1997] 2 SLR(R) 813, the Court
                    of Appeal ordered costs to be on a standard basis even though there was a
                    material non-disclosure of facts. In <em>Ng Eng Ghee and others v
                        Mamata Kapildev Dave and others (Horizon Partners Pte Ltd, intervener) and
                        another appeal</em> [2009] 4 SLR(R) 155 (“<em>Ng Eng Ghee</em>”), despite the appellants’
                    submissions that the respondents had suppressed information relating to an offer
                    for collective sale, conducted the strata titles board proceedings in an
                    unjustifiably adversarial manner, the Court of Appeal was of the view (at [32])
                    that the matters alleged did not compel a departure from the usual basis of
                    costs even though different aspects of the respondents’ conduct merited
                    varying degrees of criticism.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     In the instant case, it was argued on Peter
                    Lim’s behalf that Margaret Tung and Lin Jian Wei had been engaging in
                    speculative litigation and had not acted <em>bona fide</em>
                    because (a) RTC’s claims against the Defendants were entirely inconsistent
                    with positions previously taken by them; (b) RTC had relied on documents which
                    were inadmissible in law; and (c) RTC had adopted tactics that caused
                    embarrassment to Peter Lim such as the inclusion of criminal allegations in its
                    Statement of Claim and the distribution of the Notes of Evidence of the entire
                    cross-examination of Peter Lim in his matrimonial proceedings which touched on
                    his personal affairs. While one could be critical of certain aspects of
                    RTC’s conduct, I was of the view that these matters alleged by Peter Lim
                    did not lead inexorably to a departure from the standard basis of costs. They

                    order. Even though RTC’s claims against the Defendants had been dismissed
                    “in its entirety” (at [247] of the <em>RTC</em> Judgment), there was one issue on which I agreed with RTC:
                    that Peter Lim was at all material times a <em>de
                        facto</em> director and shareholder of RTC.</p>

                        misconduct of the successful party during the pre-litigation or litigation
                        process and show its displeasure.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     In order to make out a claim of breach of
                    directors’ duties against Peter Lim, RTC had to first establish that Peter
                    Lim was a director at the material time. Unlike the other three Defendants,
                    Peter Lim vigorously denied that he was a director and a shareholder of RTC,
                    despite the clear evidence that he was a <em>de facto</em>
                    director with a substantial beneficial shareholding in RTC at the material time.
                    Even though Chan Lay Hoon, Peter Lim’s “trusted lieutenant”
                    in RTC, gave testimony in favour of Peter Lim that he was just a consultant of
                    RTC, her evidence actually showed clearly that he was a <em>de
                        facto</em> director. According to her, Peter Lim was present at formal
                    and informal meetings where matters in relation to RTC and EH were discussed,
                    whatever he recommended would be implemented, and Peter Lim’s consent was
                    required for the acceptance of 19,000 members and the payment of 15% commission
                    to EH per membership entrance fee. Indeed, Lawrence Ang, William Tan and Dennis
                    Foo all agreed that Peter Lim had a decisive say in the major decisions of RTC
                    and they often deferred to his views. Owing to the weight of evidence against
                    him, that defence was plainly unsustainable and unmeritorious.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Much time and effort was spent by all the
                    parties on the issue of his <em>de facto</em> directorship
                    and beneficial shareholding in RTC. Five of the twelve days spent
                    cross-examining Peter Lim were devoted to this issue; two-thirds of the time
                    that Chan Lay Hoon was under cross-examination was spent on the same issue.
                    Furthermore, substantial time at trial was also taken up cross-examining the
                    other Defendants on Peter Lim’s position as director and shareholder.
                    Although I had refrained from stating in the <em>RTC</em>
                    Judgment that Peter Lim had blatantly lied on oath when he strenuously denied
                    that he was a director and a beneficial shareholder of RTC, I am of the view
                    that I can take such conduct into account when ordering costs. Peter Lim’s
                    raising of the unmeritorious defence that he was not a director with a
                    substantial beneficial shareholding in RTC had unnecessarily protracted the
                    proceedings and added to the complexity of those proceedings because of the
                    adroit manner in which he concealed his beneficial shareholding of some 40% in
                    RTC and the very substantial payments of monies and distribution of other
                    benefits from time to time arising out of that large beneficial shareholding.
                    Therefore, in my judgment, it would be fair to deprive him of his costs incurred
                    in litigating that defence. RTC should not be made to bear any part of his costs
                    pertaining to the issue of whether he was a director with a substantial
                    shareholding in RTC at the material time.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Costs occasioned by calling of expert witnesses on valuation </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     During the course of trial it occurred to me
                    that it might be a worthwhile exercise to call evidence of expert witnesses on
                    the valuation of RTC as it stood in 2001. One of the Defendants’ grounds
                    of defence was that the current shareholders of RTC had bought the shares in RTC
                    in 2001 at a value that reflected their full knowledge of how the Defendants
                    were running the company’s affairs; it would therefore be unconscionable
                    for them to claim damages against the Defendants for breach of duties which they
                    had already ratified. Accordingly, in order to have all the relevant, even
                    peripherally relevant, evidence before me, I invited the parties to call expert
                    evidence on the valuation of RTC’s shares to determine whether the current
                    shareholders of RTC had in fact significantly overpaid for the RTC shares, which
                    could then have indicated a certain amount of ignorance on the part of current
                    shareholders of the various payments of monies to the Defendants or to EH in
                    alleged breach of the Defendants’ fiduciary duties as directors of RTC.
                    Since it was evidence that I had invited the parties to call at trial, it cannot
                    be said that the defendants had acted improperly in adducing such expert
                    evidence and in incurring those costs. Accordingly, RTC as the unsuccessful
                    party in the Main Action should bear the costs of the experts called by the
                    successful parties.</p>

                    than two solicitors must be reasonable, having regard to para 1 of Appendix 1 to
                    O 59: O 59 r 19(3). Such a certificate will be granted where the services of
                    more than two solicitors are <em>reasonably necessary</em>
                    for the adequate presentation of the case: see <em>Colliers

                    certificate should only be granted in exceptional circumstances, which would
                    include cases “which involve a high degree of complexity of facts and/or
                    law or, where there are many issues of both fact and law and, trial is
                    lengthy”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The 82-day hearing of Suit 46/2006 was the
                    longest ever civil trial in Singapore’s history. A wide range of issues
                    was canvassed at trial. There were 22 factual and expert witnesses. The
                    documents were voluminous, totalling over 300 volumes of bundles of documents
                    which required the Supreme Court auditorium to be specially set up as a
                    “mega court”. In the circumstances, I am of the view that the use
                    of more than two solicitors was reasonably necessary for the adequate
                    preparation and presentation of the case. Therefore, I certify costs for three
                    solicitors for the Main Action with respect to the parties who had sought this

                    William Tan submitted that this Court should exercise its discretion to order
                    RTC to pay the costs occasioned by the third party proceedings since RTC’s
                    claim was dismissed and it was proper and reasonable for the Defendants to have
                    issued third party proceedings. When is it proper and reasonable for the
                    defendants to institute third party proceedings such that the costs of those
                    proceedings should be borne fully by the plaintiff who is a non-party to the
                    same proceedings?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     In <em>Edginton v
                        Clark</em>, the plaintiff, a squatter of a vacant bombed site, brought
                    an action in trespass against the defendants who had entered on the site as
                    weekly tenants of the freeholders and dispossessed him, claiming that he had
                    acquired title by adverse possession for over 12 years. At one point during the
                    12-year period, he had written letters to the agent of the freeholders offering
                    to purchase the site. The defendants joined the freeholders as third parties as
                    those letters amounted to the plaintiff’s acknowledgement of the
                    freeholders’ title. The plaintiff’s claim was dismissed. The Court
                    of Appeal upheld that dismissal and granted the defendants’ application to
                    add the costs which they had been ordered to pay to the third parties to the
                    costs which the unsuccessful plaintiff should pay to them. Upjohn LJ observed
                    that (at 384):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the circumstances of this case it is abundantly clear that the

                        order that the plaintiff should pay their costs directly. [emphasis

          <em>Edginton v Clark</em>
                    was applied in <em>Thomas v Times Book Company Limited; Cox
                        (Third Party) and Cleverdon (Fourth Party)</em> [1966]
                    1 WLR 911 (“<em>Thomas v
                    Times</em>”) and the plaintiff was ordered to bear the costs of the
                    third and fourth parties since the plaintiff’s claim had made the third
                    and fourth party proceedings <em>inevitable</em>. Cleverdon
                    (the fourth party) found an original manuscript of a play by Dylan Thomas, who
                    had told the former to keep it if he could find it. Cleverdon sold it to Cox who
                    in turn sold it to the defendant. Thomas’s wife, as administratrix of his
                    estate sued the defendant for possession of the manuscript. The defendant joined
                    Cox as third party and Cox joined Cleverdon. Plowman J dismissed the
                    plaintiff’s claim, holding that there was sufficient delivery of the
                    manuscript to perfect the gift by Thomas to Cleverdon. The learned judge
                    reasoned as follows (at 919 - 920):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is quite clear from the judgment of the Court of Appeal in <em>Edginton v Clark</em> that I have a complete discretion
                        in regard to the costs of the third and fourth parties. The action was
                        brought against the defendants as the persons who were in possession of the
                        manuscript of “Under Milk Wood,” but it became clear at the
                        early stage of the proceedings, and certainly before the third and fourth
                        party proceedings were started, that <em>the real issue in
                            the action was going to be whether Dylan Thomas had made a gift of this
                            manuscript to the fourth party, Cleverdon</em>; and it was also
                        clear that an attack was likely to be made—as in fact it was
                        made—on the character of Cleverdon. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In all those circumstances, it seems to me that not only did the
                        plaintiff’s claim render the third and fourth party proceedings
                            <em>inevitable</em>, but that the fourth party was
                        amply justified in being represented before me by counsel. After reflecting
                        on the matter, I have come to the conclusion that the right order for me to
                        make is that the plaintiff should pay the costs of the third and fourth
                        parties. That I think now disposes of all questions of costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     A similar issue arose in the local case of
                        <em>SAL Industrial Leasing Ltd v Teck Koon (Motor) Trading (a
                        firm)</em> [1998] 1 SLR(R) 501 (“<em>SAL</em>”). The plaintiff finance company entered into a
                    hire-purchase agreement with Greenbay Marine Pte Ltd for the purchase of a
                    second-hand car from the defendant. When the hire was unpaid, the plaintiff sued
                    the defendant, who denied having sold the car to the plaintiff. The defendant
                    initiated third party proceedings for indemnity or contribution from, <em>inter alios</em>, one Tan Kang Hoe (“Tan”). The
                    Court of Appeal found that there was insufficient evidence to prove that the
                    plaintiff was the purchaser and not just the financier of the hire-purchase car
                    and that the defendant never intended to contract with the plaintiff; in other
                    words, <em>the plaintiff had sued the wrong party</em>. The
                    Court of Appeal accepted that the defendant had properly issued third party
                    proceedings but since the plaintiff’s claim against the defendant was
                    unsustainable, the question of indemnity or contribution did not arise.
                    Therefore, Lai Kew Chai J’s order that the plaintiff should pay the
                    defendant’s costs for issuing third party proceedings was
                upheld.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     It can be surmised from the above cases that
                    in order to justify visiting the costs of the third party proceedings on the
                    plaintiff, he must have instituted the claim against the defendant under such
                    circumstances that it became <em>inevitable</em> that the
                    costs of the third party proceedings had to be incurred <em>as a
                        direct result</em> of the plaintiff’s claim. In <em>Edginton v Clark</em> and <em>Thomas v
                        Times</em>, it was held that the <em>real
                        issue</em> was not litigated between the plaintiff and the defendant,
                    but between the plaintiff and the third (or fourth) party. Since the third
                    parties <em>should</em> have been the proper parties in the
                    suit, the plaintiff who was unsuccessful in his claim against the defendant
                    should bear the costs of those third party proceedings, not the defendant. In
                    similar vein, the defendant in <em>SAL</em>’s case
                    should not have been sued at all since the contract on which the plaintiff was
                    relying was not at all entered into with the defendant; again, the real issue in
                    that case did not concern the defendant. In such circumstances, as between the
                    defendant and the plaintiff, the fairer and more just result as regards the
                    costs of the third party proceedings would be to impose those costs on the
                    plaintiff. After all, it was the plaintiff who had acted improperly, not the
                    defendant. The real question, therefore, is not whether the <em>defendant</em> had acted properly and reasonably in instituting the
                    third party proceedings, but whether the <em>plaintiff</em>
                    had acted properly and reasonably in instituting its claim against the defendant
                    instead of the third parties in the first place.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     In the present case, RTC’s claims
                    against the Defendants were not dismissed on the ground that the Defendants were
                    the wrong persons to sue. The real question in this case was whether the
                    Defendants had breached their duties to RTC while they were its directors. Even
                    though it was held that the answer was “No, they had not”, it can
                    hardly be gainsaid that the real and only fight in the Main Action was between
                    RTC and the Defendants. RTC had not acted improperly in instituting the Main
                    Action under such circumstances that the Third Party Claims could be said to
                    have been “inevitable” in order to join the proper parties to the
                    proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Lawrence Ang and William Tan’s third
                    party claim against Margaret Tung and Lin Jian Wei was dismissed on grounds of
                    the construction of the Deed and the RTC S&amp;PA as well as the inefficacy of
                    causes of action founded upon unconscionability, bad faith, conspiracy and
                    unjust enrichment (see <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a> above). Peter
                    Lim’s unsuccessful third party claim against Margaret Tung and Lin Jian
                    Wei was also founded upon conspiracy (see <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a> above). The dismissal of Peter Lim and Dennis Foo’s
                    third party claim against Lawrence Ang and William Tan was based on construction
                    of the Deed of Settlement amongst the four of them (see <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a> above). To my mind, these third party claims were not the
                    inevitable result of RTC’s claims against the Defendants, which in any
                    event were not brought against the wrong parties. It would not be fair or just
                    to visit the costs of these third party claims upon RTC. Therefore, for these
                    third party claims, costs should follow the event.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     With regard to Lawrence Ang and William
                    Tan’s counterclaim against Peter Lim and Dennis Foo, I made no order
                    either dismissing or allowing the counterclaim as the issues of indemnity and
                    contribution from Peter Lim and Dennis Foo did not arise, owing to RTC’s
                    failure to make out its claim in the Main Action. Clearly, there was no good
                    reason why the costs of Peter Lim and Dennis Foo in defending the counterclaim
                    should be borne by RTC especially after I had found against them on the
                    important issue in the counterclaim that Peter Lim was indeed a beneficial
                    shareholder and a <em>de facto</em> director of RTC, which
                    was in fact the position taken by RTC in the Main Action and similarly by
                    Lawrence Ang and William Tan in their counterclaim. The next question is whether
                    Lawrence Ang and William Tan’s costs of instituting the counterclaim
                    should be borne by RTC. While it cannot be gainsaid that the work done by
                    Lawrence Ang and William Tan’s counsel in cross-examining Peter Lim and
                    Dennis Foo on the issue of Peter Lim’s beneficial shareholding and
                    directorship assisted RTC in establishing that Peter Lim was a <em>de facto</em> director of RTC with a substantial shareholding
                    of some 40% in RTC, this was already part of RTC’s case against Peter Lim
                    and this incidental assistance given to RTC would not be a sufficient basis for
                    me to order RTC to bear the costs of Lawrence Ang and William Tan in bringing
                    the counterclaim. Lawrence Ang and William Tan’s counterclaim against
                    Peter Lim and Dennis Foo was not intended to join all the proper parties to the
                    proceedings. The purpose behind the counterclaim was simply to make Peter Lim
                    and Dennis Foo indemnify Lawrence Ang and William Tan for any loss and damage
                    which the latter duo might suffer in respect of all aspects of RTC’s
                    claim, or to make the former two contribute towards the same. While I agreed
                    with Lawrence Ang and William Tan’s contention that Peter Lim was a
                    beneficial shareholder and <em>de facto</em> director, it
                    did not mean that they were therefore entitled to contribution from or indemnity
                    by Peter Lim as of right. In any event, the issues of contribution and indemnity
                    did not arise. I also made no finding on their allegation that Dennis Foo was an
                    agent for Peter Lim. Under these circumstances, it would not be just to make RTC
                    bear the costs of Lawrence Ang and William Tan in bringing the counterclaim. As
                    between the parties involved in the counterclaim, I think they should each bear
                    their own costs since I had made no order on the counterclaim owing to
                    RTC’s failure to make out its claim in the Main Action. Accordingly, I
                    make no order as to costs with respect to the counterclaim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">One set of costs for Margaret Tung and Lin Jian Wei</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The right to be represented by separate
                    counsel does not invariably carry with it an entitlement to recover all the
                    attendant legal costs incurred since that right should be judiciously balanced
                    against the desirability of not unduly penalising the losing party by visiting
                    upon it unreasonably incurred costs: <em>Ng Eng Ghee</em>,
                    at [22]. In particular, the Court of Appeal in <em>Ng Eng
                        Ghee</em> observed that (at [24]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is axiomatic that counsel, as officers of the court, ought not to
                        unnecessarily consume judicial time (or, for that matter, the time of
                        quasi-judicial or administrative tribunals) by repetitively covering the
                        same ground. Each determination of whether to award more than one set of
                        costs will necessarily have to turn on the facts of the case. The court
                        ought to take into consideration all relevant factors, including: (a) the
                        degree of the community of interests existing among the parties; (b) the
                        size of the sum or the importance of the interest that is the subject matter
                        of the dispute; and (c) the degree of overlap in the pre-hearing
                        preparations and conduct of proceedings. <em>In general</em>, the greater the
                        community of interests, the less inclined the court will be to grant
                        separate costs for separate representation. <em>On the other hand</em>, the more
                        important and distinct the interests which are the subject of the dispute,
                        the more likely would an order for more than one set of costs be given. An
                        order for more than one set of costs is also more likely where counsel have
                        taken efforts to avoid the duplication of effort. Plainly, where there is an
                        obvious community of interests between multiple parties on the same side,
                        their counsel should try and agree, as far as possible, on the best approach
                        towards advancing a unified case for their clients. That said, the court
                        will also bear in mind the need to not unduly deter persons from making
                        reasonable efforts to protect or vindicate their rights ... . Finally, for
                        completeness, it should be noted that as this court recently indicated in
                        <em>Wing Joo Loong Ginseng Hong (Singapore) Co Pte Ltd v Qinghai Xinyuan Foreign
                        Trade Co Ltd</em> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 814 (at [201]-[202]), the usual order
                        where different parties with broadly similar interests are represented by
                        different counsel is just one set of costs. [emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Counsel for Lin Jian Wei submitted that it was
                    not unreasonable for Margaret Tung and their client to engage separate sets of
                    counsel given the magnitude of the claim and the consideration that Margaret
                    Tung and Lin Jian Wei did not have the same involvement and knowledge with
                    regard to the various allegations made against them by the Defendants. Moreover,
                    counsel for Margaret Tung and Lin Jian Wei had divided areas of
                    cross-examination between them and also covered different
                witnesses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     However, counsel for Lin Jian Wei conceded
                    that they had prepared a joint written submission to avoid duplication of
                    labour. I note that the Defendants never referred to Margaret Tung and Lin Jian
                    Wei separately in any of their submissions. To my mind, for all intents and
                    purposes, Margaret Tung and Lin Jian Wei represented the same interests in the
                    outcome of the suit and adopted the same strategy. There was no real necessity
                    for them to have been represented by separate sets of counsel given the large
                    degree of community of interests that they had and the unified stand that they
                    had taken on all issues in relation to the Third Party Claims against them.
                    Therefore, it was not reasonable to award more than one set of costs in favour
                    of Margaret Tung and Lin Jian Wei.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Drawing all the threads of the above analysis
                    together, I make the following orders as to costs:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_53-p2_a"></a>(a)     As regards costs in the Main
                        Action:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_53-p2_a-p3_i"></a>(i)       RTC is to bear Peter
                            Lim’s costs, certified for three solicitors, on the standard
                            basis, excluding any costs incurred by him in defending the Main Action
                            on the ground that he was not a beneficial shareholder or director of
                            RTC;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_53-p2_a-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       RTC is to bear Lawrence Ang and William Tan’s costs, certified
                            for three solicitors, on the standard basis; and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_53-p2_a-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       RTC is to bear Dennis
                            Foo’s costs on the standard basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-3">For the avoidance
                            of doubt, any costs incurred by the Defendants in instituting or
                            defending the Third Party Claims are not to be part of the costs of the
                            Main Action. For instance, the costs incurred by Lawrence Ang and
                            William Tan in dealing with the issue that Peter Lim was a beneficial
                            shareholder and director of RTC will not form part of their costs in the
                            Main Action as this issue is relevant only to the counterclaim brought
                            by them against Peter Lim and Dennis Foo for contribution or
                            indemnity.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_53-p2_b"></a>(b)     As regards costs in the Third Party Claims:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_53-p2_b-p3_i"></a>(i)       For the issue of
                            conspiracy, Peter Lim is to bear half, and Lawrence Ang and William Tan
                            are to bear the other half, of Margaret Tung and Lin Jian Wei’s
                            costs;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_53-p2_b-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       For the other issues in Peter Lim’s third party claim
                            against Margaret Tung and Lin Jian Wei, Peter Lim is to bear their
                            costs;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_53-p2_b-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       For the other issues in Lawrence Ang and William Tan’s
                            third party claim against Margaret Tung and Lin Jian Wei, the former two
                            are to bear the latter two’s costs;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_53-p2_b-p3_iv"></a>(iv)       Margaret Tung and Lin Jian Wei are
                            only entitled to one set of costs, assessed on the standard basis for
                            two solicitors;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_53-p2_b-p3_v"></a>(v)       Peter Lim and Dennis Foo are to each bear half
                            of Lawrence Ang and William Tan’s costs in the third party claim
                            against the latter two, on the standard basis for two solicitors;
                            and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_53-p2_b-p3_vi"></a>(vi)       There will be no order as to costs in respect of Lawrence Ang and
                            William Tan’s third party counterclaim against Peter Lim and
                            Dennis Foo.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_53-p2_c"></a>(c)     There shall be no order as to costs for this
