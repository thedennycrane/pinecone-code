<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       As the background facts of
                    these appeals have been set out in considerable detail in
                    the Judgment (at [4]–[31]), we will only highlight the salient
                    facts germane to the present appeals.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The relationship between Mas Swan and
                Roshamima</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Mas Swan and Roshamima are
                    both Malaysians. Mas Swan was 27 years old at the time
                    of his arrest. He was unemployed. Roshamima was
                    24 years old at the time of her arrest. She was working
                    as a recovery officer for a bank in Malaysia.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Mas Swan and Roshamima were
                    due to be engaged on 6 June 2009 and to get married the
                    following day. They were living together in Johor Bahru
                    before their arrest.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Background to the arrests</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       At about 9.56pm on
                    6 May 2009, Mas Swan and Roshamima arrived at Woodlands
                    Checkpoint from Malaysia in a vehicle bearing the
                    registration number JHA 7781
                    (“JHA 7781”). The Judge made no finding
                    on who drove the car. As Mas Swan’s passport was
                    blacklisted, JHA 7781 was searched. Although a manual
                    search did not discover anything incriminating, an X-ray
                    backscatter scan detected three dark spots in the front left
                    door panel of JHA 7781. However, dogs from the Police
                    K-9 unit were not able to detect the presence of any
                    controlled drugs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       A more thorough inspection
                    was then carried out, resulting in the discovery of two
                    green bundles and one black bundle (wrapped in tape of the
                    respective colours) (“the three bundles”)
                    hidden inside the front left door panel of JHA 7781.
                    One of the green bundles was cut open and was found to
                    contain brown granular substance. Mas Swan and Roshamima
                    were accordingly placed under arrest.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Mas Swan’s defence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Mas Swan’s defence was
                    that he knew that the three bundles in JHA 7781
                    contained controlled drugs. He claimed that he was
                    delivering those drugs on behalf of one
                    “Mickey”, who (according to Mas Swan) was a
                    friend of one “Murie”, who, in turn, was a
                    friend of Roshamima. Mas Swan further admitted that he had
                    made a total of four successful drug deliveries for Mickey
                    before his arrest on 6 May 2009. Mas Swan claimed that
                    he believed that the three bundles in JHA 7781
                    contained ecstasy pills and not diamorphine because
                    Roshamima had told him that those bundles contained the
                    former.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Roshamima’s defence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Roshamima’s defence
                    was that she did not know that the three bundles were
                    concealed in the front left door panel of JHA 7781 when
                    she entered Singapore with Mas Swan on 6 May 2009. She
                    claimed that the purpose of her entry into Singapore on
                    6 May 2009 was not to deliver controlled drugs, but to
                    obtain items for the planned engagement and wedding of Mas
                    Swan and herself.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The Judge acquitted Mas
                    Swan of the charge of importing diamorphine (<em>viz</em>, the joint charge mentioned at
                        <a href="#p1_1">[1]</a> above) as he was
                    satisfied that Mas Swan had rebutted the presumption under
                    s 18(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185,
                    2008 Rev Ed) (“the MDA”) that he knew
                    that the three bundles contained diamorphine. He gave the
                    following reasons for his finding:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_a"></a>(a)     Mas Swan’s
                        consistent evidence in both his statements and his oral
                        testimony in court was that he believed that the three
                        bundles that he was delivering for Mickey contained
                        ecstasy pills.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Judge preferred Mas Swan’s
                        evidence to Roshamima’s evidence because his
                        evidence was more consistent than hers and was also
                        self-incriminating.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_c"></a>(c)     It was Roshamima who had
                        inducted Mas Swan into the drug delivery racket. She had
                        been delivering bundles before Mas Swan. Mas Swan was
                        therefore aware that Roshamima had knowledge of the drug
                        deliveries.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_d"></a>(d)     Mas Swan’s role in and
                        knowledge of the drug deliveries was limited. The Judge
                        observed that Mas Swan was “mild-mannered and
                        somewhat timid”, whereas Roshamima had “an
                        assertive and dominant personality”. Mas
                        Swan’s role was simply to accompany Roshamima. The
                        Judge also noted that when Mas Swan and Roshamima were
                        detained at Woodlands Checkpoint, all calls from Murie
                        and Mickey were made to Roshamima’s mobile phone,
                        indicating that Mas Swan’s role and knowledge was
                        limited. On every occasion involving the delivery of
                        bundles, it was usually Roshamima who would inform Mas
                        Swan of the availability of a “<em>segmen</em>”, <em>ie</em>, the availability of ecstasy pills
                        for delivery to Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_e"></a>(e)     Mas Swan had no reason to
                        disbelieve Roshamima’s information that the three
                        bundles contained ecstasy pills. He was to be engaged to
                        marry Roshamima, and would have had no reason to
                        disbelieve what she told him.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_f"></a>(f)     The Prosecution
                        did not challenge the veracity of Mas Swan’s
                        statements or his oral evidence that he believed that
                        the three bundles contained ecstasy pills. In fact, it
                        appeared from the Prosecution’s questions during
                        cross-examination that the Prosecution accepted Mas
                        Swan’s testimony that he believed that the three
                        bundles contained ecstasy. From the manner in which the
                        Prosecution conducted its case, it appeared to the Judge
                        that the Prosecution was not challenging Mas
                        Swan’s belief, but rather, was attempting to
                        persuade the court that the presumption under
                        s 18(2) of the MDA (“the s 18(2)
                        presumption”) was not rebutted because Mas Swan
                        was wilfully blind to the nature of the controlled drugs
                        in the three bundles.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_g"></a>(g)     Mas Swan was not wilfully
                        blind to the nature of the controlled drugs in the three
                        bundles. Although Mas Swan had testified that the nature
                        of the controlled drugs did not matter to him, he had
                        consistently maintained that he honestly believed that
                        the three bundles contained ecstasy pills. The fact that
                        Mas Swan had opportunities to inspect the three bundles
                        was not sufficient to prove wilful
                    blindness.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     In contrast, the Judge
                    found on the evidence that Roshamima knew that the three
                    bundles were hidden in the front left door panel of
                    JHA 7781 and contained controlled drugs. He gave the
                    following reasons for this finding:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_a"></a>(a)     Mas Swan’s
                        evidence, which the Judge believed in preference to
                        Roshamima’s evidence, was that Roshamima and Mas
                        Swan were delivering controlled
                    drugs.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_b"></a>(b)     Roshamima’s evidence on the
                        purpose of her visit to Singapore was fabricated to
                        conceal the fact that the true purpose of the visit was
                        to deliver controlled drugs to
                    Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_c"></a>(c)     Although the Judge considered that it
                        was not strictly necessary to rely on Mas Swan’s
                        and Roshamima’s evidence of prior deliveries, he
                        found that the “highly similar
                        circumstances” of the prior deliveries showed
                        that it was “very likely” that Roshamima
                        was aware that they were delivering controlled drugs on
                        6 May 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     This finding triggered the
                    operation of the s 18(2) presumption that Roshamima
                    knew the nature of the controlled drugs in the three
                    bundles. The Judge then found that Roshamima had failed to
                    discharge this presumption as she had relied on an
                    “all or nothing” defence and had not led any
                    evidence to show that she was not aware of the true nature
                    of the controlled drugs in the three bundles. Her
                    “all or nothing” defence had been pitched at
                    the threshold level that she did not know that the three
                    bundles were concealed in the front left door panel of
                    JHA 7781.</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">You, [Mas Swan], on the
                        6<sup>th</sup> day of May 2009, at

                            phenethylamine (“ecstasy”) which is a
                            Class A controlled drug, and which is specified
                            in the First Schedule to the [MDA]</b>, to
                        wit, by bringing into Singapore in the said

                        packets of substances containing not less than

                        committed an offence under Section 7 read with
                        Section 12, and punishable under Section 33 of
                        the [MDA]. [emphasis in bold in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The Prosecution argues
                    that since Mas Swan believed that he was importing ecstasy
                    into Singapore when he brought the three bundles to
                    Singapore, even though he was attempting to do an act that
                    was factually impossible at that time (in so far as the
                    three bundles contained diamorphine and not ecstasy), this
                    was sufficient to constitute the offence of attempting to
                    import ecstasy under s 7 read with s 12 of the
                    MDA. In response, Mas Swan contends that since the
                    Prosecution did not submit at the trial that the joint
                    charge should be amended in so far as it related to him, the
                    Prosecution should not be allowed a “second bite at
                    the cherry” in this appeal (<em>viz</em>, CCA 7/2011).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> He also
                    argues that during cross-examination, he had replied that he
                    did not know that it was illegal to import controlled drugs
                    such as ecstasy into Singapore.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In CCA 8/2011,
                    Roshamima challenges the Judge’s finding that she knew
                    that controlled drugs were hidden in the front left door
                    panel of JHA 7781. She repeats her version of the

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Dear Madam,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I have tried to approach the CNB [Central Narcotics
                        Bureau] in Singapore at [<em>sic</em>] a number of times – by email
                        and by phone – but never managed to follow through
                        til [<em>sic</em>] the end of the
                        line, mostly due to lack of bravery.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I have also been looking back on [t]he Singapore Law
                        Watch [website] to find back [<em>sic</em>] to the full sentence I read there
                        earlier this summer, the Public Prosecutor v Roshamima
                        Roslan, citizen of Malaysia, who got a death sentence on
                        30th April of this year for trafficking.
                        Unfortunately that sentence is no longer on the site,
                        but replaced by others, and the lawyer’s name is
                        nowhere else to be found.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The matter: I may be considered partly responsible for
                        the Malaysian woman’s predicament. Part of the
                        merchandise which her car was prepared with when passing
                        the Woodlands station was on my behalf, and it was
                        placed there without her knowledge. She may or may not
                        have stated this during interrogations. According to her
                        sentence she did not mention this in court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I wonder if it would be possible to make some kind of
                        statement about this in front of Singaporean legal
                        authorities, or if I will thereby be accused of the same
                        crime and facing [<em>sic</em>]
                        punishment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I have earlier brought in illegal substances both
                        through the Changi Airport and Woodlands, but I have
                        retired from that trade. I now wish to know whether I am
                        on some kind of record at the CNB or if I could freely
                        travel to Singapore again.</p>

                    potential consequences for him or her if he or she were to
                    volunteer a statement to the CNB and on the need for him or
                    her to get impartial advice. Roshamima’s counsel
                    confirmed that as at the date of his affidavit, there was no
                    response from “Noname Hawermann” after his
                    final email to him or her on 6 December

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The issues arising in
                    CCA 7/2011 are as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_a"></a>(a)     Should Mas Swan
                        be convicted of an amended charge of attempted
                        importation of ecstasy?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_b"></a>(b)     If so, what sentence should
                        Mas Swan receive?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     As for CCA 8/2011,
                    the sole issue raised by counsel for Roshamima is whether
                    the Judge erred in fact in finding that Roshamima knew of
                    the presence of the three bundles containing controlled
                    drugs in JHA 7781. At the trial, counsel agreed with
                    the Judge’s reasoning that if Roshamima were found to
                    have knowledge of the controlled drugs hidden in
                    JHA 7781, she would not have rebutted the s 18(2)
                    presumption that she knew the nature of those controlled
                    drugs (<em>ie</em>, that they were
                    diamorphine) since she had adopted an “all or
                    nothing” defence. Nevertheless, at the hearing before
                    us, we questioned the Judge’s omission to consider the
                    possibility that Roshamima might also have believed that the
                    three bundles contained ecstasy – since this was what
                    she had told Mas Swan. Accordingly, a secondary issue arises
                    in this appeal as to whether, in the circumstances of this
                    case, the Judge should have given consideration to this
                    alternative defence (“the Alternative
                    Defence”), namely, that Roshamima likewise believed
                    that the controlled drugs contained in the three bundles
                    were ecstasy and thus did not know that those drugs were
                    actually diamorphine instead. Although Roshamima’s
                    counsel referred to the Alternative Defence in answering the
                    Judge’s questions, he failed to advance it in a more
                    dogged manner. Counsel appeared to have retreated from
                    pursuing this defence after persistent questioning by the
                    Judge regarding the logic of his position in the light of
                    Roshamima’s “all or nothing”
                    defence.</p>

                    Class A controlled drugs (other than diamorphine) in
                    contravention of s 7 read with s 12 of the MDA

                        <em>Khor Soon Lee</em>). The
                    Prosecution initially relied only on <em>Khor

                        (<em>Khor Soon Lee</em> dealt only

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     A brief history of the
                    provision is apposite. Section 12 has been present in
                    the MDA since the enactment in 1973 of one of its
                    predecessor Acts, namely, the Misuse of Drugs Act
                    (Act 5 of 1973) (“the 1973 Act”). The
                    Explanatory Statement accompanying the Bill which introduced
                    the 1973 Act (<em>viz</em>, the Misuse
                    of Drugs Bill (Bill 46 of 1972) (“the 1972
                    Bill”)) and the Parliamentary debates at the second
                    reading of the 1972 Bill do not shed light on the origins of
                    s 12 of the MDA and the intention underlying the
                    provision. A provision similar to s 12 of the MDA may,
                    however, be found in s 33 of the Dangerous Drugs
                    Ordinance (Ordinance 7 of 1951) (“the 1951
                    Ordinance”). Section 33 of the 1951 Ordinance
                    was later replaced by s 35 of the Dangerous Drugs Act
                    (Cap 151, 1970 Rev Ed) (“the DDA”).
                    In this regard, it should be noted that the 1973 Act was a
                    consolidation of the DDA and the Drugs (Prevention of
                    Misuse) Act (Cap 154, 1970 Rev Ed) (see <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates</em>,
                        <em>Official Report</em>
                    (16 February 1973) vol 32 at col 414

                    Chin, Acting Minister for Health and Home Affairs).
                    Section 35 of the DDA, which is identical to s 12
                    of the MDA apart from some minor drafting changes, reads as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-Heading1">
<b>Abetments
                            and attempts punishable as

</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>35</b>.    Any person who abets the commission of or who
                            attempts to commit or does any act preparatory to or

                            liable to the punishment provided for such
                            offence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Although the proceedings
                    at the second and third readings of the Bill which
                    introduced the 1951 Ordinance (<em>ie</em>, the Dangerous Drugs Bill 1950
                    (“the 1950 Bill”) (published in GN
                    No S505/1950)) are not useful in determining the
                    origins of s 33 of that Ordinance and, in turn, the
                    origins of s 35 of the DDA, the Statement of Objects
                    and Reasons accompanying the 1950 Bill is helpful. It
                    states, <em>inter alia</em>, that the
                    1950 Bill would not alter the existing law (<em>ie</em>, the Deleterious Drugs Ordinance
                    (Ordinance 7 of 1927) (“the DDO”) and the
                    Opium and Chandu Proclamation (BMA Proclamation No 43,
                    1948) (“the 1948 Proclamation”)), and that the
                    clauses that were new were “mainly concerned with
                    administrative detail”. Significantly, the clause
                    which introduced s 33 of the 1951 Ordinance (<em>ie</em>, the predecessor of s 35 of
                    the DDA, which is, in turn, the predecessor of s 12 of
                    the MDA) was a <em>new provision</em>
                    (see the Comparative Table attached to the Statement of
                    Objects and Reasons accompanying the 1950
                Bill).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Although the 1950 Bill
                    describes s 33 of the 1951 Ordinance as a new
                    provision, an equivalent provision can be found in the 1948
                    Proclamation as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-Heading1">

                            under this Proclamation or abets the commission of

                            provided for such offence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Section 13 of the DDO also made it an

                    made of attempts to import such drugs. This particular
                    provision was introduced in 1927, apparently to enact the
                    provisions of the International Opium Convention 1925 in so
                    far as they were applicable to the law in the Straits

                        <em>Chua Kian Kok v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [1999] 1 SLR(R) 826
                        (“<em>Chua Kian
                    Kok</em>”) held that the <em>mens </em><em>rea</em> for
                    the general offence of attempt under the then equivalent of
                    s 511 of the Penal Code (<em>viz</em>, s 511 of the Penal Code
                    (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed)) was the intention to
                    commit the primary offence (see <em>Chua Kian
                        Kok</em> at [27]–[28]). The High Court refused to follow
                    English Court of Appeal decisions which held that the
                        <em>mens </em><em>rea</em> for the general offence of attempt was
                    the same as the <em>mens </em><em>rea</em> for the primary offence. The
                    High Court gave two reasons for its decision (see <em>Chua Kian Kok</em> at [27]–[28]). First, it took the
                    view that an attempted offence resulted in a lower degree of
                    public harm than a completed offence and, thus, the mental
                    element for the attempted offence should be more stringent
                    (see <em>Chua Kian Kok</em> at
                        [30]–[31]). Second, the High Court was not
                    convinced by the reasoning in the English Court of Appeal
                    decisions because the corresponding English provision
                        (<em>viz</em>, s 1(1) of the
                    Criminal Attempts Act 1981 (c 47) (UK) (“the UK
                    Criminal Attempts Act 1981”)) seemed to provide that
                    the mental element for the general offence of attempt was,
                    instead, an intent to commit the primary offence (see
                        <em>Chua Kian Kok</em> at [32]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     We agree that the
                        <em>mens </em><em>rea</em> for the general offence of attempt under
                    s 511 of the Penal Code is the intention to commit the
                    primary offence. As was held in <em>Chua Kian
                        Kok</em>, it would not be appropriate to hold that
                    the <em>mens </em><em>rea</em> of the primary offence is the required
                    mental element. A more stringent requirement should be
                    imposed for inchoate offences. It should be noted that the
                    Indian courts also take the view that the mental element for
                    the general offence of attempt is the intention to commit
                    the primary offence (see <em>Ratanlal &amp;
                        Dhirajlal’s </em><em>The
                        Indian Penal Code</em> (LexisNexis Butterworths
                    Wadhwa Nagpur, 33rd Ed, 2010) at pp 1076 and
                    1079).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-6" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(II)   The actus reus</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The High Court in
                        <em>Chua Kian Kok</em> took the
                    view that the <em>actus </em><em>reus</em> for the general offence of
                    attempt was that the accused must have “embarked on
                    the crime proper” (see <em>Chua Kian
                        Kok</em> at [36]). The High Court preferred this rather
                    vague formulation because it did not think it was desirable
                    to provide a precise definition. The court felt that the
                    precise point at which an act became an attempt was
                    ultimately a question of fact (see <em>Chua
                        Kian Kok</em> at [36]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The authors of a local
                    textbook on criminal law have explained that a number of
                    other approaches may be taken (see Stanley Yeo, Neil Morgan
                    &amp; Chan Wing Cheong, <em>Criminal Law in
                        Malaysia and Singapore</em> (LexisNexis,
                    2nd Ed, 2012) (“<em>Yeo</em>”) at
                    paras 36.14–36.24). The authors explain that it
                    is clear that merely preparatory acts should not be
                    sufficient (see <em>Yeo</em> at
                    para 36.16). Beyond merely preparatory acts, various
                    tests are possible:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_a"></a>(a)     One possibility
                        is that only “acts immediately connected”
                        with the commission of the primary offence constitute
                        attempts (see <em>Yeo</em> at
                        para 36.17 citing <em>R v
                            Eagleton</em> (1855) Dears 376;
                        169 ER 766).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_b"></a>(b)     Another possibility is the
                        “last act test”. This test provides that
                        the accused must have done all that he believes to be
                        necessary for the commission of the primary offence (see
                            <em>Yeo</em> at
                        para 36.19).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_c"></a>(c)     Yet another test is that the
                        accused’s conduct must have been such as to
                        “clearly and unequivocally indicate in itself the
                        intention to commit the offence” (see <em>Yeo</em> at
                    para 36.20).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_d"></a>(d)     A fourth possibility is the
                        “substantial step” test, which requires
                        the accused to have “progressed a substantial way
                        towards the completion of the offence” (see
                            <em>Yeo</em> at
                        para 36.21). Interestingly, the authors point out
                        that this test is embodied in the attempt provisions in
                        two local statutes (see <em>Yeo</em> at para 36.21, referring to
                        s 54(1) of the Civil Defence Act (Cap 42,
                        2001 Rev Ed) and s 38(1) of the Police Force
                        Act (Cap 235, 2006 Rev Ed)). The authors
                        prefer this fourth possibility (see <em>Yeo</em> at
                para 36.24).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     For the purposes of
                    CCA 7/2011, it is not necessary for us to reach a
                    conclusive view on the appropriate test to be adopted in the
                    Singapore context. This is because on any view, Mas Swan had
                    done everything he possibly could to commit the primary
                    offence of importing ecstasy. He had actually brought
                    controlled drugs physically into Singapore. The only reason
                    why he could not complete committing the aforesaid primary
                    offence was that he was factually mistaken as to the nature
                    of the controlled drugs in the three bundles – he
                    thought those controlled drugs were ecstasy when they were
                    actually diamorphine.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(D)   Is it appropriate to apply the elements
                of the general offence of attempt to s 12 of the
                MDA?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     In our view, the elements
                    of the general offence of attempt under s 511 of the
                    Penal Code should be adopted in the context of s 12 of
                    the MDA for two reasons. First, there is nothing in the
                    words of s 12 of the MDA which suggests that a
                    different approach should be taken. Both provisions do not
                    define what is meant by “attempts”. Second,
                    there is nothing in the origins of s 12 of the MDA
                    which suggests that the provision should be interpreted in a
                    different manner from s 511 of the Penal
                Code.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(E)   Does s 12 of the MDA contemplate
                impossible attempts?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     It is clear that some
                    types of impossible attempts are punishable under s 511
                    of the Penal Code. The High Court in <em>Chua
                        Kian Kok</em> explained that there are four kinds
                    of impossibility <em>vis-à-vis</em>
                    impossible attempts (see <em>Chua Kian
                        Kok</em> at [43]–[44]): (a) physical impossibility;
                    (b) impossibility by reason of the non-criminality of
                    the attempted primary “offence”;
                    (c) legal impossibility (<em>eg</em>, a person taking his own umbrella with an
                    intent to steal it); and (d) impossibility by reason of
                    the accused’s ineptitude (<em>eg</em>, attempting to break into a safe with a
                    tool that is not suitable for breaking into the
                    safe).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Only the first category
                    (physical impossibility) is relevant in the present appeal.
                    Mas Swan intended to import controlled drugs of a kind
                    different from the kind he was actually carrying. The
                    Prosecution has suggested that the present appeal also
                    involves legal impossibility because Mas Swan was mistaken
                    as to the legal status of the object that he
                        possessed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> We disagree.
                    Mas Swan was not mistaken as to the <em>legal</em> status of the object that he
                    possessed. The object that he intended to possess and the
                    object that he actually possessed were both controlled
                    drugs. He was, instead, mistaken as to the physical quality
                    of the object.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     According to the High
                    Court, attempting the physically impossible is an offence
                    under s 511 of the Penal Code (see <em>Chua Kian Kok</em> at [43]). This is because it
                    is clear from Illustration (<em>b</em>) to s 511 of the Penal Code (see
                        <a href="#p1_30">[30]</a> above) that the
                    provision is intended to cover physically impossible
                    attempts (see <em>Chua Kian Kok</em> at
                        [43]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     In our view, a similar
                    view should be taken <em>vis-à-vis</em>
                    s 12 of the MDA. Factually impossible attempts to
                    commit offences were crimes under English law until the
                    decision of the House of Lords in <em>Haughton v Smith</em> [1975] AC 476
                        (“<em>Haughton</em>”)
                    (see the United Kingdom Law Commission, <em>Criminal Law: Attempt and Impossibility in relation to
                        Attempt, Conspiracy and Incitement</em> (Law Com
                    No 102, 1980) (“the <em>1980
                        Report</em>”) at para 2.58). In
                        <em>Haughton</em>, the House of
                    Lords held (at 497, 500, 502 and 506) that a person who
                    dishonestly handled goods believing them to be stolen (but
                    which were not stolen because they had been returned to
                    lawful custody due to police interception) was not guilty of
                    attempting to handle stolen goods. <em>Haughton</em> has been criticised (see, for
                    example, H L A Hart, “The House of
                    Lords on Attempting the Impossible” (1981) OJLS 149
                        (“<em>Hart</em>”),
                    especially at pp 165–166, and the <em>1980 Report</em> at
                    paras 2.95–2.97). From the perspective of the
                    rationale for punishing attempts (<em>viz</em>, deterrence and retribution), a person
                    who sets out to commit an offence and does everything
                    possible to commit the offence, but who is (perhaps
                    fortuitously) prevented from committing the offence due to
                    some external circumstance is as culpable as a person who is
                    interrupted from completing the offence (see <em>Hart</em> at p 165 and the <em>1980 Report</em> at para 2.96).
                        <em>Haughton</em> has since been
                    legislatively overruled (see s 1(2) of the UK Criminal
                    Attempts Act 1981). The current position in England is that
                    factually impossible attempts are offences (see <em>Regina v Shivpuri</em> [1987]
                    1 AC 1). In our view, when Parliament enacted
                    s 12 of the MDA, it must be presumed, in the absence of
                    contrary indication, to have intended to follow the existing
                    common law position on factually impossible attempts. There
                    is nothing in the text or the origins of s 12 of the
                    MDA which suggests that a different approach should be taken
                    in interpreting s 12 (see <a href="#p1_25">[25]</a>–<a href="#p1_29">[29]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     We also note that
                        <em>Chua Kian Kok</em> was applied
                    by the court of three judges in <em>Law
                        Society of Singapore v Bay Puay </em><em>Joo </em><em>Lilian</em> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 316
                        (“<em>Bay Puay
                        </em><em>Joo </em><em>Lilian</em>”). <em>Bay Puay </em><em>Joo
                        </em><em>Lilian</em> was part
                    of a line of disciplinary cases involving the entrapment of
                    solicitors involved in touting for conveyancing work.
                    Counsel for the respondent solicitor in that case sought to
                    argue that due cause could not be shown under
                        s 83(2)(<em>e</em>) of the
                    Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, 2001 Rev Ed) for
                    attempting to procure employment if the employment attempted
                    to be procured was fictitious (see <em>Bay
                        Puay </em><em>Joo
                        </em><em>Lilian</em> at
                        [43]). The court
                    of three judges rejected this argument by referring to
                    s 511 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev
                    Ed) and <em>Chua Kian Kok</em> (see
                        <em>Bay Puay </em><em>Joo </em><em>Lilian</em> at <a href="#p1_44">[44]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Application to the facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Mas Swan’s own
                    evidence is that he thought he and Roshamima were
                    transporting ecstasy because Roshamima had told him
                        so.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span>
                    The Judge accepted Mas Swan’s testimony that he
                    believed Roshamima’s information that the three
                    bundles contained ecstasy pills (see the Judgment at
                    sub-para (a) of [87]). Hence, the <em>mens </em><em>rea</em> for
                    the offence of attempt under s 12 of the MDA is made
                    out: Mas Swan intended to commit the primary offence of
                    importing ecstasy.</p>

                    made out on any view of the test for such <em>actus </em><em>reus</em>.
                    Mas Swan had done everything possible to complete the
                    offence of importing ecstasy; the only circumstance that
                    prevented him from actually importing ecstasy was that the
                    three bundles did not in fact contain ecstasy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     We accordingly hold that
                    on these facts, Mas Swan has committed the offence of
                    attempting to import ecstasy into Singapore under s 7
                    read with s 12 of the MDA and convict him of the
                    amended charge proposed by the Prosecution (see <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a> above).</p>

                    be sentenced to 18 years’ imprisonment and should
                    receive eight strokes of the cane.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> This was the

                    importation of ecstasy where the substance actually imported
                    was not ecstasy, the Prosecution submitted that it was

                    of 1.3kg of ecstasy would typically contain between 3,800

                    that those of the above precedents which involve the
                    importation of Yaba are relevant to the present case for two
                    reasons, even though the amended charge against Mas Swan (as

                    concerns the attempted importation of ecstasy. First, the
                    United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime treats ecstasy and
                    Yaba as belonging to the category of

                    Second, according to the Prosecution, the HSA has noted that
                    whereas ecstasy in the past meant tablets containing MDMA,

                    or mix MDMA [a Class A controlled drug] with other

                    The Prosecution points out that the HSA has noted that the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Mas Swan’s

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Counsel for Mas Swan has
                    also referred to <em>Public Prosecutor v

                        another</em> [2011] 3 SLR 719, where the
                    accused, who was acquitted of conspiring to traffic in
                    diamorphine but convicted of attempting to traffic in a
                    Class C controlled drug (the charge was framed in this
                    manner because the accused had intended to traffic in a
                    “not serious drug”, which, in the High Court
                    judge’s view, meant that she must have intended to
                    traffic in a Class C controlled drug at the very
                    least), was sentenced to nine years’
                        imprisonment.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span>
                    The accused received this sentence even though she knew that
                    trafficking in the type of controlled drugs she was dealing
                    with carried severe penalties. She had also been involved in
                    the packing of the controlled drugs and had received money
                    from her co-accused.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span>
                    In contrast, as counsel for Mas Swan has pointed out, Mas
                    Swan did not handle or see the controlled drugs in the three
                    bundles and thought that those drugs were
                        ecstasy.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     For these reasons, counsel
                    for Mas Swan has also urged this court to consider the lower

                    Swan should be sentenced to the minimum mandatory sentence
                    of five years’ imprisonment and five strokes of the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Section 12 of the MDA
                    provides that the punishment for attempts to commit offences
                    under the MDA is the punishment provided for the primary
                    offence in question. The Second Schedule to the MDA
                    tabulates the punishment for importation of controlled
                    drugs. If the hypothetical ecstasy tablets in the present
                    case are considered to contain MDMA, then the sentencing
                    range is as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_55-p2_a"></a>(a)     a <em>minimum</em> of five years’

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     In our view, these
                    considerations are applicable to the present case in
                    determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed on Mas
                    Swan. The quantity of controlled drugs involved in the
                    importation is a material consideration in determining the
                    potential harm to society. In the present case, the actual
                    amount of ecstasy that Mas Swan was found to have <em>attempted</em> to import into Singapore
                    cannot be determined at all because what was actually
                    imported was diamorphine. It is therefore necessary for the
                    court to formulate an acceptable means of calculating the
                    notional quantity of ecstasy attempted to be imported for
                    the purpose of sentencing him. The quantity has to be
                    notional because, as we have just pointed out, the actual
                    quantity cannot be determined. This situation is not common,
                    but it is not without precedent in other jurisdictions. For
                    instance, in <em>Regina v Tomasz
                        </em><em>Szmyt</em> [2010]
                    1 Cr App R (S) 69 (“<em>Tomasz </em><em>Szmyt</em>”), the appellant was found to
                    have in his possession, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, what he thought were 1,998 ecstasy
                    tablets, but which were in fact harmless tablets. The
                    English Court of Appeal held that the proper way to assess
                    the sentence for the offence was to consider what would have
                    been an appropriate sentence if that quantity of ecstasy had
                    been imported, and then to scale it down to account for the
                    fact that although the appellant was guilty of attempting to
                    import ecstasy, what was imported was actually a harmless
                    substance (see <em>Tomasz
                        </em><em>Szmyt</em> at
                        [12]).
                    Similarly, in <em>R v Magdalen Genevieve
                        </em><em>Wolin</em> [2006]
                    1 Cr App R (S) 133 (“<em>R v
                        Wolin</em>”), the appellant thought she was
                    importing cocaine, but what was actually imported was
                    lignocaine, which was <em>not</em> a
                    prohibited drug under the relevant statute. She was
                    convicted of being knowingly concerned in the attempted
                    importation of a prohibited drug of a particular class. The
                    court reduced the sentence because it felt that a further
                    discount was warranted to account for: (a) the fact
                    that the appellant was charged with an attempt and not a
                    completed offence; and (b) the fact that the substance
                    which the appellant carried was not a prohibited substance
                    (see <em>R v Wolin</em> at [6]–[7]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(4)   Our decision on sentencing</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     The Prosecution has
                    suggested in its oral submissions before this court that the
                    proper sentence to impose on Mas Swan would be a term of
                    imprisonment of between ten and 15 years (see <a href="#p1_51">[51]</a> above). However, the
                    majority of the Prosecution’s sentencing precedents on
                    the importation of ecstasy show that the range of
                    imprisonment for this offence is between seven and ten
                    years’ imprisonment instead. If the
                    Prosecution’s sentencing precedents on the importation
                    of Yaba are also considered material, the sentencing range
                    will be between five and 13 years’ imprisonment. It
                    should be noted, however, that apart from <em>Khor Soon Lee</em>, the sentencing precedents
                    relied on by the Prosecution are District Court cases.
                    Further, it is not possible to ascertain what factors were
                    taken into account in these District Court cases as they are
                    unreported and the Prosecution has not provided their
                    factual background. These decisions are also difficult to
                    reconcile. For example, the sentence in <em>Chew Wee Kiat</em> was ten years’
                    imprisonment and eight strokes of the cane for importing
                    1,399 ecstasy tablets. In contrast, the sentence in
                        <em>Teo Leong </em><em>Huat</em> for importing 15,070 ecstasy
                    tablets was only seven years’ imprisonment and ten
                    strokes of the cane. The apparent disparity is not
                    justifiable even if we take into account the fact that the
                    accused in <em>Chew Wee Kiat</em>
                    claimed trial. It may well be that the facts in <em>Chew Wee Kiat</em> were particularly
                    aggravated, but we do not know.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     In our view, the
                    sentencing range in cases of importation of either ecstasy
                    or Yaba should not be used to determine the sentencing range
                    in the present case because although what was attempted to
                    be imported here was ecstasy, what was in fact imported was
                    diamorphine, a much more serious Class A controlled
                    drug, the importation and attempted importation of which are
                    both punishable by a death sentence if the quantity of
                    diamorphine involved exceeds 15g. A closer case is <em>Khor Soon Lee</em>, where the capital
                    charge of importing not less than 27.86g of diamorphine was
                    reduced to attempted importation of Class A controlled
                    drugs other than diamorphine, and where this court sentenced
                    the offender to 18 years’ imprisonment and eight
                    strokes of the cane. Further, unlike the English cases of
                        <em>Tomasz </em><em>Szmyt</em> and <em>R v
                        Wolin</em>, no discount should be given in the
                    present case on the basis that the offence was one of
                    attempting to import ecstasy rather than the substantive
                    offence of actually importing ecstasy. The reason is that in
                    the two aforesaid English cases, non-prohibited substances
                    were ultimately imported, whereas in the present case, a
                    much more serious Class A controlled drug (<em>viz</em>, diamorphine) was actually
                    imported. For these reasons, we think that an appropriate
                    sentence for Mas Swan would be 15 years’ imprisonment
                    and eight strokes of the cane, having regard to the fact
                    that he was complicit in transporting diamorphine to
                    Singapore.</p>

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_60-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether the
                        Judge erred in rejecting Roshamima’s evidence that

                        JHA 7781 (“the first issue”);
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_60-p2_b"></a>(b)     whether the Judge erred in finding

                        presumption that she knew the nature of the controlled
                        drugs in the three bundles (“the second
                        issue”).</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     The first issue may be
                    disposed of briefly. Counsel for Roshamima has not persuaded
                    us that the Judge’s finding was wrong. We place no
                    credibility whatever on the Anonymous Email and the
                    subsequent correspondence with “Noname
                    Hawermann” as a basis for casting any reasonable
                    doubt on the finding of the Judge. Given that “Noname
                    Hawermann” is not prepared to identify himself or
                    herself even though he or she is outside the jurisdiction of
                    the law enforcement agencies in Singapore, no court would be
                    justified in giving any credence to his or her
                    assertions.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     The second issue raises an
                    interesting point on the role of logic in criminal
                    law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   The Judge’s approach</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     The Judge essentially
                    adopted an approach based on pure logic to determine whether
                    Roshamima had rebutted the s 18(2) presumption that she
                    knew the nature of the controlled drugs in the three
                    bundles. He held that she had failed to rebut this
                    presumption because she had not adduced any evidence to show
                    that she did not know and had no reason to know the nature
                    of the controlled drugs in the three bundles. The
                    Judge’s reasons are set out in the following
                    paragraphs of the Judgment:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">90    Roshamima’s defence, as
                            mentioned above, was that she had <em>no knowledge whatsoever</em> that the
                            bundles were concealed or existed in the door panel.
                            If, however, the Prosecution was able to persuade me
                            that Roshamima was aware of the concealed bundles
                            and knew that they contained controlled drugs, the
                            statutory presumption under s 18(2) of the MDA
                            would, accordingly, become operative and it would
                            then be for Roshamima to rebut it, failing which the
                            Charge against her [<em>ie</em>, the joint charge mentioned at [1]
                            above] would be made out.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">91    In this connection, it is
                            pertinent to highlight that Roshamima did not lead
                            any positive evidence to prove that she was not
                            aware of the true nature of the controlled drugs.
                            This must be so since she chose to defend the Charge
                            at the threshold level that she had no knowledge of
                            the existence of the bundles that were concealed in
                            the door panel of JHA 7781 and was accordingly
                            not in <em>legal
                                possession</em> of the controlled drugs.
                            It therefore follows that if the Prosecution was
                            able to prove that Roshamima was aware that bundles
                            containing controlled drugs were concealed in the
                            car door panel, the presumption under s 18(2)
                            of the MDA would operate against her, and because
                            she has not adduced any evidence to rebut that
                            presumption, the Charge against her would, without
                            more, indubitably be made out. This logical sequence
                            and its inevitable outcome were eventually conceded
                            by Mr Muzammil [counsel for Roshamima] during
                            oral submissions, though I would like to add that I
                            am relying on what I understand to be the legal
                            position, and not on his concession, in making such
                            a finding.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">130    As Roshamima did not adduce
                            any evidence that she believed that the bundles
                            contained controlled drugs other than diamorphine,
                            the presumption under s 18(2) of the MDA
                            remains unrebutted.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Was the Judge’s
                    reasoning in the above passages correct in law? It appears
                    to be implicit in the Judge’s reasoning that the only
                    way Roshamima could have rebutted the s 18(2)
                    presumption was for <em>her</em> to
                    adduce credible evidence to support her claim that she did
                    not know and had no reason to know that the controlled drugs
                    in the three bundles were diamorphine.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     In our view, the
                    Judge’s approach, while logically defensible, is not
                    necessarily legally correct in the context of a criminal
                    trial on the evidence before him. With respect, the
                    Judge’s approach was overly narrow in the context of a
                    criminal trial. Before we elaborate on this point, it should
                    be noted that Roshamima’s counsel did try, albeit in a
                    rather clumsy and confusing manner, to advance the
                    Alternative Defence (as set out at <a href="#p1_23">[23]</a> above) for his client, but his attempt
                    failed to make any headway with the Judge, and he eventually
                    conceded the Judge’s inexorable conclusion. This in
                    turn led the Judge to comment that Roshamima’s counsel
                    had accepted “[t]his logical sequence and its
                    inevitable outcome” that if Roshamima’s primary
                    defence failed, the s 18(2) presumption against her
                        (<em>ie</em>, the presumption that
                    she knew the nature of the controlled drugs in the three
                    bundles) would stand unrebutted (see [91] of the Judgment,
                    which is reproduced at <a href="#p1_63">[63]</a> above).</p>

                    during defence counsel’s closing submissions at the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     The above exchanges show
                    that even though Roshamima’s counsel eventually agreed
                    with the Judge that Roshamima did not have a fallback
                    defence (in the form of the Alternative Defence), he also
                    contended that if the Judge were to find that Mas Swan
                    believed what he alleged Roshamima had told him, then
                        “<em>it must have been that she
                        had knowledge that the contents of the [three] bundle[s]
                        were Ecstasy and not diamorphine</em>”
                    [emphasis added]. However, the Judge was of the view that if
                    he were to reject Roshamima’s primary defence that she
                    did not know of the presence of the three bundles in
                    JHA 7781, she would not, <em>ipso
                        facto</em>, be able to rebut the s 18(2)
                    presumption. The Judge was not disposed to consider
                    counsel’s attempt to argue that if he (the Judge)
                    believed Mas Swan’s defence, then he should also
                    consider whether Roshamima had likewise believed that the
                    three bundles contained ecstasy pills. In the Judge’s
                    view, such belief would be inconsistent with
                    Roshamima’s primary defence that she had no knowledge
                    of the presence of the three bundles in
                    JHA 7781.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Inconsistent defences in a criminal
                trial</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     In our view, the Judge, in
                    accepting Mas Swan’s defence, which was based on what
                    Roshamima had told Mas Swan (<em>viz</em>, that the three bundles contained
                    ecstasy), and in holding that Roshamima had failed to
                    discharge the burden of proving the contrary of the
                    s 18(2) presumption (<em>viz</em>,
                    the presumption that she knew the nature of the controlled
                    drugs in the three bundles) because she had led no evidence
                    to rebut the presumption, erred in law in not addressing the
                    possibility that Roshamima might also have believed that the
                    three bundles contained ecstasy since this was what she had
                    told Mas Swan. The fact that Roshamima adopted an
                    “all or nothing” defence should not have
                    deprived her of any other available defence that could
                    reasonably be made out on the evidence. It was not
                    unreasonable of Roshamima not to rely on the Alternative
                    Defence at the trial because relying on that defence would
                    inevitably have impacted on the cogency or strength of her
                    primary defence, which, if accepted by the Judge, would have
                    resulted in her being acquitted of the capital charge faced
                    by her (<em>viz</em>, the joint charge
                    set out at <a href="#p1_1">[1]</a> above).
                    The Judge’s approach is, with respect, inconsistent
                    with the established practice of criminal courts in such
                    situations. In a jury trial, the established practice in
                    such situations is that the trial judge must put to the jury
                    all defences that can reasonably be made out on the
                    evidence, and the trial judge should not withhold or
                    withdraw any alternative defences that may reasonably be
                    made out on the evidence. It is for the jury to decide
                    whether any alternative defence is credible, and not for the
                    trial judge to make this decision by withholding or
                    withdrawing an alternative defence from the jury. In a bench
                    trial, the same practice should apply, and this means that
                    the trial judge should not shut his mind to any alternative
                    defence that is reasonably available on the evidence even
                    though it may be inconsistent with the accused’s
                    primary defence. In the present case, the Judge should have
                    asked himself whether it was possible that Roshamima might
                    have believed what she had told Mas Swan, <em>viz</em>, that the three bundles contained
                    ecstasy. In not asking this question, there is a disconnect
                    between his believing Mas Swan’s defence and his
                    failure to give any consideration to Roshamima’s
                    alternative defence (<em>viz</em>, the
                    Alternative Defence). The disconnect is that since the Judge
                    made no finding that Roshamima had lied to Mas Swan when she
                    said that the three bundles contained ecstasy (which
                    information formed the basis of Mas Swan’s defence),
                    then it was possible that Roshamima might genuinely have
                    believed that the three bundles contained ecstasy, and that
                    was why she had told Mas Swan so.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(A)   The relevant case law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     We shall now examine the
                    case law on inconsistent defences in criminal trials. In
                        <em>Mancini v Director of Public
                        Prosecutions</em> [1942] 1 AC 1
                        (“<em>Mancini</em>”),
                    the appellant was found guilty by a jury of a charge of
                    murder. The appellant’s defence at the trial was that
                    he had acted in self-defence. On appeal, it was contended
                    that the trial judge erred in failing to adequately direct
                    the jury on what would amount in law to provocation. If
                    provocation had been found, the appellant would have been
                    liable for only the less serious offence of manslaughter.
                    The House of Lords agreed that the trial judge had a duty to
                    direct the jury to consider an alternative case even if
                    counsel did not rely on such an alternative (see <em>Mancini</em> at 7–8):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Although the appellant’s case at the trial was
                        in substance that he had been compelled to use his
                        weapon in necessary self-defence – a defence
                        which, if it had been accepted by the jury, would have
                        resulted in his complete acquittal – it was
                        undoubtedly the duty of the judge, in summing up to the
                        jury, to deal adequately with any other view of the
                        facts which might reasonably arise out of the evidence
                        given, and which would reduce the crime from murder to
                        manslaughter. <em>The fact that a
                            defending counsel does not stress an alternative
                            case before the jury (which he may well feel it
                            difficult to do without prejudicing the main
                            defence) does not relieve the judge from the duty of
                            directing the jury to consider the alternative, if
                            there is material before the jury which would
                            justify a direction that they should consider
                            it</em>. Thus, in <em>Rex v.
                            Hopper</em> [[1915] 2 KB 431], at a
                        trial for murder the prisoner’s counsel relied
                        substantially on the defence that the killing was
                        accidental, but Lord Reading C.J., in
                        delivering the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal,
                        said: “We do not assent to the suggestion that as
                        the defence throughout the trial was accident, the judge
                        was justified in not putting the question as to
                        manslaughter. Whatever the line of defence adopted by
                        counsel at the trial of a prisoner, we are of opinion
                        that it is for the judge to put such questions as appear
                        to him properly to arise upon the evidence, even
                        although counsel may not have raised some question
                        himself. In this case it may be that the difficulty of
                        presenting the alternative defences of accident and
                        manslaughter may have actuated counsel in saying very
                        little about manslaughter, but if we come to the
                        conclusion, as we do, that there was some evidence
                        – we say no more than that – upon which a
                        question ought to have been left to the jury as to the
                        crime being manslaughter only, we think that this
                        verdict of murder cannot stand.” [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">On the facts, the House of Lords held that there
                    was insufficient material on which to raise the question of
                    provocation and thus rejected the appellant’s
                    contention that the trial judge had failed to direct the
                    jury adequately on this defence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     A similar approach was
                    approved by Barwick CJ in <em>Pemble v
                        The Queen</em> (1971) 124 CLR 107 at
                    117–118:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… There is no doubt that the course taken by
                        counsel for the appellant at the trial contributed
                        substantially to the form of the summing up. If the
                        trial had been of a civil cause, it might properly be
                        said that the trial judge had put to the jury the issues
                        which had arisen between the parties. But this was not a
                        civil trial. The decision of the House of Lords in
                            <em>Mancini v. Director of Public
                            Prosecutions</em> following
                        Lord Reading’s judgment in <em>R. v. Hopper</em> and its influence in the
                        administration of the criminal law must ever be borne in
                        mind (see <em>Kwaku </em><em>Mensah v. The King</em>). <em>Whatever course counsel may see fit to
                            take, no doubt bona fide but for tactical reasons in
                            what he considers the best interest of his client,
                            the trial judge must be astute to secure for the
                            accused a fair trial according to law.</em>
                        This involves, in my opinion, an adequate direction both
                        as to the law and the possible use of the relevant facts
                        upon any matter upon which the jury could in the
                        circumstances of the case upon the material before them
                        find or base a verdict in whole or in part.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In <em>Mancini v. Director of Public
                            Prosecutions</em> provocation was not relied
                        upon by defending counsel. In <em>Kwaku
                            </em><em>Mensah v. The
                            King</em>, provocation was not raised at the
                        trial nor in the reasons in the appellant’s case
                        for the consideration of the Privy Council. But, there
                        being material before the jury on which they could
                        properly have found provocation so as to reduce the
                        crime from murder to manslaughter, their Lordships
                        considered the absence of any direction as to
                        provocation when that matter was raised by counsel in
                        argument before them for the first time; and for lack of
                        appropriate direction set aside a conviction for
                        murder.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Here, counsel for the defence did
                            not merely not rely on the matters now sought to be
                            raised; he abandoned them and expressly confined the
                            defence to the matters he did raise. However, in my
                            opinion, this course did not relieve the trial judge
                            of the duty to put to the jury with adequate
                            assistance any matters on which the jury, upon the
                            evidence, could find for the accused.</em>

                    there were witnesses who testified that provocative words
                    had been spoken to the appellant, provocation was not raised
                    on behalf of the Defence and counsel on both sides accepted
                    that the jury’s only possible verdicts were either not
                    guilty of murder or guilty of murder. Accordingly, the trial
                    judge did not leave the issue of provocation to the jury as
                    an issue for their consideration under s 3 of the
                    Homicide Act 1957 (c 11) (UK). The appellant was
                    subsequently convicted of murder.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     On appeal against
                    conviction, a substantial ground of appeal was whether the
                    conviction should be set aside on the basis that the trial
                    judge should have left the issue of provocation to the jury
                    to consider. The English Court of Appeal held (<em>per</em> Lord Taylor of
                    Gosforth CJ) at 974–975:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We turn to the third and more substantial ground of
                        appeal. Mr. Gray submits that the judge ought to
                        have left provocation to the jury as an issue for their
                        consideration. As already noted, provocation was not
                        raised on behalf of the defence. Indeed, it would have
                        been inconsistent with the appellant’s contention
                        that he was not the assailant. Notwithstanding this,
                        Mr. Gray submits that a clear line of authority
                        required the judge to leave provocation to the jury on
                        the evidence in this case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The line of authority goes back to <em>Rex v. Hopper</em> [1915] 2 K.B. 431,
                            <em>Mancini v. Director of Public
                            Prosecutions</em> [1942] A.C. 1 and

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In <em>Reg. v.

                        1 W.L.R. 1372 , this court approved a
                        passage from the opinion of the Privy Council in
                            <em>Bullard v. The Queen</em>

                        at p. 642:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">“It has long been settled law that if on
                            the evidence, whether of the prosecution or of the
                            defence, there is any evidence of provocation fit to
                            be left to a jury, and whether or not this issue has
                            been specifically raised at the trial by counsel for
                            the defence and whether or not the accused had said
                            in terms that he was provoked, it is the duty of the
                            judge, after a proper direction, to leave it open to
                            the jury to return a verdict of manslaughter if they
                            are not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the
                            killing was unprovoked.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is necessary to refer to only two
                        other cases. In <em>Reg. v.
                            Camplin</em> [1978] A.C. 705,
                        Lord Diplock, having cited section 3 of the
                        Homicide Act 1957, went on, at p. 716:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">“it makes it clear that if there was any
                            evidence that the accused himself at the time of the
                            act which caused the death in fact lost his
                            self-control in consequence of some provocation
                            however slight it might appear to the judge, he was
                            bound to leave to the jury the question, which is
                            one of opinion not of law: whether a reasonable man
                            might have reacted to that provocation as the
                            accused did.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In <em>Reg. v.
                            Rossiter</em> [1994] 2 All E.R. 752, 758,
                        Russell L.J. said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">“We take the law to be that wherever there
                            is material which is capable of amounting to
                            provocation, however tenuous it may be, the jury
                            must be given the privilege of ruling upon
                            it.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">For the Crown, Mr. Denyer sought to limit the
                        situation in which a judge is required to leave
                        provocation to the jury, although it has not been raised
                        by the defence. He submits that in all the cases cited
                        above, it was common ground that the defendant had
                        caused the death. The issues before the jury were
                        therefore concerned with the defendant’s state of
                        mind and in those circumstances, whether he was running
                            [<em>sic</em>] accident,
                        self-defence, no intent, or even diminished
                        responsibility, it was appropriate, if any evidence of
                        provocation existed, that the judge should also leave
                        that issue to the jury. Where, however, the
                        defendant’s case is that he was not there or it
                        was not his hand which killed the deceased,
                        Mr. Denyer submits different considerations apply.
                        There, if the defence did not rely upon provocation, the
                        judge need not leave that issue to the jury.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We cannot agree. The authorities cited above
                            [<em>viz</em>, <em>inter alia</em>, <em>Rex v Hopper</em> [1915] 2 KB 431,
                            <em>Mancini v Director of Public
                            Prosecutions</em> [1942] AC 1,
                            <em>Bullard v The Queen</em>
                        [1957] AC 635 and <em>Reg v
                            Porritt</em> [1961] 1 WLR 1372] draw
                        no such distinction. Moreover, by way of example, a
                        defendant may rely on alibi whilst the prosecution
                        witnesses identifying him as the killer may describe
                        provocative acts or words followed by an apparent loss
                        of self-control on the defendant’s part. In such a
                        case, it would manifestly be wrong, if the alibi were
                        rejected, for the jury to convict of murder without
                        considering provocation. So, even though the defence may
                        prefer provocation not to be raised, in the fear that it
                        may be a distraction offering the jury a possible
                        compromise verdict, the judge must leave it to the jury
                        if there is evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     It seems clear from the
                    last quoted passage that the court will disregard the fact
                    that an alternative defence available to an accused may be
                    inconsistent with his primary defence, and will not hold it
                    against him if he does not wish to raise the alternative
                    defence. In the context of a jury trial, an accused may well
                    decide not to advance an alternative defence because it may
                    induce the jury to reach a compromise verdict. On the facts
                    of <em>R v Cambridge</em>,
                    since it was impossible to say what the outcome would have
                    been if provocation had been left to the jury, the verdict
                    of murder was quashed and a verdict of manslaughter was
                    substituted for it (see <em>R v
                        Cambridge</em> at 976E–F).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     The rationale for this
                    approach was explained clearly by Lord Bingham of
                    Cornhill in <em>Regina v Coutts</em>
                    [2006] 1 WLR 2154 at [12] as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">12    In any criminal prosecution for
                            a serious offence there is an important public
                            interest in the outcome: <em>R. v
                                Fairbanks</em> [1986]
                            1 WLR 1202, 1206. The public interest is
                            that, following a fairly conducted trial, defendants
                            should be convicted of offences which they are
                            proved to have committed and should not be convicted
                            of offences which they are not proved to have
                            committed. The interests of justice are not served
                            if a defendant who has committed a lesser offence is
                            either convicted of a greater offence, exposing him
                            to greater punishment than his crime deserves, or
                            acquitted altogether, enabling him to escape the
                            measure of punishment which his crime deserves. The
                            objective must be that defendants are neither
                            over-convicted nor under-convicted, nor acquitted
                            when they have committed a lesser offence of the
                            type charged. The human instrument relied on to
                            achieve this objective in cases of serious crime is
                            of course the jury. But to achieve it in some cases
                            the jury must be alerted to the options open to it.
                            This is not ultimately the responsibility of the
                            prosecutor, important though his role as a minister
                            of justice undoubtedly is. Nor is it the
                            responsibility of defence counsel, whose proper
                            professional concern is to serve what he and his
                            client judge to be the best interests of the client.
                            It is the ultimate responsibility of the trial
                            judge: <em>Von Starck v The
                                Queen</em> [2000] 1 WLR 1270,
                            1275; <em>Hunter v The
                                Queen</em> [2003] UKPC 69,
                            para 27.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The same principle should apply in a bench
                    trial, with the trial judge acting as the jury. The task of
                    ensuring that offenders are “neither over-convicted
                    nor under-convicted, nor acquitted when they have committed
                    a lesser offence of the type charged” falls squarely
                    on the trial judge. The trial judge cannot shirk the
                    responsibility of considering any alternative defence
                    reasonably available on the evidence before the court even
                    if the Defence has not relied on that defence, or even if
                    the Prosecution and the Defence have agreed not to raise it.
                    In a criminal trial, the court’s duty and function
                    should not be constrained by any agreement between the
                    Prosecution and the Defence not to raise a particular
                    defence before the court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     This principle is
                    well-illustrated by <em>Mohamed Kunjo v
                        Public Prosecutor</em>
                    [1977–1978] SLR(R) 211 (“<em>Mohamed Kunjo</em>”), a Privy
                    Council decision on an appeal from Singapore. In that case,
                    the appellant did not raise the defence of sudden fight to a
                    charge of murder either at his trial or on appeal to the
                    Court of Criminal Appeal. The question was whether the
                    defence could be raised before the Privy Council for the
                    first time. Consistent with the line of authorities which we
                    referred to earlier, the Privy Council reasoned that in a
                    jury trial, the trial judge must put to the jury all matters
                    which might reasonably entitle the jury to return a lesser
                    verdict (see <em>Mohamed Kunjo</em> at
                        [19]). If the
                    trial judge failed to do that, the Privy Council would
                    intervene. The Prosecution in <em>Mohamed
                        Kunjo</em> did not suggest that this principle was
                    inapplicable where there was a bench trial or where the
                    burden was on the accused to establish his defence (which
                    was the position in <em>Mohamed
                        Kunjo</em> by reason of the Evidence Act
                    (Cap 5, 1970 Rev Ed)). The Privy Council also
                    referred to an Indian decision involving a bench trial in
                    which the Supreme Court of India substituted a verdict of
                    culpable homicide for one of murder because it found that
                    the special exception of sudden fight was made out
                    notwithstanding that this special exception was not raised
                    during the trial (see <em>Chamru
                        </em><em>Budhwa v State of Madhya
                        Pradesh</em> AIR 1954 SC 652). On the
                    facts of <em>Mohamed Kunjo</em>, the
                    Privy Council considered that the evidence was such that the
                    trial judges could not have reasonably concluded that the
                    defence of sudden fight was made out. This was because the
                    accused had taken undue advantage of the victim (see
                        <em>Mohamed Kunjo</em> at [21]). Accordingly, the
                    Privy Council held that the trial judges did not err in
                    failing to refer to that defence in their
                judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     In <em>Mohamed Kunjo</em>, the Privy Council enunciated
                    the following test for determining when it would intervene
                    and consider a defence not raised in the proceedings below
                    (at <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a>):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… In our judgment a defence based upon an
                        exception which the defendant has to prove may be raised
                        for the first time before the Board, if the Board
                        considers that otherwise there would be a real risk of
                        failure of justice. The test must be <em>whether there is sufficient evidence upon which a
                            reasonable tribunal could find the defence made
                            out</em>. If there be such evidence, the court
                        of trial should have expressly dealt with it in its
                        judgment and the Judicial Committee will deal with it on
                        appeal, even though it has not been raised below.
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(B)   Application to the facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     In the present case, the
                    Judge accepted Mas Swan’s defence that he believed
                    what Roshamima had told him. That, in our view, would be
                    evidence that Roshamima might have had the same belief,
                        <em>ie</em>, that the three bundles
                    contained ecstasy, which was what Mas Swan believed. In the
                    light of this finding concerning Mas Swan’s belief, it
                    was necessary, in our view, for the Judge to go one step
                    further and consider: (a) whether Roshamima had the
                    same belief; and (b) if she had, whether such belief
                    was sufficient to rebut the s 18(2) presumption against
                    her.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     Logically, the Judge would
                    only be entitled to ignore the implication of his acceptance
                    of Mas Swan’s evidence by making <em>another</em> finding of fact, <em>ie</em>, that Roshamima knew that the three
                    bundles contained diamorphine and had lied to Mas Swan in
                    order to bring him on board. This would be the logical
                    inference if the Judge were not to give any credence to the
                    possibility that Roshamima had thought that the three
                    bundles contained ecstasy. However, the Judge omitted to
                    consider this aspect of the case against Roshamima, and that
                    is what has troubled us in this appeal. Having regard to the
                    close relationship between Roshamima and Mas Swan (they were
                    due to get engaged to be married in June 2009), there was no
                    reason why Roshamima would have put Mas Swan’s life at
                    risk by lying to him about <em>the nature of
                        the controlled drugs they were going to
                        deliver.</em> It would have taken an extremely
                    callous woman to have done that. It was of course possible
                    for Roshamima to have done so, but such a conclusion would
                    have required the Judge to make other findings of fact, such
                    as the finding that Mas Swan did not wish to be involved in
                    the importation of diamorphine, and that telling him an
                    untruth about the nature of the controlled drugs involved
                    was the only way to get him to agree to join Roshamima in
                    bringing <em>diamorphine</em> into
                    Singapore. In our view, the intimate relationship between
                    Roshamima and Mas Swan should have alerted the Judge to the
                    implications of believing Mas Swan’s evidence and the
                    possibility that Roshamima might also have believed what she
                    had told Mas Swan. The fact that she mounted an “all
                    or nothing” defence should not, <em>ipso facto</em>, be a ground for not considering
                    the other evidence on record that, as found by the Judge,
                    she did tell Mas Swan that the three bundles contained
                    ecstasy (see the passage from <em>R v
                        Cambridge</em> reproduced at <a href="#p1_72">[72]</a> above). In our view, the
                    Judge’s omission to consider the Alternative Defence
                        <em>vis-à-vis</em> Roshamima is an
                    error of law. As it is impossible to say what the
                    Judge’s decision in respect of Roshamima would have
                    been if he had considered the Alternative Defence, we must
                    give Roshamima the benefit of doubt arising from the
                    Judge’s omission to consider that
                defence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     For the above reasons, we
                    do not consider it safe to let Roshamima’s conviction
                    on the amended charge, which is a capital charge of
                    importing diamorphine (see <a href="#p1_2">[2]</a> above), stand. Accordingly, we set aside
                    her conviction of the amended charge, substitute the amended
                    charge with the following charge and convict her of that
                    charge instead:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">You, [Roshamima], on the
                            6<sup>th</sup> day of May 2009,

                        Singapore, did attempt to import into Singapore, N,

                        (“ecstasy”) which is a Class A
                        controlled drug, and which is specified in the First
                        Schedule to the [MDA], to wit, by bringing into
                        Singapore in the said JHA 7781, one hundred and

                        less than 21.48 grams of diamorphine, which you
                        believed to be ecstasy, without any authorisation under
                        the [MDA] or the regulations made thereunder, and you
                        have thereby committed an offence under Section 7
                        read with Section 12, and punishable under
                        Section 33 of the [MDA].</p>
<p class="Judg-1">We will determine the appropriate sentence to
