</div> On 24 April 2013, the Plaintiff underwent examination and it was found that she had 20 degrees of external rotation and 20mm of shortening of her right tibia. The Plaintiff opted for reconstructive surgery using an Ilizarov frame. One of the Plaintiff’s medical experts, Dr Chang Haw Chong (“Dr Chang”), described the Ilizarov procedure as follows:

This was but the first step in a long process. The Plaintiff subsequently went through several more surgical procedures related to the Ilizarov procedure and also to treat site infections, including one to remove three Ilizarov pins on 16 January 2014 and another to remove the Ilizarov frame and to apply a plaster cast on 15 July 2014.

</div> While the procedure succeeded in achieving equalisation of her right lower leg length and correction of the external rotation, there was a setback when the Plaintiff’s right tibia fractured two weeks after the frame was removed. Her right tibia was re-cast and she was required to use a wheelchair and crutches to get around.

When faced with conflicting expert evidence, the court must decide which side’s evidence it prefers. In the present case, I prefer the evidence given by the expert witnesses for the Plaintiff. This is partly because, in the course of cross-examination, Dr Singh made certain comments which suggested to me that he was not entirely impartial. In particular, he suggested that the Plaintiff was exaggerating the pain in her ankle in order to obtain greater financial compensation.

His answer that the Plaintiff was exaggerating her pain for greater financial compensation was unsolicited and went beyond his remit. This exchange led me to wonder whether Dr Singh had come to court to give evidence in an impartial or disinterested manner.

In particular, Dr Tan is a doctor in a government hospital and there is no reason for him to recommend the Plaintiff to undergo any unnecessary surgical procedures. Dr Tan had testified that he found the Plaintiff to be honest and reliable and that she did not try to exaggerate her condition.

Dr Tan therefore has greater familiarity with the Plaintiff’s medical condition, especially her residual disabilities in relation to her ankle and her foot. Dr Tan had also seen the Plaintiff most recently on 14 June 2016.

</div> This option would be appropriate if the Plaintiff were older (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, around 60–65 years of age) and her arthritis had worsened. In my view, given the fact that the Plaintiff was clearly troubled by the pain in her right ankle at present, there is a much greater likelihood that she will undergo the osteotomy and fusion procedures in the near future to relieve her ankle pain, rather than wait nearly 20 years while her arthritis gradually worsens before undergoing a total ankle replacement. I therefore decline to award the Plaintiff any amount in respect of the ankle replacement procedure.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 For completeness, I note the following. Given that the ankle fusion surgery is likely to take place only five to ten years after the osteotomy procedure (see [24] above), it may be argued that an upward adjustment ought to be applied to take into account inflation and rising medical costs. While that is correct, one must also take into account the fact that the Plaintiff will essentially be receiving the benefit of a payment in advance (see <span class="font-italic">Khoo </span><span class="font-italic">Ih Chu v Chong Hoe Siong Jeremy</span> [1989] 2 SLR(R) 243 at [27]).

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Although Ms Kusrini had not been hired at the very outset to care for the Plaintiff, it is clear to me that the Plaintiff continued to incur domestic helper expenses (after her father’s death) <span class="font-italic">because</span> she needed assistance in daily living activities and care of her injuries <span class="font-italic">as a result of </span>the accident. I accept the Plaintiff’s evidence that she would not otherwise have continued to retain the services of Ms Kusrini. I note that the defendants did not challenge the Plaintiff’s and/or Dr Chang’s evidence that the Plaintiff was dependent on Ms Kusrini for her daily living activities and care of her wounds. I also note that the Plaintiff acted reasonably in choosing to retain the services of her existing domestic helper instead of looking for a new helper, or hiring a nurse. I therefore reject the defendants’ submission that the Plaintiff was not entitled to claim damages for domestic helper expenses at all. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 I turn now to consider the defendants’ alternative argument that the Plaintiff should only be entitled to 50% of her claim because the household chores performed by Ms Kusrini benefited not only the injured Plaintiff, but also (a) her uncle who stayed with her and (b) her employees working out of her home office. In support, the defendants cited the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Toon Chee Meng Eddie v </span><span class="font-italic">Yeap Chin Hon </span>[1993] 1 SLR(R) 407 (“<span class="font-italic">Toon</span>”). The context there was slightly different as the court was deciding the quantum to be awarded in respect of future nursing care; nonetheless, part of this assessment involved the computation of domestic helper expenses. In <span class="font-italic">Toon</span>, although parties agreed that the monthly cost of a domestic helper in Singapore was $750, the court applied a 20% discount to reach a multiplicand of $600 on the basis that this discount took into account the value of the domestic helper for other services provided to the household (at [38]). The defendants thus submitted that the percentage reduction in the present case should be higher than the 20% in <span class="font-italic">Toon</span> because Ms Kusrini’s services conferred benefits not just on other members of the household, but also those <span class="font-italic">outside</span> of the household (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Plaintiff’s employees).

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> In support, the Plaintiff relied on several cases, the most relevant of which is the High Court’s decision in <span class="font-italic">AOD (a minor suing by his litigation representative) v AOE</span> [2016] 1 SLR 217 (“<span class="font-italic">AOD</span>”). The assistant registrar applied a 50% discount to the total cost of the domestic helper on the basis that the helper had spent half her time doing household chores. However, the High Court disagreed and found that no discount should be applied. It was clear that the need for the domestic helper had arisen solely because of the accident. Even if the domestic helper did assist in housework, this was because the plaintiff’s mother had become a full-time caregiver for the plaintiff and this limited her ability to perform house work as she otherwise would. The plaintiff’s mother therefore needed a domestic helper to help out in these areas (at [81]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 The Plaintiff further submitted that <span class="font-italic">i</span><span class="font-italic">f </span>this court were minded to order a discount, in view of the small proportion of the household chores carried out by Ms Kusrini that benefited the Plaintiff’s uncle, such discount should not exceed a small percentage of 5% to 10%.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 I deal first with the sole authority of <span class="font-italic">Toon</span> raised by the defendants to support their submission that a discount greater than 20% should be applied to the domestic helper expenses claimed by the Plaintiff. One of the key reasons why the court in <span class="font-italic">Toon </span>applied a 20% discount was because the domestic helper was not required to care for the plaintiff <span class="font-italic">at all times</span>: the plaintiff was <span class="font-italic">also</span> being looked after by both his parents (see <span class="font-italic">Toon</span> at [30], [38] and [39]). In contrast, the Plaintiff’s sole caregiver is Ms Kusrini. It is reasonable to conclude that as compared to the domestic helper in <span class="font-italic">Toon</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>Ms Kusrini would have spent a significantly greater percentage of her time caring for the Plaintiff, and correspondingly would have provided fewer benefits to the household in general. This key factual distinction means that <span class="font-italic">Toon</span> does not take the defendants’ case very far. I therefore do not think that the value of Ms Kusrini’s services for benefits allegedly conferred on the Plaintiff’s uncle and/or the Plaintiff’s employees should necessarily be accounted for, much less to an extent greater than 20%. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 I come now to <span class="font-italic">AOD</span> which the Plaintiff relied on for her submission that no discount should be applied because the need to hire a domestic helper arose solely because of the accident. At the outset, it should be noted that <span class="font-italic">AOD </span>(like <span class="font-italic">Toon</span>) is distinguishable on the basis that the plaintiff had other caregivers in addition to the domestic helper.<span class="font-italic"> </span>Notwithstanding this factual distinction, the proposition laid down in [81] of <span class="font-italic">AOD</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(see [64] above)<span class="font-italic"> </span>seems eminently sensible: there is no reason to apply a discount to account for benefits accruing to the household if the domestic helper was simply doing housework that, but for the accident, would have been done by the plaintiff’s current caregiver. This principle equally applies in respect of housework that, but for the accident, would have been done by the plaintiff <span class="font-italic">personally</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 In my view, it would be inappropriate to apply a discount in the present case. Though there was evidence that work done by Ms Kusrini for the household (such as cooking and laundry) had benefited the Plaintiff’s uncle to some extent, in my view, such benefits would have been minimal. As for the Plaintiff’s employees, there was no evidence to show that they had benefited from Ms Kusrini’s services at all. In any event, as mentioned at [60] above, it was clear to me that the need for Ms Kusrini’s services had arisen solely as a result of<span class="font-italic"> </span>the accident. The Plaintiff would have taken care of the household herself, but because of the accident, she had to rely on Ms Kusrini instead. Applying the principle in <span class="font-italic">AOD</span>, the Plaintiff should be compensated for such expenses that she would otherwise not have incurred. Further, as mentioned earlier at [56], the Plaintiff had of her own accord limited her claim for domestic helper expenses to those incurred between the time of the accident and end of January 2016 (being three months after her last surgery in November 2015). This was despite the fact that she was <span class="font-italic">in fact</span> still relying on Ms Kusrini’s services up till the time of the hearing.

First, in my view, it was inappropriate to use RXP’s average earnings for 2009 and 2010 as the base figure for comparison. RXP only started providing accounting and IT solutions in 2011. Prior to that, RXP was involved in the business of providing digital imaging services for Community Development Councils and SPRING Singapore and engaged elderly people as part-time staff.

</div> That was a completely different business involving a completely different business model. Thus, RXP’s earnings in 2009 and 2010 would not be an accurate gauge of the business’s performance and profitability for 2011 and beyond, when RXP began providing accounting and IT solutions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 Second, and more fundamentally, it seems to me that the defendants’ submissions missed the point.

In my view, the award for loss of pre-trial earnings should compensate the Plaintiff for her share of the net profit that RXP and RXPPL would otherwise have made, notwithstanding the fact that the numbers show no apparent decline in profitability.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 This approach finds support in the case of <span class="font-italic">Koh</span><span class="font-italic"> Soon Pheng v Tan Kah Eng</span> [2003] 2 SLR(R) 538 (“<span class="font-italic">Koh</span><span class="font-italic"> Soon Pheng</span>”), which the defendants themselves relied on. The plaintiff was the owner of a motorcycle workshop, and most of the time he was the only worker in the business. In 2000, the plaintiff unfortunately met with an accident and sustained injuries which made it difficult for him to carry, repair and service motorcycles as he used to do. Based on documentation from the IRAS, his business suffered a net loss of $23,436 and $4,935 in 2001 and 2002 respectively. The High Court agreed with the plaintiff that his true loss of earnings was not just the amount that he had in fact lost (determined by comparing pre and post-accident figures), but also included the amount that he would otherwise have made as profit (at [13]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 Although the issue in <span class="font-italic">Koh</span><span class="font-italic"> Soon Pheng</span> was quantification rather than the fact of the loss, it stands to reason that if the court found that the plaintiff was entitled to claim the profit that he would otherwise have made, the court must have considered that the plaintiff did in fact suffer a loss, albeit one not expressly reflected in the figures. Thus, although RXP’s post-accident net profits were generally higher than its pre-accident average net profits, this does not mean that the Plaintiff did not suffer any compensable loss of earnings as a result of the accident. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 I agree with the Plaintiff that the accident prevented her from developing RXP and RXPPL to the extent she otherwise would have. As a matter of logic, that must have been the case. RXP and RXPPL were essentially driven by two persons, the Plaintiff and Wong. Of the two partners in business, the Plaintiff was the one in charge of sales and business development. Her job required her to, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, travel frequently within Singapore to meet existing and potential clients, arrange and conduct web hosting and/or software demonstrations and presentations in conjunction with pre-sales.

It was not disputed that the Plaintiff had produced these Forecasts entirely by herself, for the purpose of litigation, and that they had not been independently verified. The defendants objected to the admissibility of the Forecasts on the ground that they constituted opinion evidence and that the Plaintiff, being a witness of fact, could only give evidence on facts that she had perceived. That is, she was only entitled to present primary documents in support of RXP’s and RXPPL’s actual earnings. The defendants argued that the Plaintiff could only give opinion evidence if the exceptions set out in ss 47–53 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (“EA”), or in case law, were met. The defendants submitted that these requirements were not met – the Plaintiff was not an “expert” in the field of forecasting business growth and earnings, because her expertise was actually in the field of accountancy.

</div>
</div> I can quickly dispose of this argument. Quite clearly the Forecasts were not merely statements of fact. Creating a forecast requires interpreting, drawing inferences from and making assumptions about an underlying state of affairs. The underlying state of affairs would be factual in nature, but the forecast itself must necessarily be to some extent opinion. In other words, the Forecasts depended in part on matters of fact and in part on matters of opinion (in particular, assumptions).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 Further or in the alternative, the Plaintiff argued that the Forecasts were admissible pursuant to s 32B(3) of the EA,

There is thus no need to address the defendants’ argument that the Plaintiff was not an “expert” or that she was not impartial.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 The Plaintiff then cited several English cases where witnesses of fact were permitted to provide opinion evidence. In the English Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">David Michael Lusty v </span><span class="font-italic">Finsbury Securities Ltd</span> [1992] 59 BLR 66 (“<span class="font-italic">Lusty</span>”), the claimant Mr Lusty was an architect suing for fees. He appeared as a witness of fact and gave evidence as to the work he had performed, the hours he had spent on it and the rates on which his charges were based. In addition, he also gave evidence as to whether it was customary to value his services in this way and whether he considered his fees to be reasonable. Although the court observed that this was opinion evidence, the court held that Mr Lusty was qualified as an architect to give such evidence. Further, the court observed that opinions or beliefs of witnesses who are were not experts could be admissible on the grounds of necessity, if more direct and positive evidence were unobtainable. The fact that Mr Lusty was also the claimant only affected the weight of his opinion evidence (at 71).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 The Plaintiff also cited the English High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Multiplex Constructions (UK) Ltd v Cleveland Bridge UK Ltd</span> [2008] EWHC 2220 (TCC) (“<span class="font-italic">Multiplex</span>”). That case concerned a dispute between the main contractor and sub-contractor of the Wembley Stadium in England. One Mr Taylor had been called as a witness of fact. The question was whether he could also give opinion evidence, bearing in mind that he possessed considerable engineering expertise and had personal knowledge of the roof design and erection engineering decisions in the Wembley Stadium project. The High Court held that he could give statements of professional opinion bearing upon facts within his personal knowledge. The fact that he was not an independent expert witness went only to the weight of his evidence (at [665]–[672]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 Although these two English decisions are not on all-fours with the present case, and neither do they appear to apply the English statutory equivalent of s 32B(3) of the EA, I agree with the Plaintiff that the Forecasts are admissible. Although the Plaintiff was a witness of fact, she was the person in charge of RXP’s and RXPPL’s business development. There was no other person in a better position than she to render an opinion on their business performance and the likely increase in profitability. Her evidence was crucial for this court to assess how RXP and RXPPL would have developed over the years. Accordingly, in my view, the Forecasts are admissible. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 As in <span class="font-italic">Lusty </span>and <span class="font-italic">Multiplex</span>, however, the weight to be ascribed to such evidence is a different matter.

</div></div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The Forecasts did not take into account RXP’s financial performance for the pre-accident years of 2008–2009, and neither were financial documents for those years disclosed. The defendants alleged that this was selective since 2010 appeared to be the best-performing year on record. The defendants said that the Plaintiff should instead have taken the average of the three years and used that to forecast the business growth for 2011 onwards.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Each year’s forecast earnings were represented as a percentage increase of the previous year. The starting point for the Forecasts was therefore RXP’s financial performance in 2010. RXP allegedly had a total income of $227,667.28 that year. However, the financial documents for 2010 were not in evidence. Thus, the defendants alleged that the Forecasts were premised or built on an alleged fact that remained questionable and unsubstantiated.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Although the Plaintiff has provided an explanation for each year’s forecast, the defendants said that the factual matters referenced in these explanations were not supported by documentary evidence. For instance:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) For the forecast for 2011, the Plaintiff said that RXP became the authorised reseller of certain accounting solutions in 2011 and that RXP had been awarded a prize for being a “top new reseller” for the first quarter of 2010. The defendants pointed out that no documentary evidence was provided in support of these assertions.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) For the forecast for 2012, the Plaintiff said that RXP had been offered a demo interview session with the Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore (“IDA”) and was successfully listed on the iSprint Accounting Solutions by IDA as per their agreement in September 2011. This meant that RXP was listed as an authorised reseller of certain accounting IT solutions and so the government would provide subsidies to small and medium enterprises which purchased solution packages from RXP. RXP’s listing would therefore have helped drive sales.

Since there were government initiatives to assist companies through PIC grants, this would “definitely push [RXP’s] sales up further because of the increased percentage of cash payout from 30% to 60% plus the PIC bonus of $15000 to help companies”.

However, it is not in every case that pre-trial loss of earnings can be quantified with precision. In certain cases, such as where the Plaintiff’s monthly income fluctuates, the quantification may be approximate: <span class="font-italic">Practitioners’ Library – </span><span class="font-italic">Assessment of Damages: Personal Injuries and Fatal Accidents </span>(LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2017) at para 2-2.

The plaintiff is entitled to the net earnings he would have made but as a result of the injury has not made between accident and trial or assessment as in this case. Where the plaintiff can show, but for the accident and the injuries suffered he would have had an increase in his earnings, obtained better employment, a promotion or developed his business, the realistic chance of increased and decreased earnings must be valued by the court between the date of the accident and the trial.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">The degree of particularity required will depend upon the facts of each case</span>.<span class="font-italic"> </span>...<span class="font-italic"> Minute accuracy is not expected and the pleading should make clear what measure of damage is relied on, and if the plaintiff is able to base his claim on a precise calculation he must give the defendants access to the facts which make that calculation possible.</span> Thus, in personal injury cases the plaintiff should give full details of his loss of earnings to date, his out of pocket expenses and any benefits such as unemployment or social security benefits which he may have received. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 Accordingly, since the Plaintiff claimed pre-trial loss of earnings by way of special damages, it was incumbent on the Plaintiff to “give the defendants access to the facts which make that calculation possible”. The Plaintiff has attempted to do so by providing the Forecasts to justify the quantum of damages she claimed. However, as the defendants pointed out, these Forecasts were lacking in many respects. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 For instance, the Forecasts were essentially built on RXP’s actual financial performance for 2010.

</div> It does not contain particulars of RXP’s total revenue, cost of goods or expenses. In the circumstances the defendants and this court are in no position to verify the critical factual underpinning of the Forecasts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 It seemed to me that despite the responses provided above at [103], the Plaintiff has not addressed the nub of the defendants’ contention that there was a near complete lack of primary evidence supporting the factual matters referenced in the Forecasts. All that this court has to go on are the brief explanations provided in the plaintiff’s Forecasts and her oral testimony. For instance, consider the Plaintiff’s assertion that she had chosen not to include copies of RXP’s contracts with IDA and various government agencies in her affidavit for fear of breaching the confidentiality clauses contained within. This should not have been an issue at all. If the Plaintiff was only relying on these contracts to prove that RXP was an approved vendor of the accounting solutions, it surely would have been possible to redact the irrelevant portions of these contracts. Alternatively, permission could have been sought from the various government agencies for disclosure in these litigation proceedings. Counsel for the Plaintiff should have arranged for such matters. It certainly should not have been left to the Plaintiff to bring the original contracts to court on the day she was supposed to testify and offer them to the defendants’ counsel for viewing. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 As a result of these evidentiary failings, the factual matters referenced in the Forecasts were virtually unverifiable. As to her assumptions, I accept that the Plaintiff did provide an explanation for why she applied a 50% increase in deriving her forecast for 2011. There were also brief written explanations provided for the figures used in deriving the forecasts for 2012, 2013 and 2014. I accept that business forecasts are subjective and there is only so much justification that can be provided as to why a certain figure is used in forecasting. Yet, a claimant cannot simply make a bare assertion – particularly where the factual underpinnings are already in doubt – and expect the court to award damages in that amount without question. The claimant must do her level best to show that these assumptions are reasonable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109  A comparison with the English High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">XYZ v </span><span class="font-italic">Portmouth Hospitals NHS Trust </span>[2011] EWHC 243 (QB) (“<span class="font-italic">XYZ</span>”), recently cited in the Singapore High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Ramesh s/o Krishnan v A</span><span class="font-italic">XA Life Insurance Pte Ltd </span>[2017] SGHC 197 at [83]–[85], will demonstrate this. <span class="font-italic">XYZ</span> involved a claimant who brought a claim in medical negligence against the defendant for negligent advice and performance of an operation. One area in dispute was the quantum of damages to be awarded for the claimant’s loss of future earnings. The claimant had resigned from his very senior position in the pharmaceutical industry to set up his own pharmaceutical market research agency, which purportedly would have been highly profitable. The claimant sought compensation for the loss of his prospects of setting up and developing this business for several years and upon retirement, selling that business (at [42]–[45]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 Spencer J noted that where there cannot be certainty as to the way in which the claimant’s business would have developed, the court may assess damages by evaluating the chance that particular events would have happened at particular times (at [54]). The learned judge then quantified the claimant’s loss by expressing in percentage terms the likelihood that the claimant would achieved certain milestones, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, the chances that the business would have obtained a turnover of £2m (at [43]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 Critically, however, in assessing these chances and possibilities, Spencer J had before him an extensive amount of evidence which had been led on this issue. Particularly, there was testimony from witnesses who had set up businesses similar to the ones that the claimant had intended to establish. Spencer J noted that the financial performances of these witnesses were useful comparisons (at [48]). The claimant also adduced the evidence of a forensic accountant who had examined the financial accounts of these witnesses with a view to analysing the prospects of the claimant’s business and its likely profitability (at [51]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 Like the claimant in <span class="font-italic">XYZ</span>, the Plaintiff in the present case was also required to engage in a hypothetical exercise to prove how much RXP and RXPPL would have made between 2011 and 2017 had the accident not happened. However, the difference in the state of evidence could not have been more stark. While the claimant in <span class="font-italic">XYZ</span> made every effort to show how his business would have developed, the Plaintiff in the present case only provided a single spreadsheet document and very sparse primary evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 The Plaintiff attempted to provide other evidence in the form of the Occupational Wages Survey 2015 conducted by the Central Provident Fund Board in which the following average monthly gross wages were stated:

</div> The fact that this only came up during trial itself contributed to my impression that the Plaintiff lacked proper evidence to support her claim for special damages.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 Second, the computation technique used in Annexure B of the Plaintiff’s closing submissions was also incorrect for the year 2011. The third column of the table at [95] above reflects the amount that the Plaintiff should have earned for the year. Counsel for the Plaintiff had taken $119,164.47 (being the net profit for the year 2011) and divided it by two. This was on the basis that as one of the two equity partners, the Plaintiff would have been entitled to 50% of the business’s earnings. However, counsel seemed to have overlooked that the claim for 2011 was only for half a year, from July to December. Therefore $119,164.47 should have been divided by four instead.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 In the circumstances, I hold that the Plaintiff has failed to strictly prove that she suffered a pre-trial loss of earnings in the amount of $578,244.32.

It will be recalled from [74] above that prior to joining RXP, the Plaintiff was employed as a Finance Manager with JWT and drew a fixed monthly salary of $6,300. She left JWT in October 2008 and joined RXP in November 2008. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 The Plaintiff argued that she would not have resigned from JWT in order to join a start-up if she was not confident of earning, at the very least, $6,300 per month.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 I reiterate that special damages like pre-trial loss of earnings must be strictly proved (see [104] above). In the first place, I do not think that it is sufficient for the Plaintiff to point to her last-drawn salary of $6,300 as a proxy for what she would have earned. To prove her pre-trial loss of earnings, she should have adduced evidence as to how RXP’s and RXPPL’s business would have developed had the accident not occurred.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 In any event, there are further difficulties with the Plaintiff’s approach of using her last-drawn salary as a proxy for what she would have earned had the accident not occurred. The underlying premise of the Plaintiff’s argument was that she would not have chosen to resign from JMT had she not been confident of earning more than $6,300 per month. In my view, this premise is flawed: the Plaintiff could not have joined RXP realistically expecting to make at least $6,300 from the very outset. The Plaintiff herself acknowledged the instability and unprofitability of RXP in its early days. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 First, during cross-examination, the Plaintiff in explaining her IRAS Notice of Assessment for calendar year 2009 alluded to the fact that a start-up normally makes losses in its first few years:

So there is a trade loss of 10,000, this is derived from RXP.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 Second, the Plaintiff also said that she and Wong had discussed that if the business could not “make it” (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, turn profitable) within three years, they would have to return to the workforce.

She could not have reasonably expected to make at least $6,300 per month from the moment she joined RXP.

</div> The defendants purport to apply the methodology used in <span class="font-italic">Koh</span><span class="font-italic"> Soon Pheng</span>. There, in support of his claim for pre-trial loss of earnings, the plaintiff adduced his financial statements for the pre-accident years of 1995 to 1999, for the accident year of 2000 and for the post-accident years of 2001 and 2002. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 The court awarded the plaintiff pre-trial loss of earnings of two and a half years from June 2000 to 2002. The court took the five pre-accident years, omitted the years with the highest and lowest earnings, and took the average of the remaining three years to obtain the plaintiff’s average earnings, pre-accident. This amount was computed to be $23,154.33. The court then compared this amount to the financial statements for 2001 where the plaintiff suffered a net loss of $23,436. The court thus awarded the plaintiff $23,154.33 plus $23,436 for the year 2001. The court applied a similar approach to determine that the plaintiff should be awarded $23,154.33 plus $6,000 for the year 2002 (at [12]–[14]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 The defendants sought to apply the methodology in <span class="font-italic">Koh</span><span class="font-italic"> Soon Pheng </span>to the present case.

</div>
</div> They relied on the table at [79] above, which showed that except for 2011, RXP’s net profit exceeded the average pre-accident net profit of $37,123.95. Thus the defendants submitted that RXP’s total monetary loss was $85,070.79 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>$37,123.95 plus $47,946.84 being RXP’s net loss in 2011). Since the Plaintiff was only entitled to 50% of the business earnings, she was only entitled to $42,535.40 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, $85,070.79 divided by two).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 The defendants went further. They argued that Wong, the Plaintiff’s partner in the business, had also been injured and his injuries would also have contributed to the loss. Since they were both equal shareholders, they both would have contributed equally to the loss. This brought the Plaintiff’s claim for pre-trial loss of earnings to $21,267.70 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, $42,535.40 divided by 2).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 I do not think that the defendants’ proposed computation is acceptable. First, as I have mentioned at [81] above, RXP was engaged in a completely different business in 2009 and 2010. Its earnings from that period of time are not an accurate gauge of RXP’s profitability for 2011 and beyond.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 Second, the method in <span class="font-italic">Koh</span><span class="font-italic"> Soon Pheng</span> does not take into account business growth. The plaintiff there had been in the motorcycle repair business for about ten years. That is quite different from a start-up business like the Plaintiff’s. In the early years of a start-up, it is not unexpected that the partners would be focusing on getting in more clients and business. There was some evidence of that before this court, although those details provided were insufficient for me to accept the Plaintiff’s computation <span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">toto</span>. Nonetheless, this court cannot turn a blind eye to the fact that RXP was clearly in a stage of growth. It would not be appropriate to shackle the assessment to the performance of the pre-accident years, particularly in light of the fact that RXP had been engaged in a completely different business then. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 For the foregoing reasons, I also reject the defendants’ submission that pre-trial loss of earnings be quantified at $21,267.70.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 To recapitulate, I have thus far found that the Plaintiff did suffer a loss of earnings, that being her share of the profits that RXP and RXPPL would have otherwise made had the Plaintiff been able to develop the businesses but for the disruption caused by the accident and the resulting injuries. However, I have also rejected the methods suggested by the Plaintiff and the defendants to quantify the Plaintiff’s loss. This was largely due to the lack of evidence as to how the Plaintiff’s business would have developed but for the accident. I have also mentioned that in my view, the evidential failings were in large part due to poor preparation by the Plaintiff’s counsel. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 Is the Plaintiff then to go uncompensated for her loss? I do not think so. In my view, a fair and appropriate outcome in this case is to award the Plaintiff damages in respect of her pre-trial loss of earning capacity.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Pre-trial loss of earning capacity</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 The differences between an award of loss of earnings and loss of earning capacity were summarised by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Chai Kang Wei Samuel v Shaw Linda Gillian</span> [2010] 3 SLR 587 (“<span class="font-italic">Shaw Linda Gillian</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [16], citing <span class="font-italic">Teo</span><span class="font-italic"> Sing Keng v Sim Ban Kiat </span>[1994] 1 SLR(R) 340 at [40]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">An award for loss of earning capacity, as opposed to an award for loss of earnings, is generally made in the following cases:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) where, at the time of trial, the plaintiff is in employment and has suffered no loss of earnings, but there is a risk that he may lose that employment at some time in the future and may then, as a result of his injury, be at a disadvantage in getting another job or an equally well paid job; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) where there is no available evidence of the plaintiff’s earnings to enable the court to properly calculate future earnings, for example, young children who have no earnings on which to base an assessment for loss of future earnings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 The point was also made in <span class="font-italic">Shaw Linda Gillian</span> that the lack of sufficient evidence for proving loss of future earnings does not by itself convert a claim for loss of future earnings into a claim for loss of earning capacity. The Court of Appeal made clear that these two heads of damages were intended to compensate for different losses: “loss of future earnings compensates for the difference between the post-accident and pre-accident income or rate of income, while loss of earning capacity compensates for the risk or disadvantage, which the plaintiff would suffer in the event that he or she should lose the job that he or she currently holds, in securing an equivalent job in the open employment market” (at [20]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 However, it seems to me that this proposition stated in <span class="font-italic">Shaw Linda Gillian</span> at [20] applies only to situation (a) mentioned at [138] above. The question of the risk of loss of employment simply does not feature at all in situation (b), where the focus is simply on the lack of available evidence for the court to properly calculate future earnings. One example is where the plaintiff is a young child. Another example where such evidentiary difficulties arise is where the plaintiff is a self-employed person. This latter point was made in the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Clark Jonathan Michael v Lee </span><span class="font-italic">Khee Chung </span>[2010] 1 SLR 209 (“<span class="font-italic">Clark Jonathan Michael</span>”) at [84], where Prakash J (as she then was) commented on her earlier decision of <span class="font-italic">Koh</span><span class="font-italic"> Soon Pheng</span>:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[T]he plaintiff there was a self-employed owner of a motorcycle repair workshop whose ability to repair motorcycles was affected by the accident and whose business takings were therefore adversely affected by the accident. The issue was not so much one of the plaintiff’s being at risk of losing employment but of his ability to earn as much as he had done previously because he would have to employ others to do work he had once done and the only reason that the award was for loss of earning capacity rather than for loss of future earnings was that there was not enough evidence in the case to fix a multiplier. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 Like the plaintiff in <span class="font-italic">Koh</span><span class="font-italic"> Soon Pheng</span>, the Plaintiff does not face the risk of losing her employment. Her loss arises because she would have earned more but for the accident. Yet, the court does not know – and in fact, cannot know with much certainty – what would have happened if the accident had not happened. For instance, the court cannot be certain as to how much more time and effort the Plaintiff would have committed, how many more client meetings she would have arranged and attended, and how those clients would have responded. While I have observed that the Plaintiff could have done more to support her claim (at [112] above), ultimately there are too many “what-ifs” at play to allow this court to be entirely certain as to how RXP and RXPPL would have performed if the accident had not occurred. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 Nonetheless, this does not mean that the Plaintiff cannot be compensated for her loss at all. Situations involving such uncertainties are not new to the court. In the context of claims for loss of future earnings, the English courts follow the approach of Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Blamire</span><span class="font-italic"> v South Cumbria Health Authority</span> [1993] PIQR Q1. The plaintiff was a nurse who met with an accident. She claimed an award for loss of future earnings. The court noted that there were far too many uncertainties, such as the plaintiff’s prospects of obtaining other employment, any possible intention of having children and any possibility that she might wish eventually not to work. Thus the court held that in such cases where there exist so many “imponderables”, the court is entitled to eschew the conventional multiplier-multiplicand approach and instead adopt a broad-brush approach in quantifying an award for loss of future earnings. This came to be known as the “<span class="font-italic">Blamire</span> approach”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 Unfortunately, the <span class="font-italic">Blamire</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>approach provides no solution to the present dilemma. That approach relates to <span class="font-italic">future </span>loss of earnings, and not <span class="font-italic">pre-trial</span> loss of earnings which must be strictly proven. Nonetheless, it shows that the court is cognisant that there exist situations where it may be impossible to quantify losses due to the sheer number of uncertainties and “imponderables”. In response to such practical difficulties, the court adopts a broad brush approach instead of the strict multiplier-multiplicand approach. In the pre-trial context, a similar outcome can be reached by awarding the plaintiff damages in respect of his or her loss of earning capacity instead.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 The case of <span class="font-italic">Chang </span><span class="font-italic">Mui Hoon v Lim Bee Leng </span>[2013] SGHCR 17 (“<span class="font-italic">Chang </span><span class="font-italic">Mui Hoon</span>”) is instructive. The plaintiff there was a full-time housewife with no significant income at the time of the accident. However, she testified that she had planned to resume working life as a dog groomer by starting a small dog grooming business, and this plan was thwarted because of her injuries from the accident. She thus claimed pre-trial loss of earnings quantified at $3,000 per month, being the monthly income of a pet stylist in Singapore (at [47]). The learned assistant registrar considered the distinction between special damages and general damages, and had this to say (at [52]–[53]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">The law is thus not so rigid – nor should it be – such that all claims tending to assume the character of seeking pre-trial loss of income must be shoehorned as claims for special damages (for which there must be strict proof). It cannot be taken for granted that all claims of such character are “capable of being estimated with a close approximation to accuracy”, although instances of such incapability are quite uncommon in practice.</span> <span class="font-italic">What this means is that when a claim is made by a plaintiff seeking compensation for pre-trial income that he asserts he could actually have earned but for his injuries suffered from the accident, and </span><span class="font-italic">what the plaintiff would have actually earned is as doubtful as what would have been earned post-trial, it is to be preferred that pre-trial loss of earning capacity attracting general damages and not pre-trial loss of income attracting special damages be used as the proper measure of damages for the purposes of assessment.</span> This is, however, not to say that the former approach must invariably prevail where the plaintiff was not employed at the time of the accident … The court’s evaluation at the end of the day must depend on the factual matrices of each and every case.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In the present case, the proper measure of damages to be applied in respect of the Plaintiff’s claim for pre-trial earnings-related loss should be the Plaintiff’s pre-trial loss of earning capacity attracting general damages. As compared to what she could earn post-trial, I find it equally if not more doubtful what the Plaintiff, having been a housewife for almost five years at the time of the accident, would actually have earned during the period leading up to the date of trial. The fact that the Plaintiff has obtained a dog grooming certificate sometime after the accident does not in any way alter my analysis because the Plaintiff has pitched her claim as one seeking income that she would otherwise have been able to earn by way of setting up a dog grooming business. In other words, the claim, properly characterised, is for loss of pre-trial business earnings, not loss of pre-trial wages that she would have earned as an employee in the job market. There is no business without any commercial risks, and there is no guarantee of success in business. To assess and award the Plaintiff special damages under the rubric of pre-trial loss of income using the method [counsel for the Plaintiff] has adopted … would be tantamount to making the Defendant insure the Plaintiff against all risks of business failure in the dog grooming business that she had intended to start, and that cannot be right. This is precisely what the learned author in <span class="font-italic">Assessment of Damages for Personal Injury and Death: General Principles</span> would have cautioned against in the light of his warning against the danger that “proof of precise figures could implant in the minds of a jury the idea that the earnings would definitely have been received and make the jury forgetful of contingencies to which such earnings were subject” …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original omitted; emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 The assistant registrar then disregarded the evidence before him relating to pre-trial loss of income, and quantified the plaintiff’s loss of earning capacity at $10,000 (at [55]). In so doing, he applied the approach espoused by the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Clark Jonathan Michael </span>at [91]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The assessment for damages for loss of earning capacity can be an exercise in speculation as often the court does not know the extent to which a plaintiff will be disadvantaged by his disabilities if he has to seek a new position. In the end, it is clear from the cases that the assessment is a <span class="font-italic">rather rough and ready one which really reflects the amount that the particular court thinks is reasonable in the particular circumstances to compensate the particular plaintiff</span> for the disadvantage he has been put into in the job market by his disabilities.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 <span class="font-italic">Chang Mui Hoon</span> makes the astute observation that in certain factual circumstances, pre-trial loss of earnings can be as difficult to quantify as future loss of earnings. This creates significant difficulties for the plaintiff because pre-trial loss of earnings are a form of special damages and must be strictly proved to be claimable. In such circumstances, the better approach would be to seek damages for <span class="font-italic">pre-trial loss of earning capacity</span>. Such loss can be quantified by applying a “rough and ready approach” and the court’s aim is simply to achieve what is reasonable in the circumstances. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 I agree with the learned assistant registrar in <span class="font-italic">Chang </span><span class="font-italic">Mui Hoon</span>. Bearing these principles in mind, I return to the case before me. As I have mentioned, the Plaintiff has failed to strictly prove her claim for pre-trial loss of earnings on both the primary and alternative computation methods. Nonetheless, in my view, the Plaintiff can support a claim for pre-trial loss of earning capacity. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 In quantifying this loss, I am guided by the Plaintiff’s last-drawn salary at JWT (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the measure used in the Plaintiff’s alternative computation method). I hasten to add that this <span class="font-italic">by no means suggests </span><span class="font-italic">that the Plaintiff is being compensated for any loss of salary</span>. That would be entirely inaccurate seeing as the Plaintiff was not in fact employed as a Finance Manager at JWT at the time of the accident. I am simply using the Plaintiff’s last-drawn salary as a proxy for the Plaintiff’s earning capacity.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 I have earlier identified several difficulties with the Plaintiff’s alternative computation method (see [121]–[127] above). These centred on the fact that start-ups are relatively unstable and unprofitable in their early years. The Plaintiff was clearly aware of this, and therefore could not have realistically expected to earn $6,300 per month from the moment that she joined RXP. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 These difficulties remain valid even in the context of determining the appropriate award for loss of earning capacity. However, I am mindful that in adopting a “rough and ready approach” approach, the question is simply whether the award is reasonable in the circumstances. In my view, the Plaintiff’s alternative computation method leads to an award that is, overall, reasonable in the circumstances. Although RXP started off small and was not so profitable, it grew more profitable over time. The numbers speak for themselves. In 2011, RXP had a net loss of $47,946.84. By the next year, RXP began turning a profit – net profit for 2012 was $61,520.53, peaked at $122,367.83 in 2013 and fell back to $76,587.98 in 2014. Correspondingly, the Plaintiff’s monthly earnings increased from around $360 in 2011 to around $1,400 in 2012, peaked at around $5,000 in 2013, and fell to around $3,200 in 2014.

I have little doubt that the Plaintiff, if unencumbered by the accident and the resulting injuries, would have developed RXP and RXPPL to such a level that her earnings would have been at least as much as her last-drawn salary at JWT. In other words, although she might have made less than $6,300 per month in her early days at RXP, I am satisfied that she would have <span class="font-italic">eventually</span> started to draw $6,300 or more per month. Further, given the significant improvement in RXP’s and RXPPL’s performance over 2011 to 2017 (bearing in mind that both the Plaintiff and Wong had been involved in the accident), it did not seem implausible that this could have been achieved by 2017.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 The court must endeavour to find the appropriate figure which the Plaintiff should receive in compensation.

While I can accept that it is difficult to accurately quantify future losses, it seems to me that the evidence in this particular case is simply too inadequate. I have already pointed out some significant problems with the Plaintiff’s Forecasts (see [102] and [107]–[108] above). These include the fact that the forecast figure for 2014 is not supported by primary evidence, and that certain key assumptions used in the Forecasts were not adequately justified. I also agree that with the defendants that there is no apparent basis for applying the five years figure. I therefore decline to award the Plaintiff her claim of $585,000 for loss of future earnings. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Loss of earning capacity</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 This brings me to the Plaintiff’s alternative claim for loss of earning capacity.

The difficulty lies in the quantification.

The inquiry into quantum must necessarily be specific to the facts of each case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">160 As mentioned at [85] above, the Plaintiff’s business development role in RXP and RXPPL requires her to travel frequently within Singapore to meet existing and potential clients, and to conduct various demonstrations and presentations.

However, it remains unclear exactly how much this will affect the effectiveness of her training courses and correspondingly, the Plaintiff’s earnings. There was, for instance, no indication of how frequently such training courses were conducted and how much revenue these training courses generated. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">167  The Plaintiff made one other argument.

</div> I have agreed with the Plaintiff that she will be required to undergo some medical procedures to treat her right ankle pain (see [33] above). I also agree that having to undergo these medical procedures will result in further downtime for the Plaintiff. But again it is unclear how much of an impact this will have on the Plaintiff’s earnings. It seems to me that these three medical procedures will likely only have an impact on a fraction of the entire remaining span of the Plaintiff’s working life. I am therefore of the view that any adverse impact on the Plaintiff’s future earning capacity would be somewhat limited. At the end of the day, based on the medical opinion of the Plaintiff’s own expert, Dr Chang, the Plaintiff “should be able to continue to work in her firm in the future”.
