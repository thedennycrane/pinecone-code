</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The defendants (collectively referred to as “Bumi”) intended to make a bid for the Project through the first defendant, Bumi Armada Offshore Holdings Limited (“BAOHL”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the second defendant, Bumi Armada Berhad (“BAB”). They invited the plaintiff, then known as Tozzi Industries SpA (“Tozzi”), to support their bid given its expertise in gas processing facilities. Both parties formalised their working relationship in a Pre-Bid Agreement (“the PBA”). Tozzi’s role in the PBA concerned the supply of some or all of the Topside Process Modules. Central to the PBA was the requirement for Tozzi to work exclusively with Bumi in respect of the bid for the Project. In exchange, Bumi granted Tozzi a right of first refusal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 Although the PBA was only valid for one year, both parties continued to work together on the bid notwithstanding the expiry of the PBA. Eventually when the expiry date was raised, both parties met to discuss and decided to continue the relationship on terms which were recorded in the Minutes of Meeting (“the 1 August MOM”). Crucially, although the 1 August MOM recognised Tozzi’s right of first refusal, it also expressly stated that it was “subject always to successful negotiation and mutual agreement and execution of a formal contract”.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 After BAOHL was awarded the contract for the Project, BAB’s Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) stated that it would not favour any bidder for the subcontract to supply the Topside Process Modules, thereby implicitly denying that Tozzi had any right of first refusal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 As it turned out, BAOHL eventually awarded the subcontract for part of the Topside Process Modules to another party without first extending the right of first refusal to Tozzi. This led to the commencement of the present proceedings. Although several causes of action were pleaded to ground Tozzi’s claim – breach of express contract, variation, estoppel, waiver and implied contract – ultimately they essentially advance the same claim which is premised on Tozzi’s right of first refusal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 Tozzi called only one witness – Mr Stefano Schiavo, who was intimately involved throughout the period in the lead up to Bumi’s bid for the Project. On the other hand, although Bumi was represented by many senior members of its management in the course of preparing the bid, none of them was offered as a witness for the trial. Instead, its sole witness was its in-house legal counsel, Ms Johana Rosli, who had no personal knowledge whatsoever of the events which led to the proceedings. In fact, she only joined Bumi <span class="font-italic">after</span> the dispute had arisen. For all intents and purposes, Bumi’s defence is akin to a submission of no case to answer. Its principal defence is that the right of first refusal had no contractual force on the basis that it had either expired with the PBA or was in any event “subject to contract” in the 1 August MOM. This judgment will examine the legal effect of the “subject to contract” provision in the 1 August MOM, in particular whether it was intended to qualify the right of first refusal stated therein <span class="font-italic">or</span> the contract which the parties would have negotiated if the right of first refusal had been extended by Bumi and accepted by Tozzi.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 In the second quarter of 2012, Husky-CNOOC Madura Limited (“Husky”) invited BAOHL, amongst other qualified companies, to submit a bid for the Project. Bumi invited Tozzi in April 2012 to submit a proposal for engineering, procurement and construction/fabrication (“EPC”) services for two of the Topside Process Modules.

</div> There were seven Topside Process Modules in total. Tozzi submitted its first unpriced proposal for the supply of those two modules on 1 June 2012. Between September 2012 and February 2013, Tozzi and Bumi discussed working together to prepare a technically compliant and commercially competitive bid to Husky. An issue that arose early on was the number of modules that Tozzi was to supply or design so as to enable it to guarantee, as Bumi desired, that the operation of the whole Topside Process would be in accordance with the specifications in the tender documents.

These proposals required substantial engineering work and were markedly different from the designs described in the Project’s tender documents.

For example, Tozzi was to provide details of the manpower available to perform the FEED works in Kuala Lumpur; the power generation and flare system “can be considered for supply by Tozzi”; and options for vendors for the detailed engineering works were proposed by both sides for further consideration. The last paragraph of the 1 August MOM contained what seems to be a “subject to contract” provision:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Both BA and Tozzi agree that these minutes of meeting dated 1st August 2014 constitutes an understanding of the discussions, which took place on 31st July 2014 and is <span class="font-italic">subject always to successful negotiation and mutual agreement and execution of a formal contract.</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 Following from the 31 July Meeting, the parties signed a contract on 26 September 2014 for Tozzi to perform the FEED works.

The RFQ invited proposals from qualified vendors for the supply of all seven Topside Process Modules.

As agreed, Tozzi was to submit a revised price proposal only after the completion of the FEED. It was only if this price was unacceptable that Bumi would source for quotes in the market, but offer Tozzi a right of first refusal. Nonetheless, apparently due to Bumi’s assurance that the RFQ would not prejudice Tozzi’s right of first refusal, Tozzi submitted a bid to supply the Topside Process Modules on 12 January 2015.

</div>
</div> This prompted the present suit.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Was Tozzi entitled to a right of first refusal?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Tozzi’s primary case is that Tozzi and BAOHL reached a binding agreement to extend a right of first refusal to Tozzi at the 31 July Meeting. This right of first refusal extended not only to the TI Packages but all seven Topside Process Modules. The “subject to contract” provision in the 1 August MOM did not qualify the right of first refusal but was intended to qualify the contract for the EPC supply of the Topside Process Modules or FEED works. However, if the “subject to contract” provision did in fact preclude an agreement for a right of first refusal, Tozzi contends that BAOHL is estopped by its subsequent conduct from relying on this provision. To be clear, Tozzi identifies BAOHL as the contractual counterparty because the 1 August MOM was signed by Mr Abela on BAOHL’s behalf (see [13] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Alternatively, Tozzi grounds its right of first refusal on the PBA, on the premise that BAOHL is prevented from relying on the expiry of the PBA by waiver or estoppel. If so, Tozzi would be entitled to a right of first refusal in respect of either the TI Packages only (under the PBA’s original terms) or all seven Topside Process Modules (if the PBA was varied to this effect at the 31 July Meeting). Tozzi’s final alternative argument was that it had a right of first refusal under an implied contract commencing 6 February 2014, on the same terms as the PBA save that the implied contract was terminable on reasonable notice. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 Bumi contends that, considering the 1 August MOM in its entirety, no agreement was reached at the 31 July Meeting. The matters discussed either did not give rise to contractual rights and obligations or were too uncertain to constitute a binding contract. Further, the last paragraph of the 1 August MOM expressly rendered all matters discussed “subject to contract”. This demonstrates the parties’ intent to defer legal relations and qualifies the possibility of reading paragraph 5 as a standalone right. Bumi relied on <span class="font-italic">Norwest Holdings Pte Ltd </span><span class="font-italic">(in liquidation) v Newport Mining Ltd and another appeal </span>[2011] 4 SLR 617 (“<span class="font-italic">Norwest</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>for the proposition that the phrase “subject to contract” makes clear that even if the parties agree on all essential terms, neither party intends to be contractually bound until a contract is signed, unless there is strong and exceptional evidence to the contrary (at [23] and [29]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Since Bumi submits that the 1 August MOM must be construed as a whole, we set out its text in full here:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">1. BA informed Tozzi that the draft LOA is under review/discussion, the project will kick off … by 1st September 2014 and the overall project schedule will be approx. 28 months.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">2. BA would like to do a revalidation of the FEED and improve the quality of Technip FEED. The extended FEED will be done in Kuala Lumpur (“KL”) and will last for about 4 months. All the key deliverables will be identified and detailed out, including HAZOP and “case for Safety” workshops.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">3. BA informed in view of H2S presence and sulphur handling, the Rainbow I will be maintained as donor vessel.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">4. BA offered Tozzi to be value chain partner starting this project and asked them to undertake extended FEED by providing qualified high calibre manpower in KL. BA will reimburse extended FEED manhour cost to Tozzi. Tozzi to provide hourly rates, names, CV’s of the people for BA approval. Expected number of people required from Tozzi is up to 20. Draftsman and designers will be arranged locally by BA. BA people will participate and supervise the extended FEED in KL.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">5. Tozzi will review their earlier price and confirm within 3 weeks for entire topsides. They will list assumptions made in confirmation [of] price. At the conclusion of FEED, Tozzi will adjust the price for assumptions. If adjusted price is acceptable to BA, Tozzi will be awarded the work. In case this is not, BA will go out for a price check and offer first right of refusal to Tozzi for lowest price alternative offer.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">6. Tozzi will be free to fabricate some modules (gas modules) in Italy. For other modules, Tozzi will use either SMOF or Dynamac to build in Singapore, Batam or Johor. Keppel Shipyard Limited will undertake the hull and marine conversion work.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">7. Power generation and flare system i.e. flare stack, KODs modules will be done by BA. E-house, though not part of Topsides, can be considered for supply by Tozzi. Tozzi will arrange for BA technical team visit to Bukit Tua/ other places in Indonesia where their supplied E-House/ electrical gears are in operation.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">8. Tozzi price will include license for use of any technology for sulphur block, performance guarantees and extra warrantees [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] as required, first fill supply of catalysts, etc.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">9. Tozzi proposed to use Sidwin, India for detailed engineering. BA suggested that they use Oiltech if resources are available (BA/KC to check internally with Jay/Paul). Tozzi to revert on the proposal.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">10. Liquid molten sulphur will be the way forward. It will be stored in container cars on the FPSO which will be off loaded to supply boats. Heating of containers to be investigated (something similar to Bitumen cars). Containers will be stored in hull of FPSO with required provisions of venting, gas detection etc and open hatch for loading/offloading. Molten sulphur storage, handling and disposal to be worked out in detail and agreed with HCML.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Both BA and Tozzi agree that these minutes of meeting dated 1st August 2014 constitutes an understanding of the discussions, which took place on 31st July 2014 and is subject always to successful negotiation and mutual agreement and execution of a formal contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 We are of the view that Tozzi succeeds in its primary case. A contract was formed at the 31 July Meeting for Tozzi to be granted a right of first refusal in respect of all the Topside Process Modules. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 To begin, the right of first refusal is, in our view, a standalone right. In other words, the agreement concerning it was independent of the other matters discussed at the 31 July Meeting. The content of a right of first refusal was helpfully clarified in <span class="font-italic">Astrazeneca UK Ltd v Albemarle International Corp</span><span class="font-italic">oration and another </span>[2011] EWHC 1574 (“<span class="font-italic">Astrazeneca UK</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [35] and [44]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [A]s an irreducible minimum, a right of “first refusal” by its nature confers a right to obtain the subject matter of the right, whether it is land or another asset or a service or a business opportunity to enter a contract. In other words, it confers <span class="font-italic">a right </span><span class="font-italic">to be given an opportunity to match any third party offer which the grantor of the right might be otherwise minded to accept, and, in the event that the grantee matches the offer, to be awarded the business </span>to which the offer relates. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [A] right of first refusal constitutes a right to receive a contractual offer on terms which the party who has granted the right of first refusal is prepared to accept, <span class="font-italic">even though the detailed terms of any contract may require further negotiation</span> and might ultimately not eventuate in a contract at all. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 It is evident from the text of both the 1 August MOM and Mr Schiavo’s minutes in his email to Bumi on the same day that the parties agreed to grant Tozzi a right on these terms (see [12]–[13] above) and in consideration for this promised right, Tozzi agreed to undertake the FEED works. It is clear to us that if Tozzi had not been granted the right of first refusal for the EPC supply of the Topside Process Modules, it would not have agreed to undertake the FEED works as it had repeatedly reiterated its reluctance to do those works (see [14] above). Importantly, the right of first refusal was necessarily independent of and anterior to a subcontract for the EPC supply of the Topside Process Modules. It is a right that concerns the <span class="font-italic">process</span> by which Tozzi would be offered a contract, rather than the <span class="font-italic">substantive</span> terms of the contract that would be offered. It is true that there were numerous matters raised at the 31 July Meeting that required further deliberation. However, the details that had to be worked out pertained to the EPC subcontract and FEED contract that the parties envisaged. The fact that the precise terms of those contracts were still open to negotiation does not preclude the <span class="font-italic">independent</span> right of first refusal from having contractual effect. Indeed, in oral closing submissions, Bumi’s counsel accepted that there was nothing more to negotiate in respect of the right of first refusal.

</div>
</div> This was, in our judgment, a clear concession by counsel that Bumi’s agreement to grant the right of first refusal to Tozzi had attained the requisite certainty for contractual formation in the minds of the parties, who were <span class="font-italic">ad</span><span class="font-italic"> idem </span>as to the nature and content of that right. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Further, the context of the 31 July Meeting must be considered. Mr Basma urgently called the 31 July Meeting because Bumi anticipated the letter of award from Husky to be finalised on 1 September 2014. Given the Project’s timelines, there was no time for delay once the award was issued. It is entirely unrealistic to suggest that the parties envisaged engaging in further negotiations on the right of first refusal when that right was only to be exercisable during the process of awarding the subcontract, which was likely to occur soon.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 It is, moreover, telling that the parties’ correspondence after 31 July 2014 was replete with references to an “agreement” without any suggestion as to a need to negotiate further or formalise the agreement granting the right of first refusal in a written contract:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) On 15 August 2014, Mr Schiavo emailed Mr Gupta a revised version of Tozzi’s technical proposal and stated that “<span class="font-italic">as per agreement</span> between the companies, [Tozzi] will confirm … the price” [emphasis added] indicated in its earlier December 2012 price proposals by the end of August.

</div> This was a reference to the agreement made at the 31 July Meeting. Bumi highlighted that Tozzi failed to delete generic terms in Bumi’s RFQ form which were inconsistent with its alleged right of first refusal. In addition, Tozzi submitted bids in February and April 2015 even after the scope of the RFQ was narrowed to the TI Packages and after Mr van de Korput clearly conveyed on 1 March 2015 that Bumi did not intend to favour any bidders. It was suggested that by doing so, Tozzi acknowledged that the EPC contract was subject to competitive bidding and agreed to bid for only the TI Packages. Mr Schiavo flatly rejected these suggestions.

Tozzi also reserved its right over all the Topside Process Modules by proposing pricing for the remaining four modules as “provisional extra scope of work”.

It does not prevent a legally binding agreement to grant a right of first refusal from arising.

</div> We disagree. On the face of the 1 August MOM and Mr Schiavo’s minutes, Tozzi’s right of first refusal applied to the “entire topsides” or “all the process topsides”. In our judgment, it is sufficiently clear that the right was exercisable with respect to the scope of work that Tozzi was to submit a revised proposal for – <span class="font-italic">ie, </span>all the Topside Process Modules. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Since Tozzi succeeds in its primary case, it is unnecessary to deal with its alternative arguments. Even if Tozzi succeeds in its argument that the expiry of the PBA was waived, the right of first refusal in the PBA extended only to the TI Packages; to benefit from a right of first refusal over the full Topside Process Modules, Tozzi would still have to establish the contractual effect of the events at the 31 July Meeting. Similarly, even if a contract could be implied by conduct following the expiry of the PBA on 5 February 2014, it would, in Mr Schiavo’s words, be “superseded” by the agreement reached on 31 July 2014.

The evidence showed that VME was awarded the subcontract for the TI Packages. Tozzi was not given an opportunity to match VME’s offer before a purchase order was issued to VME. This was a clear breach, as explained in <span class="font-italic">Astrazeneca</span> at [51]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [W]here what has occurred … is that the grantor of the right of first refusal has received an offer from a third party the terms of which it is minded to accept, what is required to comply with the obligation to grant a right of first refusal is that the grantee be afforded the opportunity to match that offer. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The remaining question is whether the breach was established in respect of the remaining four modules given that the revised RFQ in January 2015 covered only the TI Packages. Bumi accepted that as Husky’s main contractor for the Project, BAOHL provided all seven Topside Process Modules. Yet Tozzi was not offered a right of first refusal for any of the seven modules. In our view, the burden lies on Bumi to show that the remaining four modules were not subcontracted to another third party but were supplied in-house by Bumi themselves. If this could be shown, there would be no third party offer that BAOHL were obliged to grant Tozzi an opportunity to match. However, Bumi did not adduce any evidence as to who supplied the remaining four modules. We are therefore led to the conclusion that BAOHL acted in breach of the agreement to grant Tozzi the right of first refusal to supply the Topside Process Modules, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, all seven modules. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Did BAB induce BAOHL to breach the right of first refusal?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 The final issue is whether BAB induced BAOHL to breach the right of first refusal.

</div> While we have found that the right of first refusal was indeed a standalone agreement which is enforceable in its own right, it does not follow that it was unrelated to the PBA. After all the right of first refusal owes its genesis to the PBA and on the cusp of Husky’s award, the 31 July Meeting was convened precisely to discuss the parties’ continued relationship despite the expiry of the PBA, in particular the right of first refusal. Hence we find that the pleading against BAB is sufficient to encompass inducement of a breach of the right of first refusal as a standalone agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 To establish that BAB induced BAOHL to breach the right of first refusal, Tozzi must show that BAB (a) acted with the requisite knowledge of the existence of the contract (although knowledge of the precise terms is unnecessary); and (b) intended to interfere with Tozzi’s contractual rights, with such intention to be objectively ascertained (<span class="font-italic">Tribune Investment Trust Inc v Soosan Trading Co Ltd </span>[2000] 2 SLR(R) 407 at [17]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Tozzi argues that BAB knew of the precise terms of the agreement between Tozzi and BAOHL, which was negotiated by BAB’s employees. It was Mr van de Korput, BAB’s CEO, who expressly denied Tozzi’s right of first refusal on 1 March 2015 after having been copied in emails where the right of first refusal was previously raised.

The observations quoted above were made in response to this contention that the subsidiary was a mere puppet despite having acted through <span class="font-italic">its own directors and employees</span>, and not those of the parent company. In contrast, the parent company here, BAB, is not liable merely by virtue of the fact that BAOHL is its wholly-owned subsidiary. It is undisputed that BAOHL does not have any employees of its own.

</div> Mr Schiavo gave unchallenged evidence that Tozzi only corresponded with BAB’s employees and executives.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Bumi also relies on the decision of the New South Wales Supreme Court in <span class="font-italic">Australian Development Corporation Pty </span><span class="font-italic">Ltd v White Constructions (Act) Pty Ltd &amp; Ors </span>(unreported) (“<span class="font-italic">ADC</span>”) to show that it is insufficient that BAOHL has no employees of its own. The parent company was sued for inducing its wholly-owned subsidiary to breach an undertaking given by the subsidiary to the plaintiff to carry out a construction project diligently. The subsidiary’s breach consisted partly in dismissing and standing down certain workers during an industrial dispute. The plaintiff submitted that the parent company induced the breach because the subsidiary had no employees at the relevant level to make the decision to dismiss and stand down workers, such that in reality it was the parent company that made that decision. The court rejected this submission, finding instead that the relevant employees of the parent company were acting in their capacity as the subsidiary’s executives or representatives; as such, it remained the subsidiary that made the decision, albeit by or with the involvement of persons employed by the parent company. The court explained (at p 47):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">All of Messrs Bendeich, Houlahan and Hitchings [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the persons who made the decision to carry out the breach in question] were employed by [the parent company], [the subsidiary] had no employees of its own at their level, and hence [the plaintiff] submitted that it should be found that in reality the decision was made by [the parent company] and that it followed that [the parent company] induced [the subsidiary’s] breach of contract. There was some debate over the second aspect of this submission: is there a difference between A inducing B to breach B’s contract and A acting for B in breaching B’s contact [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>]? But in my opinion the first aspect of the submission should not be accepted. <span class="font-italic">Mr Bendeich had been appointed acting project manager for the project, and if he were to be regarded as a decision- maker (which I doubt)</span> <span class="font-italic">he was acting on behalf of [the subsidiary], which he represented for all purposes within his authority.</span> Although Mr Houlahan was employed by [the parent company], he had been appointed Building Manager of [the subsidiary] … and <span class="font-italic">acted in his capacity of an executive of [the subsidiary]</span>. When Mr Hitchings concurred in the decision he also was <span class="font-italic">acting on behalf of [the subsidiary]</span>, because by the chain of command he was responsible for [the subsidiary’s] project at the Quadrant site and the superior of the relevant executive of [the subsidiary]. <span class="font-italic">[The sub</span><span class="font-italic">sidiary] made the decision, albeit by or with the involvement of persons employed by [the parent company]. </span>[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Again, there are crucial distinguishing facts here. In <span class="font-italic">ADC</span>, the subsidiary did not have employees of the relevant level of seniority but the parent company had appointed its employees as project manager and other roles in the chain of command for the subsidiary’s project. As such, when making the relevant decisions, they were regarded as acting <span class="font-italic">on behalf of the subsidi</span><span class="font-italic">ary</span> and not the parent company. In the case before us, Bumi made the point in oral closing submissions that BAB’s employees and executives were similarly acting on BAOHL’s behalf only. Mr Gupta, an employee of BAB, was appointed the project manager for the Project undertaken by BAOHL. It was BAOHL that was awarded the contract by Husky and tendered out the subcontracts.

<div id="divCaseSummary">
<p><strong>21 September 2017</strong> <br/> <br/> <strong>Media Summary</strong> <br/> <br/> <strong>Singapore International Commercial Court Suit No 6 of 2016 <br/> Tozzi Srl (formerly known as Tozzi Industries SpA) v Bumi Armada <br/>Offshore Holdings Ltd and another [2017] SGHC(I) 8</strong> <br/> ______________________________________________________________________________<br/> <br/> 1             This dispute can be traced to a project for the supply of facilities and services in relation to the development of the Madura BD Gas and Condensate Field in Indonesia (“the Project”). The Project included the construction and lease of a Floating Production, Storage and Offloading unit, of which an integral part was the gas processing facilities (“the Topside Process Modules”). The defendants intended to make a bid for the Project and invited the plaintiff to support their bid given its expertise in gas processing facilities. <br/> <br/> 2             Both parties formalised their working relationship in preparation for the bid in a Pre-Bid Agreement (“PBA”) under which the plaintiff was required to work exclusively with the defendants in respect of the bid for the Project. In exchange, the defendants granted the plaintiff a right of first refusal for the subcontract to provide engineering, procurement and construction/fabrication (“EPC”) services for three of the seven Topside Process Modules known as the “TI Packages”. As the Court explained in its judgment, a right of first refusal confers a right to be given an opportunity to match any third party offer which the grantor of the right might otherwise be minded to accept, and, in the event that the grantee matches the offer, to be awarded the business to which the offer relates. Although the PBA was valid for one year and expired on 5 February 2014, both parties continued to work together on the bid after the PBA’s expiry. <br/> <br/> 3             On 31 July 2014, the parties held an urgent meeting (“the 31 July Meeting”), in anticipation that the Project would be formally awarded to the defendants on 1 September 2014. The plaintiff contended that at the 31 July 2 Meeting, an agreement was reached to grant it a right of first refusal to supply all seven Topside Process Modules. The minutes of meeting (“the MOM”) were recorded in writing and signed by representatives of the plaintiff and the first defendant. <br/> <br/> 4             The defendants were awarded the bid for the Project on 8 August 2014. Between November 2014 and February 2015, the defendants invited proposals from qualified vendors for the supply of, initially, all seven Topside Process Modules and later, only the TI Packages. On 1 March 2015, the second defendant’s Chief Executive Officer informed the plaintiff that it would not favour any bidder for the subcontract to supply the Topside Process Modules, thereby implicitly denying that the plaintiff was entitled to any right of first refusal. Eventually, the first defendant awarded the subcontract for the TI Packages to a third party. The plaintiff was not informed of the price offered by this third party or given an opportunity to exercise a right of first refusal. <br/> <br/> 5             The plaintiff’s primary case was that the plaintiff and the first defendant reached a binding agreement at the 31 July Meeting to extend a right of first refusal over all seven Topside Process Modules to the plaintiff. The plaintiff argued that this agreement was breached by the first defendant, whose breach was induced by the second defendant, its parent company. The defence was that no agreement was reached at the 31 July Meeting because the matters discussed either did not give rise to contractual rights and obligations or were too uncertain to constitute a binding contract. Further, the last paragraph of the MOM expressly rendered all matters discussed “subject to contract”. <br/> <br/> 6             In its judgment, the Court found that a contract was formed at the 31 July Meeting for the plaintiff to be granted a right of first refusal in respect of all the Topside Process Modules. It was evident from the MOM that the parties agreed to grant the plaintiff a right of first refusal and, in consideration for this promised right, the plaintiff agreed to undertake the Front End Engineering and Design (“FEED”) works which it was otherwise reluctant to undertake. While 3 the details of the EPC subcontract and FEED contract required further deliberation, the right of first refusal – which concerned the process by which the plaintiff would be offered the EPC subcontract rather than the substantive terms of the subcontract that would be offered – was sufficiently certain. The context of the 31 July Meeting made it entirely unrealistic to suggest that the parties envisaged engaging in further negotiations on the right of first refusal. The parties’ correspondence after 31 July 2014 was replete with references to an “agreement” without any suggestion as to the need to negotiate further or formalise the agreement granting the right of first refusal in a written contract. Thus the “subject to contract” provision in the MOM was only intended to defer legal relations in respect of the EPC works and FEED works. <br/> <br/> 7             The Court was satisfied that the first defendant breached the agreement to grant the plaintiff a right of first refusal, in respect of all seven Topside Process Modules. The subcontract for the TI Packages was awarded to a third party without the plaintiff being given an opportunity to match the third party’s offer. For the remaining four modules, the defendants did not adduce evidence that these modules were supplied in-house by the defendants such that there was no third party offer that the first defendant was obliged to grant the plaintiff an opportunity to match. <br/> <br/> 8             Finally, the Court found the second defendant liable in tort for inducing the first defendant, its wholly-owned subsidiary, to breach the right of first refusal. The first defendant had no operational independence as it had no employees of its own and was completely controlled by the second defendant. <br/> <br/> 9             Accordingly, the Court granted the plaintiff’s claim against both defendants with damages to be assessed in the next tranche. <br/> <br/> <em>This summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the Court’s judgment. It is not intended to be a substitute for the reasons of the Court.</em></p>
