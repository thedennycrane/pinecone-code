<p class="Judg-Author">
        Andrew Phang Boon Leong JA (delivering the judgment of the
                court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an appeal against the decision of the
                    trial judge (“the Judge”), who dismissed the claim of Animal
                    Concerns Research &amp; Education Society (“the Appellant”) in the
                    tort of negligence against Tan Boon Kwee (“the Respondent”), in
                    the latter’s capacity as clerk of works (see <em>Animal
                        Concerns Research &amp; Education Society v ANA Contractor Pte Ltd
                        and another</em> [2010] SGHC 85 (“the
                    Judgment”)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Despite the fact that the position of a clerk of
                    works (now known as a “resident technical officer” (see
                    regulation 2(e) of the Building Control (Amendment No 2) Regulations
                    2007 (S 495/2007) (“the 2007 Regulations”)) and one of two
                    species of “site supervisor” (the other being a “resident
                    engineer”) (see regulation 24(2) of the Building Control Regulations
                    2003) (S 666/2003) (“the 2003 Regulations”)) is mandated by
                    ss 7 and 10 of the Building Control Act (Cap 29,
                    1999 Rev Ed) (“the Act”), this appears to be the first
                    time this role has arisen for consideration in the Singapore
                courts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Notwithstanding the change in terminology under
                    the 2007 Regulations, the term “clerk of works” (rather than
                    the term “residential technical officer”) will continue to be used
                    throughout this judgment. The use of the term “clerk of works” is
                    also more appropriate in the context of the actual facts of the present
                    proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background facts and the decision below</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Background facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The Appellant is an Institution of Public
                    Character under the Charities Act (Cap 37, 2007 Rev Ed), while
                    the Respondent was and continues to remain a director of A.n.A Contractor Pte
                    Ltd (“A.n.A”), the first defendant in the trial
                below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The Appellant had planned to establish a shelter
                    (“the shelter”) for animals on a plot of land along Jalan Lekar
                    (“the site”) leased from the Singapore Land Authority
                    (“SLA”), and appointed A.n.A as the contractor for the project.
                    A.n.A in turn appointed the Respondent as the clerk of works/site supervisor for
                    the project (who was to be employed by A.n.A, rather than by the Appellant).
                    A.n.A also appointed two qualified persons (“QPs”), a qualified
                    architect (“QA”) and a qualified engineer (“QE”), as
                    the QPs for the architectural works and supervision of structural works,
                    respectively, under s 11(1)(<em>d</em>)(ii) of the
                    Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The project, however, was beset by a number of
                    problems, which led to the Appellant suing A.n.A for breach of contract (and
                    negligence) in the proceedings below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Firstly, there was considerable delay in the
                    execution of the project. Secondly, the Appellant alleged that A.n.A had failed
                    to construct the shelter in accordance with the specified building plans.
                    Finally, it transpired that, in the course of levelling the site, wood chips had
                    been used as landfill, resulting in a foul smell and a discharge of blackish
                    effluence from the site. This came to the attention of the SLA and the National
                    Environment Agency (“NEA”), which considered that it amounted to
                    pollution of the surrounding environment and contamination of Kranji Reservoir.
                    As a result, the Appellant is obliged to excavate the rear portion of the site
                    and reconstruct the animal enclosures located there before work at the shelter
                    can begin in earnest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       In addition to its claims against A.n.A, the
                    Appellant also sued the Respondent in his capacity as clerk of works of the
                    project, alleging that he had negligently failed to supervise the levelling of
                    the site and, in particular, failed to ensure that wood chips were suitable
                    landfill material.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The decision below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The Judge found that, as the land at the site
                    was not level, A.n.A was under a contractual duty to level it (see the Judgment
                    at <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a>). A.n.A did so by raising the
                    lower-lying areas of the site in a process known as “backfilling”,
                        <em>ie</em>, bringing in earth from elsewhere to raise
                    the lower regions (see the Judgment at <a href="#p1_17">[17]</a>). A.n.A contracted with an entity known as Lok Sheng
                    Enterprises (“Lok Sheng”) to bring in wet soil and wood chips as
                    backfill material for this purpose.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The Judge found, based on expert evidence
                    adduced by the Appellant, that the wood chips A.n.A had caused to be used as
                    backfill material were the cause of the pollution and contamination (see the
                    Judgment at [28]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The Judge held that the Appellant had proved
                    its claims against A.n.A for breach of contract in respect of the delay, the
                    failure to comply with the building plans, and the use of wood chips (see the
                    Judgment at [34]–[35]). He considered that it was therefore unnecessary
                    for the Appellant to have proceeded against A.n.A in negligence. There is no
                    appeal against this portion of the Judge’s decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     However, the Judge dismissed the
                    Appellant’s action in negligence against the Respondent, on the basis that
                    s 10(5) of the Act did not impose a duty on the Respondent to supervise the
                    backfilling (see the Judgment at [39]). Section 10(5) of the Act provides
                    as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(5)    Every site
                            supervisor appointed under this section in respect of any building works
                            shall take all reasonable steps and exercise due diligence in giving
                            –</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>a</em>)    in the case of
                                large building works – full-time supervision to the carrying
                                out of the structural elements of the building works;
                            and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>b</em>)    in the case of
                                small-scale building works – immediate supervision to the
                                carrying out of the critical structural elements of the building
                                works,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">to ensure that the structural elements or critical structural elements, as
                        the case may be, of the building works in question are carried out in
                        accordance with the plans of the building works supplied to him in
                        accordance with section 9(1)(<em>c</em>) by a qualified
                        person, and with any terms and conditions imposed by the Commissioner of
                        Building Control.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">There was no dispute that the project works were “small-scale
                    building works” for the purposes of the Act. However, in the
                    Judge’s view, s 10(5)(<em>b</em>) of the Act
                    only obliges a site supervisor (including a clerk of works) to supervise the
                    carrying out of “critical structural elements” of small-scale
                    building works, and, according to s 2 of the Act, “structural
                    elements” were “parts or elements of a building” (see the
                    Judgment at [37]). Since earthworks (including backfilling) were not parts or
                    elements of a building, much less “critical structural elements”,
                    the Judge held that the Respondent was not obliged to supervise the
                    backfilling.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     In addition, the Judge considered that, even
                    if the backfill could be considered a “critical structural
                    element” for the purposes of s 10(5)(<em>b</em>), a clerk of works’ obligation under s 10(5) of the Act
                    was merely to ensure that such elements were carried out “in accordance
                    with the plans of the building works… and with any terms and conditions
                    imposed by the Commissioner of Building Control”. On the facts, however,
                    there was no evidence that the building plans specified a particular material to
                    be used as backfill, or that the Commissioner of Building Control had imposed
                    any terms and conditions relating to the backfill.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The Appellant appeals against this portion of
                    the Judge’s decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Arguments on appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Appellant’s arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The Appellant submits that, on its true
                    construction, s 10(5) of the Act does impose a duty of care on the
                    Respondent. The Appellant points out that s 2 of the Act includes
                    “foundations” and “all other elements designed to resist
                    forces and moments” within the definition of “structural
                    elements”. Under regulation 2 of the 2003 Regulations,
                    “foundation” means:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">that part of a construction immediately below the footings of a building,
                        which is in direct contact with, and through which the weight of a building
                        is transmitted to, the ground, and includes piling works …</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The backfill, the Appellant argues, falls within the definition of
                    “foundation” in the 2003 Regulations. Further, according to the
                    testimony of the Appellant’s expert witness, the backfill “wholly
                    supports the weight of the structures built at the back of the [s]ite”
                    and is “one of the critical factors that would affect the structural
                    stability of the structures built on the [s]ite”. As such, the Appellant
                    submits, the backfill is a “structural element” within the meaning
                    of s 2 of the Act, as it is both a “foundation” as well as an
                    element which resists forces and moments, and, given its crucial significance,
                    is therefore a “critical structural element” of the building
                    works. Consequently, according to the Appellant, the Respondent was obliged,
                    under s 10(5)(<em>b</em>) of the Act, to take all
                    reasonable steps and exercise due diligence in giving “immediate
                    supervision” to the carrying out of the backfilling to ensure that they
                    were carried out in accordance with the building plans, which the Respondent
                    failed to do.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In addition, the Appellant submits that the
                    Respondent owed it a common law duty of care to supervise the backfilling, and
                    to ensure that material used as backfill was suitable for its purpose. In this
                    regard, the Appellant submits that the test for the existence of a duty of care,
                    laid down by this court in <em>Spandeck Engineering (S) Pte Ltd v
                        Defence Science &amp; Technology Agency</em> [2007]
                    4 SLR(R) 100 (“<em>Spandeck</em>”),
                    is satisfied on the facts of this appeal, and that the Respondent breached his
                    duty of care to the Appellant, which caused loss to the Appellant that was not
                    too remote.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Respondent’s arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The Respondent, unsurprisingly, submits that
                    the Judge’s construction of s 10(5) of the Act is the correct one,
                    and therefore that the Act did not impose the duty of care for which the
                    Appellant contends.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     In addition, the Respondent argues that the
                    Act is conclusive as to a clerk of works’ duties, and that there is no
                    reason to impose any common law duty of care above and beyond the statutory
                    duties prescribed by the Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Finally, the Respondent submits that, even if
                    a duty of care was owed to the Appellant, there had been no breach of this duty
                    by the Respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues on appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The issues which arise for our determination
                    in this appeal are as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether s 10(5)(<em>b</em>) of the Act, on its true construction, imposes a
                        duty on the Respondent to supervise the backfilling;</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Section 10(5)(<em>b</em>) of the
                Act</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Remedying a misconception</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     We should highlight at the outset that even if
                    the Appellant’s construction of s 10(5) of the Act is correct,
                    s 10(5) is, strictly speaking, not determinative of the Respondent’s
                    civil liability to the Appellant in an action for negligence, for it is trite
                    law that there is no common law tort of “careless performance of a
                    statutory duty” (see the House of Lords decision of <em>X (Minors) v Bedfordshire County Council</em> [1995]
                    2 AC 633 (“<em>X v
                        Bedfordshire CC</em>”) at 732–735).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     In other words, what the courts in this area
                    are looking for is still a duty of care at common law (see, for example, the
                    English Court of Appeal decision of <em>Connor v Surrey County
                        Council</em> [2010] 3 All ER 905 at [102]), <em>ie</em>, the statutory duty which a plaintiff alleges sounds
                    in negligence must have been previously held to give rise to a common law duty
                    of care, or must be so declared by the court adjudicating the matter, applying
                    the test in <em>Spandeck</em>. A statutory duty does not
                        <em>ipso facto</em> impose a concomitant duty of care
                    at common law. A statutory duty may, of course, form the backdrop to and inform
                    the existence (or lack thereof) of a common law duty of care (see, for example,
                        <em>X v Bedfordshire CC</em> at 739), but that
                    does not mean the statutory duty <em>per se</em> is a duty
                    of care, even if it is phrased (as here) in terms of requiring the taking of
                    “reasonable steps” and “due
                diligence”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Even if the Appellant’s construction of
                        s 10(5)(<em>b</em>) of the Act is correct,
                    therefore, the <em>mere existence</em> of a statutory duty
                    on the Respondent to supervise the backfilling is not sufficient to establish an
                    action in negligence at common law by the Appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Nevertheless, if there is indeed such a
                    statutory duty on the Respondent under s 10(5)(<em>b</em>) of the Act (as construed by the Appellant), and the
                    Respondent had breached such a duty, another possible cause of action that the
                    Appellant might have pursued against the Respondent would be one based on the
                    tort of breach of statutory duty. However, this alternative legal route does not
                    appear to have been adopted by the Appellant. Although s 10(5) of the Act
                    clearly imposes some sort of statutory duty on site supervisors, the Act only
                    states that breach of that duty will give rise to <em>criminal</em> liability under s 10(8) of the Act. As the Act is
                    completely silent on whether breach of s 10(5) also gives rise to <em>civil</em> liability, and, if so, whether such liability is
                    incurred to a private individual who has suffered loss as a result of the
                    breach, the success of a claim for breach of statutory duty would, in the main,
                    have depended on the construction of the Act in general and
                        s 10(5)(<em>b</em>) in particular, in order to
                    ascertain whether the Legislature impliedly intended to provide a right of civil
                    action to enforce the statutory duty (see the leading House of Lords decision of
                        <em>Cutler v Wandsworth Stadium Ltd</em>
                    [1949] AC 398 at 407 and 412).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The key precondition, however, to the validity
                    of an action for breach of statutory duty would have been the existence and
                    nature of the statutory duty contended for, <em>ie</em>,
                    the correctness of the Appellant’s construction of s 10(5)(<em>b</em>) of the Act, for the action would fail at the
                    threshold if the relevant facts did not even fall within the ambit of
                        s 10(5)(<em>b</em>) of the Act in the first place.
                    Indeed, this is precisely what the Judge found, and it is to that finding that
                    our attention now turns.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Our decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     We are of the view that the Judge’s
                    decision on the interpretation to be given to s 10(5)(<em>b</em>) of the Act is undoubtedly correct. The definition of
                    “structural elements” in s 2 of the Act clearly refers to
                    parts or elements of a <em>building</em>, and the
                    definition of “building” in s 2 (“any permanent or
                    temporary <em>building or structure</em>” [emphasis
                    added]) contemplates an artificial construct or edifice, and not the ground upon
                    which that construct or edifice rests.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Further, the only example of a
                    “building” given in s 2 of the Act which could come close to
                    covering the backfill in the context of the present proceedings is the term
                    “earth retaining or stabilising structure, whether permanent or
                    temporary” found in example (b). However, the term “earth
                    retaining structure” is, in turn, defined in s 2 of the Act as
                    “any structure, structural system or other means used to maintain the
                    shape of excavation <em>during … earth
                    filling</em>” [emphasis added], which suggests that earth filling
                        <em>per se</em> cannot be a building.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Hence, the backfill does not form part of the
                    “structural elements” of the building works, critical or
                    otherwise, and s 10(5)(<em>b</em>) of the Act
                    therefore imposed no statutory duty on the Respondent to supervise the carrying
                    out of the backfilling.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Common law duty of care</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     It follows from the discussion at <a href="#p1_21">[21]</a>-<a href="#p1_23">[23]</a> above, however, that the construction of
                        s 10(5)(<em>b</em>) of the Act is not
                    determinative of the issue of the Respondent’s common law duty of care,
                    and it is therefore necessary to determine whether, under the <em>Spandeck</em> test, the Respondent owes a duty of care to the
                    Appellant at common law. As this court observed in <em>Ngiam Kong
                        Seng and another v Lim Chiew Hock</em> [2008] 3 SLR(R) 674

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">20    The general position
                            in Singapore with respect to liability for negligence in cases of pure
                            economic loss and cases of physical damage has now been settled by the
                            recent decision of this court in Spandeck ([2] supra). Briefly stated,
                            the position in Singapore follows, in the main, the two-stage test laid
                            down by Lord Wilberforce in Anns v Merton London Borough Council
                            [1978] AC 728 (“Anns”), where the learned law
                            lord observed, as follows (at 751-752):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[I]n order to establish that a duty of care arises in a particular
                            situation, <em>it is not necessary to bring the facts of that situation
                            within those of previous situations in which a duty of care has been
                            held to exist</em>. Rather the question has to be approached in two stages.
                            First one has to ask whether, as between the alleged wrongdoer and the
                            person who has suffered damage there is a sufficient relationship of
                            proximity or neighbourhood such that, in the reasonable contemplation of
                            the former, carelessness on his part may be likely to cause damage to
                            the latter - in which case a prima facie duty of care arises. Secondly,
                            if the first question is answered affirmatively, it is necessary to
                            consider whether there are any considerations which ought to negative,
                            or to reduce or limit the scope of the duty or the class of persons to
                            whom it is owed or the damages to which a breach of it may give rise ...

                                have reached their conclusions in terms of proximity and/or

                            precedents, which determines the current limits of liability, would make
                            it easier for the later court to determine whether or not to extend its
                            limits. However, the absence of a factual precedent, which implies the
                            presence of a novel situation, should not preclude the court from
                            extending liability where it is just and fair to do so, taking into
                            account the relevant policy consideration against indeterminate
                            liability against a tortfeasor. <b><em>We would admit at

                                foreseeability. Indeed, we should point out that this is the test
                                applied in substance by many jurisdictions in the

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In a similar vein, the learned Chief Justice summarised the
                        applicable law in Singapore at the end of the judgment in <em>Spandeck</em> in the
                        following terms (at [115]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">To recapitulate: A <em>single</em> test to determine the existence of a duty of
                            care should be applied regardless of the nature of the damage caused
                            (<em>ie</em>, pure economic loss or physical damage). It could be that a more
                            restricted approach is preferable for cases of pure economic loss but
                            this is to be done within the confines of a single test. <b><em>This test is a two-stage test, comprising of, first,

                                foreseeability but since this is likely to be fulfilled in most
                                cases, we do not see the need to include this as part of

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In <em>Ngiam</em> itself,
                    the <em>Spandeck</em> test was extended to encompass
                    liability for psychiatric harm (thus confirming that it is, indeed, a <em>single</em> test for the existence of a duty of care that is
                    applicable across the board in the tort of negligence). In so far as the law in
                    other Commonwealth jurisdictions was concerned, the following observations were
                    made in <em>Ngiam</em> (at [105]–[107]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">105    It should also be noted that although the
                            two-stage test in <em>Anns</em> ([20] <em>supra</em>), which forms the basis of the test
                            laid down by this court in <em>Spandeck</em>, has not been followed in England,
                            the law in that particular jurisdiction continues (as this court noted
                            in <em>Spandeck</em> at [46]-[49]) to remain in a state of flux (see, for
                            example, the House of Lords decision of <em>Customs and Excise Commissioners

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">106    It is also interesting to note that the position
                            in Canada is similar to that presently applicable in Singapore, where
                            (as mentioned earlier at [98] above) a somewhat modified version of the
                            two-stage test in Anns has been adopted. In particular, whilst affirming
                            the two-stage test in Anns, the Canadian courts have considered both
                            reasonable foreseeability and proximity under the first stage (see, for
                            example, the Canadian Supreme Court decisions of <em>Cooper v Hobart</em> (2001)
                            206 DLR (4th) 193 at [30]-[31]; <em>Odhavji Estate v Woodhouse</em>

                            Centre v BD</em> (2007) 284 DLR (4th) 682 at [23]-[30]). This
                            approach is not necessarily at variance with that adopted in <em>Spandeck</em>,
                            for (as we explained above at [104]) the concept of reasonable
                            foreseeability is also an integral part of the process of ascertaining
                            whether there is sufficient (legal) proximity between the plaintiff and
                            the defendant, albeit on a preliminary (and factual)

                            in a state of flux (see generally Francis Trindade, Peter

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     It is interesting to note that the respective
                    situations in the various jurisdictions as summarised in <em>Ngiam</em> above have not – to the best of our knowledge
                    – changed substantially since then (see, for example,
                    W V H Rogers, <em>Winfield &amp; Jolowicz on Tort</em>
                    (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 18th Ed, 2010) (“<em>Winfield &amp; Jolowicz</em>”) at ch 5 (with

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Returning to the facts of the present appeal,
                    as noted above (at <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a>), this court decided
                    in <em>Spandeck</em> that a single test for the existence
                    of a duty of care in the tort of negligence is applicable irrespective of the
                    type of loss suffered, and it is therefore not fatal to the Appellant’s
                    case that the loss for which it seeks to be compensated is pure economic loss,
                        <em>viz</em>, the cost of remedial work.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The <em>Spandeck</em>
                    test requires this court to consider (assuming it was factually foreseeable that
                    the Appellant would suffer damage from the Respondent’s carelessness)
                    whether there was sufficient legal proximity between the Appellant and the
                    Respondent for a <em>prima facie</em> duty of care to arise
                    (see <em>Spandeck</em> at [77]), and whether any policy
                    considerations negated this <em>prima facie</em> duty (see
                        <em>Spandeck</em> at [83]). This two-stage test is to
                    be applied incrementally with reference to the facts of decided cases in
                    analogous situations (see <em>Spandeck</em> at
                    [73]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In essence, what this court has to decide, in
                    the context of the present appeal, is whether, at common law, a clerk of works
                    owes a duty to the person commissioning the building works (who may or may not,
                    contractually, be his employer) to take reasonable care in supervising the
                    carrying out of those works. Even if such a duty of care exists, there must,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, have been a breach of such a duty
                    of care by the Respondent resulting in damage that must not have been too remote
                    in order for the Respondent to be liable to the Appellant. However, the
                    establishment of a duty of care is an obvious threshold requirement that must
                    first be established (in this case, by the Appellant). It is this issue (and, in
                    particular, the legal criteria laid down in the <em>Spandeck</em> test) that we must now address.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Factual foreseeability</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The threshold requirement of factual
                    foreseeability is easily fulfilled on the facts of this appeal: it was
                    reasonably foreseeable that if the Respondent did not take care in supervising
                    the backfill operation, the Appellant would suffer some sort of loss or damage.
                    The land might not, for instance, have been backfilled to the proper depth,
                    leading to subsidence and physical damage to any structures resting on the
                    backfill.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Proximity</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     As explained in <em>Spandeck</em> (at [78]–[79]), the focus of the inquiry at this
                    stage of the test is on the closeness of the relationship between the parties,
                    and it embraces physical, circumstantial and causal proximity, including (where
                    the facts support it) any voluntary assumption of responsibility by the
                    defendant and/or reasonable reliance thereon by the plaintiff (see <em>Spandeck</em> at [81]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">Physical proximity</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     There was evidently physical proximity between
                    the parties: the Appellant was the lessee of the site, and the Respondent, by
                    virtue of his appointment as clerk of works/site supervisor, was bound to be
                    physically present at the site in order to carry out his duties (as to which see
                        <a href="#p1_44">[44]</a> below).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">Legal proximity</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The concept of proximity requires more than
                    just physical closeness between the parties, however, and in order to determine
                    whether there was a sufficient degree of <em>legal</em>
                    proximity between the Appellant and the Respondent, it is necessary to examine,
                    in some detail, the status and position of a clerk of works.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">The role of a clerk of works</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     According to the <em>Clerk of
                        Works Manual</em> (Institute of Clerks of Works and Royal Institute of
                    British Architects, 3rd Ed, 1994) (at para 1.01), the term
                    “clerk of works” was historically “given to the cleric or
                    other person appointed to <em>superintend</em> building
                    operations” [emphasis added]. This is confirmed by
                    John E Johnston, <em>The Clerk of Works in the
                        Construction Industry</em> (Crosby Lockwood Staples, 1975)
                        (“<em>The Clerk of Works</em>”), which
                    states (at p 3) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The title Clerk of Works has been in existence since the medieval period,
                        when a clerk was recognised as a man of learning associated with Holy Orders
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Medieval clerks were not always ordained priests, but acted in a lay
                        capacity on behalf of the Church, <em>those nominated as
                            Clerk of Works being responsible for the construction and upkeep of
                            buildings. Because of the similarity of their duties, the title was
                            later conferred upon those</em> who did not hold Holy Orders but
                        who <em>were commissioned to</em><b><em>supervise</em></b><em>the erection and repairs to the Royal
                            Buildings</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     It is interesting to note from the above
                    materials that since the Middle Ages, the role of the clerk of works at a
                    building site has been of a supervisory nature. For example, <em>The Clerk of Works</em> cites (at p 6) records from the time of
                    the restoration of St Paul’s Cathedral in the seventeenth century which
                    state that the clerk of works:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… constantly attends the service of the work to take care that
                        carpenters, labourers, etc, who work by the day, be employed in such
                        business as the Surveyor has directed to be done …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The <em>Clerk of Works
                        Manual</em> notes (at para 1.01) that the attributes of
                    “ability, integrity and vigilance” were considered the most
                    appropriate qualities of a clerk of works, and that these continue to be
                    reflected in the official coat of arms of the Institute of Clerks of Works of
                    Great Britain. The <em>Clerk of Works Manual</em> further
                    states (at para 3.03) that the functions and attributes of a clerk of works
                    include (<em>inter alia</em>):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">-    
              <em>Inspection</em>: detecting
                            workmanship which does not comply or materials which do not conform to
                            the contract standards. This will usually mean inspecting in detail, and
                            checking measurements regularly.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">-    
              <em>Reporting</em>: keeping the
                            architect fully informed on a regular pre-arranged basis. It also means
                            alerting the architect immediately when situations arise which require
                            decisions or actions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Indeed, it has been the common understanding
                    of the construction industry for over three centuries that (see <em>The Clerk of Works</em> at p 104):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[t]he primary task of the Clerk of Works is to inspect the work as it
                        proceeds to ensure it is carried out in accordance with the contract
                        drawings and specifications.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">For instance, British Standards Institution, <em>Glossary of Building and Civil Engineering Terms</em> (Blackwell
                    Scientific Publications, 1993), defines (at 160 2015) a “clerk of
                    works” as a “[p]erson appointed to verify, on behalf of a
                        <em>client</em>, that <em>construction
                        work</em> is executed in accordance with <em>drawings</em>, specifications and other <em>contract
                        documents</em>” [emphasis in original]. That this understanding
                    is shared locally by construction professionals is confirmed by Chow Kok Fong,
                        <em>Construction Contracts Dictionary</em> (Thomson,
                    Sweet &amp; Maxwell Asia, 2006), who defines (at p 62) a clerk of
                    works as:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A representative of the architect, engineer or superintending officer in a
                        construction contract who is deployed on site to assist the architect,
                        engineer or superintending officer and to inspect the progress of the works
                        on behalf of the architect, engineer or superintending officer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Colin Tesch, <em>Construction</em> - <em>Law and Duties</em>
                    (Butterworths, 1977), explains (at [215]) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">An architect, for his basic agreed fee, does not usually undertake to do
                        more than periodic inspections. If the project is of a large size, or
                        perhaps distant from the architect’s office or maybe only small but
                        complex, full-time supervision may be required. This is provided for by the
                        appointment of a clerk of works.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     It appears, therefore, that the industry
                    practice has been that clerks of works assist the architect by monitoring the
                    work of contractors on behalf of the person commissioning the construction works
                    (“the client”), in order to ensure that work is carried out to
                        <em>the client’s</em> standards, specifications
                    and schedule, that the correct materials are used and that proper workmanship is
                    observed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Turning to the relevant case law, in the
                    English High Court decision of <em>Leicester Board of Guardians v
                        Trollope</em> (reported in Alfred A Hudson, <em>The Law of Building, Engineering and Ship Building Contracts and of
                        the Duties and Liabilities of Engineers, Architects, Surveyors, and Valuers;
                        with Reports of Cases and Precedents</em>, vol II,
                    (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 4th Ed, 1914) at p 419)
                        (“<em>Trollope</em>”), the defendant
                    architect had contracted with the plaintiffs to supervise the building works. A
                    clerk of works had been appointed, who permitted the builders to lay the
                    flooring without the specified precautions, thereby deviating from the
                    defendant’s design, and causing dry rot to set in some years later. The
                    plaintiffs sued the defendant for breach of the contract of supervision, and the
                    defendant denied liability on the ground that the damage had been caused by the
                    negligence or misconduct of the clerk of works. In the course of his judgment,
                    Channell J remarked (at p 423) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I think there is no difficulty in seeing what are the respective functions
                        and duties of an architect, and of a clerk of the works. I had a very clear
                        idea of it myself, and the witnesses who have been called for the defendant,
                        two gentlemen of position in the profession, and the defendant himself, who
                        is a gentleman of position in the profession, all practical agree. They all
                        agree that <em>the clerk of the works has to see to matters
                            of detail</em>, and that the architect is not expected… to
                        do so …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Everybody knows that an architect cannot be there all the time, and
                        everybody knows that <em>the clerk of the works is appointed
                            to protect the interests of the employer against the builder, mainly
                            because the architect cannot be there</em>. The same gentlemen who
                        tell us that tell us also that the architect is responsible to see that his
                        design is carried out. That fairly indicates what the respective duties of
                        each are, but it leaves one in each case to say whether the matter
                        complained of is a matter of detail or a matter of seeing whether the design
                        is complied with.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">On the facts, Channell J decided that the laying of concrete was
                    a matter of design within the architect’s purview, and not a matter of
                    detail that could be left to the clerk of works, and therefore rejected the
                    defendant’s attempt to deny liability.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Although in stating that “the clerk of
                    the works is appointed to protect the interests of the employer against the
                    builder” (<em>Trollope</em> at p 423, and
                    reproduced in the preceding paragraph), Channell J used the term
                    “employer”, we are of the view that the position is no different
                    where the client does not formally (pursuant to a contract of service) employ
                    the clerk of works. It is to be noted, however, that although
                    Channell J’s comments in <em>Trollope</em> on
                    the scope of the duty of a clerk of works have generally been accepted (see
                        <em>Jackson &amp; Powell on Professional
                        Liability</em> (John L Powell and Roger Stewart
                    Gen Eds) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 6th Ed, 2007) at
                    para 9-246), his eventual decision is more questionable. Even if the laying
                    of concrete had been a matter of design, it appears that the clerk of works had
                    fraudulently colluded with the builder in not taking the necessary precautions,
                    and then concealed the wrongdoing (see <em>Trollope</em> at
                    p 422). In such circumstances, we would have thought that there would be
                    scope for arguments based on contributory negligence or <em>novus
                        actus interveniens</em> (see, for instance, the English decision of
                        <em>Gray and Others (The Special Trustees of the London
                        Hospital) v T P Bennett &amp; Son (a firm) and
                        others</em> (1987) 43 BLR 63). It should be borne in mind,
                    however, that <em>Trollope</em> had been decided long
                    before these defences were fully developed, and that, on the facts, the
                    architect in <em>Trollope</em> made no effort to ensure
                    that his design had been complied with.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     In the English High Court decision of
                        <em>Kensington and Chelsea and Westminster Area Health
                        Authority v Wettern Composites and others</em> (1984) 1 Con
                    LR 114 (“<em>Wettern Composites</em>”),
                    the plaintiffs were the board of governors of a hospital to which an extension
                    had been built, consisting of (<em>inter alia</em>)
                    artificial stone mullions erected as part of the outer cladding, and which was
                    eventually discovered to be defective. The defendants were, essentially, the
                    architects, whom the plaintiffs had sued in negligence for failing to adequately
                    supervise the erection. In the course of his judgment holding the architects
                    liable, Judge David Smout QC referred (at 133) with approval to the
                    division of duties between the architect and clerk of works commented upon in
                        <em>Trollope</em>, and (at 137–138) stated that
                    the clerk of works:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… has been aptly described as the Regimental Sergeant-Major. It is
                        accepted that <em>he acts as the eyes and ears of the
                            architects, and has a responsibility to keep the architects informed as
                            to what is or is not happening on site. He is also described as employed
                            “to act solely as inspector on behalf of the employer under the
                            direction of the architects</em>.” [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     
          <em>Wettern
                        Composites</em> is also notable because the clerk of works concerned
                    was also held to be negligent in failing to detect the defects, which holding
                    demonstrates that, even in matters of detail, the presence of a clerk of works
                    may not exempt an architect from responsibility. As the clerk of works was
                    employed by the plaintiffs, they were held vicariously liable for his
                    negligence, and their damages were reduced by 20% as a result of contributory
                    negligence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Closer to home, in the decision of this court
                    in <em>Chuang Uming (Pte) Ltd v Setron Ltd</em> [1999]
                    3 SLR(R) 771 (“<em>Setron</em>”),
                    the first respondent (“Setron”) owned a building which had been
                    designed by the second respondent (“the architect”), while the
                    appellant (“the contractor”) was the main contractor who was
                    responsible for tiling works on the building’s façade. As a result of
                    defective design on the part of the architect and defective workmanship on the
                    part of the contractor, tiles fell off the façade in such quantities that the
                    entire façade had to be replaced. One of the issues on appeal was the
                    architect’s failure to supervise the tiling works, in breach of its
                    contractual duty to Setron to do so, and the architect attempted to argue that,
                    as on-site supervision had been left to a clerk of works, who was employed by
                    Setron, the architect was not liable for the clerk of work’s
                    negligence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Rejecting this contention, this court held (at
                        <a href="#p1_40">[40]</a>) that the clerk of works was the
                    “ears and eyes” of the architects in respect of the day to day
                    on-site supervision of the construction works, and that he was “duty
                    bound to report to the architects of any defect or shortcomings in the
                    construction works”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     This survey of authorities demonstrates that,
                    both as a matter of industry practice and judicial observation, a clerk of works
                    is regarded as being, by virtue of his functions and responsibilities at the
                    building site, in fairly close proximity to <em>the
                        client</em>, regardless of whether they are in a formal
                    employer-employee relationship. If, of course, the clerk of works is in fact
                    employed by the client, then there would also be a <em>contractual relationship</em> (which would, naturally, entail the
                    corresponding legal obligations) between the parties. The clerk of works
                    protects the interests of the client against the builder, by inspecting and
                    supervising the works to ensure that they conform to the client’s budget,
                    standards and specifications, and that the client is getting value for money and
                    proper workmanship. These matters have usually been described as matters of
                    “detail”, but might be more accurately be termed <em>operational</em> matters, in keeping with the military
                    analogy employed in <em>Wettern Composites</em> (see
                        <a href="#p1_47">[47]</a> above). In respect of such
                    operational matters, the clerk of works is predominantly responsible, although,
                    as <em>Wettern Composites</em> illustrates, depending on
                    the circumstances, the architect may share some responsibility. In addition, as
                    the <em>Clerk of Works Manual</em> and <em>Setron</em> indicate (see above at <a href="#p1_41">[41]</a> and <a href="#p1_50">[50]</a>,
                    respectively), regardless of whether the matter is one of design or operations,
                    the clerk of works should keep the architect abreast of developments at the
                    worksite, especially if he notices defects or shortcomings in the
                works.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     All this having been said, however, we are
                    inclined to think that, if a problem arises, the client would not generally sue
                    the clerk of works concerned in either contract and/or tort. Indeed, we have
                    seen that, even where a clerk of works has been at fault, the actual claim has
                    (in the cases considered) been made against the architect (see <em>Trollope</em>, <em>Wettern
                        Composites</em> and <em>Setron</em>, all of which
                    have been discussed above), with the role of the clerk of works being relevant
                    to the issue of <em>vicarious liability</em> and <em>contributory negligence</em>. This is not surprising as
                    clerks of works are not generally substantial litigants in their own right
                    (although, as we shall see, this is not the situation in the present appeal,
                    which presents a rather exceptional fact situation). A more important point,
                    however, is that, in the <em>tortious</em> context<em>, clerks of works might not even be liable to the client in the
                        first instance</em>. Let us elaborate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     It is important to acknowledge the very real
                    fact that <em>the qualifications of clerks of work can vary
                        enormously</em>. As has been observed in a leading textbook in the
                    field (see I N Duncan Wallace, <em>Hudson’s
                        Building and Engineering Contracts</em>
                    (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 1995) vol 1 (at para 2-024)):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Clerks of works are usually employed for a specific project, in many cases
                        on the recommendation of the architect, though it is not unusual for
                        building owners with their own building departments or organisations to put
                        forward one of their own employees. They are almost invariably employed and
                        paid for by the building owner. ... Their use is more common in building
                        than in engineering contracts... <em>Their qualifications may
                            vary from those of a retired tradesman or foreman to a fully qualified
                            archit[e]ct or engineer, but in general their position is considerably
                            inferior to that of a resident engineer, and the extent of their
                            authority much more rigorously circumscribed by the contract
                            documents</em> ... [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">There are at least two legal consequences that arise from this
                    variation in qualifications of clerks of works.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     First, the <em>scope</em>
                    of any duty of care owed by a clerk of works will <em>vary</em> from case to case and, depending on the fact situation, the
                    scope of the duty of care may not include the acts or omissions complained of.
                    If so, there is no duty that can be <em>breached</em>, even
                    assuming that a duty of care exists in the first instance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     
          <em>Secondly</em>, at a
                        <em>threshold</em> level, <em>there
                        might not even be a duty of care to begin with</em> (and, on the
                        <em>overlap</em> between duty and breach, see below at
                        <a href="#p1_61">[61]</a>). We are, of course, assuming a
                    situation in which there is <em>no contractual nexus</em>
                    between the clerk of works concerned and the client to begin with. Whilst,
                    following from the analysis above at <a href="#p1_39">[39]</a>-<a href="#p1_51">[51]</a>, it might be argued that, in such a situation, there would,
                    ordinarily, be a duty of care in <em>tort</em> owed by the
                    clerk of works to the client (<em>cf</em> Stephen Furst and
                    Sir Vivian Ramsey, <em>Keating on Construction
                        Contracts</em> (8th Ed, London: Sweet &amp; Maxwell,
                    2006) (“<em>Keating</em>”) at
                    para 13-049), we are of the view that<em>, in order for such
                        a duty of care to exist, there must first be demonstrated that, on the facts
                        of the case concerned, there had been legal proximity between the parties
                        – for example, that there had been an assumption of responsibility by
                        the clerk of works</em> vis-a-vis <em>the client. At
                        this juncture, the universal and the particular (necessarily and, indeed,
                        inevitably) intersect, with the focus tending towards the latter (as opposed
                        to the former)</em>. This necessarily entails an application of the
                    general legal principles to the <em>facts</em> of the case
                    itself. However, unlike the issue of the <em>scope</em> of
                    the duty of care referred to in the preceding paragraph, we are <em>not</em> here stating that the existence of a duty of care is
                        <em>dependent on</em> the (variable) qualities of the
                    clerk of works. Nonetheless, as we explain below, <em>the precise
                        facts</em> are <em>still</em> important in
                    ascertaining whether there has been an assumption of responsibility by the
                    defendant and (correspondingly) whether the element of reliance on the part of
                    the plaintiff has been satisfied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     However, can it be argued that a <em>particular or specific</em> consideration of the <em>facts</em> of <em>a given case</em> is
                        <em>inconsistent</em> with the <em>general</em> principle that a clerk of works <em>ordinarily</em> owes a duty of care to his or her client? In our view
                    there is <em>no inconsistency</em> (a key consideration in
                    this regard, as we shall see, lies in the word “<em>ordinarily</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     As already alluded to above, the <em>general</em> principle is (<em>necessarily</em>) stated at <em>a high level of
                        abstraction and</em> consideration must therefore (<em>and also necessarily</em>) be given to the <em>particular or specific facts</em> of the case itself.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     One such example is to be found on the facts
                    of the seminal House of Lords decision of <em>Hedley
                        Byrne &amp; Co Ltd v Heller &amp; Partners
                        Ltd</em> [1964] 1 AC 465 (“<em>Hedley
                        Byrne</em>”), where, although the House of Lords held that it
                    was possible, as a matter of <em>general principle</em>,
                    for a defendant to owe a duty of care with regard to <em>negligent misstatements</em>, there was no liability on the <em>facts</em> of that particular case as the defendant bank had
                    included <em>a disclaimer of responsibility</em> in the
                    response it had given to the plaintiff firm. We would observe –
                    parenthetically – that there is, once again, <em>an
                        intersection between the universal and the particular</em> inasmuch as
                    it could be argued that, <em>in addition to</em> the effect
                    of such a disclaimer on the <em>particular facts</em> of
                    the case itself, such a disclaimer represents (at the level of <em>general principle</em>) an instance of what might constitute
                        <em>an exception</em> to the general proposition that a
                    duty of care can be owed with respect to negligent misstatements at common law.
                    However, what is important, for present purposes, is to acknowledge <em>the role of the particular facts</em> in ascertaining whether
                    or not a duty of care exists in a given case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Consequently, it is necessary, in the context
                    of the present appeal, to now turn to the <em>application</em> of the general legal principles to the <em>facts</em> of this case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Before proceeding to do so, however, we would
                    emphasise that we have hitherto considered <em>only</em>
                    the position between a clerk of works and the client. By way of a <em>summary</em> of the analysis rendered thus far, where a
                        <em>contractual nexus</em> exists between these two
                    parties, there will be contractual liability if a breach of contract can be
                    established by the innocent party. Further, where such a nexus exists, there
                    could well be <em>concurrent</em> liability for negligence
                    in <em>tort</em> as well. Where, however, a contractual
                    nexus does <em>not</em> exist between these two parties, it
                    does <em>not necessarily</em> follow that there <em>must</em> be liability for negligence in <em>tort</em> between these parties simply because a duty of care might
                    not even exist in the first place. As we have sought to emphasise, whilst it
                    would be possible to argue that, on a <em>general</em>
                    level, a duty of care ought <em>ordinarily</em> to be owed
                    by a clerk of works to his client, whether or not such a duty of care <em>is</em> indeed owed in the case at hand would, in our view,
                    depend on the <em>precise facts</em> in question – in
                    particular, whether there had been an <em>assumption of
                        responsibility</em> by the clerk of works concerned <em>vis-a-vis</em> the client (and a corresponding <em>reliance</em> by the latter on the former). Indeed, <em>even if</em> such a duty of care existed on the facts, there
                    might <em>still</em> be <em>no</em>
                    liability if, again on the <em>relevant facts</em> of the
                    case concerned, the clerk of works had not <em>breached</em> that duty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     It is apposite, at this juncture, to point out
                    that there is often an <em>overlap</em> between duty and
                    breach (see generally <em>Winfield &amp; Jolowicz</em> at para 5-23).
                    Conceivably, in our view, whether the relevant facts of the case are considered
                    at the (earlier) duty stage (as is the case in the present appeal) or at the
                    later breach stage would depend very much on the characterisation as well as
                    level of abstraction adopted by the court concerned. However, acknowledging (as
                    we have done (see below at <a href="#p1_66">[66]</a>-<a href="#p1_74">[74]</a>)) that the relevant <em>contractual
                        matrix</em> ought (where it exists) to be considered (whether at the
                    first and/or second stages of the <em>Spandeck</em> test)
                    suggests that, in most of these cases, the court will probably consider (as we
                    have in the present appeal (see below at <a href="#p1_63">[63]</a>-<a href="#p1_74">[74]</a>)) the <em>particular facts in order to ascertain
                        whether a duty of care exists</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     
          <em>It is also important to
                        note that we leave open the point as to whether or not a clerk of works owes
                        a duty of care (even on a general level) to other third parties (who are not
                        the clients as such)</em>. There might well be a strong argument in
                    favour of excluding such a duty of care (even on a general level; and <em>cf Keating</em> at para 13-049) but as this is not the
                    fact situation before us, we say no more about this particular issue. We turn,
                    instead, to a consideration of the facts of the present appeal.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     It should be noted that the Respondent was the
                    main director of A.n.A and that he procured A.n.A to appoint himself clerk of
                    works (see <a href="#p1_64">[64]</a> below). In such
                    circumstances, the Respondent was <em>voluntarily assuming the
                        various responsibilities the role carried and holding himself out as
                        possessing the relevant qualifications and skills necessary to discharge
                        that role</em>. This is exactly the sort of relationship that
                    Lord Devlin in <em>Hedley Byrne</em> considered (at
                    529) to be “equivalent to contract”, <em>ie</em>, where there is an <em>assumption of
                        responsibility</em> in circumstances in which, but for the absence of
                    consideration, there would be a contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     As for whether there was <em>reliance</em> by the Appellant on care being taken by the Respondent
                    in circumstances where the latter knew or ought to have known of such reliance,
                    it must have been obvious to the Respondent that the Appellant was relying on
                    him as a clerk of works. Indeed, the Respondent intended that he should be so
                    relied on, for he procured his own appointment as clerk of works by naming
                    himself the site supervisor/clerk of works in an application form (“the
                    BCA form”) submitted to the Building and Construction Authority
                    (“BCA”), in which the Respondent declared that, as site
                    supervisor, he was “not a partner, officer or employee of the
                    builder”. This was, of course, patently false, but was no doubt
                    calculated to convey the impression that the Respondent was an independent and
                    reliable individual with no links to A.n.A, and could therefore be relied upon
                    to act in the Appellant’s interest as a clerk of works.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     The Respondent contends, however, that if the
                    Appellant had wanted the Respondent to assume some liability to it in the
                    conduct of his responsibilities, it could have sought a personal guarantee from
                    the Respondent or introduced the Respondent as a further party to its contract
                    with A.n.A, but it chose not to do so (see, similarly, <em>Spandeck</em> at [96]). In such circumstances, the Respondent argues,
                    it cannot be said that he had assumed any responsibility to the Appellant and/or
                    that the Appellant was relying on him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     Before we address this argument, we should
                    note that the presence of a contractual matrix is a factor that, whilst
                    considered to be among the “relevant policy considerations” in
                        <em>Spandeck</em> (at [83]) (and, hence, falling under
                    the <em>second</em> limb of the <em>Spandeck</em> test), might, depending on the facts, be appropriately
                    analysed, instead, in relation to the issue of proximity (under the <em>first</em> limb of the <em>Spandeck</em>
                    test). That there is, on occasion at least, an overlap between both limbs of the
                        <em>Spandeck</em> test is not, perhaps,
                    surprising.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Indeed, in <em>Spandeck</em> itself, the contractual matrix was treated as both a
                    proximity factor (at [108]) as well as a policy consideration (at [114]).
                    Similarly, in the English Court of Appeal decision of <em>Pacific
                        Associates Inc v Baxter</em> [1990] 1 QB 993 (“<em>Pacific Associates</em>”) (which was, in fact, applied
                    in <em>Spandeck</em>), the court did not adopt an
                    altogether uniform approach towards this issue. Purchas LJ, for example,
                    was of the view (at 1023-1024) that the precise reason adopted “may not
                    in the present case matter very much” as the result would be the same,
                        <em>regardless</em> of whether it was held (<em>inter alia</em>) that there had been no proximity between the
                    parties <em>or</em> that it would not be just and
                    reasonable to find that a duty of care had been established. Ralph
                    Gibson LJ, on the other hand, appeared (at 1031-1032) to base his decision
                    on what is presently the second limb of the <em>Spandeck</em> test, whilst Russell LJ <em>clearly</em> based his decision on that particular limb (at
                    1037-1039).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     As was also observed in an article (see
                    Andrew Phang, Cheng Lim Saw and Gary Chan, “Of
                    Precedent, Theory and Practice – The Case for a Return to <em>Anns</em>” [2006] SJLS 1 (at
                    p 54)):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[D]espite the doctrinal separation of both limbs in the <em>Anns</em> test [which was adopted in <em>Spandeck</em> (see above at <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a>)], there would, at the level of appli­cation,
                        nevertheless be an interaction between them. This is only to be expected
                        since the Court concerned has to base its final decision on a <em>holistic</em> consideration of <em>both</em> limbs as applied to the facts of the case itself.
                        [emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     The overlap just referred to is, in fact,
                    neatly illustrated by the facts of this particular appeal. In this case, the
                    Respondent is suggesting that the legal relationship between the parties has
                    been exclusively defined by contract, leaving no room for the tortious doctrine
                    of assumption of responsibility to operate. This bears more affinity to
                    proximity (pursuant to the first limb of the <em>Spandeck</em> test), which is, after all, a question of the closeness
                    of the relationship between the parties (see <em>Spandeck</em> at [77]), than to far-reaching considerations of public
                    policy (such as the notorious “floodgates” argument and the
                    availability of insurance). However, we would observe – parenthetically
                    – that the reasoning <em>as well as</em> (more
                    importantly) the result would be the <em>same</em> even if
                    we treat this particular issue under the second limb of the <em>Spandeck</em> test. This is not, of course, surprising, given the
                    overlap just mentioned (see also, in a similar vein, <em>Spandeck</em> (at [114])).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     Returning to the Respondent’s
                    submission, although this sort of argument defeated the claim in <em>Spandeck</em> and in <em>Pacific
                        Associates</em>, in our view, on the facts of the present appeal, it
                    is not as compelling.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     The mere fact that there is a pre-existing
                    contractual relationship or backdrop between the parties should not, in itself,
                    be sufficient to exclude a duty of care on one of them to avoid causing pure
                    economic loss to the other (the situation is <em>a
                        fortiori</em> where, as here, there is in fact <em>no</em> contractual relationship between the parties, but merely a
                    contractual backdrop, in the sense that each party was in a separate contractual
                    relationship with a third party, <em>viz</em>, A.n.A). The
                    true principle, in determining whether or not any contractual arrangement has
                    this effect, should be whether or not the parties structured their contracts
                    intending thereby to exclude the imposition of a tortious duty of care (see the
                    House of Lords decision of <em>Henderson and others v Merrett
                        Syndicates Ltd and others</em> [1995] 2 AC 145 at
                    193–194).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     In <em>Spandeck</em> and
                        <em>Pacific Associates</em>, the presence of an
                    arbitration clause pointed unequivocally to the fact that the parties
                    deliberately wished for their contractual arrangements to exclusively govern
                    their respective liabilities, and to prevent a tortious duty of care which would
                    cut across and be inconsistent with that contractual structure (see generally
                        <em>Spandeck</em> at [98]–[102],
                    [108]–[109] and [114]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     Here, however, there is no inconsistency
                    between, on the one hand, the contract between the Appellant and A.n.A, and, on
                    the other, a duty of care owed by the Respondent to the Appellant. Certainly,
                    there is no evidence to suggest that the Appellant and A.n.A had deliberately
                    organised their contractual arrangements to exclude any potential tortious
                    liability on the part of the Respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     Hence, in the absence of any positive steps
                    taken by the parties during the negotiation and conclusion of the contract
                    between A.n.A and the Appellant, we are unable to see how the contractual matrix
                    militates against the existence of a duty of care owed by the Respondent to the
                    Appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Policy considerations</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     Given that there is sufficient proximity
                    between the Appellant and the Respondent for a <em>prima
                        facie</em> duty of care to arise, it is necessary to consider whether
                    any reasons of policy militate against the imposition of a duty of
                care.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     There are a number of such policy
                    considerations, <em>viz</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_76-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether imposing a duty of care on
                        the Respondent might circumvent the prescribed statutory duties of a site
                        supervisor;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_76-p2_b"></a>(b)     whether imposing a duty of care on the Respondent might amount to an
                        impermissible lifting of the corporate veil; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_76-p2_c"></a>(c)     the Respondent’s conflicts of
                        interest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">We will deal with each of these considerations
                    seriatim. However, it is appropriate to make one preliminary
                observation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     With regard to consideration (c) above, it
                    will be seen (at <a href="#p1_87">[87]</a> below) that our
                    conclusion thereon is that, far from negating the Respondent’s <em>prima facie</em> duty of care, this particular consideration
                    in fact <em>reinforces</em> it. It should not be thought,
                    however, that this represents a departure from <em>Spandeck</em>, and a return to the three-part test (“the
                        <em>Caparo</em> test”) in <em>Caparo Industries Plc v Dickman</em> [1990] 2 AC 605
                        (“<em>Caparo</em>”). The second limb of
                    the <em>Spandeck</em> test is essentially <em>negative</em> in nature. Put simply, the court, having
                    determined that a <em>prima facie</em> duty of care has
                    been established, applies policy considerations to the factual matrix to decide
                    whether that <em>prima facie</em> duty is <em>negated or limited</em>. In contrast, the third limb of the
                        <em>Caparo</em> test is a <em>positive</em> one: notwithstanding the existence of sufficient
                    foreseeability of damage and proximity between the parties, a duty of care
                    nonetheless cannot arise unless and until the factual matrix is “one in
                    which the court considers it fair, just and reasonable” to <em>impose</em> a duty (see <em>Caparo</em>
                    at 618). In other words, unlike the third limb of the <em>Caparo</em> test, the second limb of the <em>Spandeck</em> test does not require the presence of policy
                    considerations militating in favour of the imposition of a duty of care
                    (“positive policy considerations”) – it merely requires the
                    absence of policy considerations militating against the imposition of such a
                    duty (“negative policy considerations”). We gratefully adopt the
                    explanation of the difference between the two approaches supplied by
                    Mark Lunney and Ken Oliphant, <em>Tort Law: Text and
                        Materials</em> (Oxford University Press, 3rd ed, 2008) (at
                    p 141):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The difference may aptly be characterised as one between an approach that
                        starts from a presumption of duty, and requires the invocation of policy
                        factors if the duty is to be negated, and one that starts from a presumption
                        of no duty, and requires the invocation of policy factors if a new duty is
                        to be established (see <em>Stovin v Wise</em>
                        [1996] AC 923 at 949, per Lord Hoffmann).</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Although it has been questioned whether the difference between the
                        <em>Spandeck</em> and <em>Caparo</em> approaches is truly as stark as the above passage
                    suggests (see John Murphy, <em>Street on Torts</em>
                    (Oxford University Press, 12th ed, 2007) at pp 43–44), for
                    present purposes we would merely observe that this difference in approach does
                        <em>not</em> mean that courts cannot, under the second
                    limb of the <em>Spandeck</em> test, have due regard to the
                    presence of positive policy considerations. While the <em>Spandeck</em> test does not require this, it does not prohibit it
                    either, for courts may sometimes need to deploy such countervailing positive
                    policy considerations in order to dismiss spurious negative policy
                    considerations raised by the defendant (see, for example, the Singapore High
                    Court decision of <em>Amutha Valli d/o Krishnan v
                        Titular Superior of the Redemptorist Fathers in Singapore and
                        others</em> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 1091, where just such an
                    exercise was undertaken by Lee Seiu Kin J at [81]). As this court stated in
                        <em>Spandeck</em> (at [85]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The courts must, as far as possible, avoid giving the impression that
                        there remain “unexpressed motives” behind their finding for or
                        against a duty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     With this preliminary point settled, we turn
                    now to consider the relevant policy considerations, both negative and positive,
                    in this appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">Statutory duty</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     One possible negative policy argument is that
                    the duties of a site supervisor are clearly set out in s 10 of the Act, and
                    therefore if (as in this case) the actions of a site supervisor or clerk of
                    works fall outside the ambit of s 10, this might indicate that the
                    Legislature did not intend for them to owe any duties in respect of such
                    actions, and that the courts should not therefore seek to superimpose a common
                    law duty of care wider than the statutory duty imposed by s 10, which would
                    (on such reasoning) contradict such legislative intention in the
                process.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     Such an argument found favour with the House
                    of Lords in <em>Murphy v Brentwood District Council</em>
                    [1991] 1 AC 398 (“<em>Murphy</em>”)
                    at 457, 472, 482, 491–492 and 498, where the House of Lords overruled
                        <em>Anns and others v Merton London Borough
                        Council</em> [1978] 1 AC 728 (“<em>Anns</em>”) and held that a local authority owed no duty of
                    care to avoid negligently approving the purchase of houses with defective
                    foundations, which would thereby cause a purchaser of a house to incur pure
                    economic loss. A number of their Lordships considered that, in what was
                    essentially a consumer protection field, the precise extent and limits that
                    should be imposed on builders and local authorities in the public interest was
                    best dealt with by the Legislature and not the courts. As the UK Parliament had
                    seen fit to enact the Defective Premises Act 1972 (c 35) (“the UK
                    DPA 1972”), which imposed on builders a liability falling short of
                    that imposed by <em>Anns</em>, there was no policy reason
                    for the courts to impose a higher common law duty on builders or local
                    authorities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     On closer scrutiny, however, the argument
                    based on s 10 of the Act is not, in our view, strong enough to prevent the
                    imposition of a duty of care on the Respondent. First, the preamble to the UK
                    DPA 1972 states quite clearly that it is:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">An Act to <em>impose duties</em> in connection with
                        the provision of dwellings and otherwise to <em>amend the
                            law</em> of England and Wales as to liability for injury or damage
                        caused to persons through defects in the state of premises. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Further, s 1 of the UK DPA 1972 sets out in fairly substantial
                    detail the persons to whom the duty is owed (s 1(1)(<em>a</em>) and (<em>b</em>)); the nature of the
                    duty (s 1(1)); how the duty may be discharged (s 1(2) and (3)); and
                    the persons on whom the duty is imposed (s 1(1) and (4)). In contrast,
                    s 10 of the Act does not obviously create a private cause of action that
                    sounds in damages (see <a href="#p1_24">[24]</a> above). It would
                    appear that a breach of s 10 of the Act results instead in purely criminal
                    sanctions under sub-sections (7) to (9). In such circumstances, and given
                    the rather general terms in which s 10 of the Act is phrased, it is
                    unlikely that the Legislature had intended, when enacting s 10, to preclude
                    common law civil remedies against negligent site supervisors or clerks of works.
                    Second, the fact that the Act does not cover a particular situation is equally,
                    if not more, consistent with the possibility that there is a lacuna in the law
                    the courts should remedy, as opposed to the possibility that the Legislature
                    intended for such a situation to be completely unregulated by the common law.
                    Indeed, nothing in the debates during the Second Reading of the Building Control
                    Bill indicates that the Legislature intended there not to be a civil remedy
                    against negligent site supervisors (see <em>Singapore
                        Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</em> (16 February 1989)
                    vol 52 at cols 668–686). Third, the question of what common law
                    duties a clerk of works owes is not merely one of “consumer
                    protection”, but is also one of public safety, especially in the local
                    context, where construction takes place on an ongoing basis. In the field of
                    public and workplace safety, there is no reason why the courts should not be
                    astute to introduce minimum standards of skill and care via the tort of
                    negligence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     For all these reasons, we consider that
                        <em>Murphy</em> may be distinguished, and that
                    s 10 of the Act, in itself, is not inconsistent with the Respondent owing
                    the Appellant a duty of care at common law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">Lifting of the corporate veil</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     The Respondent also argues that the imposition
                    of a duty of care in this case would in effect amount to an unwarranted lifting
                    of the corporate veil.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     This would only be true, however, if the
                    Respondent was being sued for the tortious acts or omissions of A.n.A, rather
                    than for his own tort (see, for example, the House of Lords decision of
                        <em>Standard Chartered Bank v Pakistan National Shipping
                        Corpn and others (Nos 2 and 4)</em> [2003] 1 AC 959 at
                    [22] (<em>per</em> Lord Hoffmann) and [40] (<em>per</em> Lord Rodger)). As <em>Company
                        Directors: Duties, Liabilities and Remedies</em> (Simon Mortimore
                    ed) (Oxford University Press, 2009) states (at para 27.22):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A director is personally liable for his own torts committed in relation to
                        the company’s affairs, whilst acting as a director or employee of the
                        company. In such circumstances the company will also be vicariously liable
                        for the director’s torts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In other words, the corporate veil argument depends on the Respondent
                    acting as A.n.A, rather than as its employee or agent (or indeed in a personal
                    capacity). On the facts of the present appeal, however, the Respondent’s
                    liability is not predicated on any corporate acts <em>qua</em> organ of A.n.A, but on his personal acts <em>qua</em> clerk of works (albeit therefore as an employee of A.n.A
                    (see above at <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a>)). If all the elements of
                    the tort of negligence can be established against the Respondent, he will be
                    personally liable, and the fact that he is also a director of a company is
                    irrelevant to his personal liability, although it may be relevant to the
                    company’s vicarious liability, depending on whether (as here) the tort was
                    committed in the director’s course of employment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     In the circumstances, therefore, the separate
                    legal personality of A.n.A is irrelevant, and a duty of care cannot be denied on
                    that ground.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">Conflicts of interest</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     One final positive policy consideration that
                    points <em>in favour of</em> the imposition of a duty of
                    care, and which merits special notice on the specific facts of this appeal, is
                    the lack of checks and balances arising out of the Respondent’s conflicts
                    of interest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     We have already adverted to the
                    Respondent’s dual position as director of A.n.A and clerk of works (see
                    above at <a href="#p1_4">[4]</a>, <a href="#p1_63">[63]</a> and <a href="#p1_64">[64]</a>), which would
                    inevitably have compromised his ability to scrutinise the work of A.n.A and act
                    in the Appellant’s interest (as he ought to have done as clerk of works).
                    Not for nothing, after all, has the virtue of “integrity” been
                    considered a core attribute of a clerk of works (see <a href="#p1_41">[41]</a> above). Clerks of works should not be allowed to flout the
                    system of checks and balances envisioned by the Act, to the detriment of their
                    clients, without the latter having some form of recourse.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Conclusion on duty of care</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     For all these reasons, the <em>Spandeck</em> test is satisfied, and we are of the view that the
                    Respondent owed the Appellant a duty of care at common law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the Respondent breached his duty of care to the
                Appellant</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     Given that the Respondent was under a common
                    law duty of care to the Appellant, it is necessary to consider whether, on the
                    facts, this duty was breached. This raises, in turn, the issue as to what the
                        <em>scope</em> of that duty is, for, if the duty does
                    not even include or encompass the matters complained of, then there is no duty
                    to breach. This will obviously depend heavily on the specific fact situation of
                    each case and will include such factors as the contractual duties, if any, that
                    the clerk of works concerned has undertaken.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     On the facts of the present appeal, it is
                    clear, in our views, that, <em>qua</em> clerk of works, the
                    Respondent owed the Appellant a duty of care to supervise the backfilling works,
                    which was undoubtedly an operational matter under the responsibility of the
                    Respondent. This is because, as originally agreed, the levelling of the land was
                    to be a relatively minor part of the contract, and was the product of
                    negotiations and agreement between the Appellant and A.n.A, without any
                    architectural input whatever. Although it is a question of fact in each case
                    whether a matter is one of operation, as opposed to design, it is quite
                    impossible to regard the backfilling in this case as a design element, unlike
                    the concreting in <em>Trollope</em> or the tiling works in
                        <em>Setron</em>, especially when, as matters
                    subsequently transpired, the backfilling operation was an unauthorised adventure
                    on the part of A.n.A (see further at <a href="#p1_93">[93]</a>
                    below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     Also, as this court held in <em>JSI Shipping (S) Pte Ltd v Teofoongwonglcloong (a firm)</em> [2007]
                    4 SLR(R) 460 (at [69]), in determining whether there has been a breach
                    of a duty of care, the standard of reasonable care is to be objectively assessed
                    on the basis of knowledge then reasonably available.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     Although the Respondent attempted to draw a
                    sharp distinction between what he knew in his capacity as director of A.n.A, and
                    what he knew as clerk of works, we regard this distinction as somewhat unreal.
                    This sort of approach has been rejected in the context of directors’
                    fiduciary duties (see, for example, the English High Court decision of <em>Industrial Development Consultants v Cooley Ltd</em>. [1972]
                    1 WLR 443 at 451 and the English Court of Appeal decision of <em>Mohan Singh Bhullar &amp; ors v Inderjit Singh
                        Bhullar &amp; anor</em> [2003] EWCA Civ 424 at
                    [41]), and we see no reason to adopt it in the context of the common law duties
                    of a clerk of works.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     Consequently, the knowledge reasonably
                    available to the Respondent <em>qua</em> clerk of works was
                    also the knowledge available to him <em>qua</em> director
                    of A.n.A, which included the following matters:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_93-p2_a"></a>(a)     As the site was not level, the
                        Appellant’s contract with A.n.A envisioned that A.n.A was to level the
                        land (see the Judgment at [16]) by using surplus earth from the higher-lying
                        areas to raise the lower-lying areas (see the Judgment at [3]–[4]).
                        The levelling operation was therefore supposed to be a
                        “self-contained” job, involving no external
                    elements.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_93-p2_b"></a>(b)     Instead,
                        A.n.A departed from the terms of the agreement by engaging Lok Sheng to
                        truck in backfill material consisting of wet soil and wood chips from
                        off-site to raise the lower-lying areas of the site (see the Judgment at
                        [17]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_93-p2_c"></a>(c)     A.n.A
                        did not know if Lok Sheng had any special qualifications in the area of
                        earthworks (see the Judgment at [17]). During the course of the trial, it
                        emerged that Lok Sheng’s principal business activities consisted of
                        “construction and engineering” and “freight transport
                        by road” – a far cry from the “specialist” in
                        earthworks it was asserted to be by both A.n.A and the Respondent in their
                        pleadings and affidavits. In addition, as the Judge observed, Lok Sheng was
                        “a one-man operation” (see the Judgment at
                    [17]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_93-p2_d"></a>(d)     In the
                        contract between A.n.A and Lok Sheng under which Lok Sheng was to supply the
                        soil and wood chips as backfill material, there were no specifications
                        regarding the type and/or quality of soil and wood chips to be provided. The
                        contract was completely silent as to whether, for example, the wood chips
                        were to be chemically treated or inert, or whether the soil was to consist
                        of organic or inorganic material (or both), or whether precautions had been
                        taken to ensure the absence of contaminants.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_93-p2_e"></a>(e)     A.n.A did not have to pay for the backfill
                        material (see the Judgment at [17]), and in fact appears to have received
                        $40,000 in “compensation” from Lok Sheng for transport and
                        labour costs allegedly incurred by A.n.A in facilitating the supply and
                        delivery by Lok Sheng of the wood chips. Whether A.n.A actually incurred any
                        such costs is open to question, given the testimony of Choo Kong Leong
                        (A.n.A’s project manager), that there were in fact <em>no</em> extra costs incurred in bringing in the backfill
                        material. In any event, even if any such costs had been incurred, the fact
                        of the matter is that A.n.A received the backfill material from Lok Sheng
                        for free (see the Judgment at [17]). Indeed, under these circumstances, the
                        Respondent ought, in our view, to have realised that something was amiss
                        – particularly having regard to the dubious circumstances under which
                        the wood chips were brought onto the site and used as backfill material. It
                        bears repeating that these circumstances resulted in A.n.A being able to
                        level the land with at minimal or no cost, utilising material (here, wood
                        chips) which Lok Sheng was only too eager to offload free-of-charge. Indeed,
                        as we have already noted, Lok Sheng appears to have paid $40,000 in
                        “compensation” to A.n.A as well.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     Given the circumstances set out above, a
                    reasonably competent and prudent clerk of works, knowing of all these matters,
                    would have taken special care and redoubled his efforts in supervising the
                    backfilling and checking that the backfill material used by Lok Sheng was
                    suitable. At the very least, he would have informed the QPs (and, more
                    importantly, the Appellant) that A.n.A was backfilling the site in a manner not
                    contemplated by the contract (see <a href="#p1_93">[93]</a>
                    above), as well as of all the other matters in the preceding paragraph. In
                    short, it was the Respondent’s duty, as clerk of works, to act in a manner
                    which was contrary to his interests as director of A.n.A.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     The Respondent, however, did none of these
                    things. There is no evidence that he took any steps to ensure that the wood
                    chips were safe backfill material and would not contaminate the site, nor is
                    there evidence that the QPs had been informed of the backfilling. Indeed, the
                    Respondent himself admitted in cross-examination that, had the QE been informed
                    of the backfilling, the QE would have applied for a permit from the Urban
                    Redevelopment Authority (“URA”), as the backfilling involved a
                    land area of more than 2,000m<sup>2</sup> and a change in the
                    level of the land of more than 1.5m relative to the neighbouring land, and
                    Condition 10 of the “Permit to Carry Out Structural Works”
                    granted by the BCA to the Appellant required:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A separate planning permission … from the Chief Planner, URA for
                        earthworks at a remote site if the works for which this permit is granted
                        also involve:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a) the borrowing or filling of earth at the remote site; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b) such borrowing/filling of earth at the remote site involves a land
                        area of more than 2,000m<sup>2</sup> or a change in level of
                        land of more than 1.5m anywhere in the site relative to the neighbouring
                        land.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It is not disputed that, notwithstanding this requirement, no planning
                    permission was applied for prior to the commencement of the
                backfilling.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     It should be added that, throughout this
                    entire unhappy affair (<em>ie</em>, both before and during
                    the trial, as well as at the hearing of the present appeal), the Respondent has
                    repeatedly prevaricated and changed his story with regard to the provenance of
                    the wood chips, attempting to suggest that they had been used on the access way
                    of the site to provide traction for vehicles entering and leaving the site, and
                    had been “accidentally buried” when they should have been removed
                    at the end of the project (see, for example, the Judgment at [18]). These
                    blatant attempts at evasion and dissemblance lead to the inevitable inference
                    that the Respondent knew full well that A.n.A had no authorisation from the
                    Appellant to use the wood chips as backfill, and was going to all possible
                    lengths to hide the fact that A.n.A had gone off on a frolic of its own in
                    engaging Lok Sheng to backfill the site.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     In the circumstances, by reason of his failure
                    to supervise the backfilling operation and to report it to the QPs, the
                    Respondent was in breach of his duty of care to the Appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Causation and remoteness</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     It is clear that, but for the
                    Respondent’s negligence, the Appellant would not have suffered the loss it
                    has. Had proper supervision been observed, it is more likely than not that soil
                    and wood chips would not have been used as the backfill material. More
                    importantly, had the QPs (or the Appellant) been informed of the unauthorised
                    backfilling, they would very likely have put a stop to it. In addition, they
                    would have applied for the necessary permit from the URA; and if that had been
                    done, it is unlikely that the URA would have granted the permit in the absence
                    of the SLA’s consent, and the SLA would not have consented because
                    cl 6.11 of the Tenancy Agreement between the Appellant and the SLA obliged
                    the former “[n]ot to dispose earth, debris or any other material”
                    on the site.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     With regard to the issue of remoteness, we do
                    not consider the Appellant’s loss too remote for the purposes of the
                    Respondent’s liability in negligence. The test for remoteness of damage in
                    the tort of negligence is that of “reasonable foreseeability”,
                        <em>ie</em>, a tortfeasor is liable only for damage of
                    a kind which a reasonable man should have foreseen (see the leading Privy
                    Council decision of <em>Overseas Tankship (UK) Ltd v Morts
                        Dock &amp; Engineering Co Ltd (The Wagon Mound)</em>
                    [1961] AC 388, as well as the decisions of this court in <em>Ho Soo Fong v Standard Chartered Bank</em> [2007]
                    2 SLR(R) 181 at [39] and <em>Sunny
                        Metal &amp; Engineering Pte Ltd v Ng Khim Ming Eric</em>
                    [2007] 3 SLR(R) 782 at [56]). It was perfectly foreseeable that, if
                    reasonable care was not taken by the Respondent in supervising the backfilling,
                    ensuring that the backfill material was suitable and reporting the backfilling
                    to the QPs, pure economic loss would have been caused to the Appellant in having
                    to demolish any structures resting on the affected areas in order to excavate
                    and replace the backfill.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    Quite apart from this, as a result of the
                    Respondent’s negligence, the Appellant has had to suffer the unnecessary
                    stress and inconvenience of having to deal with a number of government agencies
                    regarding the environmental damage from the contaminated backfill, delay the
                    opening of the shelter and the commencement of the good work the shelter was
                    intended for, as well as put up with the unsightly and noxious effluence being
                    discharged from the site. While these may not be legally recoverable losses, it
                    is a testament to the fortitude and determination of the Appellant’s staff
                    that they were not deterred by these numerous setbacks.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Defences</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    We did not hear any argument on this issue,
                    but we are of the view that the Respondent cannot avail himself of any defences
                    to the Appellant’s claim in negligence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    As we observed at <a href="#p1_90">[90]</a> above, we regard the backfilling as an operational matter
                    falling under the supervisory responsibility of the clerk of works. The QPs were
                    entitled to expect the Respondent to carry out his duties diligently and to keep
                    them informed if for some reason their attention was required on site. That
                    being so, we do not think it can be said that the QPs have, in this case, been
                    guilty of contributory negligence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    For all the foregoing reasons, we conclude
                    that the Respondent was in breach of his duty of care to the Appellant, and
                    that, by reason of his negligence, he caused the Appellant to suffer pure
                    economic loss. The Appellant’s appeal is therefore allowed with costs and
                    with the usual consequential orders. The damages to be awarded to the Appellant
                    are to be assessed by the Registrar.</p>
