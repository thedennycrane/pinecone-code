Lee Ker Min (“the Plaintiff”), by his eldest son and litigation representative Lee Kai Teck Roland (“Roland”), is suing his eldest sister Lee Gin Hong (“the first defendant”) as well as his youngest sister Lee Gim Moi (“the second defendant”) to recover half of the partnership’s debt owed to a bank.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The two Defendants are sued personally as well as in their capacities as the executors of the estate of their late mother Ng Ang Chum (“the Deceased”) who passed away on 19 December 2014. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The partnership in question is Lee Huat Company (“Lee Huat” or “the Partnership”), which started as a sole-proprietorship in 1958. It is a retailer of motorcycles and motor scooters, spare parts and accessories as well as a workshop. Lee Huat operates at a shophouse in Upper Bukit Timah Road located at Nos. 873 to 875 (“the shophouse”). Prior to 1975, Lee Huat was a sole-proprietorship of the late Lee Kim Eng (“the father”) who started the business in 1958 and was the father of the Plaintiff and the Defendants.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 On 4 February 1975, the Plaintiff joined Lee Huat as a partner. After the father passed away on 4 October 1981, the Deceased was registered as a partner. As the Deceased was illiterate, the business of Lee Huat was conducted/managed by the Plaintiff. In July 2014, the Plaintiff suffered a severe stroke that incapacitated him. Thereafter Lee Huat’s business was managed by Lee Kai Leong Jeffrey (“Jeffrey”) the Plaintiff’s second son. On 22 February 2016, Roland obtained an order of court under the Mental Capacity Act (Cap 177A, 2010 Rev Ed), to be appointed the Plaintiff’s litigation representative.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 According to the Defendants,

</div> the Deceased did not have any say in the management or running of Lee Huat which was always a profitable and cash orientated business. Neither did the Deceased share in the profits made by Lee Huat. The Defendants claimed that the Plaintiff took all the profits and only gave to the Deceased a monthly allowance of about $1,000.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The Deceased had seven children and after they grew up and married, they moved out from the shophouse, save for the two Defendants who never married. The second and first Defendants commenced working for Lee Huat in 1984 and 1989 respectively, as administration clerks until they resigned in August 2016. During their employment with Lee Huat, the Defendants were responsible for such matters as renewing the road taxes and certificates of entitlement and hire-purchase instalments of the motorcycles of Lee Huat’s customers. These duties were described by the defendants as “inside” duties were opposed to “outside” duties, which comprised of the workshop and the selling/servicing of motorcycles/motor scooters and spare parts by the Plaintiff, who was assisted by Jeffrey. Lee Huat’s business was usually transacted in cash save for dealings with sub-dealers for new motorcycles, hire-purchase instalment payments, sales of motorcycles or trade-in transactions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 According to the Defendants, after the demise of the father, the Plaintiff had a free hand in how he conducted Lee Huat’s business. Apart from performing simple tasks such as sweeping the floor, cooking and making beverages as it was a family business, the Deceased took no part in the business of Lee Huat.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 ln or around 1994, the Plaintiff decided to set up LH Motor Pte Ltd ("LHMPL") in which he would park new motorcycles for trading. The Plaintiff held 70% of LHMPL's shares while the Deceased and the two Defendants each held 10%. The Partnership's business in the sale and purchase of new motorcycles was then moved to LHMPL.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 The Plaintiff used the Partnership’s monies for the initial capital investment in LHMPL. As and when LHMPL made sales, the money was either collected directly by the Partnership, or repaid by LHMPL to the Partnership. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 The Defendants alleged that the Plaintiff also made use of the Partnership’s monies, profits it made as well its overdraft facility with United Overseas Bank (“UOB’s overdraft facility”) and funds from its other banks for his and his family’s expenses. The UOB overdraft facility for the sum of $1.5m was obtained on 22 Aug 2000. It is payable on demand with an interest of 1.5% over UOB’s prevailing prime rate. The facility and all monies owed by the Partnership was secured by a mortgage of a 3-storey semi-detached house at 59A Choa Chu Kang Road, Singapore 689482 (“59A CCK”), which is solely owned by the Plaintiff but acquired using Lee Huat’s monies. The Plaintiff also acquired the following assets and/or businesses with the Partnership’s funds:-</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In or about 1991, the Plaintiff and his wife Ng Lim Lee (“NLL”) acquired a property at Blk 223, Choa Chu Kang Centre #13-249, Singapore 2368 (“Blk 223 CCK") at the price of $106,700. The Plaintiff used at least $123,999.50 from the Partnership to pay for the purchase of Blk 223 CCK and its expenses by making withdrawals from the Partnership’s bank accounts with UMBC (which changed its name subsequently first to Sime Bank Bhd and then to RHB) and UOB.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The construction of two semi-detached houses at Nos. 59 and 59A Choa Chu Kang (“59/59A CCK”) for which the Plaintiff took at least $890,253.82 from Lee Huat for the construction of 59A CCK. 59 CCK belonged to the Plaintiff’s younger brother Lee Ker Leng.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) In or around October 2003, the Plaintiff purchased No 615 Balestier Road ("615 Balestier Road") for which he took at least $605,131.50 from the Partnership. 615 Balestier Road was rented out, which rental was not/never paid to Lee Huat even though the mortgage instalments payable to Hong Leong Finance were serviced by the Partnership.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) His investment in Everfit Motor Pte Ltd (“Everfit”) for which he took $46,910 from Lee Huat.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) The Plaintiff took $88,000 from the Partnership to invest in Bikelink Pte Ltd (“Bikelink”) and another $50,000 to invest in Bikelink Agencies.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) With 6 other individuals, the Plaintiff invested in a partnership called Cycle Trade Enterprise" ("Cycle Trade") using at least $103,531.31 from the Partnership. Cycle Trade invested in two properties at No 1080 Serangoon Road, Singapore 328183 and No 21 Rowell Road in 2003 and 2004 respectively.

He told the Defendants that he had received an offer to sell 615 Balestier for $800,000.00 and asked the Defendants for details of the outstanding sum on the UOB Overdraft Facility as he intended to use the proceeds of sale to repay the loan.

After the premises were compulsorily acquired by the Housing and Development Board (“the HDB”) in or around mid-1980s, all three moved to No 75 Chua Chu Kang Road (“75 CCK”) where the Defendants took care of the Deceased until she passed away. In recognition of their devotion to her for over 30 years, the Deceased bequeathed 75 CCK to the Defendants in her Will where they reside to this day.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 The genesis of this litigation was a letter dated 29 January 2015 that the Defendants received from the Plaintiff’s solicitors, acting for the Plaintiff’s daughter Lee Ling Ling Jamie. The letter stated that the Partnership had a "substantial amount of overdraft", and requested that the Defendants make provision to set aside $1.3m to deal with this issue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 The solicitors acting for the estate of the Deceased replied to the Plaintiff’s solicitors’ letter at [14] on 13 February 2015 stating that the Deceased had passed away and that to the Defendants’ understanding, the Deceased held 50% shares in the Partnership. They requested for the value of the Deceased’s shares as at the date of her death on 19 December 2014. The Defendants were the executors of the Deceased’s estate under her Will dated 15 January 2013. The Defendants applied for and were granted probate of her estate in 2015. They distributed her assets in accordance with the Deceased’s Will in or about May and June 2016. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 On 22 February 2015, the Defendants had a meeting with the Plaintiff’s wife NLL, Jeffrey and Lee Kai Chuan Keith (“Keith”) who is the Plaintiff’s youngest son and an accountant. The following matters were discussed:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the Defendants highlighted that the Partnership's business had always been profitable year on year. Most of the UOB Overdraft Facility was used by the Plaintiff for his personal affairs. Shortly before his stroke, the Plaintiff told the Defendants that he intended to sell 615 Balestier Road to pay off the UOB Overdraft Facility; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) NLL, Jeffrey and Keith indicated they would not be dealing with the matter until the court appointed one of them as the Plaintiff’s deputy. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 The Estate’s solicitors wrote to the Plaintiff’s solicitors on 25 February 2015 to say that a substantial portion of the debt under the UOB Overdraft Facility was utilised by the Plaintiff for his personal use.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 ln the meantime, Jeffrey was in the process of formally taking over the business of the Partnership. He wrote to the HDB on 23 March 2015 seeking to transfer the tenancy of the shophouse to his personal name. After the shophouse was compulsorily acquired by HDB in 1994, it had been leased back to the Deceased in her sole name. As such, the second Defendant felt that Jeffrey had no basis to request that the lease be transferred to his name. However, as they are his aunts, the Defendants felt there was no need at that time to contest the issue even though the lease was valuable, being situated in a prime location with a long history of being a successful motorcycle workshop; and the name Lee Huat was well known in the market. The cost of the lease from HDB was only $1,499.07 per month.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 The Defendants did not receive a response from the Plaintiff’s solicitors on the issue of the lease. Instead, on or about 11 April 2015, the Estate’s solicitors received a copy of the Partnership's balance sheet, profit &amp; loss accounts and statement of rental account for the period of 1 January 2014 to 19 December 2014 (“the 2014 Accounting Records"). The 2014 Accounting Records showed that the Partnership was solvent and had earned net profits of $78,259.02 for the period of 1 January 2014 to 19 December 2014.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Due to the increasingly tense relationship between the Defendants and the Plaintiff’s family, the two sisters decided to resign from Lee Huat, which they did with effect from 1 August 2016. In the course of consolidating the records to be handed over to the Plaintiff's family, the Defendants discovered that the bank journal records from 1991 to June 1999 were missing. They alleged that throughout that period, both NLL and Jeffrey had access to the office of Lee Huat where the records were kept.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 By a letter dated 6 May 2016, Roland as the Plaintiff's deputy, wrote to the Defendants to state that the Estate had an obligation to settle all debts of the Partnership. The Estate’s solicitors replied to Roland on 16 May 2016 reiterating that "a very substantial portion of the UOB Debt was utilized by [the Plaintiff] for his personal affairs”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 In his email reply dated 20 May 2016, Roland took the position that the Estate’s solicitors were in conflict of interest because they were the solicitors who drafted the Will of the Deceased. The Defendants responded by letter dated 24 May 2016 disagreeing with Roland’s position.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Roland sent a further letter to the Defendants dated 10 June 2016 alleging that they were running the business of Lee Huat after the death of the Deceased, when in actual fact (according to the Defendants), it was his brother, Jeffrey who did. Roland also asserted that 615 Balestier Road belonged to the Plaintiff personally and had nothing to do with Lee Huat.

They alleged that the Plaintiff must have withdrawn and/or misapplied those profits since the Partnership had alleged net liabilities of $710,214 as at 19 December 2014. The Defendants contended that pursuant to s 29 of the Partnership Act, the Plaintiff was liable to account to the Partnership for all private profits withdrawn from the Partnership for the period 4 October 1981 to 19 December 2014.

Roland denied the Plaintiff managed Lee Huat solely and that the Deceased took no part in the management. He alleged that after the Plaintiff suffered a stroke in July 2014, the Deceased retained control while the Defendants, from whom Jeffrey took instructions, ran the entire business. Monies collected by Jeffrey were handed to the Defendants at the end of every business day. The Defendants also kept the cheque books of Lee Huat. They held pre-signed cheques of the Deceased that they used to withdraw monies from the UOB Overdraft Facility after the Deceased’s demise. Roland alleged that the Defendants used Lee Huat’s monies to purchase shares personally.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Roland disagreed that Tee’s Report was inaccurate and that the Defendants had repaid the $20,000 withdrawn from Lee Huat’s UOB account for the Deceased’s funeral expenses. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Roland also alleged that the Deceased had pre-signed cheques for the Partnership and the Defendants utilised those cheques to make withdrawals from the UOB Overdraft Facility account after the demise of the Deceased by backdating the cheques. He alleged that the UOB Overdraft account was operated by the Defendants who siphoned monies from the Partnership to buy shares in their own names. Thereafter, the second defendant opened another account for the Partnership with RHB bank with herself and Jeffrey as alternate signatories. Control of the RHB account was vested solely in the second Defendant who kept the cheque books.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Roland further alleged that the Defendants had never made full disclosure of the assets of the estate.

He claimed the Defendants ran the Partnership in its entirety in the mornings together with the Deceased. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 He deposed that the Plaintiff employed Yeo as an external bookkeeper to finalise the Partnership’s accounts on a yearly basis, and those accounts were prepared based on the handwritten data entries of the second Defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Roland claimed that the Partnership’s monies were controlled by the Deceased as the matriarch of the family. She would give her other children money from the Partnership including using $50,790.02 from the Partnership’s monies to bail out her eldest son Lee Kerk Hen (“Kerk Hen”) from bankruptcy. He alleged that the first Defendant utilised $233,921.56 of the Partnership’s monies to buy shares for herself between 1997 and 2000. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Roland claimed that the net profits of the Partnership, like its capital, were divided equally between the Plaintiff and the Deceased although in some years, the Plaintiff contributed more towards the capital. He deposed that Lee Huat’s former employee Giam would be able to testify to the <span class="font-italic">modus operandi</span> of the Partnership.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Roland alleged that because the UOB Overdraft Facility was secured by the Plaintiff’s personal property at 59A CCK, the Defendants as the executors of the Estate of the Deceased had chosen to frustrate any attempts by him or his family to resolve the matter with UOB. The result was that interest continued to to run on the overdraft amount of $940,986.20 (as at 19 December 2014) and the amount had ballooned to $1,119,294.78 as of 28 February 2019.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Roland denied the Plaintiff had used significant sums of money from Lee Huat for his personal affairs let alone that the sundry debtor amounts were due from the Plaintiff. Hence he brought Tee in as the expert to review the balance sheet and other relevant documents of Lee Huat to determine the value of the assets and liabilities and finalise the accounts between the Plaintiff and the Estate as at 19 December 2014.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Roland relied heavily if not totally on Tee’s Report for his contention that the Estate/the Defendants are liable to pay half plus the interest on, the UOB Overdraft Facility’s outstanding amount of $710,214. Roland also relied on the AEIC of Jeffrey to support the Plaintiff’s claim, which he described as simple and straightforward and to which the Defendants had no defence. He accused the Defendants of acting <span class="font-italic">mala fides</span> and asserted their Counterclaim was unfounded and conjured up to deny and frustrate the Plaintiff’s claim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 At the outset, the court notes that Roland does not work and has never worked in Lee Huat; he works in a local bank. Neither did he live at the shophouse after he married in 2001. He therefore does not have any personal knowledge of the goings-on in the Partnership. During cross-examination, the following evidence was adduced from Roland:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) he had limited knowledge of the business of Lee Huat, and even less of the business affairs of his father’s brothers including Kerk Hen, particularly on property ownership;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) he did not know if the Plaintiff had other sources of income apart from Lee Huat but was aware the Partnership was the Plaintiff’s main source of income;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) he was “not very sure” on matters relating to the immoveable properties held by the Deceased and why she bequeathed specific properties to the Defendants and to his uncle Kerk Hen;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Chip Huat Electronic Co. that he claimed was the first Defendant’s business was actually left to the Deceased by his grandfather and the first Defendant helped the Deceased to run it until its premises were compulsorily acquired by HDB.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 In fact, cross-examination of Roland proved him wrong on several allegations including his claim that the Deceased used the Partnership monies to bail out his uncle Kerk Hen from bankruptcy. In actual fact, the Deceased did not give Kerk Hen any money from Lee Huat. She gave Kerk Hen (who is her eldest son) $50,000 from the compensation sum paid by HDB for compulsorily acquiring Nos. 873 and 875 Upper Bukit Timah Road, which properties were jointly owned by the father and Kerk Hen.

Nothing turns on his testimony or his cross-examination. Giam started working at Lee Huat when he was about 14–15 years old in the 1960s. He left the employment of the Partnership after working there for about 10 years when the Plaintiff was running the Partnership. Giam joined Bethlehem Shipyard in the 1970s for higher pay until he was retrenched in the 1990s. Thereafter he returned to work for the Partnership at the invitation of the Plaintiff and the Deceased.  The Plaintiff was not only his employer but also a close friend.

The Partnership held stock of new motorcycles valued at $20,200 and second-hand motorcycles valued at $20,450. Consumables (accessories, motorcycle spare parts and oil) were book-valued at $17,867.50. Tee however chose a higher value (based on a 2016 stock take) of $19,415.63 as the value. The total value of all three items as at 19 December 2014 was $60,065.63 which he rounded up to $60,066.

He did not know how the balance of $114,862 arose. He noted that the amount owed by LHMPL according to Lee Huat of either $311,993 or $197,131 did not tally with the accounting records of LHMPL, which showed that the company owed Lee Huat $248,808. As LHMPL only had cash in the bank of $27,158.88, it was Tee’s view that the maximum recovery to Lee Huat of the debt owed by LHMPL would be limited to $27,158.88 regardless of the actual amount owed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 Tee’s treatment

Hence, those transactions would not form any part of the sundry debtor account. Tee opined that the Defendants were wrong to treat the pre-2002 withdrawals by the Plaintiff as new transactions that had not been accounted for. He stated that those transactions did not have any effect on his assessment of finalising the accounts of the Partnership as at 19 December 2014.

</div> The court pointed out to Tee that recoverability was not his task/function. Further, it was incomprehensible to the court how a 30 year old leasehold property belonging to the Partnership could overnight be reduced to zero value. Tee’s response was that that was his understanding of a joint tenancy.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 As for the stock in trade, Mr Toh pointed out that the value may have been progressively reduced over the years but the lowest figure was Tee’s of $60,066. Mr Toh questioned Tee why he did not utilise the stock in trade figure prepared by the Partnership for 2013 of $159,254.  Tee said the fluctuations in value had no “relevance”. In any case, he said he did not have sufficient information to arrive at a better/correct value and $60,066 was his best estimate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 As for his figure of $76,568.80 for sundry debtors which he believed would be trade receivables, Tee explained it would very likely be from LHMPL.

Tee said he did not know why the transfers were made or what happened to the funds transferred. He was reminded that the Plaintiff held 70% of the shares in LHMPL. Although the court also reminded him that it was not within his purview as an expert witness, Tee maintained that as an accountant, he had to consider the prospect of recoverability of the loans from LHMPL and he believed the sums were not recoverable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 Tee’s report

Mun noted that in arriving at the figure of $197,131, Tee had included transactions that had the word “Sundries” in their description, which Tee mentioned related to the Sundry Debtor account. As the Partnership classified Sundry Debtors and what LHMPL owed separately, Mun pointed out the transactions should not be double counted in the analysis of what was due from LHMPL.

If that leasehold property was depreciated, the total asset balance would be smaller, reducing its net asset position. Even so, the Partnership would still be in a net asset position as at 19 December 2014 and the years prior thereto even if the Woodlands Property was fully depreciated.<span style="color: rgba(179,179,179,1)"> </span>Although he had requested for it, Mun was not provided with the breakdown or ageing of the Sundry Debtors account.

Of those, he was able to reconcile the largest 450 expense items by value, which made up approximately 95% of the total expenses of $2,594,039. <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Of that amount, $2,174,876 could be reconciled against the</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> Partnership’s available bank statements or both bank statements and journals, while a further $243,472 could be reconciled against bank journals only.

Instead, they substituted the abandoned claim with a claim for a liquidated sum of $1,977,632 or $1,813,633.

Yet, in paragraph 17 of their closing submissions, that was not what the Defendants claimed.

The distinguishing obligation of a fiduciary is the obligation of loyalty. The principal is entitled to the single-minded loyalty of his fiduciary. This core liability has several facets. A fiduciary must act in good faith; he must not make a profit out of his trust; he must not place himself in a position where his duty and his interest may conflict; he may not act for his own benefit or the benefit of a third person without the informed consent of his principal. This is not intended to be an exhaustive list, but it is sufficient to indicate the nature of fiduciary obligations. They are the defining characteristics of the fiduciary.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The above extract from <span class="font-italic">Bristol and West Building Society v Mothew</span> was cited with approval by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Tan Yok Koon v Tan Choo Suan</span> [2017] 1 SLR 654 where (at [192]) the appellate court added “the hallmark of a fiduciary obligation is that the fiduciary is to act in the interests of another person”.     </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">178 The Plaintiff’s acquisition of the immovable properties and other assets itemised in [10] above using the Partnership’s monies was in clear breach of his fiduciary obligations to the Deceased. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">179 <span class="font-italic">Chip Thye’s case</span> cited by the Plaintiff in [163] is not relevant and would not assist the Plaintiff. In that case, the liquidator of an insolvent company alleged that the company’s directors had breached their fiduciary duties by transferring debts due from the fourth defendant to a related insolvent company causing recoverability problems. The directors attempted to argue that the company was solvent when the debt was transferred out but the court disagreed and held that the liquidator was right to take recoverability into consideration and that the company was already insolvent at the time the directors made the transfer.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">180 The court now turns to the testimony of the two experts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">181 Contrary to paragraph 2 of his AEIC and paragraph 1.6 of Tee’s Report, in rendering his report/opinion, Tee did not discharge his duty to the court nor did he adhere to his professed claim that his duty to the court overrode any obligation to the party (the Plaintiff) who engaged him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">182 In fact, Tee’s Report and Supplementary Report were blatantly slanted in favour of the Plaintiff.
