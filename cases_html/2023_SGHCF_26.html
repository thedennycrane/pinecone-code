I am satisfied that the DJ was correct in finding that the Wife’s efforts in taking care of D did not amount to effort “in an economic sense”, such that it could have substantially improved the KS shares and transformed them into a matrimonial asset within the meaning of s 112(10)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) (“Women’s Charter’). My reasons are as follows.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 As a starting point, s 112(10)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Women’s Charter defines “matrimonial asset” as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(10) In this section, “matrimonial asset” means – </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">     (<span class="font-italic">a</span>)  any asset acquired before the marriage by one party or both parties to the marriage – </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> (i) ordinarily used or enjoyed by both parties or one or more of their children while the parties are residing together for shelter or transportation or for household, education, recreational, social or aesthetic purposes; or </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> (ii) which has been substantially improved during the marriage by the other party or by both parties to the marriage; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">It is trite that pre-marriage assets are excluded from the matrimonial pool unless they were substantially improved by the other spouse or used for family purposes (<span class="font-italic">USB v USA</span> at [19(c)]). As the DJ noted in his grounds of decision, in <span class="font-italic">USB v </span><span class="font-italic">USA</span>, in elaborating on the meaning of “substantial improvement”, the CA highlighted that it “necessarily has an economic connotation” (<span class="font-italic">USB v USA </span>at [21]). Further, the CA made the following observations (<span class="font-italic">USB v USA </span>at [22]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">First, the improvement of such an asset must entail the investment of money or money’s worth for the improvement of the asset.</span> <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The mere increase in the value of the asset does not mean that the asset has “improved”. In order for the asset to be transformed into a matrimonial asset, there must have been investment of some kind in the asset. The paradigm example would be renovation works performed on a residential or commercial property</span>. These can easily be understood as increasing the sale value of such a property. However, even if the resale value does not increase because of market forces, a substantial renovation which makes a previously barely habitable home very much more comfortable or able to attract higher rental income could be considered a substantial improvement. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Second, the improvement must arise from effort which can be understood as having economic value. For example, if the asset is a business belonging to one spouse, then development of the business by the other spouse or by both spouses during the marriage by sustained efforts could transform that asset into a matrimonial asset. In this regard, however, carrying out administrative or minor public relations activities or being a nominal director may not be sufficient. There should be an increase in turnover or in profitability or some other measurable improvement. It will always be a question of fact as to how the efforts of the non-owning spouse have contributed to an improvement in the asset.</span> Ultimately, the court’s focus is on whether there has been some expenditure or application of <span class="font-italic">effort</span> towards the improvement of the asset (in an economic sense). </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The Wife’s submission that the words “in an economic sense” were used by the CA to describe or to qualify the words “the improvement of the asset”, rather than the nature of the effort itself, calls for a skewed reading of the final sentence in this passage which ignores everything else said by the CA in the same passage. It is a submission that is plainly wrong. Reading the above passage in its entirety, there can be no doubt that the CA has made clear what “substantial improvement” of an asset involves: either the improvement entails some investment of money or money’s worth, or the improvement arises from effort that can be “understood as having economic value”. In respect of the second limb, the CA provided an illustration by citing the example of a non-owning spouse who develops the business owned by the other spouse, taking pains to point out that minor administrative or public relations activities or being a nominal director might not be enough to be considered effort “having economic value”.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Applying <span class="font-italic">USB v USA</span>, I find that while the Wife’s actions in taking care of D were an important and weighty contribution to the marriage as a whole, they did not amount to “substantial improvement” of the Husband’s KS shares: her actions in taking care of D did not constitute an “investment of money or money’s worth” for the improvement of the said asset, nor could they be characterised as the application of effort “having economic value” towards the improvement of the asset.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 <span class="font-italic">Chen Siew Hwee</span>, which the Wife cited, also does not assist her case.

</div> the following passage from Phang J’s (as he then was) judgment (at [51] of <span class="font-italic">Chen Siew Hwee)</span>: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…This is <span class="font-italic">not</span> to state that indirect financial contributions can never justify such a finding (<span class="font-italic">cf</span><span class="font-italic"> Hoong Khai Soon</span> at [10] and [11]). But even so, and as I have already pointed out, a <span class="font-italic">direct causal connection</span> needs to be proved between the contributions and the improvement of the asset. This was clearly <span class="font-italic">not</span> proved on the facts of the present case. It is also important to note that indirect financial contributions would, in any event, <span class="font-italic">be taken into account in ascertaining the proportion </span>of the matrimonial assets that ought to be given to the spouses concerned and hence otherwise serve an important function.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 It must be pointed out, first of all, that Phang J was talking about indirect <span class="font-italic">financial </span>contributions. However, even assuming that his remarks were intended to apply to all indirect contributions (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>both financial and non-financial), it must also be pointed out that in quoting the above passage, the Wife omitted the earlier portion of this passage. I now reproduce below the omitted portion:</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51   I should note that <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Ms Koh did in fact attempt to argue that the shares had been “substantially improved” by the wife during the subsistence of the marriage through her indirect financial contributions. I rejected this argument for the simple reason that there was no direct causal connection whatsoever between these contributions and the shares</span> (see the Singapore Court of Appeal decisions of <span class="font-italic">Hoong</span><span class="font-italic"> Khai Soon v Cheng Kwee Eng</span> [1993] 1 SLR(R) 823 (“<span class="font-italic">Hoong</span><span class="font-italic"> Khai Soon</span>”) at [11] and <span class="font-italic">Lee Yong </span><span class="font-italic">Chuan Edwin v Tan Soan Lian</span> [2000] 3 SLR(R) 867 (“<span class="font-italic">Lee Edwin</span>”) at [37]). This is obviously a question of fact (see <span class="font-italic">Hoong</span><span class="font-italic"> Khai Soon</span> at [11]). Indeed, in the context of the present proceedings, there was no substantial improvement of the shares to begin with (see also the Singapore Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Shi Fang v Koh Pee </span><span class="font-italic">Huat</span> [1996] 1 SLR(R) 906). Though Ms Koh cited the Singapore Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Koh Kim Lan Angela v Choong Kian Haw</span> [1993] 3 SLR(R) 491, this particular decision is readily distinguishable from the situation in the present proceedings. In that case, the wife concerned <span class="font-italic">did</span> in fact <span class="font-italic">actually assist</span> the husband <span class="font-italic">in the business</span> which had been given to him (the husband) by his father. Mr Khoo cited, on the other hand, the Singapore High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Chow </span><span class="font-italic">Hoo Siong v Lee Dawn Audrey</span> [2003] 4 SLR(R) 481 (“<span class="font-italic">Chow </span><span class="font-italic">Hoo Siong</span>”), where S Rajendran J observed thus (at [13]–[15]):</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">The wife was not a director, shareholder, employee of or advisor to any of the companies in the group: her only link was that she was the wife of the husband.</span> That being so, the affairs of the Teo companies, even if fully disclosed by the husband to the court, would not have revealed any contributions by the wife: <span class="font-italic">even the wife did not claim that she had made any direct contribution to the Teo Shares</span>. Any “indirect” contribution she may have made – such as looking after the welfare of the family – would not appear in the records of the Teo companies. There was therefore no basis for the district judge to have made the inference from the husband’s conduct that had he made full disclosure the wife’s contribution would have been revealed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Apart from the adverse inference that the district judge drew from the husband’s conduct, <span class="font-italic">the district judge enumerated the following ‘indirect contributions’ by the wife towards the ‘improvement’ of the Teo Shares</span>:</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">It was pertinent to note that the Respondent’s admission that his salary in ESC [Eng Seng Cement Products – a company controlled by the Teo companies] remained the same “since graduation. I am the lowest paid because I’m youngest in the generation hierarchy”. Clearly Chow has enhanced the shares through his employment in ESC. By accepting no increment in salary over 13 years of service to the company, he has in fact enhanced the profits of the company and in turn the value of the shares of the companies. His sacrifice would also affect the lifestyle of his wife who, according to the Respondent, was required to share in the family expenses. She also had contributed financially towards the household and hence had participated towards the acquisition of the asset by her efforts towards the family life. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">These “contributions” were, in my view, far too remote and far too insignificant to justify the conclusion that the district judge arrived at that the Teo Shares have been improved by the contributions of the wife during the marriage.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">As the wife had not on her own or together with the husband contributed in any way to the improvement of the Teo Shares, these shares should not be included in the pool of matrimonial assets available for division between the parties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">…..</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">This decision supports, in my view, the proposition to the effect that indirect financial contributions alone are too vague and remote to justify a finding that the spouse concerned had helped to substantially improve an asset within the meaning of s 112(10)</span>… </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 From the above, it is clear that Phang J’s starting point vis-à-vis “indirect financial contributions” was that such indirect contributions “alone [were] too vague and remote to justify a finding that the spouse concerned had helped to substantially improve an asset within the meaning of s 112(10) [of the Women’s Charter]”. It is also clear that while Phang J did not rule out the possibility that indirect financial contributions might justify a finding of substantial improvement, he emphasised the need to prove a direct causal connection between the alleged contributions and the improvement of the asset. Indeed, he repeated this caution in the portion of the passage which the Wife cited (see above at [38]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Applying the principle articulated by Phang J<span class="font-italic">,</span> I agree with the Husband that the Wife has no evidence at all to show a direct causal connection between her actions in taking care of D and the value of the KS shares.

Counsel for the wife asks us to infer such a causal link but, in our view, there is no reasonable basis to draw such a link. This was not a case where a spouse’s efforts in the home frees the other spouse to devote his or her energies to the running of a business.

This was because the software was the main revenue generator for MS; and it would not have been appropriate to apply the cost approach for an intangible asset such as software. Such an approach would have also ignored MS’s future revenue streams, which showed a continuing upward trend.

</div> However, the DJ rejected the Wife’s contention that an uplift of 20% should be applied to the value he had arrived at for the MS shares to give effect to the adverse inference to be drawn against the Husband for his non-disclosure of the FY 2021 financial documents. In the DJ’s view, the percentage figure proposed by the Wife was speculative and not backed by the expert. In any event, he reasoned that he had already taken into account the Husband’s non-disclosure by applying a lower DLOM (30%).

The DJ did not record his reasons for leaving the FY 2021 financial statements out of the equation, but in his grounds of decision, he alluded (at [60]) to the Wife’s expert Mr Wan having stated in his reply affidavit that he “[would] not be amending the original position about the market value of MS… even where the new partnerships the company [had] with companies such as KBC and Schlumberger were taken into account”.

Indeed, since he had used the income approach for his valuation (as part of his hybrid approach), I accepted that the lack of the most recent financial information would have had a material impact on his valuation. Thus, for example, the much higher figure of <span class="font-italic">30.8%</span> growth provided in the FY 2021 financial report indicated that Mr Wan’s original estimate of <span class="font-italic">15%</span> growth in FY 2021 had severely underestimated MS’s profits for FY 2021.

In 2021, MS had seen its cash holdings increase significantly – by about 58% – to US$1,175,755, even after taking into account the US$430,476 paid out in dividends. Based on historical data, a cash balance of US$1,175,755 was beyond the operating needs of the company; and from the FY 2021 financial statements, all the expenses of the company amounted to only US$869,857.

Mr Wan explained that this pre-excess cash value of US$4,235,538 was 21.8% higher than the figure of US$3,477,876 derived under the income approach in his first report, because more reliable and up-to-date information had resulted in a much higher starting base and a “revised size premium discount”.

In this connection, he noted that a value of US$2.90 per share represented a 20.8% increase in the value of the shares – which was reasonably conservative given the considerably higher 45.5% increase in revenue since 2018, and the even higher 66.3% increase in profit since 2018. The value of US$2.90 per share was also reasonably conservative when comparison was drawn with a 2018 transaction wherein the Husband had purchased 19,000 shares from another shareholder at US$2.40 per share. In Mr Wan’s view, a private sale of a minority lot of shares at US$2.40 per share has already accounted for DLOM and DLOC in its sale price – and this made it a suitable base for independent comparison.

The cost approach did not accord any value to the software which helped MS to generate further revenue.  Such an approach thus failed to capture the true worth of the company.

In other words, there were limitations to his ability to exercise control over the company. On the other hand, he was not in a situation where he found himself a non-family member in a family-run company, where he held a very small stake with no role at all except as a shareholder.

In Mr Mann’s view, this would lead to an extremely thin or minute market for MS’s business.

He acknowledged that MS’s main asset was its exploitation of the software application which it had purchased from a related party (KS) for a sum of S$200,000; that MS derived the bulk of its revenue from the sales of licenses pertaining to the use of this software application; and that the software application had been written down completely by FY 2017. He also acknowledged that it would be neither practical nor correct to ascribe a nil value to the software since MS continued to use and exploit this asset in generating increased revenues and increased profits for MS – even after FY 2017. As such, he ascribed a value of S$200,000 to the software application, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the purchase price which MS had paid KS for the software. The other assets of MS, in the form of plant, equipment and inventory, were also taken into consideration before he made adjustments to reinstate the value of MS’s software application using a figure of S$200,000 (at an exchange rate of approximately 1 USD to 1.349 SGD). This meant that pursuant to the cost approach, MS was valued at S$1,446,768. Mr Mann then applied a further 25% DLOC and 50% DLOM to this figure, which eventually translated to the Husband’s 210,000 shares being valued at approximately S<span class="font-weight-bold">$126,032</span>.

</div> The change in methodology to a singular focus on the income approach had led to a new valuation of S$824,506 which was objectively very high and represented a 76.7% increase from the value of S$466,561.24 assessed by the DJ below. The Husband argued that taken at face value, this implied that MS had almost doubled in value for the financial year 2021.

If Mr Wan had applied the market approach using a 30% DLOM and a 25% DLOC, the value of the MS shares would have been S$358,479.98. The Husband argued, therefore, that by dropping the market approach in his further report, Mr Wan had drastically increased the value of MS by S$233,013.01.

Instead, as the Husband claimed, Mr Wan had unjustifiably changed the parameters and assumptions in his model (compared to those used in his first valuation), thereby artificially increasing the value of the MS shares.

</div> The Husband argued that Mr Wan should not be permitted to “arbitrarily” change the parameters of his model, as this prevented any meaningful comparison of his further report with his first report. A further element of unfairness, according to the Husband, arose from the fact that his own expert, Mr Mann, had in his further report adopted the parameters from Mr Wan’s first report: Mr Wan’s choice of different parameters in his latest report therefore meant an unfair shifting of the goalposts for the Husband and his expert.

</div> The Husband argued that Mr Wan had not made such adjustment in his first valuation because of the uncertainty as to whether projects coming online would require cashflow to sustain their continued growth. According to the Husband, this rationale should apply with even greater force in the latest valuation, given that at least six new partnerships had emerged since Wan’s first valuation, all of which would require cash flow to sustain. In other words, there should be even less reason to make an “excess cash adjustment” in the latest valuation, as compared to the first valuation.

</div> – both in his first expert report and in his further report. The DJ found that Mr Mann chose this valuation date on the specific instructions of the Husband – and the Husband has not challenged this finding on appeal. The general position is that matrimonial assets should be valued as at the date of the AM hearing (<span class="font-italic">per</span> the CA in <span class="font-italic">TDT v TDS</span> and another appeal and another matter [2016] 4 SLR 145 (“<span class="font-italic">TDT v TDS</span>”) at [50]; also <span class="font-italic">WAS v WAT</span> [2022] SGHCF 7 at [4]; <span class="font-italic">VTU v VTV</span> [2022] SGHCF 23 at [2]; <span class="font-italic">VOW v VOV</span> [2023] SGHCF 9 at [10]). As the CA noted in <span class="font-italic">Yeo Chong Lin v Tay Ang Choo Nancy and another appeal </span>[2011] 2 SLR 1157 at [39], “[o]nce an asset is regarded as a matrimonial asset to be divided, then for the purposes of determining its value, it must be assessed as at the date of the hearing”. The court does of course retain the discretion to depart from the AM hearing date – if there are facts shown to warrant the exercise of such discretion (<span class="font-italic">TDT v TDS</span> at [50]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 In the present case, no effort has been made by the Husband – either in the proceedings below or on appeal – to put forward facts which would warrant the court exercising its discretion to depart from the AM hearing date. This is in spite of the DJ’s express criticism of Mr Mann’s decision to value the shares as at 24 March 2021 instead of using the date of the AM hearing. Given that Mr Mann valued  the MS shares at a date nearly a year and a half before the actual AM hearing date, it seems to me likely that the accuracy of his valuation will be adversely affected. At the very least, Mr Mann should have furnished an explanation as to why the (significantly) earlier valuation date would have had no material impact on the accuracy and reliability of his valuation, as compared to a valuation conducted as at the date of the AM hearing.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 It is true that the Wife’s expert Mr Wan also did not use the AM hearing date as the operative date for his valuation of the MS shares: Mr Wan valued the shares as at 31 March 2022. However, I do not find the accuracy of Mr Wan’s expert report to have been adversely affected. The date he used – 31 March 2022 – was less than six months before the AM hearing date. In his report, Mr Wan expressly noted that he had not used the AM hearing date of 17 August 2022 – and he took pains to explain that it was highly unlikely that there would be a material difference between a valuation as at 31 March 2022 and a valuation as at 17 August 2022 (the ancillary hearing date).

This was because the 2018 share purchase was carried out at a time when the company was not listed; and the shares which changed hands in that transaction also formed a non-majority and non-controlling stake. Given these factors, Mr Wan explained that applying a DLOM and a DLOC to the US$2.40 figure would be double counting the discounts.

</div> However, on the evidence available, there is nothing to suggest that their previous experience of working together had forged such an intimate or special relationship between the MS shareholders that each of them would not have been capable of acting independently in the sale and purchase of shares as among themselves. As such, there is no reason for me to doubt that in the 2018 transaction, the Husband and his fellow shareholder would have factored into the pricing those considerations relating to the lack of marketability and lack of control which a minority shareholding in a company such as MS (non-listed, niche business, restrictions on share transfers, <span class="font-italic">etc</span>.) necessarily entailed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 The inference I draw above is buttressed by the fact that 96,000 treasury shares were retired in each of the two years in 2018 and 2019 at US$230,400 – which worked out to US$2.40 per share as well. To my mind, the retirement of treasury shares must (in the absence of evidence otherwise) be taken to be an assessment of the market value by the MS shareholders.  As I have noted, there is nothing in the evidence to suggest any sort of special relationship as between the MS shareholders which would have caused them not to act independently. In the retirement of treasury shares, therefore, I would expect the shareholders to have acted independently, in a manner consistent with their own commercial interests. There was no reason why the shareholders would have wanted to retire the treasury shares for anything other than what they believed to be market value, given the likelihood of these past transactions being relied on to arrive at a valuation in future sales of MS shares.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 For the reasons explained above, therefore, I am of the view that the US$2.40 figure seen in the Husband’s 2018 purchase of shares and in the retirement of treasury shares represented the market value of the shares, as perceived by the shareholders themselves. This means the figure would already have factored in those considerations relating to lack of marketability and lack of control. As Mr Wan put it in his first report, the value of US$2.40 per share would have been based on the collective knowledge and decision by the shareholders of the company premised on the outlook as well as the potential of the company.

Some of the most common adjustments made in the market approach are known as discounts and premiums.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">    (a) Discounts for Lack of Marketability (DLOM) <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">should</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> be applied when the </span><span class="font-weight-bold">comparables are deemed to have superior marketability to the subject </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">asset</span><span class="font-weight-bold">. </span>A DLOM reflects the concept that when comparing otherwise identical <span class="font-italic">assets</span>, a readily marketable <span class="font-italic">asset</span> would have a higher value than an <span class="font-italic">asset </span>with a long marketing period or restrictions on the ability to sell the <span class="font-italic">asset</span>. For example, publicly-traded securities can be bought and sold nearly instantaneously while shares in a private company <span class="font-italic">may</span> require a <span class="font-italic">significant</span> amount of time to identify potential buyers and complete a transaction. Many bases of value allow the consideration of restrictions on marketability that are inherent in the subject <span class="font-italic">asset</span> but prohibit consideration of marketability restrictions that are specific to a particular owner. DLOMs <span class="font-italic">may</span> be quantified using any reasonable method, but are typically calculated using option pricing models, studies that compare the value of publicly-traded shares and restricted shares in the same company, or studies that compare the value of shares in a company before and after an initial public offering.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">    (b) Control Premiums (sometimes referred to as <span class="font-italic">Market Participant Acquisition Premiums or MPAPs</span>) and Discounts for Lack of Control (DLOC) <span class="font-weight-bold">are applied to reflect differences between the </span><span class="font-weight-bold">comparables and the subject </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">asset</span> with regard to the ability to make decisions and the changes that can be made as a result of exercising control.

However, <span class="font-italic">participants’</span> willingness to pay a Control Premium or DLOC will generally be a factor of whether the ability to exercise control enhances the economic benefits available to the owner of the subject <span class="font-italic">asset</span>. Control Premiums and DLOCs <span class="font-italic">may</span> be quantified using any reasonable method, but are typically calculated based on either an analysis of the specific cash flow enhancements or reductions in risk associated with control or by comparing observed prices paid for controlling interests in publicly-traded securities to the publicly-traded price before such a transaction is announced.

</div> It must be noted that the lack of control associated with the Husband’s minority shareholding has already been accounted for in the DLOC of 25% which both parties adopted in their valuation methodologies. In relying on this lack of control as a factor justifying a 50% DLOM, Mr Mann has essentially accounted <span class="font-italic">twice</span> in the valuation process for the impact of a lack of control. I do not think this can be correct. In this connection, the judgment of the CA in <span class="font-italic">Liew Kit Fah</span> is instructive.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 In <span class="font-italic">Liew Kit Fah</span> (at [43]-[46]), the CA noted that Judith Prakash JA in <span class="font-italic">Thio</span><span class="font-italic"> Syn Kym </span>had<span class="font-italic"> </span>formulated the discount for lack of control as one that arose from the minority shareholder’s inability to exert control over the management decisions of the company, while the discount for lack of marketability accounted for the difficulties one would face in selling the shares of a private company with share transfer restrictions. In <span class="font-italic">Liew Kit Fah </span>itself, the judge at first instance did not disagree with Prakash JA’s formulation of the DLOC.  However, as the CA noted –</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">… he considered that the discount for lack of marketability, which accounted for the difficulty of selling shares in a narrow market, would additionally have to be affected by the unattractiveness of a bloc of shares that does not confer upon its holder control over the management decisions of the company. In other words, he took the view that a discount for lack of marketability would necessarily take into account certain matters that would already have been taken into account when one applies a discount for lack of control, namely, the minority status of the subject shares. He accordingly thought that the term “lack of free transferability” better describes the considerations that arise from the narrowness of the market for the shares in a private company,</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 The CA observed that there was no definitive answer when it came to a choice of labels, since terms such as DLOM and DLOC were not terms of art. That said, for the purposes of the appeal in <span class="font-italic">Liew Kit </span><span class="font-italic">Fah</span>, the CA held (at [45]-[46]):</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">45 …we adopt Prakash JA’s formulation in <span class="font-italic">Thio</span><span class="font-italic"> Syn Kym (HC)</span> of the discount for lack of control, which the Judge below adopted as well. This discount refers to the one that applies as a result of the minority status of the bloc of shares being sold, which consequently do not confer on its holder any ability to exert control over the management decisions of the company.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">46 <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">As to the discount for lack of marketability, we use this term, advisedly, to refer to the difficulty of selling shares in a private company as a result of the typical transfer restrictions that apply in this context. This difficulty is independent of the status of the bloc of shares being sold, and thus applies regardless whether the shares constitute a minority or majority shareholding in the company concerned</span>. See <span class="font-italic">Re Blue Index Ltd; Murrell v Swallow</span> [2014] EWHC 2680 (Ch) at [48]–[49], where Mr R Hollington QC (sitting as deputy judge of the High Court) distinguished between a discount for lack of control and a discount for non-marketability in the same manner. After all, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">considerations as to the minority status of the bloc of shares on sale are already accounted for by the discount for lack of control.</span> It appears to us that the Judge intended to adopt the same formulation that Prakash JA adopted in <span class="font-italic">Thio</span><span class="font-italic"> Syn Kym</span> (HC) at [32] when she stated that the discount for lack of marketability “arises from the difficulty of selling shares due to share transfer restrictions and the narrowness of the market, regardless of whether the shares are majority or minority shares”. The Judge, however, chose to describe this discount as a discount for lack of free transferability because he thought it better captured, without any overlap, the matters that are respectively accounted for by the discount for lack of control and the discount for lack of marketability. Nonetheless, for the sake of consistency with the authorities that have employed the term (see [43] above), we shall stick with the “lack of marketability” label. Indeed, the use of this label to refer purely to the difficulty of selling shares in a private company (unrelated to the minority status of the bloc of shares being sold) finds traction in one of the foremost authorities on the valuation of shares in private companies: Christopher G Glover, Valuation of Unquoted Companies (Gee Publishing, 4th Ed, 2004) (“Glover”) at p 188:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Unquoted shares lack <span class="font-italic">marketability</span>. This arises in two ways. First, most unquoted companies have <span class="font-italic">few</span> shareholders. The <span class="font-italic">resulting narrow market</span> for a company’s shares makes it difficult, and sometimes impossible, to deal. Secondly, many private companies’ articles of association contain <span class="font-italic">share transfer restrictions</span>. These typically provide that an intending seller must offer his shares to existing members who, if they do not like the intending seller’s offer price, <span class="font-italic">can elect to have the fair value of the shares determined by the company’s auditors</span>. Only if there are no buyers among existing members is the intending seller free to find a buyer outside the company. And in all private companies the directors usually have the right to refuse to register a transfer of shares. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 From the above passages, it is clear that the CA regarded the DLOM as something that should be assessed “independent of the status of the bloc of shares being sold, and [that] thus applies regardless whether the shares constitute a minority or majority shareholding in the company concerned”. This is because “considerations as to the minority status of the bloc of shares on sale are already accounted for by the discount for lack of control”. Following <span class="font-italic">Liew Kit Fah</span>, therefore, I am of the view that it is wrong for Mr Mann to use the lack of control associated with a minority shareholding as a reason for adopting a DLOM at the top of the range.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The income approach</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 I next address the Husband’s criticism of Mr Wan’s methodology vis-à-vis the income approach; specifically, the criticism of Mr Wan’s decision to add the amount of US$754,572 to the value of MS pursuant to an excess cash adjustment.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 The Husband pointed out that in his earlier report, Mr Wan did not make an excess cash adjustment because of the uncertainty over whether new projects coming online would require cashflow to sustain their continued growth. According to the Husband, this reasoning should apply with even greater force in Mr Wan’s further report because at least six new partnerships have emerged since his earlier valuation, and all these new partnerships would require cash flow to sustain. Compared to the earlier valuation, therefore, there would be even less reason to make an “excess cash adjustment” in the latest valuation – or so the Husband claimed.

From the 2021 financial statements we note that all the expenses of the company for the whole year – both fixed and variable – amount to only $869,857. MS therefore has kept 16 months of cash needs in the bank balances.

As it turned out, there was no need for this cash amount and in fact, MS even declared dividends amounting to $430,473.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 In essence, Mr Wan’s point was that he had not made an excess cash adjustment in the first valuation because he had been uncertain at that juncture whether the upcoming projects would require cashflow to sustain their growth. However, when the FY 2021 financial statements were made available to him, the numbers therein showed that not only did the upcoming projects <span class="font-italic">not</span> eat into MS’s (already substantial) excess cash, the company actually continued to build on its excess cash – even after declaring significant dividends for the year. In gist, not only did the two new partnerships accounted for in the first valuation <span class="font-italic">not</span> eat into the excess cash from that year, the excess cash had actually grown by over S$400,000 in spite of MS having also declared dividends of S$430,473.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 I am satisfied that Mr Wan’s explanation is reasonable, commercially sensible and backed up by the evidence of the FY2021 financial statements.

As the DJ has pointed out, the value of the MS shares pursuant to a valuation using the cost approach would be “lower than the value made under the most extreme scenario of liquidation where the company has only cash or cash equivalent’s left where it is unable to collect a single dollar from its receivables and prepayments”.

</div> In the event of liquidation, therefore, the Husband’s MS shares would be worth approximately US$273,127 (23.23% x US$1,175,755) – <span class="font-italic">excluding </span>other potential sources of value from other assets of the company. This amount of US$273,127 is already approximately three times the value of S$126,032 which Mr Mann attributed to the Husband’s shares based on his application of the cost approach.

</div> In that case (at [24]), the court quoted and relied on the following extract from “The Valuation of Unlisted Shares”, <span class="font-italic">Accountants Digest </span>No 132, (1983) at p 30:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The assets basis alone should be used only to value companies which have readily realisable assets with a value independent of the business. Property companies, investment trusts and ship-owning companies and, of course, companies in liquidation are examples of businesses which might well be valued on this basis. Nevertheless, the value of small minority holdings in such companies, other than those in liquidation, should always be justifiable in terms of the dividend yield since, barring a take-over or possibly a listing, the only way those assets are likely to represent a cash return to the minority shareholder is in the form of future dividends.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 In the present case, MS is a very different company – in terms of the sort of assets owned – as compared to “property companies, investment trusts and ship-owning companies”. As a software company, its software generates income but does not appear to have a value independent of the business. It would be highly inappropriate to apply the cost approach in valuing the MS shares.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Summary of findings on the MS Shares Issue</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 In summary, I agree with the DJ that a hybrid approach should be used such that both the income approach and the market approach are applied, with equal weightage of 50% each. However, for the reasons explained earlier, I am of the view that the DJ erred in his application of the DLOM and DLOC. In this regard, it is Mr Wan’s methodology and reasoning that I adopt: I accept Mr Wan’s proposal to apply a 30% DLOM and 25% DLOC under the income approach, and to refrain from applying any DLOM and DLOC under the market approach. I also accept that Mr Wan was correct to make the excess cash adjustment in his latest valuation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 Applying the above methodology and parameters, the Husband’s 210,000 MS shares have a value of <span class="font-weight-bold">S$753,662.50</span> [0.5 X (S$824,506

At the AM hearing below, since the DJ appeared to have chosen not to have regard to the FY 2021 financial statements, the Wife had submitted for an adverse inference to be drawn against the Husband and for a 20% uplift to be applied to the valuation of the MS shares. Since the FY 2021 financial statements were available for the purposes of the appeal, it became unnecessary for me to consider the submission for an uplift.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 Finally, I am grateful to the Husband’s counsel for pointing out that the increase in the value of the Husband’s MS shares would necessarily increase the total value of the matrimonial pool of assets. Mathematically, it follows that an adjustment will also be required to the parties’ direct financial contributions ratio. With the value of the MS shares being adjusted to S$753,662.50, there is an increase of S$287,101.26 from the valuation by the DJ below

</div> While the Wife agreed that the Husband had borne responsibility for a large part of the indirect financial contributions, she submitted that the DJ had given excessive weight to his indirect financial contributions. After all, since the Wife had stopped working from September 2015, it was only to be expected that the Husband’s indirect financial contribution far outstripped the Wife’s.

In finding the Wife responsible for a significantly larger share of the non-financial contributions and in nevertheless assessing indirect contributions at an odd 52:48 ratio in her favour, it appeared that the DJ had merely chosen a tokenistic figure to avoid pronouncing a 50:50 split of indirect contributions.

In (<span class="font-italic">UYQ v UYP </span>[2020] 1 SLR 551 (“<span class="font-italic">UY</span><span class="font-italic">Q</span>”), the CA held (at [4]) that “courts should discourage parties from applying the <span class="font-italic">AN</span><span class="font-italic">J </span>approach in a rigid and calculative manner”. In <span class="font-italic">USB v USA</span>, the CA stressed (at [43]) that the broad-brush approach was to be adopted with particular vigour by the court in assessing parties’ indirect contributions. As the CA pointed out:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">43 In our judgment, the broad-brush approach should be applied with particular vigour in assessing the parties’ <span class="font-italic">indirect</span> contributions. This would serve the purpose of discouraging needless acrimony during the ancillary proceedings. Practically, this means that, in ascertaining the ratio of indirect contributions, the court should not focus unduly on the minutiae of family life. Instead, the court should direct its attention to broad factual indicators when determining the ratio of parties’ indirect contributions. These would include factors such as the length of the marriage, the number of children, and which party was the children’s primary caregiver.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 Case law has also been instructive in elucidating the courts’ approach to the determination of the appropriate indirect contributions ratio under the <span class="font-italic">ANJ </span>approach. In <span class="font-italic">TIT v TIU and another appeal </span>[2016] 3 SLR 1137, the DJ had awarded a ratio of 100:0 in the husband’s favour for direct contributions, a ratio of 50:50 for indirect contributions and an overall ratio of 75:25 in the husband’s favour for the final ratio. On appeal, Thean JC (as she then was) found that the indirect contribution ratio was too low in favour of the wife. This was because for the first 11 years of the marriage, it was not disputed that the wife was the sole anchor at home (at [36]-[37]). The wife had relocated multiple times and had four children in the span of seven years. Thean JC found that the care of four babies and young children “born in quick succession in unfamiliar surroundings would have been extremely demanding”, notwithstanding the help the wife received from relatives at various points. Although the husband took over household matters in the 14th year of the marriage, this was with the help of a maid – when the most punishing baby-sitting years were over. As such, Thean JC found that the indirect contribution ratio should properly be 35:65 in favour of the wife. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 In <span class="font-italic">UAP v UAQ</span> [2018] 3 SLR 319, the parties were married for 22 years and had one son. The wife was a flight stewardess prior to marriage. After marriage, she was a full-time homemaker, apart from shot stints of employment. The husband was a pilot who also had other business interests. Thean JC found that the appropriate indirect contribution ratio was 80:20 in favour of the wife (at [80]). Thean JC considered that the wife had made serious sacrifices to support her husband “in his overseas attachments and night classes to obtain his post-graduate degree, and to take care of the son”. Although the wife had some external help from her mother-in-law and a domestic helper, “these were not significant in duration or extent”. The husband’s focus was on his career, which “entailed not only piloting but also the management of his side businesses and other ventures”. Taking into account these factors, Thean JC assessed the indirect contribution ratio at 80:20 in favour of the wife. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 In <span class="font-italic">TUV v TUW </span>[2016] SGHCF 15, the parties were married for about 13 years, with four children to the marriage (“the Children”). Debbie Ong JC (as she then was) found that “[the wife] had been the main caregiver of the Children during the marriage and had taken care of the Children for many years after the parties were separated” (at [39]). Although the wife had spent some time away from the family during the early years of the marriage, she had played a “much more active role in the family during the later years of the marriage, when she managed the Children’s daily needs, assisted them with their homework, and sent the Children for their various extra-curricular activities”. The wife was also heavily involved in caring for one of the children who was diagnosed with cancer: she would alternate between home and hospital to take care of all the children. As for the husband, Ong JC found that he too had contributed to the family’s welfare in no small amount (at [40]). When one of the Children was ill, the husband had “played a role in taking care of the home and the other children”. He had also “contributed substantially to the family’s welfare financially”. Ong JC observed that “due weight had to be given to the Husband’s efforts in providing a comfortable life for the family”. Ultimately, Ong JC found the ratio of parties’ indirect contributions to be 60:40 in favour of the wife.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 <span class="font-italic">BNS v BNT </span>[2017] 4 SLR 213 involved a marriage of about ten years, with two children to the marriage. Thean JC noted (at [42]) that the husband had been an involved father who had also made significant indirect financial contributions in absolute terms. On the other hand, Thean JC observed (at [43]) that the wife had been the children’s primary caregiver who had spent a “significant amount of time with the children after their birth”. She had also left her job for the sake of the family when the husband relocated to Singapore and Bangkok for work purposes. Ultimately, Thean JC assessed parties’ indirect contributions to be in the ratio of 60:40 in favour of the wife (at [44]); and in so deciding, she highlighted that this was lower than in other cases involving homemaker mothers because she had taken into account the husband’s “very substantial indirect financial contributions in absolute and relative terms”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 In <span class="font-italic">TYS v TYT </span>[2017] 5 SLR 244, parties were married for 17 years, with one son to the marriage. The husband worked as a corporate banker and rose to a management position in a large and reputable international bank. The wife worked at various companies till somewhere around the mid-point of the marriage, when she became a housewife. Thean JC found that in the initial years of the marriage, “the indirect contributions as a whole would tend to be a favour of the Husband” (at [42]). This was because “the husband was the primary breadwinner, even though both parties were working”. As a result, “the significantly higher income of the Husband allowed the Wife to enjoy a standard of living that she otherwise might not be able to”. The husband was given credit “for his significant indirect financial contributions”. On the other hand, she noted that it “must have been extremely difficult for the Wife to serve as the primary caregiver of their son who, being on the autistic spectrum, required particular care and attention.” The wife only had help for the first ten months after the son’s birth. After the husband’s relocation to the US, the wife “had to bear even greater responsibility in taking care of the son and household”. Thean JC found that “it was clear that the Wife made significant greater indirect contribution to the family across the length of the marriage than the Husband, who concentrated on his career throughout the marriage, travelled extensively, and left the household to the care of the Wife”. Parties’ indirect contributions were assessed at 75:25 in favour of the wife. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 There have of course also been cases where parties’ indirect contributions were found to be evenly split at 50:50. It is helpful to look at two cases as examples. In <span class="font-italic">UZM v UZN </span>[2019] SGHCF 26, parties were married for 14 years, with no children to the marriage. Tan Puay Boon JC found that since “the Husband was the main breadwinner in the relationship, it would naturally follow that he would have been in the position to make larger indirect financial contributions” (at [75]). On the other hand, Tan JC also observed that “the Wife made more significant indirect non-financial contributions” because “even though she was assisted by domestic helpers during the marriage, she would have taken on some managerial role to ensure the smooth running of the household (with all the accompanying logistical requirements).” The wife had also contributed to the marriage by working for the husband at his law firm instead of another law firm – at a lower pay than what she had previously earned in another law firm. This went towards enabling the husband “to enjoy success at work and to generate a substantial income”. On these facts, Tan JC assessed the ratio of indirect contributions to be 50:50.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">156 The case of <span class="font-italic">UWL v UWM</span> [2021] 5 SLR 1012 involved a marriage of about 15 years, also with no children to the marriage. Tan Puay Boon JC observed (at [47]) that since parties did not have any children, there was no need for either of them to take a role of a caregiver. Since both husband and wife were very much focused on their careers, and the court was unable to meaningfully conclude that neither had contributed to a greater extent than the other, Tan JC assessed the ratio of indirect contributions to be 50:50.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-justify font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether the indirect contribution ratio of 52:48 in favour of the Wife is correct</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">157 Having reviewed the DJ’s grounds of decision and the parties’ submissions, I accept the Wife’s submission that the DJ erred in giving too little weight to her indirect non-financial contributions. While the marriage was a childless one in the early years when both parties were working, it was not disputed – and the DJ himself found as a fact – that after the birth of the child, the Wife became the primary caregiver. The Husband, on his own account, spent the bulk of his time at work and on traveling for work. Following the Husband’s departure from the matrimonial home, the DJ again found as a fact the Wife would have “undertaken the sole responsibility of caring for the child”. Indeed, insofar as the assessment of parties’ indirect contributions was concerned, the only factor on which the DJ clearly found in favour of the Husband related to his substantial indirect financial contributions.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 Bearing in mind the findings of fact made by the DJ, I find that the indirect contributions ratio he arrived at (52:48 in favour of the Wife) was clearly inequitable to the Wife.  This was extremely close to a 50:50 split which was plainly not justified on the facts. While credit ought to be given to the Husband’s substantial indirect financial contributions, that alone cannot swing the balance towards a roughly equal ratio of indirect contributions. As the DJ himself accepted, the Wife had left her job as a lead stewardess with Singapore Airlines to take on the onerous burden of caring for the child and the home during the second half of the marriage.  It is not disputed that she did so without the assistance of a domestic helper and/or family members. Her burden has become even more onerous in the last few years since the Husband’s departure from the matrimonial home in October 2019, as she now has virtually sole responsibility for the care of their child – and at a time, moreover, when she has had to rejoin the workforce. As for the Husband, while it is true that he has been busy with working and work-related travel, I note that even he does not dispute that he has found time outside of his work hours to visit pubs to “decompress” – and it is not disputed that he has incurred significant expenditures at the pubs.

</div>
</div>
</div> Weighing all the above factors together, I find that the DJ’s apportionment of parties’ indirect contributions at 52:48 in favour of the Wife was plainly inadequate in terms of the recognition given to the Wife’s non-financial contributions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">159 I note that the DJ found the Husband’s conduct to be “not so abysmal” because he made the effort to spend some time with the child and continued “to spend weekend days with the child even after [he] moved out”. With respect, the fact that the Husband did spend some time with the child did not equate to his being an involved father: it is not disputed that since D’s birth, the Wife has been the primary caregiver who has borne substantially most of the responsibility of raising him – and even more so since October 2019. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">160 I should also point out that the DJ’s decision to award an indirect contributions ratio of 52:48 in the Wife’s favour was clearly against the grain of existing precedents. As I have noted, this was extremely close to a 50:50 split. In the cases I have examined above (at [150] to [156]), where the wife has borne the bulk of the responsibility for the child(ren) of the marriage, the courts have tended to attribute to the wife a far higher percentage of the parties’ indirect contributions than 50% – even where the husband is the sole breadwinner.

It seems to me counter-intuitive that savings should be treated as part of her reasonable expenses which the Husband should pay maintenance towards. In any event, as the Husband has pointed out, the Wife has shown no legal basis for this proposition. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">180 As to the S$70 awarded by the DJ for monthly MCST charges, I also agree with the Husband that this appears to be a reasonable amount for MCST or S&amp;C charges; and I do not find any basis to interfere with the amount awarded. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The appropriate multiplier for the Wife</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">181 Second, I also reject the Wife’s submission for the multiplier to be increased from four years to six years. I agree with the Husband that there is no rule in law that requires the multiplier to be calculated with reference to the length of time it may take the Wife to attain her last-drawn salary. In any event, the Wife has not provided any authorities to support this proposition. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">182 In considering the appropriate multiplier for the purpose of assessing the maintenance for the Wife, I note that in <span class="font-italic">Ong Chen </span><span class="font-italic">Leng v Tan Sau Poo </span>[1993] 2 SLR(R) 545 (“<span class="font-italic">Ong Chen </span><span class="font-italic">Leng</span>”), the CA approved the lower court’s methodology, which involved taking the monthly maintenance to be paid on a straight-line basis over a period of 17 years, as a compromise between the average life expectancy of a woman (70 years) and the usual retirement age of a male Singaporean worker (65), less the wife’s age (50). This methodology has been endorsed by the CA in other cases; <span class="font-italic">eg</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Wan Lai Cheng v Quek Seow Kee and another appeal and another matter </span>[2012] 4 SLR 405 (“<span class="font-italic">Wan Lai Cheng</span>”, at [89]-[91]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">183 However, in the recent case of <span class="font-italic">TNL v TNK</span>, the CA highlighted (at [62]) that the <span class="font-italic">Ong Chen </span><span class="font-italic">Leng</span> method was simply a guide rather than a rule of law. Whilst the CA clarified that it was not proposing to discard the <span class="font-italic">Ong Chen </span><span class="font-italic">Leng</span> method, it stressed that ultimately, the award of maintenance “was a multi-factorial inquiry which, pursuant to s 114(1) of the Women’s Charter”, “requires the court to have regard to all the circumstances of the case including the following matters listed in ss 114(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) to 114(1)(<span class="font-italic">g</span>) of the [Women’s Charter].” In<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">UBM v UBN </span>[2017] 4 SLR 921 (“<span class="font-italic">UBM v UBN</span>”), Debbie Ong J (as she then was) pointed out that the <span class="font-italic">Ong Chen </span><span class="font-italic">Leng</span> formula was not as helpful in cases involving younger wives, and was more helpful as a guide in cases of older wives who had taken on the homemaking role in the marriage and who had little or no earning capacity at the time of the divorce (at [77]). As Ong J explained:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The <span class="font-italic">Ong Chen </span><span class="font-italic">Leng</span> formula is not as helpful in cases involving younger wives. An application of the formula to a 35-year-old wife would yield a multiplier of 40 years – this is calculated on the basis of 85 years being the updated average life span of a woman (see <span class="font-italic">Wan Lai Cheng v Quek Seow Kee</span> [2012] 4 SLR 405 at [89]) and 40 being the solution to the equation ([(85 + 65) ÷ 2] – 35). Ironically, a young wife is far more capable of earning income and for more years than an older wife of say, 60 years of age. The older wife would have obtained a far lower multiplier of 15, being the solution to the equation ([(85 + 65) ÷ 2] – 60). This anomaly arises because the formula does not take into account the wife’s earning capacity and her income but assumes that she has none. The formula may be more helpful as a guide in cases of older wives who have taken on the homemaking role in the marriage and who have little or no earning capacity at the time of the divorce.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">184 In <span class="font-italic">ACY v ACZ </span>[2014] 2 SLR 1320 (“<span class="font-italic">ACY v ACZ</span>”), the parties were married for three years and had no children. Both parties worked, with the husband having a significantly high income of about S$48,000-S$78,000 a month (exact amount disputed), whilst the wife too had a fairly high income of about S$13,000-S$32,000 a month (exact amount disputed). In considering the appropriate multiplier to be applied to the 51-year-old wife’s maintenance, George Wei JC (as he then was) reasoned that a multiplier of three years would be excessive when the marriage itself had lasted for only three years; and that instead, a multiplier of 18 months – which was approximately half the duration of the marriage – would be appropriate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">185 In <span class="font-italic">CGX v CGY and another appeal and other matters </span>[2014] SGHC 256, the marriage had lasted about five years, with no children. The husband earned a monthly income of S$5,950 and the wife earned a monthly income of S$2,150. Thean JC (as she then was) reasoned that a two-year multiplier was appropriate because the marriage was a short childless one, and both parties were working. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">186 In the case of <span class="font-italic">Foo Ah Yan v </span><span class="font-italic">Chiam Heng Chow</span> [2012] 2 SLR 506 (“<span class="font-italic">Foo Ah Yan</span>”), the parties’ marriage had lasted for about 13.5 years. There were no children to the marriage. At the time of the AM proceedings, the wife was 60 years old and the husband was 72. Both husband and wife had retired shortly after they were married in October 1995, although the husband continued to receive an income of S$2,600 per month after retirement, by virtue of an annuity and rental income. The CA held (at [27]) that a multiplier of seven years was appropriate in the circumstances, reasoning that the husband was able to meet the maintenance order due to his (non-employment) income, while the relatively shorter length of the multiplier took into account his status as a retiree. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">187 From the above cases, it is clear that whereas the <span class="font-italic">Ong Chen </span><span class="font-italic">Leng </span>methodology continues to be a guide in cases where the wife is older and unable to rejoin the workforce, it may not be as helpful in cases where the wife is younger and able to rejoin the workforce. In the latter category of cases, there is no one formula that can be applied to determine the appropriate multiplier: the court will consider the individual circumstances of each case, and reference can be made to the factors found in the Women’s Charter. For ease of analysis, s 114(1) of the Women’s Charter is reproduced as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Assessment of maintenance</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">114.—(1)  In determining the amount of any maintenance to be paid by a man to his wife or former wife, or by a woman to her incapacitated husband or incapacitated former husband, the court must have regard to all the circumstances of the case including the following matters:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) the income, earning capacity, property and other financial resources which each of the parties to the marriage has or is likely to have in the foreseeable future;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) the financial needs, obligations and responsibilities which each of the parties to the marriage has or is likely to have in the foreseeable future;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) the standard of living enjoyed by the family before the breakdown of the marriage;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) the age of each party to the marriage and the duration of the marriage;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(e) any physical or mental disability of either of the parties to the marriage;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(f) the contributions made by each of the parties to the marriage to the welfare of the family, including any contribution made by looking after the home or caring for the family; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(g) in the case of proceedings for divorce or nullity of marriage, the value to either of the parties to the marriage of any benefit (for example, a pension) which, by reason of the dissolution or annulment of the marriage that party will lose the chance of acquiring.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">188 In my view, the factors in s 114(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), (<span class="font-italic">b</span>), (<span class="font-italic">d</span>), (<span class="font-italic">f</span>) would be most relevant in the determination of the multiplier in the present case. On the one hand, there are several factors that appear to point towards a higher multiplier. Firstly, the Husband’s income is significantly higher than that of the Wife’s. Secondly, the maintenance amount for the Wife is not a very large portion of the Husband’s income. Thirdly, the Wife has made considerable contributions in caring for the family. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">189 On the other hand, there are other factors which tilt the balance towards a lower multiplier. Firstly, as a result of my decision on the MS Shares Issue and the Indirect Contributions Issue, the Wife will get a significant increase in the amount due to her from the division of matrimonial assets.  Secondly, the Wife is relatively younger at age 42; and the marriage was of moderate length (10.5 years). Thirdly, the Husband has been the main financial provider for the family. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">190 Taking all these factors into account, I find that the multiplier of four years is reasonable. A multiplier of four years on the present case also appears to me to be is in line with the range of multipliers seen in the cases I examined earlier (at [184] To [186]).  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether the Wife should receive rental expenses</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">191 As for the Wife’s submission for an additional S$54,000 to cover 18 months of rent in a scenario where she is unable to buy out the Husband’s share of the matrimonial home, I find this submission to be without merit as well. No such rental expenses have actually been incurred by the Wife; and it is not certain whether rental expenses will even be necessary. As the Husband has pointed out, therefore, the Wife’s submission really amounts to a claim for contingent maintenance. An award of contingent maintenance would in this case negate the whole point of a lump sum maintenance award – which was to enable parties to achieve a clean break.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">192 For the avoidance of doubt, I am not saying that a maintenance award cannot include rental expenses. That is certainly not the case. In <span class="font-italic">UEB v UEC </span>[2018] SGHCF 5 for instance, Debbie Ong J (as she then was) held that “both the moneys that go towards rent and the moneys that go towards a mortgage loan… are accommodation expenses which the court can take into consideration” in determining maintenance (at [7]). The question is whether there is sufficient evidence before the court of such expenses. As I have noted above, the Wife’s claim in this case for an additional sum of S$54,000 for rental expenses appeared to me to be speculative.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">193 I would add that given the findings I have made in the Wife’s favour on the MS Shares Issue and the Indirect Contributions Issue, the amount she will now receive from the division of matrimonial assets will be increased significantly. Both counsel have agreed that following from the adjustment of the parties’ direct financial contributions ratio (at [137]), the monetary value of the Wife’s share will increase from S$855,519.50

As the Husband has pointed out, both parents are equally responsible for providing for their children, although their precise obligations may differ depending on their means and capacities (<span class="font-italic">AUA v ATZ</span> at [41]). The Husband’s contribution towards the son’s maintenance has already been set at a very high rate – 90% of the assessed maintenance amount, versus the Wife’s 10%. In my view, this difference in the parties’ respective contributions to their son’s maintenance sufficiently accounts for the difference in their earning power. I would also highlight that in addition to being responsible for 90% of the assessed Child Maintenance amount, the Husband is required to make full and direct payment for D's school fees, medical expenses, dental expenses and current insurance policies.

As noted earlier (at [193]), counsel for both parties have agreed that the Wife’s entitlement to the matrimonial pool is accordingly increased to S$1,199,050.98.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">204 The Wife’s appeal in respect of the KS Shares Issue, the Maintenance Issue and the Child Maintenance Issue is dismissed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">205 In respect of the matrimonial home, the DJ had in the AM hearing below given the Wife three months from the date of his decision in which to exercise her right of first refusal to purchase the Husband’s share of the matrimonial home. Given that the Wife has had some eight months since the filing of her notice of appeal to mull over this issue, I do not think another three months’ wait is necessary. As such, the Wife has 14 calendar days from the date of this judgment in which to notify the Husband in writing of any decision on her part to exercise her right of first refusal. If the Wife decides against buying out the Husband’s share of the property, then the Husband has 14 calendar days from the expiry of the deadline given to the Wife, in which to notify the Wife in writing of any decision on his part to buy out her share. If neither side wishes to take over the property, then it will be sold on the open market within seven months from the expiry of the above-mentioned 28 calendar days, with both the Husband and the Wife having joint conduct of the sale; net sale proceeds after settling outstanding mortgage loans (if any), CPF refunds (if any) and costs and expenses of sale to be divided in the final ratio I have determined. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event either the Wife or the Husband decides to buy over the other party’s share of the matrimonial home, the value of the matrimonial home as assessed by the DJ shall apply for the purpose of determining the amount to be paid by the Wife or the Husband, as the case may be.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">206 As to the costs of the appeal, I am inclined to think that since the Wife has succeeded on the two most important issues in her appeal (in terms of the impact on the state of her finances), she should be awarded the costs of the appeal, but these costs should be adjusted to take into account the fact that she has failed on the remaining issues raised. I will hear parties before I make any order on costs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">207 Post division of matrimonial assets, based on the final ratio I have determined, the Wife should have in her name assets totalling a higher value than the aggregate amount to which she is entitled. I leave it to parties to work out the necessary computations. Parties may submit the draft order of court for my approval before extracting it. Both have liberty to apply in the event any clarification is required. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify"></div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Mavis Chionh Sze Chyi<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Chong Siew Nyuk Josephine and Kym Calista Anstey (Josephine Chong LLC) for the Appellant.</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Johnson Loo Teck Lee and Lew Zi Qi (Drew &amp; Napier LLC) for the Respondent.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
