It is in relation to this second <span class="font-italic">Coco </span>requirement, that <span class="font-italic">I-Admin </span>states that an obligation of confidence will be found where the confidential information is accessed or acquired without the plaintiff’s knowledge or consent. In other words, where confidential information was accessed without knowledge or consent, this fact fulfils the second requirement of <span class="font-italic">Coco</span> that the confidential information was “imparted in circumstances importing an obligation of confidence”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 There is therefore no basis for the plaintiff’s assertion that under <span class="font-italic">I-Admin</span>, there is no need to prove that the information has the necessary quality of confidence about it, where the information was surreptitiously accessed and used without the plaintiff’s knowledge or consent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 To support their position that there is no need to comply with the first requirement of <span class="font-italic">Coco</span>, the plaintiff also relied on <span class="font-italic">Imerman v Tchenguiz</span> [2011] 2 WLR 592 (“<span class="font-italic">Imerman</span>”) at [68] where the court held that just as a defendant “who adventitiously, but without authorisation, obtains information in respect of which he must have appreciated that the claimant had an expectation of privacy” is a breach of confidence, “it must, <span class="font-italic">a fortiori</span>, extend to a defendant who intentionally, and without authorisation, takes steps to obtain such information.”

Hence, even in <span class="font-italic">Imerman</span>, the court did not state that it is assumed that information is confidential where the defendant surreptitiously accessed it without the plaintiff’s knowledge or consent. In reaching the modified approach at [61] of <span class="font-italic">I-Admin</span>, the court did consider <span class="font-italic">Imerman</span> (at [59]). It is thus not correct for the plaintiff to submit that the court’s modified approach at [61] of <span class="font-italic">I-Admin</span> did not consider or does not apply to an <span class="font-italic">Imerman </span>situation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 In addition, while the Australian cases of <span class="font-italic">Whillans</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>and<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Ithaca Ice Work </span>indicate that the courts there would more readily find that information was confidential where it was surreptitiously obtained, they did not go so far as to state that there is no need in such situations to examine whether that information is confidential. Indeed, in <span class="font-italic">Whillans</span>, before McPherson JA’s <span class="font-italic">dicta</span> which the plaintiff relies on, McPherson JA also stated that he had no doubt that the information there was confidential to the respondent even if the names of the patients were in fact known to the respondent by reason of his having treated them, as the “critical feature was the combination of those names with the addresses of the patients, and their compilation or collection in a single, simple and readily accessible form”. In other words, even in <span class="font-italic">Whillans</span>, the court analysed the information in coming to its view that it was confidential. This must be so, since information which is clearly in the public domain, would not be treated as confidential information, even if it was surreptitiously obtained.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 Hence, my view is that, following<span class="font-italic"> I-Admin </span>at [61], the plaintiff has to prove that the Copied Data for which he asserts his claim of breach of confidence, “has the necessary quality of confidence about it”.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether a claimant for breach of confidence must particularise each and every document for which he claims confidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 The second and third defendants further assert that the plaintiff must particularise each and every of the documents claimed to be confidential, relying on <span class="font-italic">Chiarapurk Jack </span><span class="font-italic">and others v Haw Par Brothers International Ltd and another and another appeal </span>[1993] 2 SLR(R) 620 (“<span class="font-italic">Chiarapurk Jack</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">Stratech Systems Ltd v Nyam Chiu Shin (alias Yan Qiuxin) and others </span>[2005] 2 SLR(R) 579 (“<span class="font-italic">Stratech</span>”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 The plaintiff disagrees with this. He relies on <span class="font-italic">Imerman</span> at [78], where the court rejected the imposition of a requirement that the claimant must identify each and every document for which he claims confidence and why. The court in <span class="font-italic">Imerman</span> stated that in that case, the imposition of such a requirement was unnecessary (as it is obvious that many, probably most, of the documents are confidential or contain confidential information), disproportionate (because of the sheer quantity of documents copied) and unfair (in light of the number of the documents copied, and the fact that the copying was done without the claimant’s knowledge, let alone his consent). The court found that it was oppressive and verging on the absurd to suggest that before the claimant could obtain any equitable relief, he must first identify which out of 250,000 documents is confidential.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 The plaintiff also cites the decisions of the Hong Kong Court of First Instance in <span class="font-italic">Sim Kon Fah v JBPB and Co (a firm)</span> <span class="font-italic">and others </span>[2011] 4 HKLRD 45 at [53] and <span class="font-italic">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd v Shi Huaifang</span> [2019] HKCFI 1212 at [52]–[53] for the proposition that the application of the principles requiring particulars must be applied with a degree of practical common sense and that the adequacy of particularity in each case depends on its own facts. The plaintiff submits that it would be disproportionate, unfair, oppressive and verging on the absurd to suggest that the plaintiff must particularise each and every one of the more than 50,000 documents that were copied.

</div> Moreover, the rationale of the requirement to particularise the confidential information is to prevent oppressiveness to the defendant, by allowing the defendant to know the case to meet. However, in this case, the second and third defendants had provided the plaintiff with a schedule of all the Copied Data that they were delivering up pursuant to the Interim Injunction.

</div> They were hence fully aware of the documents in the Copied Data and could not now say they did not know the case they have to meet in terms of the confidential documents.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 In my view, the second and third defendants’ reliance on <span class="font-italic">Stratech </span>is based on an unjustifiably stretched reading of the decision. At [27] of <span class="font-italic">Stratech</span>, the Court of Appeal noted that the plaintiff did not specify in its pleadings or evidence the confidential information allegedly taken. In the further and better particulars, the plaintiff in <span class="font-italic">Strate</span><span class="font-italic">ch</span> merely stated, “[t]he 1st and 2nd Defendant disclosed all the Plaintiffs’ information contained in the 5 computers at LTA as well as confidential information acquired by them in the course of employment.” The court found (at [36]) the plaintiff’s claim there to be too sweeping because it took the position that, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, password protected information had to be confidential information. The court then stated (at [39]) that the plaintiff there ought to have been able to establish its case with specificity. A reading of <span class="font-italic">Stratech </span>indicates that while the Court of Appeal required such greater specificity, it did not mandate that every document claimed to be confidential has to be particularised.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 This was also the view of the court in <span class="font-italic">QB Net Co Ltd v Earnson Management (S) Pte Ltd and others</span> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 1 (“<span class="font-italic">QB Net</span>”) when it considered <span class="font-italic">Stratech</span>. The court noted (at [74]) that unlike the plaintiff in <span class="font-italic">Stratech</span>, the plaintiff in <span class="font-italic">QB Net</span> had “[identified] the various manuals that constituted the confidential information” and “the plaintiff had adduced evidence to show how such information was confidential in nature. Therefore, the plaintiff’s claim was adequately particularised.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The analysis in <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure 202</span><span class="font-italic">1 </span>vol 1 (Cavinder Bull gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2021) (“<span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure</span>”), at para 18/12/42 also highlights a requirement for clear and precise pleadings, but without mandating that each and every document be particularised. It states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Cases of alleged breach of confidence ought to be clearly and precisely pleaded, and particulars of the confidential information must be given. Moreover, <span class="font-italic">some</span> particularity of what is alleged to have been taken is required (<span class="font-italic">Speed Seal Products Ltd. v. Paddington</span> [1984] F.S.R. 77; also, <span class="font-italic">Chiarapurk Jack &amp; Ors. v. Haw Par Brothers International Ltd. &amp; Anor. and another appeal</span> [1993] 2 S.L.R.(R.) 620, CA where it was held that where a party seeks to restrain another from misusing allegedly confidential information, he is required to give particulars of the information to show that it is confidential and that there is a need to restrain the act). </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 In <span class="font-italic">Chiarapurk Jack</span>, the Court of Appeal expressed concern (at [34]) that the plaintiff provided “merely a statement that the details of the manufacturing process are confidential” and that this emanated from “a source that claims no familiarity with. the manufacture of the product”. Hence, the court held (at [38]) that it was “not sufficient for the respondents merely to allege, and by an officer who was not personally conversant with the details, that there was a manufacturing process, the detailed particulars of which were confidential … It was incumbent on them to be specific before injunctions could be justified on the basis of the confidentiality of the manufacturing process”. The court also noted (at [42]) that a statement of claim averring a whole list of confidential information and a duty of confidence in a defendant not to disclose such information would constitute a fishing expedition if no particulars are given.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 I note that in the survey of the law in the United Kingdom on this point in Charles Phipps <span class="font-italic">et al</span>, <span class="font-italic">Toulson &amp; Phipps on Confidentiality </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 4th ed, 2020) (“<span class="font-italic">Toulson &amp; Phipps</span>”), the position is also that a claimant is not required to particularise each and every document. At para 4-011, the authors state that “it would be wrong to cast the claimant’s obligation of particularisation as an absolute rule, applicable without modification in every case. Much may depend on the manner in which a defendant originally came by the information alleged to be confidential”. <span class="font-italic">Imerman</span> is cited as one example, along with other categories in which a claimant may not be required to identify with specificity every item of information alleged to be confidential (<span class="font-italic">Toulson &amp; Phipps</span> at paras 4-011–4-012). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 In this case, the plaintiff has specified in his Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief (“AEIC”), documents from the Copied Data that have been taken from him and used, and why they were confidential.

To do so would create an erroneous incentive for defendants to extract even larger volumes of data to make it harder for a plaintiff to particularise each and every document.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 At the same time, within the facts of each case, the principle remains that there must be enough particulars of sufficient specificity to allow the defendant to know the case to meet.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 In summary, while the plaintiff has to establish its case that there is breach of confidence with specificity, there is no strict legal requirement that the plaintiff must identify each and every document for which he claims confidence for.

This states that the court may presume the existence of any <span class="font-italic">fact</span>, “that evidence which could be and is not produced, would if produced be unfavorable to the person who withholds it”. While there is a factual matrix that the court examines in assessing if information is confidential, whether documents are confidential or not is ultimately a legal finding, not a purely factual one, and hence not suitable to be determined via a presumption of adverse inference in reliance on s 116 illus (g) of the Evidence Act. Moreover, as set out above, I find that there is no legal requirement for the plaintiff to particularise each and every confidential document that he seeks protection for. In addition, during the re-examination of the plaintiff, counsel for the plaintiff sought to bring the plaintiff through other documents from the Copied Data, that were not in his AEIC but were in the Agreed Bundle of Documents. The plaintiff notes that counsel for the second and third defendants acknowledged that such documents could be found in the Agreed Bundle of Documents and hence such documents are part of the evidence in court. In <span class="font-italic">Press Automation Technology Pte Ltd v Trans-Link Exhibition Forwarding Pte Ltd</span> [2003] 1 SLR(R) 712, the court held (at [22]) that the effect of the parties’ agreement to include a report as one of the agreed documents was that they had agreed that it would be admissible without formal proof.

However, the plaintiff did explain how the other enumerated items were private and confidential to the plaintiff.

It contains descriptions of the emails, such that one can broadly make out contents of the emails. The description of the emails in the index (save for items no 7, 29, 30, 31, and 34 of the index which the plaintiff said were not part of the Copied Data) show that they relate to communications concerning the plaintiff’s private life, including his personal finances and business dealings.

While the second and third defendants submit that the Copied Data reveals fraud and criminal breach of trust by the plaintiff, they have not pleaded it. It is trite law that a party should be bound by its pleaded case: see <span class="font-italic">Tan Poh Choo Joscelyn v Tan Poh Seng and another </span>[2014] SGHC 22 at [81] and <span class="font-italic">Enholco Pte Ltd v Schonk, Antonius Martinus Mattheus and Another</span> [2015] SGHC 108 at [2]. Neither did they put this contention to the plaintiff for him to explain his position. In <span class="font-italic">Suhha Natrajan v The Bank of East Asia Ltd</span> [2017] 1 SLR 141 the court held (at [48]) that allegations of vital importance ought to have been put directly to the plaintiff who should be given the opportunity to address it. This was not done. Importantly, the second and third defendants have also not provided any evidence to support this allegation. I find this submission to be without merit.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether the second and third defendants’ actions were justified because of the plaintiff’s alleged failure to comply with discovery/disclosure obligations in the Matrimonial Proceedings and Trust Proceedings </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 In response to the second and third defendants’ submission that they were justified to extract the Copied Data because of the plaintiff’s duty of disclosure in the Matrimonial Proceedings and the Trust Proceedings, the plaintiff points to the following.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 First, the third defendant’s evidence is that he downloaded the Copied Data in October 2016. However, there were no extant legal proceedings when the third defendant allegedly downloaded the Copied Data in October 2016. The Matrimonial Proceedings were commenced by the first defendant in October 2017. The Trust Proceedings were eventually initiated by the first defendant in December 2017.

</div> is not borne out on the facts: since the Trust Proceedings was only filed on 18 December 2017, while Interim Judgment in the Matrimonial Proceedings was only entered on 29 October 2018. Thus, the exchange of documents for matrimonial assets would not have commenced before that.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Second, there has been no finding by the Family Justice Courts that the plaintiff breached disclosure obligations nor are there live issues of breach of disclosure obligations in the Matrimonial Proceedings or Trust Proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Third, the second and third defendants are not even parties in the Matrimonial Proceedings or the Trust Proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Fourth, the third defendant did not just download documents relating to the Matrimonial Proceedings or the Trust Proceedings. Indeed, the third defendant testified that he was not able to isolate the specific documents and hence copied from the plaintiff’s email folders, documents that were not related to the Matrimonial Proceedings or the Trust Proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 The plaintiff submits that the court should not “condone the illegality of self-help consisting of breach of confidence (or tort) because it is feared that the other side will itself behave unlawfully and conceal that which should be disclosed”: see <span class="font-italic">Imerman </span>at [107].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 The second and third defendants rely on <span class="font-italic">Wee </span><span class="font-italic">Shuo Woon</span> for the proposition at [50] that “[s]ince it is the court’s equitable jurisdiction that is being engaged, it remains open to the court to refuse relief on the general principles affecting the grant of a discretionary remedy, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, on such grounds as inordinate delay, a lack of clean hands or general iniquity.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 In that case, the appellant was employed as a security specialist of the respondent company. The respondent sued him for breaching his employment contract. After the commencement of the suit, the respondent’s computer systems were hacked. Data, including emails between the respondent and its solicitors pertaining to the suit, were uploaded onto the internet. The appellant filed an affidavit referring to such emails and exhibited copies of them. The Assistant Registrar (“AR”) allowed the respondent’s application to expunge the emails. The High Court and Court of Appeal affirmed the AR’s decision. It was in this context that the Court of Appeal made its observations at [50]. Notably, they made this with reference to the appellant who had stealthily extracted the emails, not the respondent. This is clear from the Court of Appeal further stating at [50] that public policy “also requires that a litigant should not be permitted to make use of a copy of privileged document which he has obtained by stealth, trickery or otherwise acting improperly”. At [52], the Court of Appeal further emphasised that “the equity in favour of restraining the use of privileged documents is even stronger in the case of a party who had its privileged documents accessed and taken through stealth and unlawful means.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Far from assisting them, the Court of Appeal’s <span class="font-italic">dicta</span> in <span class="font-italic">Wee Shuo Woon</span> about the public policy against accessing and taking the Copied Data through stealth, trickery or otherwise improper conduct applies with equal force here against the second and third defendants.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 According to the third defendant, he was the sole person involved in the downloading of the Copied Data. There is no firm evidence suggesting otherwise. The third defendant’s evidence is that he had initially borrowed the plaintiff’s Personal Laptop to watch a movie because his own laptop was not functioning. Besides the plaintiff’s personal account, there was another account on the Personal Laptop that the plaintiff had created for the second defendant’s personal use (“the second account”). The second account could not access any of the Copied Data. However, as the plaintiff could not remember the password for the second account, he logged into his personal account.

But the third defendant went far beyond that limited permission. Even if the third defendant had accidentally accessed the plaintiff’s work email account and saw emails related to the Trust and the Will, he could have decided to ask the plaintiff about them rather than download the Copied Data without the plaintiff’s awareness or consent. Instead, he stealthily downloaded the Copied data.

</div> He then, on his evidence, kept his actions secret from the plaintiff for more than a year until his actions came to light during the Trust and Matrimonial proceedings. When the second defendant was told by the third defendant, he did not tell the third defendant that this was wrong, but instead reviewed the Copied Data and forwarded some of them to the fourth defendant for use in the first defendant’s case in the Matrimonial Proceedings. The second and third defendants seek to rely on <span class="font-italic">Wee Shuo Woon </span>to allege that the plaintiff should be refused relief because of his lack of clean hands. But what <span class="font-italic">Wee Shuo Woon </span>says, is that a litigant should not be permitted to make use of a copy of privileged document which he has obtained by stealth or by acting improperly. That applies with full force to the second and third defendants. It is they who have the unclean hands.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Moreover, as the plaintiff has pointed out, relying on <span class="font-italic">E C Investment Holding Pte Ltd v Ridout Residence Pte Ltd and others</span><span class="font-italic"> and another appeal</span> [2012] 1 SLR 32 at [92], the conduct complained of must have an immediate and necessary relation to the equity sued for, and it must be a depravity in the legal as well as in the moral sense.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 In this case, the conduct complained of (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the failure of the plaintiff to disclose documents to the first defendant in the Matrimonial Proceedings and Trust Proceedings) does not have an immediate and necessary relation to the equity sued for by the plaintiff, as the second and third defendants are not even parties in the Matrimonial Proceedings and Trust Proceedings. Those proceedings were not even in existence at the time the third defendant downloaded the Copied Data.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 The second and third defendants’ case is essentially, that they have a right to access someone else’s computer and extract a mass of emails belonging to that person, without that person’s awareness or consent, on the justification that that person may not comply in the future with his disclosure or discovery obligations in court proceedings that have not been initiated, and for which they will not be a party to. Moreover, due to the challenges of isolating the relevant emails, they are entitled to access and extract emails which are not even related to such future court proceedings. The public policy concerns highlighted by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Wee </span><span class="font-italic">Shuo Woon </span>would be greatly amplified if this were to be a valid defence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 I therefore find that there is absolutely no merit to the second and third defendants’ defence that they are entitled to the Copied Data because of the plaintiff’s alleged failure in discovery or disclosure obligations in the Matrimonial Proceedings or Trust Proceedings. It is undisputed that the Matrimonial Proceedings or Trust Proceedings had not yet commenced, either at the point where the third defendant accessed and downloaded the Copied Data in October 2016 or when the third defendant said he informed the first and second defendant of this in October 2017. Nor were they parties to the eventual Matrimonial Proceedings or the Trust Proceedings. It is also undisputed that the Copied Data was not even restricted to documents relating to the Matrimonial Proceedings or the Trust Proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether the second and third defendants are entitled to access, extract and use the Copied Data because they are beneficiaries of the Trust</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 The second and third defendants’ other defence relates to their status as beneficiaries of the Trust set up by their grandfather. Their father, the plaintiff, is the trustee. Their case is that the plaintiff had hidden the existence of this Trust from them. When it was discovered, the plaintiff did not provide them with the necessary documents about the Trust. Hence, the second and third defendants are entitled to access, extract and use the Copied Data without the plaintiff’s awareness or consent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 I find that there is no merit to this defence for the following reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 First, the second and third defendants do not dispute that the third defendant was not able to identify or isolate what were the documents that related to the Trust, and that he extracted much more documents than just those relating to the Trust.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Second, even <span class="font-italic">if</span> the second and third defendants were entitled to documents relating to the Trust, the proper approach would have been to seek remedy through the court rather than to stealthily extract it without the awareness or consent of the plaintiff. This court does not condone a litigant hiding documents that should properly be disclosed as part of legal proceedings. But at the same time, it is a simple legal principle that if a father has his son’s belongings and refuses to return them to him, the son is not entitled to break into the father’s house to surreptitiously retrieve it. This principle does not change just because such belongings take the form of confidential information. I fully endorse the principle set out in <span class="font-italic">Imerman</span> at [107]: “[a]re the courts to condone the illegality of self-help consisting of breach of confidence (or tort), because it is feared that the other side will itself behave unlawfully and conceal that which should be disclosed? The answer, in our judgment, can only be: No.” What the second and third defendants did was plainly wrong. The first and fourth defendants recognised this and chose not to contest the plaintiff’s action for breach of confidence. The second and third defendants did not recognise this and ironically chose to justify their conduct by pleading that it was the plaintiff who came to court with unclean hands.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 Therefore, in my judgment, the second and third defendants are not entitled to access and extract the Copied Data without the awareness or permission of the plaintiff, simply because they assert that they are beneficiaries of the Trust.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Permanent Injunction</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 The plaintiff’s primary position on the Permanent Injunction, is that there should be no exceptions permitting the first and fourth defendants to use any Copied Data in the Matrimonial Proceedings. Their secondary position is that if the Court is minded to retain the existing exceptions ordered by the Court under the Interim Injunction Order dated 14 September 2020 (“Interim Injunction”), the scope of exceptions there should not be expanded to permit the use of additional documents by the first and fourth defendant. <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">The Permanent Injunction should likewise have no exceptions for the second and third defendants.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 The defendants seek certain limitations in the Permanent Injunction. First, that the injunction contain the limitation that the first, second and third defendants should be at liberty to use their knowledge or recollection of the Copied Data to support any application that they may make to the Court for specific discovery in any proceedings, and if the Court allows their application, they shall be at liberty to use and refer to the documents so ordered to be disclosed in those proceedings, subject always to the law of evidence (the “Knowledge Exception”).

But having breached confidence in relation to the Copied Data, the defendants should put the plaintiff back in the position that he previously was in.

Moreover, as far as the first and the fourth defendants are concerned, nothing has changed from the time Justice Andrew Ang made the injunction order against them in September 2020 to the present stage. They elected not to participate in the trial. They offered no evidence. Therefore,</span> their present position after the trial is no better than that which existed at the time Justice Andrew Ang made the Injunction Order against them in September 2020. Allowing the additional exceptions, would be to allow the first and the fourth defendants to take advantage of their own wrongs. The documents that the first and fourth defendants want to use in the Matrimonial Proceedings by way of exceptions to the Permanent Injunction, constitute all of the Copied Data that they have adduced in the Matrimonial Proceedings to date. If the wide exceptions sought by them are allowed, it will render the entire Permanent Injunction futile and useless. One of the primary reasons Justice Andrew Ang rejected the request for the exceptions to be broadened was that it would have the effect of undermining the entire injunction order itself, and he said: “[s]till, I think that the right balance in this particular case is not to overextend the wife’s right to the access to the documents such that – as I have heard Mr Liew – it then renders the injunction just something not worth the paper it’s written on.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 The court in <span class="font-italic">Tentat Singapore Pte Ltd v Multiple Granite Pte Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> and others </span>[2009] 1 SLR 42 (“<span class="font-italic">Tentat</span>”) held (at [40]) that: “[w]hen a document has become a part of the record in any court proceedings, the information in the document enters into the public domain, and it will be too late to preserve the privilege in the document.” In <span class="font-italic">Tentat</span>, the court noted that reference to privileged information in the affidavit of a party was insufficient to be considered as having “entered into evidence”, as the case has not been heard. The filing of the affidavit was “preparatory to the admission of evidence”. In this case, orders have been made in FCD 4639, although they do not explicitly reference the documents mentioned at para 17 of the SOC. The plaintiff submits that the affidavits have not entered into evidence as they have not been heard on. As the first and fourth defendants have chosen not to participate in the trial, there is no evidence from them against this.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96  In any event, it is clear that while the affidavits were filed into court, there have been no request to inspect them. They were not disseminated to any third party apart from the court. This is also the position asserted by the first and fourth defendants.

However, the question remains as to whether the Permanent Injunction should cover these documents.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97  In response to the plaintiff’s argument that nothing has changed since the Interim Injunction to warrant variations to it, the first and fourth defendants submit that what has changed following the trial, is the evidence adduced at trial which confirms their limited role in the entire matter.

This would limit the use of the Copied Data to the more substantive matters where the Copied Data has been filed into court as affidavits in FCD 4639, without rendering the injunction useless.

The court also noted in <span class="font-italic">I-Admin</span> that these remedies do not set right the loss already suffered, but equitable monetary remedies do not guarantee more ideal outcomes. The reason is that it is wildly speculative to determine how much of the profits came from the defendant’s own capital, given that it has been intermingled with the confidential information. In addition, the concern in <span class="font-italic">I-Admin</span> was what kind of remedy would place the plaintiff in a position if the duty of confidence had not been breached.

</div> The decision there was premised upon Article 8 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms 1950 (also known as the European Convention on Human Rights (“ECHR”)). At [66], the court noted that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… it would be a hollow protection of that right if in a particular case in breach of confidence without consent details of the confider’s private and family life were disclosed by the confidant to others and the only remedy that the law of England allowed was nominal damages. In this case an injunction or order for delivery up of all copies of the medico-legal report against the defendant will be of little use to the claimant. The damage has been done. The details of the claimant’s private and family life are within the archives of the National Health Service and she has been unable to retrieve them.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The Jersey case of <span class="font-italic">Harry Royston </span>also referred to <span class="font-italic">Archer</span> and <span class="font-italic">Cornelius</span> as authority.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 Two observations can be made from the above. First, the decision in <span class="font-italic">Cornelius </span>was premised on Art 8 of the ECHR, which protects the “right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence”. The plaintiff cites the Australian case of <span class="font-italic">Giller v Procopets</span> (2008) 24 VR 1 (“<span class="font-italic">Giller</span>”) which held (at [431]) that the basis for damages for distress caused by a breach of confidence is the Lord Cairns’ Act, which he submits is <span class="font-italic">in</span> <span class="font-italic">par</span><span class="font-italic">i materia </span>with para 14 of the First Schedule to the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (“SCJA”). The plaintiff submits that there is therefore juridical basis to award damages for injury to feelings caused by breach of confidence, based on para 14 of the First Schedule of the SCJA.

</div>
</div>
</div> While I agree that there is such juridical basis in the SCJA, the point arising from <span class="font-italic">Cornelius</span> is not that it derived its juridical basis from Art 8 of the ECHR, but that in its reasoning, the court in <span class="font-italic">Cornelius</span> was consciously seeking to ensure that the protection of the rights guaranteed under Art 8 of the ECHR was not made “hollow”. Singapore has not signed or ratified the ECHR. There is no corresponding need to ensure effective protection of any rights under Art 8 of the ECHR. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 Second, the court in <span class="font-italic">Cornelius</span> was concerned with the fact that injunctions and delivery up cannot right the wrong done to the plaintiff because the confidential information had already been irretrievably released into the public domain. The other two English cases cited by the plaintiff, <span class="font-italic">Archer</span> and <span class="font-italic">Harry Royston</span> also involved dissemination of confidential information into the public domain, in the form of the press. In contrast, there is no dissemination here of the Copied Data to third parties other than the court. In this case, injunctions and delivery up can right the wrong done to the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 Moreover, the plaintiff has failed to substantiate with evidence, his claim that he has suffered any injury to his feelings, and pain and suffering, beyond a bare assertion in his AEIC.

</div> Neither has the plaintiff shown that any such injury to feelings is caused by the breach of confidence.

</div> this trial was not bifurcated, which means that any award for damages awarded is to be assessed based on evidence led at the trial. The plaintiffs were aware of this from the outset.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 The first and fourth defendants highlight that both <span class="font-italic">I-Admin </span>and <span class="font-italic">Clearlab</span> are cases dealing with the use of confidential information in a commercial context and it is unclear whether the reliefs of equitable compensation and equitable damages are available to the plaintiff where the confidential information relates to personal information taken in a personal or family setting. Even if such reliefs are available, they submit that these reliefs should not be awarded in the circumstances of this case. The first and fourth defendants further submit that the Copied Data was only used for the Matrimonial Proceedings. They did not profit from the use of the Copied Data, as these are documents which the plaintiff was legally obliged to disclose in any event in the Matrimonial Proceedings pursuant to his duty to make full and frank disclosure of the matrimonial assets.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 In addition, the second and third defendants cite <span class="font-italic">Shiffon Creations (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Tong Lee Co Pte Ltd </span>[1990] 2 SLR(R) 472, where the court held (at [23]) that the general rule is that an award for damages in lieu of equitable relief would be granted only in exceptional situations.

The defendants have delivered up all the Copied Data, in hardcopy and/or electronic form. There is also a Permanent Injunction which prevents further use of the Copied Data. Any award of equitable damages would amount to “double recovery” for the plaintiff. The only exception allowed in the Permanent Injunction is with respect to the parts of the Copied Data that were exhibited in the three affidavits filed in FCD 4639. However, while there may not be double recovery in respect of these documents, there is no loss to the plaintiff since these are documents that the plaintiff was legally obliged to disclose in any event in FCD 4639 pursuant to his duty to make full and frank disclosure in the Matrimonial Proceedings. I agree with the defendants that the plaintiff’s right to preserve confidentiality of the Copied Data has been adequately vindicated by way of the Permanent Injunction and order for delivery up. Hence, the plaintiff is not entitled to any further relief for equitable damages or equitable compensation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 In conclusion, I find the second and third defendants liable to the plaintiff for breach of confidence in respect of the Copied Data (excluding the Non-Confidential documents from the Copied Data as found at [54]).
