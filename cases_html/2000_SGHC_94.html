<p align="justify">1. The onus is on the creditor to satisfy the court that the

obligations under s 96 of the Bankruptcy Act have been complied with.</p>
<p align="justify">2. In this case, the Petition was based on the failure to pay after a

statutory demand was served. It behoved the creditor to satisfy the court that the

statutory demand was served, and if not, all reasonable steps had been taken to ensure

that it was brought to the debtor’s attention.</p>
<p align="justify">3. It was not disputed here that there was no personal service of the

statutory demand. The creditors sent the demand by post on 26 August 1998 to an address

given by the debtor in his affidavit. That address was not the residential address but

that of his place of work. The demand was returned post-marked "Burnt House".

Another demand was sent to an hotel in Batam where the debtor had sought temporary refuge

at some point (to escape the social turmoil prevailing in Jakarta at the time). That

letter was also returned. Subsequently, an advertisement was placed in the Indonesian

newspaper "Kompas" on 7 December 1998. The debtor deposed in his affidavit that

he was not in Indonesia at that time. He had been out of Indonesia from 2 December 1998.</p>
<p align="justify">4. The creditors were aware at all material times that the debtor had a

residential address in Jakarta. There was also evidence that the creditors had reason to

believe that the debtor had a PO Box number at the material time as that was part of the

information provided to them by the debtor’s daughter in Singapore.</p>
<p align="justify">5. In spite of all that, the creditors did not send a copy of the

statutory demand to either his residential address or the PO Box.</p>
<p align="justify">6. In these circumstances, I do not think that the "reasonable

steps" obligation had been sufficiently discharged. The sending of the statutory

demand to two additional places is a simple and inexpensive exercise which ought to have

been done. The consequences to the debtor, on the other hand, were serious and therefore,

I am of the view that the appeal must be allowed and the bankruptcy order filed on 26 May

1999 set aside.</p>
<p align="justify">7. The appeal is allowed. The costs of the appeal is fixed at $2,000.

The costs below (if paid) is to be refunded to the debtor and costs of the application

below is awarded to the debtor and fixed at $700.</p>
