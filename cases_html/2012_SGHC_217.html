<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This case concerned the determination of
                    ancillary matters. I made orders on maintenance, division of matrimonial assets
                    and custody against which orders the Wife has filed an appeal (in Civil Appeal
                    No 120 of 2012).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The plaintiff Tay Boon Cheng Gina (“the
                    Wife”) married the defendant Goh Ah Poo (“the Husband”) on
                    24 November 1989. They have two sons who are presently 20 and 16 years of age
                    respectively (collectively “the children”). On 31 October 2011 the
                    Wife obtained an interim judgment dissolving the marriage on the ground of the
                    Husband’s unreasonable behaviour. Both parties then appeared before me on
                    7 September 2012 to settle the ancillary matters consequent on the interim
                        judgment<em>.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The issues that needed my consideration
                    were:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_a"></a>(a)     Custody, care and control of the
                        children;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_b"></a>(b)     Maintenance for the Wife and the children and;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_c"></a>(c)     Division of the matrimonial
                assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Custody, care and control </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The parties agreed to joint custody of the
                    children. The Wife sought care and control of the children with reasonable
                    access to the Husband, while the Husband sought care and control of the children
                    with unlimited access to the Wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The Wife claimed that the children had expressed
                    their wish to live with her. She also alleged that the Husband was always
                    travelling and rarely spent time at home. This was confirmed by the
                    Husband’s own evidence, which indicated that he would normally return home
                    very late and often had to go on overseas trips due to his commitments in the
                    Kampong Tiong Bahru West Residents’ Committee.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The Husband on the other hand countered that the
                    Wife had attempted suicide before and was thus unsuitable to have care and
                    control of the children. The medical report furnished by the Institute of Mental
                    Health (“IMH”) confirmed that the Wife had been admitted to the
                    IMH from 9 August 2007 after a suicide attempt. She was diagnosed to have a
                    situational reaction and was discharged on 15 August 2007. Since then, the Wife
                    has been taking medication for anxiety and insomnia but has not suffered from
                    any major psychiatric episode. The Wife also stated in her affidavit that she
                    has fully recovered from her depression.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Having regard to the evidence before me, I was
                    persuaded that the Husband’s busy schedule would make him a less suitable
                    caregiver than the Wife. I was also satisfied that the Wife’s mental
                    condition had stabilised enough that she was able to exercise care and control
                    over her children. I therefore ordered that the Wife be granted care and control
                    of the younger son, subject to his wishes as to which parent he chose to live
                    with. The younger son is old enough to have an independent opinion on this
                    issue. As for the older son, I made no order as to his custody because he would
                    turn 21 on 10 September 2012 just three days after I heard the ancillary
                    matters.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Maintenance</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Under a maintenance order issued on 21 June 2011
                    (“the Maintenance Order”), the Husband was ordered to pay the Wife
                    monthly maintenance of $700, which comprised of $200 for the elder son, $400 for
                    the younger son and $100 for the Wife. At the hearing before me, the Wife
                    requested monthly maintenance of $400 for the elder son, $500 for the younger
                    son, and $400 for herself. The Husband counter-offered $500 for the elder son,
                    $400 for the younger son but only $100 for the Wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The take-home monthly incomes of the Husband and
                    Wife were about $3,000 and $1,500 respectively. In terms of monthly expenses,
                    the Husband claimed that he needed $2,254.14 (excluding the sums he has to pay
                    in maintenance), while the Wife claimed that she required $1,705. If the
                    Husband’s proposal (<em>supra</em> at [8]) were
                    adopted, he would be paying a total of $1,000 in maintenance ($100 of which goes
                    to the Wife), which works out to $2,000 for himself and $1,600 for the Wife.
                    This seemed reasonable to me in view of the parties’ reported monthly
                    expenses. I therefore ordered maintenance in terms of the Husband’s
                    proposal. I further ordered that the Husband be responsible for the tuition fees
                    of the two children when they pursue tertiary education.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Division of matrimonial assets</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The parties’ dispute over the division
                    of the matrimonial assets centred on two properties – a 4-room HDB flat
                    held by both parties as joint tenants (“the flat”), and a HDB
                    shophouse owned solely by the Husband and used for his bicycle-cum-motorcycle
                    business (“the shophouse”). Based on recent resale prices of
                    similar units on the same floor, the flat had an estimated value of $666,500,
                    while a valuation report obtained by the Wife valued the shophouse at $1.35
                    million.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     It was clear that both properties constituted
                    matrimonial assets. The flat was the parties’ matrimonial home, while the
                    shophouse was purchased on 16 February 1996 during the parties’ marriage
                    and therefore fell within the definition of “matrimonial asset” as
                    an asset “acquired during the marriage by one party or both parties to
                    the marriage” (see s 112(10)(b) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353,
                    2009 Rev Ed)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The Wife wanted the flat to be transferred to
                    her for no consideration and without any refund to the Husband’s CPF
                    account, while the Husband (after some discussions between parties and the
                    court) was agreeable to selling the flat and dividing the proceeds equally with
                    the Wife. However, he wanted to keep the shophouse for himself, while the Wife
                    wanted it to be sold and to be awarded 35% of the proceeds.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The parties’ contributions </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     In terms of financial contributions, the
                    Husband had contributed about 79% of the payments towards the purchase price of
                    the flat thus far (including an estimated $30,000 that he had spent on
                    renovations and electrical appliances). He was also solely responsible for the
                    purchase of the shophouse. The Wife contributed the remaining 21% of the
                    payments towards the flat, and there was evidence that she had used her own
                    money to purchase replacement furniture and appliances when they broke down. She
                    also paid for some of the children’s medical bills.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     As for non-financial contributions, the Wife
                    had been working for the Husband at his business from 1990 until at least 2001.
                    She was paid $1,000 per month by the Husband, and he had also made employer
                    contributions to her CPF account from August 1995 to February 2004. There was
                    some dispute over the precise scope of her duties – the Husband claimed
                    that she only worked as a cashier while the Wife insisted that she did some
                    administrative work as well. Overall, I was satisfied that while the Wife did
                    aid the Husband in the running of his business, it was in the capacity of an
                    employee and she did not play a part in developing the business or generating
                    profits. In other words, she made neither direct nor indirect contribution
                    towards the business or to the acquisition of the shophouse.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The Wife was also primarily responsible for
                    managing the household and doing household chores. However, when it came to the
                    children’s upbringing, the Husband claimed that the elder son had lived
                    with his sister on weekdays until he was 13, while the younger son was cared for
                    by a neighbour until he was 5, with the Husband paying the babysitting fees to
                    his sister and the neighbour. The Wife did not dispute this save to clarify that
                    the arrangement for the elder son ended when he was 11, while the arrangement
                    for the younger son ended when he was 2. Thereafter she enrolled the latter in a
                    childcare centre and raised funds for the fees by pawning her and her
                    husband’s jewellery. Even accepting the Wife’s account to be true,
                    the fact remained that the children were substantially cared for by third
                    parties while they were young, and I could not give her full credit for raising
                    them.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In deciding the just and equitable division of
                    matrimonial assets, a court should make “a holistic assessment of all the
                    circumstances of the case”, instead of “embark[ing] on a
                    mathematical calculation in a fruitless attempt to ascertain and attribute the
                    ‘correct’ percentage to each party's actual contribution”
                        (<em>NK v NL</em> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 743 at [36]). This is
                    especially so when there is conflicting evidence regarding the precise extent of
                    each party’s contributions, as is so often the case in matrimonial
                    proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Having regard to the parties’
                    contributions during the marriage, I was of the view that the Wife should
                        <em>prima facie</em> be granted 40% of the flat. In
                    addition, I considered that the Wife ought to be granted a small share of 10% in
                    the shophouse in recognition of the years she had spent working there for which
                    she was paid. However, I did not consider it satisfactory for the shophouse to
                    be sold as it was the only source of the Husband’s income and would also
                    be his residence after the flat has been sold. Further, the Husband would be
                    responsible for the continued maintenance of the Wife and children, including
                    the payment of the children’s tertiary education fees.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     In the light of those considerations, I
                    thought it best to and did, order the flat to be sold in the open market within
                    6 months for at least $650,000, with the net sale proceeds to be divided 50:50
                    between the parties. In view of the Wife’s 50% share in the flat’s
                    proceeds, which amounted to giving her an additional 19% over and above her
                    direct contribution of 21% towards the acquisition of the flat and an additional
                    10% share for her notional share in the shophouse, I allowed the Husband to
                    retain the shophouse. Finally, I ordered the Husband to reimburse the Wife from
                    his half share of the sale proceeds of the flat, the expense of $600 that she
                    had incurred as valuation fee for the shophouse.</p>
