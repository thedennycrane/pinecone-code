<font color="#000080" size="4">Judgment</font>
</strong>
</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font color="#800000"><strong><u>GROUNDS OF DECISION</u></strong></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">         This was an appeal

from the judgment of the learned district judge Hoo Sheau Peng where she acquitted the

respondent, Conleth, on a charge of abetting by intentional aid, under s 6(a) read with s

29(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Cap 241 ("PCA"), one Madhavan s/o

Rajagopal ("Madu") to commit an offence under s 6(a) of the PCA. The s 6(a)

offence committed by Madu was to make and use false airline boarding passes in the

smuggling of two people into the USA in return for gratification. The DPP appealed against

Conleth’s acquittal. I dismissed the appeal and now give my reasons.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Facts</p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">2        Madu was a Customer

Services Officer ("CSO") with the Singapore Airport Terminal Services Ltd

("SATS"). Conleth was a former CSO and colleague of Madu, but had resigned in

1997. Part of a CSO’s duties were to process boarding passes for passengers in

transit.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3        Sometime in late October

2000, Madu had approached Conleth for help in smuggling people overseas. Madu promised him

a sum of $4,500 for his help. Conleth agreed as he was in need of money to settle his

credit card bills.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4        On 1 November 2000, Conleth

and Madu took a flight to Bangkok. On the flight, Madu gave him some details. Conleth was

told that they would be helping to smuggle two people into the USA who did not have valid

documents, and that all four of them would be on the same flight. However, both Madu and

Conleth would disembark at Hong Kong, where there was a transit stop, from where they

would later return to Singapore.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5        According to the

prosecution, the scheme for smuggling people into the USA was that in return for money

paid to him by one Khan, Madu would churn out two fake boarding passes in his and

Conleth’s name. They would then use these passes to board a flight to the USA on

which they were not listed as passengers. The persons smuggled would be on the same

flight. Madu and Conleth would then disembark at a transit point and return to Singapore

whilst the two persons smuggled would continue to the USA. However, the details of this

vague scheme were not disclosed to Conleth, save for what was listed in the preceding

paragraph.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6        On 2 November 2000, they

returned to Singapore from Bangkok on a night flight. At Changi Airport, Madu told Conleth

not to check out but to stay within the transit area in Terminal 1. He was to wait for

further instructions and he eventually stayed overnight in the transit area.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7        According to Madu, he was

handed two boarding passes by Khan on that day, which were in the names of the persons to

be smuggled. Since he and Conleth were not listed on the flight, Madu then procured two

blank boarding passes, to which he had access as a SATS employee, and wrote their names on

the passes for the flight from Singapore to Hong Kong only. His actions here constituted

the s 6(a) PCA offence. All this was done in the absence of Conleth.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8        Madu and Conleth then

entered the holding area. To enter, both Madu and Conleth presented the bogus passes along

with their passports so that the documents would tally when checked. Madu then took the

bogus pass back from Conleth. For the second check before entering the holding area

proper, Madu then used the two boarding passes which he had gotten from Khan – this

was necessary since the check here was done against the passenger manifest for the flight.

Conleth had entered in front of Madu and did not see this. The two of them then boarded

the flight. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9        As planned, both of them

disembarked in Hong Kong and waited for a day before returning on 5 November 2000. Madu

later paid Conleth $4,500 as promised. Madu was subsequently charged and convicted on five

counts of an offence under s 6(a) PCA. He also pleaded guilty to a charge under the

Computer Misuse Act, Cap 50. He was sentenced to ten years imprisonment in total.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The decision below</p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10        The district judge found

that the only issue in dispute was the <i>mens rea</i> of Conleth. She held that the

offence of corruption in this case by Madu involved him accepting gratification in return

for churning out fake boarding passes. She held that Conleth must be shown to have had

knowledge of the corrupt element, constituted by Madu’s acts, in order to be guilty

of the offence charged.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">11        The district judge

believed Conleth’s defence that he had had no knowledge at all of Madu’s forgery

of the boarding passes. She found that Conleth’s intention was solely to aid Madu in

smuggling people to the USA. In view of the surrounding circumstances at the time, she

found that it was reasonable for Conleth not to have inquired further as to the details of

the scheme. The district judge also held that there was no reason for Conleth to suspect

that there was anything amiss with the boarding passes. Since the offence of abetment by

intentional aid required knowledge of the circumstances constituting the offence abetted,

she found that the prosecution had not satisfied its burden of proof concerning

Conleth’s <i>mens rea</i> on the evidence adduced. She accordingly acquitted Conleth.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The appeal </p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">12        The only issue in this

appeal was whether the judge below had erred in finding that Colneth had not been proven

to have possessed the <i>mens rea</i> for the offence. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">13        The relevant parts of s

6(a) and s 29(a) PCA read:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">6(a)    If any agent corruptly accepts or

    obtains, … from any person, for himself or for any other person, any gratification as

    an inducement or reward for doing or forbearing to do, or for having done or forborne to

    do, any act in relation to his principal’s affairs or business, or for showing or

    forbearing to show favour or disfavour to any person in relation to his principal’s

    affairs or business; …he shall be guilty of an an offence…</p>
<p align="justify">29(a)    Whoever abets, within the meaning of the Penal

    Code the commission of an offence under this Act; … shall be deemed to have committed

    the offence and shall be liable on conviction to be punished with the punishment provided

    for that offence.</p>
</font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Further, s 107(c) of the Penal Code, Cap 224 provides:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">A person abets the doing of a thing who intentionally

    aids, by any act or illegal omission, the doing of that thing.</p>
</font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">14        The DPP pointed to the

evidence that had been adduced against Conleth and argued that it was an irresistible

inference that Conleth must have known of Madu’s actions, or, at the very least, have

had knowledge that something was amiss with the boarding passes. It was argued that this

would have been sufficient to found the <i>mens rea</i> for the offence.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">15        A list of the evidence

against Conleth was set out by the DPP:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(i) He knew that Madu was a CSO and, being a former CSO, knew that

    Madu’s duties involved dealing with passengers checking in;</p>
<p align="justify">(ii) he would further know that a CSO was able to generate boarding

    passes at will;</p>
<p align="justify">(iii) the district judge had found that he knew Madu would be paid for

    the scheme, and Conleth himself was paid a large sum of money;</p>
<p align="justify">(iv) the circumstances prior to the trip were suspicious – Conleth

    had to wait in the transit area overnight and fly off immediately the next day, which

    meant he never went through immigration, a fact he would have realised;</p>
<p align="justify">(v) although he did not buy tickets nor checked in, Madu was able to

    appear with his boarding pass;</p>
<p align="justify">(vi) he knew that he was to help in smuggling people illegally; and</p>
<p align="justify">(vii) he had seen the forged boarding pass with his name hand-written

    on it</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">16        I must confess at the

outset that I was unable to see how the scheme as disclosed could have effectively

smuggled people into the USA. This was also a mystery to all the parties involved, and the

details adduced at the trial below did not shed much light on the matter. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">17        Furthermore, it was

unhelpful to focus on the fact that Conleth knew, or thought, that he was helping to

smuggle people into the USA by his actions. Involvement in the scheme itself did not give

rise to criminal liability; what should be focused on was the extent of his awareness of

Madu’s actions. His knowledge that he was involved was neither here nor there; for

all intents and purposes, all he had actually done here was to accept money in return for

accompanying a friend to board a plane to Hong Kong.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">18        Turning to the question of

whether the judge below had erred in her finding that Conleth had had no knowledge of

Madu’s actions, I found the burden on the DPP in this instance to be a heavy one. In

the proceedings below, the district judge had made her finding not just on the basis of

the evidence before her, but also because she had <i>believed </i>both Madu’s and

Conleth’s evidence that Conleth had had no knowledge of Madu’s actions. While

not explicitly stated in her grounds of decision, her decision on Conleth’s

credibility must have stemmed in part from her observation of his demeanour, since there

was no other objective evidence in support of his story. As held in <i>Ang Jwee Herng v PP</i>
<a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=61262&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[2001] 2 SLR 474</a>, an appellate court will be slow to overturn findings of fact by the

trial judge especially when an assessment of the credibility and veracity of the witnesses

has been made.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">19        Having examined the

evidence carefully, I found it could not be proven beyond reasonable doubt that Conleth

either knew or should have suspected both that there was something improper about the

boarding passes and that Madu had brought this about with his powers as a CSO.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">20        As the district judge had

found, Conleth had had no details of the scheme save what Madu had told him. Notably,

nothing was mentioned about the boarding passes. The scheme to smuggle was so murky that

it cannot be said with certainty that Conleth must have known or suspected that Madu had

to breach his duties by preparing false boarding passes as part of the scheme. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">21        Similarly, the fact that

Conleth had to spend the night in the transit area did not lend weight to the inferences

which this court was urged to draw. It was also in evidence that Madu had taken

Conleth’s passport and told him that he would "settle everything" with

regards to the flight to the USA; in such circumstances, it was not at all improbable for

Conleth to think that Madu had legitimately bought tickets and checked in on the flight

for both of them. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">22        The strongest piece of

evidence for the prosecution was the fact that Conleth had seen the boarding pass with his

name hand-written on it. However, there was no evidence as to whether a boarding pass with

a passenger name hand-written on it would be considered unusual or wrong. It was entirely

possible that, because Conleth used to be a CSO, what would strike other people as odd

about the boarding pass would in fact seem normal to him. In addition, it must be noted

that Conleth was able to pass through the security check using the fake said boarding pass

without any problems. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">23        In contrast, the district

judge found Conleth’s defence believable since it was entirely logical for him not to

have known much about the scheme, save that generally it was to smuggle people into the

USA. There was no reason to think, on the evidence, that Conleth would have had knowledge

of Madu’s corrupt activities.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">24        In view of the above, I

was of the opinion that while Conleth’s conduct in this matter was thoroughly

dishonest and reprehensible, the fact remained that he had not been proven to have

committed an offence punishable under our laws. Moral culpability by itself is not a

sufficient basis to found criminal liability. </p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Conclusion</p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">25        For the above reasons, I

dismissed the appeal against acquittal.</p>
