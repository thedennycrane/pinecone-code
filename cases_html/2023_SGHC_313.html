The Accused and the Complainant exchanged telephone numbers in order for the former to send the latter the online link for the invitation to the birthday party.

After leaving Hero’s pub, the Complainant and the Accused took a Grab taxi back to the Accused’s home at the Condominium, to continue drinking. According to the Complainant, he was “very drunk” by then; and he only realised later that they had taken a Grab taxi when he found the Grab receipt on his phone. He did recall that it was in the taxi on the way to the Condominium that they spoke about him “crashing” at the Accused’s home “because the plan was to continue drinking and it was quite far away” from his own home.

He could also recall three other acts by the Accused in between the two instances of fellatio. He could not recall strictly the sequence in which these three other acts were committed as he was at that juncture “falling in and out of consciousness”, but he could recall that one of the acts involved the Accused sticking his fingers into his (the Complainant’s) anus. He knew it was more than one finger because he “felt fingers” and “it felt painful”. Another act involved the Accused lifting his hand and putting it on the Accused’s penis. He recalled that the Accused was on his left side by then and “kept lifting…up” his left hand to put it on the Accused’s penis. At that point, the Accused was wearing “something on top but nothing on the bottom”. The third act involved the Accused “trying to put his tongue in [the Complainant’s] mouth, trying to kiss [him]”: he could remember “feeling [the Accused’s] tongue in [his] mouth as [he] was sleeping” as well as “opening [his] eyes and seeing [the Accused’s] face there” and then closing his eyes again because he “was scared” of what the latter was doing.

His father came to meet him at SGH, and later, so did Zen.

The Complainant was “mumbling little bits of words and breathing heavily”, sounding “drunk but scared at the same time”.

He also reported having been “too disoriented to figure out how to exit the premises of the condominium”: “[a]fter some trying, he managed to leave the compound briefly for twenty metres but thereafter proceeded to walk back in after failing to find the main road and waited for the police to arrive after calling them”.

The Complainant “tended to drink once per week, each time drinking 3 pints of beer on average”, with beer being “his preferred beverage”. According to the Complainant, at these levels of alcohol consumption, he would “not get intoxicated”, “but would feel tipsy and somewhat ‘happy’”, and “thereafter he would stop drinking”. The Complainant also informed Dr Low that “on the day of the alleged sexual assault, he estimated that he had drunk 2 times his usual amount” and had not consumed “more food to go along with his alcohol at night” after having had “dinner at around 6-7pm”.

However, “based on the pattern of [the Complainant’s] drinking”, Dr Low opined that he was “a moderate drinker with an estimated alcohol clearance rate of 15mg/100ml to 20mg/100ml of blood per hour”. Dr Low also noted that the Complainant’s blood ethanol concentration – taken at 1.00pm on 9 August 2017 – was 40mg/100ml. Based on Dr Low’s calculations, “this would imply that at 4.15am, [the Complainant’s] BAC level was between 171.25mg/100ml and 215mg/100ml.” At 5.30am, “[the Complainant’s] BAC level was between 152.5mg/100ml and 190mg/100ml”.

Dr Low also explained that his statement that “a moderate drinker” would have “an estimated alcohol clearance rate of 15mg/100ml to 20mg/100ml of blood per hour” was based on Western research literature, in which “experts would agree that 15 milligrams per decilitre… of alcohol clearance per hour is the general standard for an average person”; and that he had given a range of 15 to 20mg per decilitre in order to “give leeway for an experienced drinker, experienced meaning that somebody who is…used to regular drinking, like [the Complainant], who possibly could have a slightly higher than the average rate of clearance of alcohol because he is used to drinking three to four pints of beer on average per week”.

Generally speaking, a person would first experience the effects of alcohol on the system at “levels above 50 milligrams per decilitre”: at BAC levels above 50mg/100ml, such a person would “start experiencing effects of alcohol on his psychomotor functions, so he could be a bit clumsy, a bit more…impaired in his coordination”.

</div> At BAC levels above 100mg/100ml, “more cognitive effects start to come in, in which the person becomes a little bit more dizzy, more elated, more talkative”. Thereafter, at BAC levels above 150mg/100ml, the cognition or mental state of the person would “start to become even more affected”, in terms of his “awareness of the surroundings…his responses to his surroundings, his ability to take in information and process information, his ability to understand and weigh decisions, his ability to…make sense of things around him”: “his conscious level drops”.

</div> In Dr Low’s opinion, generally, at BAC levels above 150mg/100ml, “a person’s mental state becomes impaired, he tends to make reckless behaviour, tends to be…less aware of his surroundings…more and more confused”. At the even higher BAC levels of 250 to 300mg/100ml, the person would experience stupor and be unable to move very much; his muscles would become very weak; he would become “very lethargic and very much unable to respond to the external circumstances”. Finally, at above 300mg/100ml, the person would become comatose.

</div> Dr Low opined that the “most likely case” was that the Complainant had been in “a state of shock”, “a dreamlike state in which he was kind of drifting in and out of consciousness”, had a “partial awareness” of what was going on around him”, and was “trying to make sense of what [was] going on around him, and possibly…then falling back to sleep thereafter and waking up again”. In Dr Low’s opinion, in this state, the Complainant would not have really reacted because he would still have been “really trying to appreciate the nature and the circumstances” of what was happening around him.

</div> By the time of the second instance of fellatio, however, the Complainant would probably have “gained a better understanding and awareness of his scenario, realising that it’s actually happening and it’s no longer a dream that he’s experiencing”.

That’s okay, because your primary focus at that point in time is to walk… to make sure you don’t fall down”. Dr Low also caveated that the distances which the Complainant was shown walking in the video footage were “very short” distances; and it would be “very hard to conclude” whether the Complainant would have been able to continue walking straight without staggering over a “more protracted, more prolonged” distance.

</div> As for the audio-recording of the Complainant’s first phone call to the police, which the defence claimed showed the Complainant to have had “his cognitive abilities about him”, Dr Low’s evidence was that it showed that the Complainant had “limited mental faculties, in the sense that he’s able to recall certain information about himself, for instance, his own phone number, his name”; and that he had “limited awareness of surroundings. He knows he’s on Nutmeg Road”. Dr Low caveated that the Complainant’s phone call to the police was a “very simple conversation”; and while he was able to say that the Complainant had been able to provide the information required by the operator who answered his call, he was unable to tell very much more.

In her report dated 22 January 2019, Dr Chee noted that the Complainant had recounted to her the following events: on 8 August 2017, he “had finished his last day of National Service”, “had gone drinking, and had gone to a friend’s house to sleep”. However, he woke up to find that this friend (an older man) was “performing oral sex on him, and was attempting to digitally penetrate him”. He “managed to break free and run out of the house”.

The Accused changed his clothes in front of the Complainant before “they started sipping whisky and coke, which the [Accused] had prepared there, while sitting beside each other”. The Accused claimed that the Complainant had “started playing guitar” and that “their arms were rubbing against each other”. As to the sexual acts, the Accused claimed that “the Complainant was awake when he started touching his thigh”; and that “when he tried to open the [C]omplainant’s pant[s] the Complainant cooperated”: according to the Accused, “after finding the [C]omplainant’s penis erect, [he] tried to pull down his pant[s] to fully expose the penis”, whereupon the Complainant had “raised his body to allow the [Accused] to pull down his pant[s]”. The Accused then started performing fellatio on the Complainant and also kissed his mouth and nipples. He claimed that he did so for about 10 minutes. However, he denied “putting his fingers into the Complainant’s anus even though he admitted to having touched his buttocks”.

He claimed that this was done with consent because the Complainant “did not push [him] away or brush [him] away”: the Complainant’s eyes were “still opened that time” and he maintained “eye contact” with the Accused. Thereafter, the Accused tried “to insert [his] hand inside [the Complainant’s] pants”; and when he found that he could not do so “because it was really tight”, the Complainant “shifted his body towards the ceiling” “so that [the Accused] could actually reach and unbutton his pants, unbuckle his belt and unzip him”. In fact, according to the Accused, the Complainant shifted his buttocks so that the Accused “could pull down his pants and underwear towards his mid-thigh”. The Accused claimed that all this while, the Complainant remained “conscious” and “awake”, and he “did not push away [the Accused’s] hands”. Thereafter, as the Accused noticed that the Complainant was slowly getting an erection, he started to masturbate the Complainant; and then, when the latter’s penis “was hard”, he proceeded to suck his penis.

He then opened the main door, whereupon “a battalion” of police officers – who included Mr Tho – entered the apartment. The Accused recalled feeling “really, really frightened” because in the Philippines where he had grown up, the police “is not really on the good side” and did “bad things to people” such as torturing them, beating them and subjecting them to verbal abuse.

First, according to the Accused, prior to Mr Tho recording his statement, he was verbally “interrogated” by another officer (later identified as one ASP Vimala Raj (“ASP Raj”) without anyone else being present in the interview room. The Accused claimed that ASP Raj questioned him about how he had pulled down the Complainant’s pants as well as the Complainant’s position at the relevant time. The Accused also claimed that ASP Raj told him that the Complainant’s family was “wealthy”, and that the Complainant’s father was “loaded, super loaded”. This made the Accused “really more scared” because police officers “back in [his] hometown” were “really corrupt”; and he had the thought “that this police officer…might do something to [him] and because of the power of the wealth, then [he] can’t do anything anymore to protect [himself]”.

He said that ASP Raj had also told him he “likes President Duterte”, and that he felt “more scared” upon hearing this, because “at that time, President Duterte was killing people”, and “a lot of things were going inside [his] mind” about who would take care of his parents if he “was going to die here”.

In his opinion, the “sloppy drunk” behaviour associated with a “BAC percent” of 0.16 to 0.20 “would conceivably manifest varying combination of facets of these four cardinal features”.

It was Dr Lim’s opinion that “a variety of factors” could have “existed to vary the BAC as well as changing the manifestation of alcohol intoxication”. I reproduce below the factors suggested by Dr Lim:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Body mass: Healthy “larger built” people tended to better tolerate the intoxicating effect and they have lower BAC;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Gender: For the same amount of alcohol consumed by both males and females, males tolerate intoxication better and also have a lower BAC than females;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Age: Young people (&lt;24) are less sensitive to the intoxicating effects of alcohol such as sedation and motor coordination;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Tolerance: A person who drinks regularly even moderately is less sensitive to the effect of intoxication and would possibly have a lower BAC;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Metabolism: Drinkers with an “active lifestyle” are often associated with lower alcohol degradation rate resulting in lower BAC and they tolerate better the intoxicating effect of alcohol; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) Genetics: Different forms of the same gene can lead to different degrees of alcohol metabolism. In general, Caucasians tolerate elevated alcohol levels better than Orientals because the atypical enzyme in Orientals makes it difficult for the latter to tolerate higher levels of alcohol.

The Complainant also looked “oriented” to time and place in that he ‘was following the accused behind, when he opened the [lift] door” and thus showed “an awareness of his surrounding”.

</div> As for the video-recording of the Complainant’s subsequent exit from the lift lobby, Dr Lim opined that this also showed the Complainant exhibiting “very normal behaviour” in that he appeared to be “trying to orientate himself” as he came down into the lift lobby. Dr Lim agreed, however, that based on the video-recordings alone, he was unable to tell whether or not at an earlier point of time inside the apartment, the Complainant would have been “in a state capable of giving informed consent to sexual activity”.

Dr Lim also claimed that from the audio recording, he could hear that the Complainant’s speech was “slow but not slurred”.

</div>. Having checked his field diary, ASP Raj recalled that on the morning of 10 August 2017, he had in fact been in the High Court assisting Deputy Public Prosecutors (“DPPs”) with the trial of a gang rape case in which he had been the IO. Halfway through that trial, the accused persons in that case decided to plead guilty, and the matter was fixed for hearing on another day. ASP Raj returned to PCC around 12.30pm and spent his time doing paperwork and sending out emails at his workstation until about 2.30pm. He could not remember exactly what he did after that, but stated that he would probably have been in the office handling paperwork, as it was usual to put up case updates to management after a trial.

When the Accused attended at PCC for the extension of his bail bond, he would have come in with his bailor. There would have been two copies of the bail bond form: one for the Accused and one for his bailor. The officer conducting the extension of the bail bond would endorse both copies by “stamping the next date of reporting” and signing off on the Accused’s copy of the form. The Accused and his bailor would also be asked to indicate their acknowledgement on the form. The process for the extension of the bail bond would “take probably less than 2 minutes” and consisted of a “brief moment when” ASP Raj would see the Accused, confirm his identity, and get him to acknowledge the bail bond extension. ASP Raj would not have any knowledge of what the IO in charge might want from the Accused as he was not the IO for the case.

Instead, in his opinion, the literature in this subject area showed that there were “five or six” stages of alcohol intoxication. Dr Low listed and described them as follows:

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">So less than 50 milligrams per decilitre would imply a state of euphoria or what people would commonly call sub-clinical intoxication in a sense that people can be more talkative, may not display overt sins of being drunk… And thereafter you have what we call the excited stage where it becomes more apparent and that is a level that usually corresponds to 50 to 150 milligrams per decilitre. In this state, the person most commonly exhibits an elation and altered mood, being happy talking a bit more than usual, having impaired concentration and judgement and to a certain extent a degree of sexual disinhibition. And progressed further to the confused stage which is between 150 to 250 milligrams per decilitre. That’s when you start developing things like slurred speech, unsteady walking which some people call staggering…or different types of gait disturbances, nausea, drowsiness, anti-social kind of behaviour, getting into fights. So that is the next stage, the confused stage. At 300 milligrams per decilitre, that’s when we have what we call the confusion stage, which is what Dr Lim mentioned when he talked about disorientation to time, place and person… So towards the later stages of confusion, a person would then also be disoriented to time, place and person, and by the time he reaches the stupor…stage which is the 300 milligrams per decilitre, he then becomes extremely drowsy, speech becomes even more incoherent and he would…exhibit more signs of confusion …as compared to the confused stage. And finally when you hit about 400 milligrams per decilitre, that’s when you have very laboured breathing, you…start developing signs of alcohol poisoning and leading towards a…comatose state and even death… [T]his is very individual dependent and would really depend on a person’s tolerance to alcohol. A person who is less tolerant to alcohol, a non-seasoned drinker may even develop alcohol poisoning and death even at 300 milligrams per decilitre. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 On the issue of alcohol clearance rate, Dr Low disagreed with Dr Lim’s assertion that “all” drinkers – whether “non-drinkers”, “moderate drinkers” or “chronic drinkers” – would have the same alcohol clearance rate of 15 to 20mg per 100ml of blood per hour. Instead, a seasoned drinker would have a higher alcohol clearance rate which could even go up to 25mg/100ml, whereas someone who was a non-drinker or social drinker in the context of a “Western population” would probably have an alcohol clearance rate of around 15mg/100ml. The Complainant, who drank three to four pints of alcohol weekly, would be considered a “moderate drinker”. and his alcohol clearance rate would probably “veer more towards” 20mg/100ml. In Dr Low’s opinion, the most important determinant of an individual’s alcohol clearance rate would be the regularity with which that individual drank alcohol. All other things being equal, a seasoned drinker would have a higher alcohol clearance rate; and a higher alcohol clearance rate, when factored into the retrograde extrapolation from the BAC level of 40mg/100ml measured at 1 PM on 9 August 2017, would lead to a higher BAC figure at 4.15am on 9 August 2017.

In his view, however, the audio recordings <span class="font-italic">did </span>demonstrate that the Complainant’s speech was slurred at the material time. More importantly, insofar as Dr Lim had asserted that the Complainant appeared in the video footage to be oriented to time and place Dr Low disagreed that a lack of orientation to time, place and/or person would be the earliest sign of intoxication.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">[I]f a person reaches a state where he cannot tell time, place or person, that would have probably been quite a late stage of drunkenness.  Probably even more so than being able to provide consent for sexual intercourse because being able to provide consent for sexual intercourse requires a dialogue, requires some kind of signalling, requires some kind of ample communications. If you are able to provide that, definitely you are not…disoriented. But if you were to go beyond that and not even be able to identify the place, the person or even the time, then that would be a later stage of intoxication from beyond providing consent. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 Dr Low also opined that consent was a “multivariable question” which depended on various elements such as “understanding, weighing…the benefits and the cons of an activity, being able to communicate it subsequently”. In the case of an intoxicated individual, Dr Low explained that alcohol would tend first to affect the frontal lobe, which controlled personality, executive function and cognition, before affecting the other centres which were important for psychomotor control (balance, posture and coordination), and finally the “involuntary centres” which controlled breathing and circulation.

</div> In other words, alcohol would tend first to affect the area of the brain on which an individual would depend for decision-making and communication. In his view, therefore, the ability of an intoxicated person to give informed consent to sexual activity would probably be impaired before the individual’s orientation to time, place and person was impaired.

He also asserted that the entire sexual encounter was a consensual one.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 Before I deal with my findings on these disputed issues, it will be expedient for me to address first the Accused’s allegations in respect of his statement of 10 August 2017. This is because the Defence sought to argue that the statement was largely corroborative of the version of events provided by the Accused at trial, and that in respect of those portions which appeared to be inconsistent with his testimony or at least ambiguous, they had either been inserted by Mr Tho, with the Accused having been too “scared” to object, or Mr Tho had refused to let him amend or clarify certain words and phrases. The Prosecution, on the other hand, sought to argue that in making the statement, the Accused failed to deny the offence of digital-anal penetration under s 376(2)(a) PC; the statement should therefore be given “full weight” by the court in finding that the Accused had in fact penetrated the Complainant’s anus with his fingers. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Accused’s statement dated 10 August 2017</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Parties’ positions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 I have set out at [93] the specific portions of the Accused’s statement which he either disavowed or qualified at trial. At the outset, it should be noted that although the Accused took the position that he had been too “scared” to object to the inclusion of the disputed words or sentences in his statement, the closing submissions filed on his behalf made no reference at all to the issue of voluntariness. Notwithstanding this omission, the claims put forward in the closing submissions clearly showed the Accused to be taking the position that the inclusion of these disputed words and sentences in his statement was involuntary on his part – even if the word “involuntary” was not used: in gist, the Accused claimed to have been subject to some form of threat of harm in the course of giving his statement. For example, defence counsel submitted that ASP Raj’s alleged interview with the Accused left the latter feeling “even more frightened and believe[ing] that he should agree with whatever the police officers were telling him for the sake of his safety”.

In fact, on 10 August 2017, he had been involved in the High Court trial of a case in which he had been the IO; and his evidence was that on returning to the office on the afternoon of that day, he would have been occupied with sending out emails and handling paperwork.

There was thus no reason for ASP Raj to have gone out of his way to interview the Accused alone, and no way in which he could have been in a position to “interrogate” the Accused about details such as how he “pushed down the pants of the victim” and “whether the victim was lying down”.

On the basis of these alleged acts, the Accused claimed to have feared for his life because – according to him – he knew that the police back in his own hometown were corrupt and that they abused or even killed people. In other words, the Accused claimed that ASP Raj and/or other police officers would inflict physical harm on the Accused and perhaps even kill him.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 In considering the Accused’s claims about the alleged threat constituted by ASP Raj’s various statements to him, I found the judgment of VK Rajah J (as he then was) in <span class="font-italic">PP v Lim Thian Lai </span>[2005] SGHC 122 (“<span class="font-italic">Lim Thian Lai (HC)</span>”) instructive. In <span class="font-italic">Lim Thian Lai (HC)</span>, the accused challenged the voluntariness of a statement he had given the police, alleging <span class="font-italic">inter alia </span>that one of the police officers – “SI Roy” – had reiterated a number of times that they were on the 18th floor of the Police Cantonment Complex. The accused took this to imply that SI Roy would throw him from the 18th floor of the Police Cantonment Complex if he did not admit the offence. In cross-examination, the accused admitted, albeit reluctantly, that the alleged threat to throw him off the 18th floor of the building was pure speculation on his part (at [37]). VK Rajah J rejected the accused’s claims about the threat. <span class="font-italic">Inter alia</span>, Rajah J held that the allegation against SI Roy was “without substance, both in law and in fact”. First, it was settled law that a self-perceived threat without a reasonable basis would not amount to a threat within the rubric of s 122(5) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) (then the relevant CPC provision on the admissibility of accused persons’ investigative statements). Second, Rajah J was not persuaded that there was any legitimate basis for the “rather fanciful flight of imagination even if the accused’s version of events was correct”. Third, and most importantly, Rajah J was inclined to accept the contrary testimony proffered by the police officers.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 In similar vein, in the present case, the Accused’s claims about the alleged threat by ASP Raj against his safety and his life amounted in my view to pure speculation on his part. Even assuming ASP Raj had repeated the words “you thought” in an “angry” tone and stated that the Complainant’s father was “super loaded” and that he (ASP Raj) liked President Duterte, these statements did not amount to an objective threat of physical harm – much less an objective threat of murder. To borrow VK Rajah J’s words, this was a case of “a self-perceived threat without a reasonable basis”. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) The objective limb: Allegations against Mr Tho</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 In respect of Mr Tho, the Accused’s alleged reasons for feeling “scared” were more vague. In sum, the Accused’s case appeared to be that he had felt “really scared” during the recording of his statement, not just because of the things said by ASP Raj to him prior to the statement-recording by Mr Tho, but also because Mr Tho himself spoke in an “angry tone”.

</div> The Accused claimed that this caused him to “shiver” with fear whenever Mr Tho was in front of him, and to “[think] that [he did] not want to be beaten up”. At the same time, the Accused felt that Mr Tho was trying to “coach” him by putting various statements to him, apparently for him to agree to. As a result of his fear, the Accused decided to say ‘Yes, okay’” to whatever Mr Tho was “trying to tell” him.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 I accepted Mr Tho’s evidence that he did not speak to the Accused in an “angry tone”, nor did he try to “coach” the Accused on what to say. In the first place, there was no reason why Mr Tho should have done these things. The Accused conceded in cross-examination that he was given a pen to make whatever amendments he wished after reading through the printed statement; and the Accused did in fact make several amendments using the pen. This indicated that Mr Tho was conscious of the need to be fair to the Accused and that he was prepared to let the Accused amend the statement as he wished before signing. This being the case, there was no reason for him to get “angry” at the Accused, or to put various statements to the Accused for him to agree to, or to substitute his own words for the Accused’s, or to rephrase the Accused’s statements in some other way. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 I should add that the Accused claimed he had to ask Mr Tho for permission each time he wanted to make an amendment and that there were multiple instances in which Mr Tho refused to let him make amendments and instead told him to “leave it” (<span class="font-italic">per </span>the table at [93] above). However, I did not find this claim at all believable. If Mr Tho had really been so anxious about dictating and controlling the contents of the statement, he would not have told the Accused he could make whatever amendments he wanted – much less given him a pen to make the amendments himself. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 Even if I were to take the Defence’s case at its highest and to assume the allegations against Mr Tho to be proven, the conduct alleged – <span class="font-italic">ie </span>speaking<span class="font-italic"> </span>in an angry voice and putting certain statements to the Accused for the latter to agree to – did not amount to an objective threat to “beat up” the Accused or to cause him physical harm. Again, this was a case where the so-called threat was entirely self-perceived, without any reasonable basis. For the avoidance of doubt, I should reiterate that I was satisfied that Mr Tho did not in fact try to “coach” the Accused by putting certain statements to him and/or rephrasing the Accused’s statements. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 As for the Accused’s rather belated allegation that Mr Tho had warned him he would not be released from the lock-up if he failed to sign the statement, I accepted Mr Tho’s evidence that he never said any such thing. There was simply no reason for Mr Tho to make such a threat. As he pointed out in his testimony on rebuttal, if the Accused had refused to sign the statement, he (Mr Tho) would simply have recorded the fact that the Accused had refused to sign; and the latter would then either have been released on bail or charged in court.

</div> In other words, Mr Tho would have achieved nothing in threatening not to release the Accused from the lock-up if he failed to sign the statement. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) My decision on the voluntariness of the disputed portions of the Accused’s statement</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 To sum up, therefore, in respect of the objective limb of the test for voluntariness, I was satisfied that no threats were made against the Accused by ASP Raj and Mr Tho on 10 August 2017. Having made this finding, it was not necessary for me to consider the subjective limb of the test.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 As there were no threats made against the Accused on 10 August 2017, there was no reason at all to doubt the voluntariness of the disputed portions of the statement recorded from him on that date.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Accused’s allegations concerning the accuracy of his statement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 Apart from the allegations against ASP Raj and Mr Tho which concerned the voluntariness of the disputed passages in his 10 August 2017 statement, the Accused also alleged that there were inaccuracies in his statement. Insofar as the Accused alleged that these were inaccuracies which arose from his having fearfully agreed to statements put to him by Mr Tho (<span class="font-italic">eg </span>the statement that the Complainant was “lying down flat” at the point the Accused took off his pants) and/or the latter having refused him permission to make certain amendments (<span class="font-italic">eg</span> to amend the sentence “I think he was conscious” to “I know he was conscious that time because we were just talking”), I have dealt with these allegations above at [131] to [142]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 However, there was one significant point of inaccuracy which the Accused claimed arose from his choice of words and Mr Tho’s misunderstanding of those words. This related to paragraphs 15 and 18 of the 10 August 2017 statement, which recorded the Accused as saying that he could not recall whether he had inserted or put his fingers into the Complainant’s anus but that he had touched the latter’s anus with his “left fingers”. According to the Accused, in these paragraphs, he had actually used the word “anus” in two different senses – the buttock cheeks <span class="font-italic">and</span> also the anus “hole”. To recap, the Accused said he had grown up in an environment where the word “anus” had a double meaning. His evidence was that when he told Mr Tho he “could not recall whether [he] inserted [his] fingers into [the Complainant’s] anus”, he had used the word “anus” to mean “the anus with the hole”. However, when he told Mr Tho that he “did use [his] left fingers to touch [the Complainant’s] anus while sucking his penis”, he had used the word “anus” to mean the buttock cheeks. The Accused alleged that after having told Mr Tho that he “did use [his] left fingers to touch [the Complainant’s] anus while sucking his penis”, he asked Mr Tho to change the word “anus” in that sentence to “cheeks of the buttocks”, but Mr Tho had claimed to “understand what [he] meant” and had told him to “leave it”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 I rejected the above allegations. First, apart from his bare assertion that the word “anus” was used when he was growing up in the Philippines to mean both the “cheeks of the buttocks” and the “anus hole”, the Accused did not adduce any other evidence of the purported “double meaning” with which the word “anus” was used in his native language and culture.

</div>
</div> If the word “anus” really did hold a “double meaning” in the Accused’s native language and culture, it should not have been difficult for him to adduce evidence of this, especially since the Defence already had a copy of the statement sometime before the trial, and it was the Defence that elected to put the statement into evidence at trial. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 Second, I observed that in his evidence-in-chief, the Accused consciously chose to use the words “buttocks” and “cheeks” – instead of “anus” – when referring to the Complainant’s buttock cheeks. For example, the Accused testified that he had brushed the cheeks of the Complainant’s buttocks.

Logically, the Accused must have been referring to the same body part, and that body part must have been the anus “hole”: it would not have made sense otherwise to use the word “anus” several times in succession in the same passage and/or to talk about the insertion of fingers into the anus in the same passage. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 Having regard to the reasons set out above, I concluded that what the Accused was really saying in the disputed passages was that he could not recall whether he had penetrated the Complainant’s anus (<span class="font-italic">i.e. </span>“the hole”) with his fingers but that he did recall touching the latter’s anus (<span class="font-italic">i.e. </span>“the hole”) with his fingers.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 I next address the disputed issue as to whether the Accused did in fact commit the <span class="font-italic">actus reus </span>of the charge under s 376(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), <span class="font-italic">i.e.</span> whether he did in fact penetrate the Complainant’s anus with his fingers.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The actus reus of the s 376(2)(a) PC charge</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 At the outset, I should make it clear that in my view, both the medical report by Dr Lew and the report by the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) were neutral factors insofar as proving the act of digital-anal penetration by the Accused was concerned. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Dr Lew’s report</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 In respect of Dr Lew’s report, it will be recalled that her evidence was that having performed a physical examination of the Complainant’s anal area, there were no “obvious trauma, tears, scratches” that she could see.

</div> In cross-examination, Dr Lew explained that “a lot of times”, whether or not there were “obvious injuries” resulting from an act of digital-anal penetration would depend on the “situation, size of object, how vigorous it was done or whether lubricants are used”. Therefore, having found no “obvious injuries” in the Complainant’s anal area in the present case, she could not confirm that his anus had been digitally penetrated, but she also could not rule out the possibility of digital-anal penetration either.

</div> The Defence argued that given the Complainant’s testimony about the Accused having inserted at least two fingers in his anus and the Accused’s nails having been “quite sharp”, the absence of the Accused’s DNA in the Complainant’s anus raised a reasonable doubt as to whether digital-anal penetration had actually occurred.

</div> However, the premise of this argument – that digital-anal penetration in the manner described would necessarily have led to the Accused’s DNA being found in the Complainant’s anal region – was never put to the HSA witness because the Defence elected to dispense with the attendance of the HSA witness. For that matter, the Defence also omitted to put any questions to Dr Lew about the conclusion – if any – to be drawn from the absence of the Accused’s DNA in the Complainant’s anus. Given that the Defence’s case theory included the specific proposition that “if any penetration had occurred, it should have left some form of scratches or marks, and the Accused DNA should have transferred onto [the Complainant’s] anus/anal region”

</div>, the omission by the Defence to put any questions to the relevant prosecution witnesses on this issue had to have been a considered decision.

What the Accused said was that he could not recall and did not really know whether he did insert his fingers into the Complainant’s anus.

The CA (at [113]) cited with approval VK Rajah JA’s observation in <span class="font-italic">XP v PP </span>[2008] 4 SLR(R) 686 (“<span class="font-italic">XP</span>”, at [31]) that the requirement the alleged victim’s evidence ought to be unusually convincing - </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">… does nothing, however, to change the ultimate rule that the Prosecution must prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt, but it does suggest how the evidential Gordian know may be untied if proof is to be found solely from the complainant’s testimony against the [accused].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">160 The CA also adopted (at [114] of <span class="font-italic">AOF</span>) Rajah JA’s propositions in <span class="font-italic">XP</span> as to what “unusually convincing” entailed:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a)     First, subsequent repeated complaints by the complainant cannot, in and of themselves, constitute corroborative evidence so as to dispense with the requirement for “unusually convincing” testimony. As Yong Pung How CJ noted in the Singapore High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Khoo Kwoon Hain v PP</span> [1995] 2 SLR(R) 591 (“Khoo Kwoon Hain”) at [51]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If the complainant’s evidence is not ‘unusually convincing’, I cannot see how the fact that she repeated it several times can add much to its weight.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b)     Secondly, the “unusually convincing” reminder should not be confined to categories of witnesses who are supposedly accomplices, young children or sexual offence complainants.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c)     Thirdly, a conviction will only be set aside where a reasonable doubt exists and not simply because the judge did not remind himself of the “unusually convincing” standard.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d)     Fourthly, an “unusually convincing” testimony does not overcome even materially and/or inherently contradictory evidence to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The phrase “unusually convincing” is not a term of art; it does not automatically entail a guilty verdict and surely cannot dispense with the need to consider the other evidence and the factual circumstances peculiar to each case. Nor does it dispense with having to assess the complainant’s testimony against that of the accused, where the case turns on one person’s word against the other’s.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(e)     Fifthly, even where there is corroboration, there may still not be enough evidence to convict.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">At [115] of <span class="font-italic">AOF</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the Court of Appeal further explained:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Moving from the level of scrutiny to the elements of what an unusually convincing testimony consists of, it is clear that a witness’s testimony may only be found to be “unusually <span class="font-italic">convincing</span>” by weighing the <span class="font-italic">demeanour </span>of the witness alongside both the <span class="font-italic">internal and external consistencies</span> found in the witness’ testimony. Given the inherent epistemic constraints of an appellate court as a finder of fact, this inquiry will <span class="font-italic">necessarily</span> be focussed on the internal and external consistency of the witness’s testimony. However, this is <span class="font-italic">not</span> to say that a witness’s credibility is <span class="font-italic">necessarily</span> determined <span class="font-italic">solely </span>in terms of his or her demeanour…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">161 Further, in assessing whether a complainant’s testimony is “unusually convincing”, the court must also assess the complainant’s testimony against that of the accused – such that the complainant’s testimony is found to be “unusually convincing” to the extent that “the court can safely say his account is to be unreservedly preferred over that of another”: see <span class="font-italic">XP</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [34]; <span class="font-italic">Kunasekaran s/o Kalimuthu Somasundara v </span><span class="font-italic">PP </span>[2018] 4 SLR 580 (“<span class="font-italic">Kunasekaran</span> at [27]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">162 Lastly, the CA has also held that where the complainant’s evidence was not unusually convincing, the accused’s conviction would be unsafe unless there was some corroboration of the complainant’s story (<span class="font-italic">AOF </span>at [173]; <span class="font-italic">Haliffie</span><span class="font-italic"> bin Mamat v PP</span> [2016] 5 SLR 636<span class="font-italic"> </span>(“<span class="font-italic">Haliffie</span>”,<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [30]).

The CA found that the alleged victim’s distress appeared to have been genuine and that the evidence of the witnesses who saw her right after the incident was corroborative evidence under the more “liberal approach” to corroboration (at [64] to [66] of <span class="font-italic">Haliffie</span>).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">164 In <span class="font-italic">GDC v PP</span> [2020] 5 SLR 1130 (“<span class="font-italic">GDC</span>”), in finding that the testimony of the alleged victim of an offence of aggravated outrage of modesty met the “unusually convincing” threshold, Sundaresh Menon CJ held that her testimony was <span class="font-italic">inter alia </span>“substantially corroborated” by a report which she had written in her school counsellor’s office on the same day on which the alleged offence was committed and prior to making the police report. Menon CJ also noted that the victim’s school counsellor had testified as to the victim’s demeanour on the day of the incident and how she “plainly seemed to have been affected by what had allegedly occurred earlier”. These factors added weight to the victim’s testimony because it was “implausible that she not only lied about the encounter [with the accused], but also knew months ahead of a court appearance that she should conduct herself in a particular way before third parties in order to create an appearance of credibility” (at [14] of <span class="font-italic">GDC</span>)<span class="font-italic">.</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) The Complainant’s testimony was unusually convincing</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">165 I found that the Complainant’s testimony in respect of the incident of digital-anal penetration met the “unusually convincing” threshold. My reasons were as follows.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">166 First, having had the opportunity to observe the Complainant in the witness stand, I found his evidence on the incident of digital-anal penetration to be candid and straightforward. He gave a clear and measured account of the events which occurred in the Accused’s room on 9 August 2017, but did not attempt to embellish or exaggerate his account of events and readily admitted that there were certain things which he could not recall or which he was unsure of. For example, he readily admitted that he could not remember the sequence of the sexual acts committed by the Accused, although he remembered that there were several distinct acts – including the act of digital-anal penetration. He also explained that this was because at the material time, he was still intoxicated and “falling in and out of consciousness”.

</div>  The impression he was clearly trying to give was that the “brush” against the Complainant’s buttock cheeks had happened only because he was at that point trying to pull the Complainant’s jeans and briefs down to mid-thigh, and that it was not an intentional act of touching. However, this account was starkly at odds with the account given in the Accused’s statement of 10 August 2017, in which he stated that he had “use[d] his left fingers to touch [the Complainant’s] anus while sucking his penis”,

I found the inconsistency between the account given by the Accused at trial and his account in his investigative statement to be material and telling. I have already explained in [144] to [152] my reasons for rejecting the Accused’s attempt to attribute a double meaning to the use of the word “anus” in his statement; and leaving aside his claims of linguistic confusion, no coherent explanation was proffered by the Accused for the inconsistency between his testimony and his statement.

His evidence was further corroborated by his contemporaneous account of the said incident to Dr Irfan and Dr Lew.

</div> Dr Low explained that he had used a retrograde extrapolation method to compute these BAC levels. This involved using the Complainant’s BAC at 1.00 PM on 9 August 2017, which had been measured at 40mg/100ml. In gist, this entailed Dr Low doing a “backward” calculation of the Complainant’s BAC levels using an objectively obtained baseline measurement of the Complainant’s BAC as well as an estimated alcohol clearance rate (<span class="font-italic">ie </span>the rate at which the Complainant’s body would clear or metabolise the alcohol). Dr Low explained that the retrograde extrapolation method of BAC calculation was a more accurate method, compared to estimating the Complainant’s BAC levels based on the amount of alcohol he was able to recall drinking.

In the case of the present Complainant, the Prosecution’s case was that his account of the events inside the Accused’s room, coupled with certain admissions in the Accused’s 10 August 2017 statement, demonstrated that he (the Complainant) was in fact incapable of consenting to sexual activity at the material time.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">189 Crucially, the defence expert Dr Lim testified that he had no difficulty in accepting the BAC figures derived by Dr Low using the retrograde calculation method (i.e. between 171.25mg/100ml and 215mg/100ml as at 4.15am and between 152.5mg/100ml and 190mg/100ml as at 5.30am).

The first concerned the issue of alcohol clearance rate. As I alluded to earlier, in using the retrograde extrapolation method to calculate the Complainant’s BAC levels at the time of the alleged offences, Dr Low assessed that the Complainant would be regarded as a “moderate drinker”, based on the latter’s account of his drinking pattern. Dr Low opined that based on the available literature, the alcohol clearance rate of a moderate drinker would be in the range of 15mg/100ml to 20mg/100ml.

First, as Dr Low pointed out in rebuttal, while it is true that there is a range of alcohol clearance rates “for any person”, it is not possible to disregard the difference between “a non-drinker versus an occasional drinker versus a chronic drinker”. Dr Low explained that the most important factor in determining an individual’s alcohol clearance rate would be the regularity of drinking: a seasoned drinker would generally have a higher alcohol clearance rate.

</div> If one were to use a range of 12mg/100ml to 18mg/100ml, an alcohol clearance rate of 12mg/100ml would apply to a “very novice drinker”, whereas more experienced drinkers would “[tend] to move to the upwards of the spectrum”, such that it would simply be “quite hard to use” the same alcohol clearance rate of 12mg/100ml for someone like the Complainant who “clearly had regular drinks”. In fact, in Dr Low’s opinion, an alcohol clearance rate of 15mg/100ml would be at the lower end of the spectrum for an individual with the Complainant’s reported drinking pattern. This would mean that the Complainant’s BAC level as at 4.15am should actually be at the higher end of the range of 171.25mg/100ml and 215mg/100ml calculated by Dr Low, because a higher alcohol clearance rate – when factored into a retrograde extrapolation – would lead to a higher BAC value as at 4.15am on 9 August 2017.

</div> In this connection, I note that the Defence did not at any stage challenge the Complainant’s account of his drinking habits (as recorded by Dr Low in his report).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">193 Second, and more fundamentally, Dr Lim’s assertion that the alcohol clearance rate of 15mg/100ml to 20mg/100ml used by Dr Low was one applicable to all drinkers made no substantive difference at the end of the day because Dr Lim himself affirmed in cross-examination that he “accept[ed] Dr Low’s result”.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">194 Having affirmed more than once that he accepted the BAC levels calculated by Dr Low in his report, however, Dr Lim sought to show that the Complainant “didn’t display the behaviour associated” with these BAC levels. This was the second point on which Dr Lim’s opinion appeared to diverge from Dr Low’s. Dr Lim’s main reason for claiming that the Complainant’s behaviour was uncharacteristic of these BAC levels was his observation, firstly, that the Complainant appeared able to walk without staggering or requiring support in the CCTV footage of the Accused’s lift lobby; and secondly, that the Complainant was able to give the address of the Condominium in his phone call to the police and was generally able to make himself understood during the phone conversation. The whole point of Dr Lim’s evidence in this respect appeared to be to suggest that the Complainant must therefore have had a lower BAC level at the time of the alleged offence than those calculated by Dr Low – since Dr Lim also suggested in his report various factors such as “body mass” and “genetics” which could “lead to different degrees of alcohol metabolism” and thus different BAC values.

</div> I say this “appeared to be” the point of Dr Lim’s evidence because regrettably, Dr Lim was not at all clear about the point he was making: this seemed the only rational explanation as to what Dr Lim was seeking to convey. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">195 Again, I found Dr Lim’s evidence in this respect unhelpful and illogical. In the first place, he had already accepted the BAC values calculated by Dr Low based on the undisputed BAC figure of 40mg/100ml measured at 1.00pm on 9 August 2017 and using the retrograde extrapolation method. In subsequently suggesting (or seeming to suggest) that the Complainant might have had a lower BAC level than the values calculated by Dr Low, Dr Lim failed to put forward any alternative calculations, much less any alternative BAC value. This was unconstructive, to say the least.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">196 Second, it appeared to me that any attempt by the Defence to suggest a lower BAC level on the Complainant’s part based on behaviour purportedly observed from the video and audio recordings was misconceived. As Dr Low pointed out in rebuttal, any attempt to “push down a calculated blood alcohol concentration just because the apparentness of it cannot be seen” would be a scientifically incorrect approach, since it would essentially conflate the notion of an individual’s “tolerance” of alcohol (in the sense of being able “to withstand the effects of alcohol without manifesting it”) with the individual’s BAC level. As Dr Low explained:

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">[F]rom what I understand in his report, [Dr Lim] is trying to say that because [the Complainant] is of such characteristics, therefore he should have a lower blood alcohol concentration than what I have stated. And because he has observed the footage, he had heard the audio, it doesn’t seem like someone who is in this range of blood alcohol concentration. But on the other hand, he has agreed with me that this is probably…the range of blood alcohol concentration that [the Complainant] has in his system. It’s just that he’s not showing it. And it doesn’t look like the apparent blood alcohol concentration and therefore, he said that there is therefore a lower blood alcohol concentration. There is some contradiction here because he has agreed with me on one hand, on the calculation, but the apparent blood alcohol concentration he disagrees based on what he has seen. And…he then pushes down the…blood alcohol concentration. That is not correct. We cannot push down a calculated blood alcohol concentration just because the apparentness of it cannot be seen. What we can ask ourselves then is, how is he manifesting such ability to tolerate the blood alcohol concentration? And that comes to the term “tolerance” and not metabolism and not blood alcohol concentration, because that is already fixed, that is already calculated. What you can then ask…is that, how is a person not manifesting the effects of alcohol at such levels? And that’s when you come to…the apparentness of his tolerance to alcohol, his ability to withstand or mask the symptoms and not harp upon a lower BAC because that cannot be in dispute anymore because he has agreed with me.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">197 Third, as I have noted, Dr Lim’s observations as to the Complainant’s purportedly uncharacteristic behaviour were based on the CCTV footage of the latter’s arrival at and subsequent exit from the lift lobby and on the audio recording of his phone call to the police. As to the CCTV footage, the video-recording of the Complainant’s arrival at the lift lobby lasted no more than 16 seconds,

</div> The distance for which the Complainant could actually be seen walking in both video-recordings was extremely short. Moreover, in the first video-recording, the Complainant was seen simply following the Accused into the lift – which suggested that there would not have been any real effort required on his part to orientate himself to his surroundings. In the second video-recording, it could be seen that he initially went in the wrong direction in his attempt to exit the Condominium before retracing his steps to get back to the correct path – which suggested some degree of confusion in his cognition. In the circumstances, the observation that he could not be seen visibly staggering or requiring support during these two short snippets could not in my view be sufficient basis for suggesting that his behaviour was uncharacteristic of someone with the BAC levels calculated by Dr Low – much less, that he must therefore have had a lower BAC level at the material time. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">198 As for the audio-recording of the Complainant’s phone call, having listened to it multiple times, it appeared to me that the Complainant was not merely mumbling but also slurring his words at certain intervals during the phone call – a fact Dr Low also remarked upon.

</div> The fact that he appeared to know he was talking to the police and was able to tell them where he was did not in my view warrant the conclusion that this behaviour was uncharacteristic of someone with the BAC levels calculated by Dr Low – much less, that he must therefore have had a lower BAC level at the material time (see [121] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">199  At the end of the day, therefore, having reviewed Dr Lim’s evidence in totality versus Dr Low’s, I was satisfied that there was no merit in the Accused’s suggestion that the Complainant’s behaviour was uncharacteristic of someone with the BAC levels calculated by Dr Low and/or that the Complainant must have had a lower BAC than those calculated by Dr Low. I accepted Dr Low’s evidence as to the Complainant’s BAC levels as between 4.15am and 5.30am on 9 August 2017. I also accepted Dr Low’s evidence that at the BAC levels calculated by him, generally the ability of the individual to consent to sexual activity would be impaired, because the individual’s ability to understand and to weigh the “benefits and cons” of sexual activity, to make an informed decision and to communicate that decision would be impaired.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">200 Dr Low’s evidence was a helpful and integral part of my consideration of the question as to whether the Complainant in fact had the capacity to consent to the sexual acts by the Accused at the material time.

</div> The Complainant said that he was still intoxicated at the point he woke up; he recounted being “like paralyzed similar to [when]…dreaming”, feeling “paralyzed with fear”, wanting to “get out” but not being able to, and experiencing a feeling similar to what he called “sleep paralysis”. While he was in this state, the Accused carried out various sexual acts which included kissing him, digitally penetrating his anus and fellating him a second time. The Complainant described himself as falling in and out of consciousness as these acts were performed by the Accused. Finally, at some point, he managed to gather the strength to get up and to push or brush the Accused away before leaving the room.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">203 Based on his testimony, the Complainant was still asleep and unconscious at the point the Accused first started fellating him, and did not as such have the capacity to consent to any sexual activity. Upon waking up, he continued to experience the effects of intoxication in that he was falling in and out of consciousness and felt as though he were paralysed “like when…dreaming”. Based on his account, again, his mental state upon awakening was such that he did not have the capacity to consent to any sexual activity. The question, then, would be whether the Complainant’s testimony was “unusually convincing”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">204 I found the Complainant’s testimony about what happened inside the room and the state that he was in at the material time to be unusually convincing. My reasons were as follows. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">205 First, the Complainant was able to provide a clear account of the events inside the Accused’s room. He was able to recall that prior to the alleged incident of sexual assault, he had been sitting on the floor of the room, that the Accused had given him an alcoholic drink which he had consumed, that he had refused the Accused’s offer of a change of clothing (specifically, pyjamas), that he had told the Accused he was going to sleep, and that he had then gone to sleep lying flat on the floor.

</div> He next recalled being woken up by some movement and finding that the Accused was sucking his penis. He was able to recall how he was “half asleep” and “pulling in and out of consciousness” as the Accused tried to put his tongue into his (the Complainant’s) mouth and to lift his (the Complainant’s) hand to put it on the Accused’s penis: <span class="font-italic">inter </span><span class="font-italic">alia</span>, he described how his hand was “floppy” and would “just drop” even as the Accused tried to place it on his penis. He also recalled the Accused inserting his fingers into his anus because he remembered it feeling “painful” and “sharp”. Finally, he recalled managing to “gain the strength” to get up, pushing or brushing the Accused away (though “not violently”), and realising at that point that his belt had come undone and that his trousers and briefs were around his ankles. He had some “vague” recollection of going to the toilet, feeling “disgusted” and trying to wash his penis because of his fear of “getting any STD”.

</div> In all, I found the Complainant’s account of what he could remember to be a vivid and textured one. He was also able to explain why and how his mental state upon awakening prevented him from resisting the sexual acts carried out by the Accused. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">206 At the same time, I observed that the Complainant did not attempt to embellish or exaggerate his evidence. When he was unsure of something, he said so: for example, although he did recall feeling “disgusted” and fearful of “getting any STD”, he admitted that he could not be “100%” certain that he had in fact gone to the toilet and tried to wash his penis. He was also candid in admitting the things he could not remember – for example, the exact sequence of the sexual acts carried out by the Accused in between the two acts of fellatio,

In particular, the Complainant’s description of how he had felt “paralyzed similar to when…dreaming” and how he had fallen “in and out of consciousness” corresponded with Dr Low’s evidence of the mental state generally associated with BAC levels above 150mg/100ml: namely, that at such BAC levels, the individual would be in a “confused state”, where “his conscious level drops”; and his ability to “process information”, to “understand and weigh decisions”, to “make sense of things around him”, and to formulate and communicate consent would be impaired. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">209 Second, the Complainant’s testimony was also consistent with the account he provided to the examining doctors at SGH hours after the alleged offences.

In respect of the accounts provided to medical and expert witnesses, the Defence pointed to the following extracts:

</div> This emphasis on the Complainant’s seated position appeared to me to be an attempt to drive home the point that the Complainant was – according to the Accused – not asleep at the material time. However, in the 10 August 2017 statement, the Accused’s evidence was that the Complainant “was almost lying flat on the floor and only his head was against the drawer”: in fact, the Accused added that the Complainant “was lying straight” and that it was “easier for [him] to remove [the Complainant’s] jeans”.

The Complainant was also said to have “had an expression of arousal on his face” while the Accused was fellating him.

Zen’s recollection was that the Complainant “sounded like he was panicking and really scared”, “was mumbling little bits of words and breathing heavily”, and had to be calmed down by Zen.

</div> Zen’s evidence about the Complainant’s immediate complaint of rape and his distress added weight to the latter’s testimony because – to borrow Menon CJ’s words in <span class="font-italic">GDR </span>(at [14]) – it was implausible that the Complainant not only lied about the sexual encounter, but also knew <span class="font-italic">years </span>ahead of a court appearance that he should conduct himself in a particular way before third parties in order to create an appearance of credibility.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">228 Second, in calling the police after his conversation with Zen, the Complainant repeated the same complaint of rape.

As such, the burden on the Prosecution to prove absence of motive to fabricate did not arise (see <span class="font-italic">PP v Yue Roger Jr</span> [2019] 3 SLR 749 (“<span class="font-italic">Roger Yue (HC)</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [48]). For the avoidance of doubt, I should make it clear that in my view, the evidence clearly showed the Complainant to have had no reason to fabricate the allegations of sexual assault. Indeed, according to the Accused’s version of events, all that had happened to the Complainant on 9 August 2017 was that he had willingly participated in the sexual encounter and had left the Condominium after appearing to change his mind about having sexual intercourse with the Accused. In other words, if the Accused were to be believed, the Complainant had no reason at all to call the police immediately after leaving the Condominium and/or to complain of sexual assault.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) The Accused’s account of events</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">231 Finally, having reviewed the Accused’s evidence about the alleged consensual nature of the sexual encounter, I did not find the Accused’s evidence sufficient to cast any reasonable doubt on the finding that the Complainant’s account of the incident was unusually convincing. In the first place, the Accused’s 10 August 2017 statement actually corroborated crucial portions of the Complainant’s testimony. The Accused recounted in his statement that the Complainant was lying down flat on the ground while the sexual acts were being carried out on him.

As the Accused himself admitted in his statement, “He did not say anything and I also did not ask him anything”.

</div> The Accused contended that the Complainant was awake and conscious throughout the sexual encounter, but the factual premise for this contention was extremely flimsy: it was primarily based on the tentative allegation that they had been “talking a moment” before the Accused started performing the various sexual acts, and on his observation that the Complainant’s eyes were “half-opened”. The Accused also contended that the Complainant made adjustments to the position of his body so as to facilitate the Accused’s removal of his jeans and briefs. However, this account appeared to me to be highly contrived and unbelievable. The Complainant was at that point wearing jeans, briefs and a belt (as well as a shirt). If he had in fact been awake, conscious and ready to engage in sexual activity with the Accused, there was no reason why he would not have removed his own clothing: it would certainly have been much simpler for him to do so than for him to lie flat on the floor while trying to “lift” his body to allow the Accused to pull down his jeans and briefs. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(4) Whether the Complainant did in fact consent to the sexual acts: Conclusion</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">233 For the reasons set out at [226] to [232], I was satisfied that even if the Complainant had the capacity to consent at the material time, he did not in fact consent to the sexual acts carried out by the Accused.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(5) Whether the Complainant’s alleged <span class="font-italic">prior</span> behaviour indicated consent to the sexual acts carried out by the Accused on 9 August 2017</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">234 I should make it clear that in finding that the Complainant did not consent to the sexual acts carried out by the Accused, I rejected the Defence’s contention that the Complainant’s alleged <span class="font-italic">prior </span>behaviour towards the Accused indicated his consent to the subsequent sexual acts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">235 In <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair</span>, the CA held that just because the victim was sociable or friendly with the appellant, this could not mean that the victim had consented to sexual activity with the accused. That conclusion would not change even if the court were to assume in the appellant’s favour that the victim had gone beyond being friendly and had flirted with him (at [67] of <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair</span>).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">236 In the present case, taking the Accused’s case at its highest, the Complainant was said to have used the expression “xo” in his text message which the Accused understood to mean “hugs and kisses”; the Complainant had given the Accused several “tight hugs” when wishing him happy birthday on the occasion of his birthday celebrations and had on the same occasion stated that he “liked” the Accused; the Complainant and the Accused had danced with their arms around each other’s shoulders at Hero’s pub on the night of 8 August 2017; and the Complainant had agreed to “sleep over” at the Accused’s apartment after their night out drinking. Even if I were to accept all these allegations, they still did not in any way demonstrate the Complainant’s consent to any sort of sexual activity with the Accused at his apartment on 9 August 2017. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">237 In respect of the expression “xo” used in the text message, even accepting the Accused’s assertion that it was a term commonly meant to convey “hugs and kisses”, this was really neither here nor there. A perusal of the WhatsApp and Snapchat messages between the Accused and the Complainant showed that their communications in between the two-odd weeks prior to 9 August 2017 consisted of mundane chit-chat about their social and sporting activities. Moreover, throughout all the conversations on WhatsApp and Snapchat, the Complainant consistently referred to the Accused as “buddy”, “bud” or “mate”, just as he referred to his other friends as “mates”.

</div> From these messages, therefore, it was obvious that the Complainant simply saw the Accused as a friend: there was simply no hint of any romantic interest on his part vis-à-vis the Accused, much less any desire or intention to engage in sexual activity with the Accused.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">238 In respect of the Complainant’s alleged behaviour during the Accused’s birthday celebration, even assuming he had hugged the Accused and stated that he liked him, the most that could be said was that the Complainant had thereby shown friendly affection towards the Accused which was in keeping with the nature of the occasion: it was after all the Accused’s birthday; the Accused had invited the Complainant to his birthday party; the Accused had even agreed to let him bring his friends along; and it was not disputed that the Complainant had consumed a number of drinks in the course of that night. Even if I were to assume in the Accused’s favour that the Complainant’s behaviour went beyond being friendly and constituted some sort of flirtation, it was simply not possible to characterise this behaviour as being indicative of consent to sexual activity with the Accused. The same observation must be made as well in respect of the allegation of the dancing at Hero’s pub on the night of 8 August 2017.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">239 In respect of the Complainant’s agreement to “sleep over” at the Condominium after their night out drinking, it was telling that even though the Accused claimed the Complainant’s agreement to “sleep over” implied an agreement to engage in sexual activity, he conceded that this was his own understanding, based on his own experience, which he did not verbalise to the Complainant.

</div> Indeed, it was plain from the Accused’s own evidence that no discussion about the possibility of sexual activity ever took place between them; and the last thing the Complainant said to the Accused prior to the latter carrying out the various sexual acts was that he wanted to go to sleep.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">240 For the avoidance of doubt, I rejected the Accused’s allegation that the Complainant had spoken about wanting to “explore his sexuality” at their very first meeting on 23 July 2017.

Specifically, this involves establishing that “by reason of a mistake of fact”, the accused “in good faith” believed himself to be justified by law in doing what he did to the victim. In the context of sexual assault cases, therefore, the accused must have in good faith believed that the victim consented to the sexual acts forming the basis of the charge(s). Further, pursuant to s 52 PC, nothing is believed “in good faith” if it is believed “without due care and attention” (<span class="font-italic">Pram Nair</span> at [110]-[111]; <span class="font-italic">Asep Ardiansyah</span> at [45]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Whether the defence of mistake of fact applied on the present facts</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">246 In the present case, I accepted the Prosecution’s submission that there was no basis for the Accused to argue that he had, in good faith, believed the Complainant to have consented to sexual activity with him.

Thereafter, the Accused began carrying out the various sexual acts on the Complainant, without ever asking the latter if he consented to these sexual acts or even confirming that he was fully awake and conscious. In his statement to the police, the Accused was only able to say tentatively and vaguely, “I <span class="font-italic">think </span>he was conscious because we were talking just a moment ago”.

On the present facts, it was not disputed that the Complainant and Accused had consumed large amounts of alcohol prior to returning to the Condominium, and that they had consumed more alcohol in the Accused’s room. I have explained earlier my reasons for finding that the Complainant was asleep when the Accused began performing the sexual acts on him, and that even upon awakening, the Complainant was falling in and out of consciousness, feeling “paralysed”, and had no capacity to consent to sexual activity. It was in this vulnerable state that the Complainant was taken advantage of by the Accused.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">262 Next, I agreed with the Prosecution that the Complainant clearly suffered psychiatric harm as a result of the sexual assaults. Dr Chee, the psychiatrist who treated the Complainant on 30 July 2018, diagnosed the Complainant as suffering from “Generalized Anxiety Disorder with possible Post-traumatic stress symptoms”, and started him on antidepressant medications for anxiety disorders – being Venlafaxine with a dosage of 75mg/d.

</div> in his first phone call to the police. According to the Prosecution, this showed that there was a “betrayal” by the Accused of the trust reposed in him as a friend. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">265 In my view, it would be wholly inappropriate to find a breach of trust on the present facts. In <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>when the CA alluded to a “breach of trust” as an aggravating factor for sentencing purposes, the CA expressly referred to cases where there was a pre-existing relationship of responsibility between the offender and the victim, or where the offender was a person in whom the victim had placed her trust by virtue of his (the offender’s) office of employment (at [44(b)] of <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span>). Obviously, the second limb of that formulation did not apply in the present case. As for the first limb, I did not find it possible to agree that there was some sort of pre-existing relationship of responsibility between the Accused and the Complainant. At best, they were simply friends who had known each other for a few weeks and who had met on three different occasions. As Aedit Abdullah J pointed out in <span class="font-italic">PP </span><span class="font-italic">v Ong Soon Heng </span>[2018] SGHC 58 (“<span class="font-italic">Ong Soon Heng</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [134]), there can be no abuse of position in a situation “where the perpetrator and the victim were merely friends as that would result in too broad a scope for the aggravating factor of abuse of position”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">266 For completeness, I should also make it clear that this was not a case of an offender who could be said to have exploited the trust placed in him by third parties who entrusted the victim to him – a factor which has been considered an offence-specific aggravating factor in <span class="font-italic">Ong Soon Heng</span> (at [143]) </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">267 Having regard to the Accused’s exploitation of the Complainant’s vulnerability while he was intoxicated as well as the psychiatric harm suffered by the Complainant, I was of the view that the present offences would fall within the middle to higher end of Band 1 of the <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair</span> sentencing framework.

</div> There is ample authority for the proposition that voluntary intoxication worsens rather than mitigates the offence (<span class="font-italic">PP</span><span class="font-italic"> v Satesh s/o Navarlan </span>[2019] SGHC 119 at [23]; <span class="font-italic">Chung Wan v </span><span class="font-italic">PP </span>[2019] 5 SLR 858 at [57]; <span class="font-italic">Wong Hoi Len v </span><span class="font-italic">PP </span>[2009] 1 SLR(R) 115 at [44]–[48]; <span class="font-italic">PP</span><span class="font-italic"> v Lim Chee Yin Jordon </span>[2018] 4 SLR 1294 at [56]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">272 However, I disagreed with the Prosecution that the Defence’s treatment of the Complainant in the present case amounted to an aggravating factor that should be held against the Accused. The Prosecution’s argument that the Accused had engaged in victim-blaming was based on the following three factors: first, the Accused had put the Complainant through a trial and suggested that the Complainant had desired to engage in sexual activity with the Accused; second, the Accused had baselessly accused the Complainant of tampering with evidence by deleting and / or manipulating WhatsApp messages and failing to furnish a complete set of their Snapchat conversations; third, the Complainant had been confronted with the scandalous suggestion that after leaving the Accused’s room mid-way through the second act of fellatio, he had gone into the toilet to masturbate.

</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">273 As to the first factor, it must be remembered that in cases of alleged sexual assault where the main issue in contention is the presence or absence of consent by the victim, the accused and the victim will almost invariably have diametrically opposed versions of the relevant events. The victim’s position will usually be that no consent was given and / or that the victim lacked the capacity to consent to sexual activity. On the other hand, the accused would usually take the position that the victim had capacity to consent and had in fact consented to sexual activity. In putting forward such a defence, the accused does not of course have license to make all sorts of scandalous allegations against the victim. At the same time, however, the accused who relies on such a defence should not be unduly penalised at the sentencing stage for putting uncomfortable questions and suggestions to the victim, so long as this is done in a reasonable manner and the questions or suggestions are necessary for the proper ventilation of the defence. Ultimately, whether or not an accused in a particular case has crossed the line into “victim-blaming” would depend on the specific facts and circumstances of that case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">274 In <span class="font-italic">GCM v </span><span class="font-italic">PP and another appeal </span>[2021] 4 SLR 1086 (“<span class="font-italic">GCM</span>”), for example, the accused (“U”) was a 22-year-old university student, and the victim (“S”) was a 13-year-old secondary school student. U pleaded guilty to three charges of sexual penetration of a minor under 14 years of age. On appeal, Abdullah J criticised the conduct of U’s counsel in the proceedings below. He observed (at [91]) that the counsel had, in the proceedings below, made assertions that “essentially blamed the victim, alluded to her supposed promiscuity and ill repute, and being the initiator of intimacy”. Counsel had even included “photographs which seemed to be intended to show the sexual maturity of the victim”. Abdullah J held (at [93]) that cumulatively, counsel’s submissions constituted a “blatant and unapologetic attempt to foist responsibility and blame on the victim”, and that such character assassination served no purpose. In Abdullah J’s view (at [96]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…What counsel should properly do is to carefully consider their submissions to determine whether or not they are relevant to the offence, and whether they are at all indicative of their clients’ culpability. If an argument is scurrilous or scandalising, and/or casts aspersions about a victim without any real relevance to the accused’s wrongdoing, counsel should not make any such submission.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Abdullah J also noted (at [100]) that in cases where such scurrilous or scandalising submissions were made, it would be “appropriate for the court to impose an uplift to any sentence imposed to reflect a clear absence of remorse in attacking the victim in a scurrilous way”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">275 In<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Law Society of Singapore v Wong Sin Yee </span>[2018] 5 SLR 1261, the respondent counsel (“W”) faced a complaint regarding his conduct when he had acted on behalf of a client charged with outraging the modesty of a woman. In the course of his cross-examination of the victim (“V”) at trial, W had questioned V on whether she was attractive, had suggested that she was, and had required her to stand up in court so as to subject her to physical scrutiny. The Court of Three Judges found (at [39]-[41]) that W’s cross-examination of V “was both irrelevant and wholly impermissible”. W’s cross-examination “did not relate to facts in issue or matters necessary to determining if the facts in issue existed”, and “the inquiry into the correlation between the victim’s attractiveness and the ‘temptation’ or ‘motive’ to molest was misguided”, with “no evidence to support a contention that there was such a correlation”. The Court of Three Judges also stated (at [40]) that getting the victim to stand up “was tantamount to asking her to parade her physique and appearance for public scrutiny, to the point that she understandably felt uncomfortable and offended”. Finally, the Court of Three Judges observed (at [41]) that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Third, it was cruel and humiliating to suggest to the victim that she was attractive, and to physically scrutinise her to the point that she felt uncomfortable and offended, only to then suggest that she was so unattractive that her testimony that she was deliberately molested could not be believed. This was a clear abuse of the power the Respondent had in relation to the victim in his role as counsel.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">276 In the present case, based on counsel’s cross-examination of the Complainant, I did not find that there was any victim-blaming by the Accused.

</div> this suggestion was relevant to the Accused’s defence of consent. The same was true of the Accused’s allegation of a mutual romantic attraction between the Complainant and him. Moreover, the allegations of romantic interest and desire which were put forward to the Accused were couched in moderate terms and could not by any stretch of the imagination be said to constitute accusations of a scurrilous or scandalising nature. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">277 In similar vein, the question posed to the Complainant about his alleged act of masturbation in the toilet was relevant to the Accused’s case that the Complainant had consented to the sexual encounter in his room and that he had been visibly aroused in the process. In any event, counsel did not dwell on the subject after putting the Accused’s case to the Complainant:

</div>
</div> there was no prolonged questioning, nor any inappropriate comments or suggestions made by counsel. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">278 As to the Accused’s allegations about missing or incomplete WhatsApp and Snapchat messages, I also did not agree that these allegations amounted to victim-blaming. As far as I could see, the Defence was simply challenging the accuracy and completeness of the messages adduced in evidence. If an accused takes the position that the victim has adduced incomplete or inaccurate documentary evidence, the accused should as a matter of principle put his position for the victim. In any event, counsel in this case clearly did not engage in any inappropriate or scurrilous or scandalous remarks when putting forward the Accused’s position on the messages. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">279 For the avoidance of doubt, I should add that I did not find that there was any reason to doubt the accuracy and completeness of the messages adduced by the Complainant. The Accused admitted that he could not find the allegedly missing messages on his own phone; and from what little he could recall of their purported contents, it was evident that nothing significant turned on these messages (even assuming they existed).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">280 I should also add that in sentencing the Accused, I did not consider his decision to claim trial to be an aggravating factor. Electing to claim trial simply meant that upon conviction, the Accused would not benefit – at the sentencing stage – from the mitigatory weight of a plea of guilt. I did not think the Prosecution was in disagreement with this established principle. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">281 Although I did not agree that the Accused had engaged in victim-blaming, I did agree on the other hand that his conduct in making grave – and ultimately baseless – allegations against the police constituted an aggravating factor for sentencing purposes (<span class="font-italic">per </span>Chan Sek Keong CJ in <span class="font-italic">PP</span><span class="font-italic"> v Amir Hamzah Bin Mohammad </span>[2012] SGHC 165 at [19]). To be clear, I did not think the Accused should be penalised for testifying about his experience of the police in his “home town” and his consequent fear of the police <span class="font-italic">in general</span>. However, the Accused went further than simply testifying about his general fear of the police: he made various allegations about the manner in which ASP Raj and Mr Tho had conducted themselves. ASP Raj was alleged to have “interrogated” the Accused alone even before the formal statement-recording and to have taken the opportunity to make insinuating remarks about the Complainant’s father being “super loaded”. Mr Tho was alleged to have attempted to “coach” the Accused on what to say in his statement and to have refused to let him make amendments. Mr Tho was even alleged to have told the Accused that he would not be released from the lock-up if he failed to sign the statement. The upshot of the Accused’s allegations about the two officers was that they had successfully intimidated him into accepting various inaccuracies in his statement. It should also be noted that despite the seriousness of the Accused’s allegations against ASP Raj and Mr Tho, the Defence chose to raise these allegations for the first time at trial <span class="font-italic">after</span> the Prosecution had closed its case. This necessitated the recall of Mr Tho and the calling of ASP Raj to respond to the allegations, thereby causing wastage (or at the very least, highly inefficient usage) of resources. No explanation was proffered by the Defence for their omission to bring up these allegations earlier. Eventually, as seen from [131] to [151] above, I found the Accused’s allegations against the two officers to be completely unfounded.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">282 The Accused’s baseless (and belated) allegations against the police showed a lack of remorse on his part and constituted an aggravating factor for sentencing purposes. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Mitigating factors</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">283 As to the offender-specific mitigating factors, following the CA’s decision in <span class="font-italic">BPH</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [84]–[85]), the absence of antecedents on the Accused’s part would be a neutral factor and not a mitigating factor. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">284 I also disagreed with the Defence that the Accused had been “cooperative” with the relevant authorities and/or that he had rendered such assistance throughout the investigations that this should count as a mitigating factor. Apart from making a bare assertion, the Defence did not provide any details of the Accused’s alleged cooperation with the authorities and the assistance he allegedly rendered. As the Prosecution pointed out, even taking the Accused’s case at its very highest, his act of opening the door for the police on the day of his arrest, and his conduct in reporting for bail as scheduled, could not amount to conduct that should be afforded mitigating weight.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">285 Next, although the Defence has placed great emphasis on the Accused’s good character, charitable works and numerous character testimonials, it must be pointed out that as a matter of principle, these matters would generally be accorded <span class="font-italic">modest and limited</span> mitigatory weight at best. In <span class="font-italic">Stansilas Fabian Kester v Public Prosecutor </span>[2017] 5 SLR 755 (“<span class="font-italic">Stansilas</span>”), Menon CJ explained the circumstances in which a court would be justified in admitting evidence of positive contributions and good character in the sentencing process (at [102]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">102    The following principles may be extracted from the foregoing analysis:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a)     Any evidence concerning the offender’s public service and contributions must be targeted at showing that <span class="font-italic">specific sentencing objectives will be satisfied </span>were a lighter sentence to be imposed on the offender.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b)     The fact that an offender has made past contributions to society might be a relevant mitigating factor not because it somehow reduces his culpability in relation to the present offence committed, but because it is indicative of his capacity to reform and it tempers the concern over the specific deterrence of the offender.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c)     This, however, would carry modest weight and can be displaced where other sentencing objectives assume greater importance.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d)     Any offender who urges the court that his past record bears well on his potential for rehabilitation will have to demonstrate the connection between his record and his capacity and willingness for reform, if this is to have any bearing.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">286 In practice, this translates to the general proposition that “alleged charitable or other good works” – and by extension good character – “cannot be regarded as mitigating on some form of social accounting that balances the past good works of the offender with his/or offences”. The only basis where <span class="font-italic">limited weight</span> might be given to such works (and good character) is if they were “sufficient to demonstrate that the offence in question is a one-off aberration, which might then displace the need for specific deterrence” (<span class="font-italic">PP</span><span class="font-italic"> v Song Hauming Oskar and another appeal </span>[2021] 5 SLR 965 at [129]-[130] citing <span class="font-italic">PP</span><span class="font-italic"> v Lim Cheng Ji Alvin</span> [2017] 5 SLR 671 at [23]; <span class="font-italic">Ang Peng Tiam v Singapore Medical Council and another matter </span>[2017] 5 SLR 356 (“<span class="font-italic">Ang Peng Tiam</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [100]-[102]; and <span class="font-italic">Stansilas </span>[102]). In particular, the three-judge High Court in <span class="font-italic">Ang Peng Tiam </span>(at [101]) expressly rejected the view that “an offender’s general good character or his past contributions to society (such as volunteer work and contributions to charities) can be regarded as a mitigating factor in so far as this rests on the notion that it reflects the moral worth of the offender”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">287 Applying the above principles to the present case, neither the Accused’s alleged good character nor his charitable contributions could be considered a mitigating factor insofar as this was premised on the notion that they reflected his moral worth. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">288 Moreover, this was a case of serious sexual assault of a vulnerable victim. Even if I were to assume that the Accused’s good character argued for this being a one-off aberration, there remained a need for the sentences to reflect the importance of <span class="font-italic">general</span> deterrence of such crimes. General deterrence aims to educate and deter other like-minded members of the general public by making an example of a particular offender (<span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Law Aik Meng </span>[2007] 2 SLR(R) 814 at [24]). In the present case, the need for such general deterrence would displace what moderate mitigatory weight could be ascribed to the Accused’s alleged good character. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">289 Finally, I did not accept the Defence’s submissions that the following factors were of mitigating value:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) no use of force;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) no abuse of trust;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) no injuries on the Complainant;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) no restraining or confining of the Complainant; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) no or low psychological harm.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">These would be more accurately classified as neutral factors, in that the Accused should not be credited for the absence of actions such as the use of force and the abuse of trust – but would be penalised if such aggravating conduct were present. This is in line with the principle that the absence of aggravating factors cannot be construed as a mitigating factor (<span class="font-italic">Mohammed Ibrahim s/o Hamzah v </span><span class="font-italic">PP </span>[2015] 1 SLR 1081 at [41]; <span class="font-italic">Edwin s/o </span><span class="font-italic">Suse Nathen v PP </span>[2013] SGHC 194<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [25]; <span class="font-italic">PP</span><span class="font-italic"> v Chow Yee Sze </span>[2011] 1 SLR 481 at [14]; <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v AOM </span>[2011] 2 SLR 1057 at [37]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">290 For the reasons set out at [283] to [289], I agreed with the Prosecution that there were no offender-specific mitigating factors in the present case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Adjustment to indicative sentence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">291 Taking into account the offender-specific aggravating factors, I agreed with the Prosecution that there should be an upward adjustment of the indicative sentence.

As Menon CJ has explained in <span class="font-italic">Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v </span><span class="font-italic">PP </span>[2014] 2 SLR 998 (“<span class="font-italic">Shouffee</span>”) (at [58]-[59]), the totality principle requires the court to take a last look at the facts and circumstances to assess “whether the sentence looks wrong”. If so, “consideration ought to be given to whether the aggregate sentence should be reduced” and this could be done by re-assessing “which of the appropriate sentences ought to run consecutively” and also by “re-calibrating the individual sentences so as to arrive at an appropriate aggregate sentence”. The two limbs of the totality principle are as follows (at [47] and [53]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Whether the aggregate sentence is substantially above the normal level of sentences for the most serious of the individual offences involved; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Whether its effect is to impose on the offender a crushing sentence not in keeping with his records and prospects.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">294 There are also three ancillary principles that go with the application of the totality principle (at [75]-[80] of <span class="font-italic">Shouffee</span>):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the totality principle may not be applied in such a way as to undermine s 307(1) CPC. This means that the total term of imprisonment for the sentences to be run consecutively has to exceed the term of imprisonment imposed for the highest individual sentence;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, care should be taken to ensure that the aggravating factors are not counted against the accused twice over; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, under the right circumstances, the totality principle does not preclude more than two sentences being run consecutively.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">295  In <span class="font-italic">PP</span><span class="font-italic"> v Raveen Balakrishnan</span> [2018] 5 SLR 799 (“<span class="font-italic">Raveen</span>”) (at [77]–[78]), Menon CJ explained that the application of the totality principle to mitigate the aggregate sentence of a multiple offender was not to be justified as a bulk discount on account of multiple offending. Rather, the totality principle is a recognition of the fact that “<span class="font-italic">an aggregation resulting in a longer sentence is going to carry a compounding effect that bears more than a linear relation to the cumulative and overall criminality of the case</span>”. Additionally, an extremely long aggregate sentence could also induce a feeling of hopelessness that destroys all prospects of an offender’s rehabilitation and reintegration. At the end of the day, the court has to consider all the facts and circumstances of the case to ensure that the aggregate sentence is <span class="font-italic">sufficient and proportionate to the offender’s overall criminality</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [98(c)] of <span class="font-italic">Raveen</span>).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">296 In the present case, the Prosecution acknowledged that in light of the totality principle, the Accused’s global sentence ought to be moderated downwards to reflect a generous sentencing discount.

</div> In essence, the Accused’s <span class="font-italic">overall criminality </span>in the present case involved <span class="font-italic">a single instance</span> of sexual assault in which there were two instances of fellatio and one instance of digital-anal penetration. As such, although the Accused was convicted of <span class="font-italic">three charges</span> of sexual assault by penetration, his <span class="font-italic">overall criminality </span>should be considered<span class="font-italic"> significantly lower</span> than that of an offender convicted of <span class="font-italic">three charges</span> of sexual assault by penetration committed against more than one victim – or where those offences were committed against the same victim <span class="font-italic">on multiple instances</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">298 I accepted the above submissions by the Prosecution.
