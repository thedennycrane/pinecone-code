They were believed to have a large quantity of cannabis stored in one of the flats in Blocks 52, 53 or 54 (all blocks named are in the Teban Gardens Road housing estate unless otherwise stated).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Photographs of the said male Indians were shown to the officers.</span></p>

<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">4.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">        </span> In the meantime, another male Indian resembling the accused had disappeared from the scene and was believed to be hiding in #06-164 of Block 24 (the accused’s flat).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The CNB officers knocked on the main door of that unit and identified themselves but there was no response from within the flat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Several of the officers then left for the flower shop at Block 61 to ask the accused’s wife, Vasuagee d/o Subramaniam, to help them gain access into the flat</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">5.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">        </span> At about 6.35 pm, they returned to the accused’s flat with Vasuagee and tried to use her keys to open the main door.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Although the keys worked, the door would not open as it was latched from within.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The door was then kicked open.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The CNB officers entered the flat and arrested the accused in the master bedroom after a struggle. His young son was also in the master bedroom. A search was then conducted and one Dunhill cigarette box containing two rolled-up papers of vegetable matter was found on top of the basin in the toilet located in the kitchen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Later that night, the accused was escorted to Block 52.</span></p>

<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">8.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">        </span> Balu was then brought up to #09-592 of Block 52 where the occupants of that flat were questioned.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He was then brought up to the staircase landing at the thirteenth floor of that block and further questioned. At about 8.05 pm, an Indian lady (Indra d/o Ramasamy) walked up the stairs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Upon seeing the group of men, she turned around and walked away but was told by the CNB officers to continue to proceed to her destination.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was discovered that she was the owner of #13-588 and that she knew Balu as her tenant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> ASP Nigel Sim asked her not to unlock the padlock on the gates.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He then used the bunch of four keys seized earlier from Balu and two of the keys could unlock the padlock and the main door.

<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">13.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">      </span> Balu was then brought to his flat in Jurong West where a search was conducted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The accused was brought to CNB HQ.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Later, at CNB HQ, the bundles of vegetable matter seized from the rented room were weighed by the Investigating Officer in the presence of Balu and the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The bundles were subsequently analysed by the Health Sciences Authority and were found to contain a total of not less than 2715.6 grams of cannabis, the subject of the charge.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">14.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">      </span> Fingerprint examination of the exhibits seized from the said room revealed only one latent print on some Tamil Murasu newspapers dated 6 December 2002 but that was not traced to Balu or to the accused.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">15.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">      </span> The investigations revealed that the accused and his wife rented a shop space at #01-05 in Block 61 in July 2002 to operate a flower shop which also sold clothes and prayer items. The rental was $1200 per month. The accused’s wife testified that their shop would be open from around 8.30 am to about 8.30 pm every day except Sunday when it would be closed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The accused would open the shop in the morning and would take care of it until about 2 pm when she would take over after completing her household duties and sending their two children to school.

<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">16.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">      </span> She was the subscriber of a Singtel handphone bearing number 98279544 which was used by the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She used another Singtel handphone with the number 98956601, which was operated using the Hi-card system.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">17.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">      </span> The accused’s wife remembered having seen Balu talking to her husband in the flower shop several times in 2003 although they were not introduced to each other. A couple of years ago, their family had attended a party at the Fort Canning Park held by Balu to celebrate his daughter’s birthday.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">18.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">      </span> On 24 February 2003, she accompanied some CNB officers from the flower shop to her flat as they had asked her to follow them there.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She confirmed that the main door of her flat could not be opened by the officers using her keys.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She was told that the main door had been latched from within.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She did not know why her husband had done that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> After the CNB officers kicked the main door down, they dashed into the master bedroom and shut the room door.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She was told to sit in the living room.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As their young son (three and a half years old) was crying, he was brought out to the living room.

<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">20.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">      </span> The flower shop business was definitely a profitable one as there was only one Indian shop in that area.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They could make gross profits of $100 to slightly less than $200 per day.

At about 11.30 am, he rejoined the group.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He ordered beer for everyone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Sometime between 12 noon and 12.30 pm, he left the group and walked home.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">109.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">    </span> Back at his flat, he helped his wife with some home cleaning and did not leave the flat again that day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He made nine calls from his handphone to Balu’s handphone between 2 pm and 7.35 pm that day. He believed the calls were about tips on the Singapore and Malaysian horse races that Sunday.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In one call from Balu to him, Balu mentioned that he was painting the rented room.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">110.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">    </span> The next day, 24 February 2003, the accused opened his flower shop as usual in the morning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> When his wife and their maid went to take over the shop at lunch, he brought their young son home as he was not feeling well. They returned to the flat to sleep.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He made two or three calls to Balu that afternoon. As he was taking his shower at about 6 pm, he heard his son crying, presumably because of the banging sounds coming from the main door of the flat and went out of the bathroom in a towel. His wife opened the door of the master bedroom and CNB officers rushed into the room and arrested him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He acknowledged that the two rolled up cigarettes of cannabis found in his flat belonged to him and that he smoked cannabis occasionally.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">111.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">    </span> The accused denied Balu’s testimony about how the room in Indra’s flat came to be rented.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He denied ever having possession of any of the keys for Indra’s flat. Balu did not approach him at all for financial assistance for his food stall. The accused did not and could not have demonstrated cutting of cannabis in his flat as his son would be sleeping there. He denied having offered Balu $100 to cut cannabis for him.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">112.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">    </span> In cross examination, the accused said he smoked cannabis only when he had stomach pain due to his irregular meals.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> While he was working together with Balu, they would smoke cannabis together but he would not share the drug with Balu.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> When the accused did not have cannabis, Balu would give him some. He also bought cannabis from Balu on two or three occasions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The accused also bought from other suppliers in small amounts. The two sticks of cannabis found in his flat by the CNB officers was part of six joints of cannabis that Balu had put in an empty cigarette box and given to him.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">113.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">    </span> The accused believed Balu was unhappy that he had taken over Balu’s job at Natferrous as the one overseeing the stevedoring project.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Balu’s service was terminated as he had a poor punctuality record.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He agreed it was Balu who recommended him to work in the company.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">114.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">    </span> In March 2003, after their case had been mentioned in the Subordinate Courts, as they were being brought back to the Queenstown Remand Prison in the prison bus, Balu asked the accused in front of everyone in<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> the bus how the CNB came to know about the rented flat when only Balu, the accused and Indra knew about it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The accused therefore believed that Balu thought the accused had framed him.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">115.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">    </span> The accused found out about the stabbing incident (which happened on 16 February 2003) only in the morning of 17 February 2003.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He went to the coffee shop at about 4 pm that day and spoke mainly with Balu’s father.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> When Balu’s wife was at the coffee shop,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Balu did not lift up his shirt to show the wounds.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He merely pointed to the areas where he was stabbed.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">116.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">    </span> Balu paid the accused the balance of $200 for the rental which the accused had paid to Indra on his behalf.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> After selling his New Singapore Shares, Balu also paid him another $400 for the bets on horse races which the accused had paid for him earlier.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">117.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">    </span> Indra offered the accused a commission for helping her get a tenant but he declined to take it. Balu wanted a room near his food stall so that he and his workers could rest there during the day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Balu could also stay there overnight as he needed to start the next day’s business very early.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The accused said if he was the one who wanted to rent the room, he would have done so when Indra approached him in November or December 2002.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Asked whether Indra had any reason to lie about the accused, he said Indra and Balu were seated together in her flat when their statements were being recorded and Indra, due to her age and out of fear and confusion, could have been mistaken that it was the accused who brought Balu to her flat and therefore merely answered ‘yes, yes’ to everything in the recording of her statement, essentially echoing Balu.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">118.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">    </span> Neither the accused nor Balu told Indra that Balu was a student.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> However, since Balu had a computer in his work as a part time private investigator, Balu asked Indra whether it was safe to keep his computer there.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The accused then asked Indra to whom she had given the room keys and she replied that her husband last went back to the flat four years ago. He might have said Balu was an educated man.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He agreed he did most of the talking on the day of introduction but that was because Balu and Indra were asking him questions and he was responding to both.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">119.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">    </span> The rent for February 2003 was paid on 15 February.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A few days before that, Indra told the accused that she rarely met Balu and therefore did not know how to collect the rent from him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The accused told her he would let Balu know or would get the rent from him and keep it in his flower shop for her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> On 15 February 2003, Balu telephoned the accused to say he was going to the barber shop that was next to the accused’s flower shop for a haircut.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The accused asked him whether he had paid the rent for that month and he replied he had not but was bringing the money with him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> When the accused warned him not to play any tricks, Balu said if he did not believe him, he would pass the money to him for him to give to Indra.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> When Balu arrived, he passed the money to the accused who then telephoned Indra to get the money from him. He did not tell Indra that Balu’s food stall was located in the block next to Indra’s. He also did not tell Balu to go and pay Indra directly as he pitied the lady.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">120.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">    </span> He said that the door of the master bedroom was not closed on 24 February 2003 when the CNB went into his flat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He did not hear anything strange. However, his son was crying while the main door was being banged and that was why he went out of the bathroom clad in a towel.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">121.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">    </span> Asked why he had latched the main door from within, he said his block of flats was Singapore’s first upgraded block and the main door’s locking mechanism was such that when a person inside the flat wanted to lock the door, he had to use a key from inside the flat to it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> That day, he did not bother to use the key and therefore simply latched the door.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He could not hear the knocking the first time as he was in the toilet with its door closed and the television was on because his young son had awakened.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> To the assertion that he was doing so to avoid arrest, he retorted that if he knew the CNB was after him, then he should not be in his flat awaiting arrest. He only knew who the officers were after the arrest, which he claimed took place at 6.10 pm as he looked at the clock in the living room.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This was because three outgoing calls were recorded as having been made from his handphone to the telephone in the flower shop after 6.10 pm.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He claimed he had dialled the telephone number for his son and then handed the handphone to him.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">122.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">    </span> The accused said he did not mention he had been to Indra’s flat on 7 or 8 January 2003 with Balu in a statement recorded on 1 and 3 March 2003 as the interview room was very cold and he wanted to give the statement as quickly as possible and get out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He denied he avoided mentioning that incident in an attempt to minimize his role in the renting of the room. He told the Investigating Officer he had lent Balu $400 to $500 but the Investigating Officer recorded it as a loan relating to the food stall. Further, there was no reason for him to offer Balu $100 for cutting each block as it was a task he could perform himself.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 12pt 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><strong>THE DECISION OF THE COURT</strong></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">123.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">    </span> Balu was an accomplice who had pleaded guilty to the charges albeit for a lesser amount of cannabis.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Under s 116 Illustration (b) Evidence Act, the court may presume that an accomplice is unworthy of credit and his evidence needs to be treated with caution. This maxim must be considered in the light of the evidence adduced before the court.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">124.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">    </span> I believed the evidence of Balu that the room in question was rented by the accused, that Balu made use of it only on the occasions mentioned and that each time, he had to take the keys from the accused and would return them to him after using the room. Balu was a man who was in financial straits.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He had been retrenched and was out of work since July 2002.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He could not pay his bills. The accused knew that because of the letters of demand from the finance company. His car was re-possessed. Balu’s wife had frequent arguments with her husband over the unpaid bills. To set up the food stall, he had to borrow money from his father-in-law. He had to pawn jewellery and sell his New Singapore Shares. It was incredible that in those circumstances, he would think of the luxury of having a room to rest in during working hours.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> His home was only ten to fifteen minutes away by taxi or by motorcycle. Moreover, why would he waste money by starting the tenancy on 15 January 2003 when his food stall was not going to open until two weeks later?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">125.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">    </span> Balu’s evidence as to what was said in Indra’s flat on the first occasion was corroborated by Indra who clearly had no reason whatsoever to implicate the accused in any way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The accused was the one lying to Indra about the status of Balu and was the one concerned about others having access to the rented room. He paid the rent for January and for February when he had no reason to, especially since Balu was within easy reach by handphone or by simply walking over to Block 54 where his food stall was.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Indra’s evidence was that the accused would pay the rent for Balu. The accused even bought the mattress for the rented room.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">126<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">   </span> The duplication of the first set of keys was mentioned by both Balu and Indra.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The accused clearly was in possession of the keys to Indra’s flat. It therefore made good sense that Balu would hand him the room key as well when that was handed over by Indra to Balu. No evidence was adduced as to whether there was a duplicate room key made by the accused except the statement by Balu that a fellow inmate had heard the accused say he flushed his keys away.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It made sense that if the accused wanted duplicates of the keys to the main door and the padlock, he would also make a duplicate of the room key.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In any event, the evidence (as discussed below) showed that he must have had a duplicate room key as well. I accepted Balu’s evidence that all the keys for gaining access to Indra’s flat and the rented room were in the possession, custody or control of the accused.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">127.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">    </span> Further evidence that the rented room was not Balu’s second home could be seen in the absence of his personal belongings in the room and in the entire flat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He only had some t-shirts in the room (three of which he had bought only for the purposes of the three-night stay between 16 and 19 February 2003). .<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> There were no underwear or trousers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If the accused was correct about Balu being unshaven on Sunday, 23 February 2003, then it begged the question why Balu would not even have a razor or a shaver in his second home.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">128<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">   </span> The accused asked rhetorically why, if he wanted to rent the room, he did not rent it in November or December 2002 when Indra first approached him. Firstly, the timing as to when he needed the room was completely in his hands. Secondly, he could not have told Indra immediately that he wanted to rent the room as it was obvious from the evidence he wanted to have as little to do with it as possible.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He needed someone to be the apparent tenant and Balu fit the position.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Of course, it was not very clever of the accused to have told Indra that Balu was a student when Balu was going to open a food stall so near the home of Indra and neither was it very intelligent of him to have flashed the keys at Indra. However, I was convinced by the evidence he did those things.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">129.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">    </span> I had no doubt that the accused was the true tenant of the rented room and that he had unrestricted access to it while Balu had access to it only upon request made to the accused.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">130.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">    </span> In addition to Balu being an accomplice, it was also alleged that he could have been very unhappy with the accused over the various incidents.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Insofar as the accused usurping his place at Natferrous was concerned, I was satisfied that Balu harboured no ill feelings against the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He tried to be the bridge between his father and the accused in placing orders for flowers which was to the mutual benefit of his father and the accused. He stayed away from the accused for a while because he feared he would not be welcome after the altercation between the accused, his wife and Balu’s father. He treated the accused at all material times with respect, addressing him as ‘sir’.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The same remarks applied to the letters of demand.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">131.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">    </span> The accused was close enough to Balu to inform him about the availability of stall space and to advise him to try his hand in the food business.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Balu obviously trusted him enough to accept the advice. As the accused also said, Balu even bought supplies from him.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">132<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">    </span> Where the teasing and taunting incident over the stabbing was concerned, I had no doubt Balu was made of much sterner stuff than to be so easily hurt by such remarks. He had the fortitude to return to his food stall so late at night after what must have been a rather shocking incident. He could even hide it from his wife when she visited his food stall the next day to talk about their finances.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">133.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">    </span> Even if he was upset over any of the above incidents, it did not appear to me that they were of such magnitude as to cause him to want an erstwhile friend to hang. He certainly did not seem to be such a wicked and vindictive person.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">134<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">    </span> Returning to the stabbing incident, if the accused had teased Balu in front of his father and their friends on 17 February 2003, it would be remarkable that Balu’s wife remained ignorant about the stabbing until after her husband had been arrested.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was entirely logical that Balu’s friends, including the accused, would be concerned for him upon hearing about the stabbing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The accused, being a friend and constant companion who lived and worked in the vicinity, would surely have heard about it on the day of the incident on 16 February 2003.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was therefore highly believable that he and the rest of their companions would be at the coffee shop in Block 54 waiting for news about Balu.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I believed Balu’s testimony that the accused was at the said coffee shop that night and that he passed the keys to Indra’s flat to Balu when the latter requested them. I also accepted Balu’s evidence that he stayed in the rented room for only three nights, that he returned the keys to the accused thereafter and only took them on two other occasions for taking a shower, but not on Sunday, 23 February 2003.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">135<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">    </span> Since at least one set of the keys to Indra’s flat and the rented room was proved to be in the accused’s possession, custody or control at all material times, s 18 (1)(c) Misuse of Drugs Act applies and the accused was presumed to be in possession of the cannabis found in the rented room. The only other person who could have had access to the rented room was Indra herself as the padlock had been changed after the previous tenants left.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I believed her evidence that she did not enter the rented room after 15 January 2003.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I accepted that Balu never brought his worker to the rented room at all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In any event, it would be ridiculous to suggest that the cook could be resting while the food stall was in operation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The presumption therefore remained unrebutted.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">136<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">    </span> On Sunday, 23 February 2003, when one set of the keys was handed over to Balu by the accused, it was apparent that the accused had possession of or at least had access to the second set of keys. I accepted Balu’s evidence that the accused left in a car and returned later on foot and, sometime later in the evening, called Balu to say that the ‘thing’ (ie, the cannabis) was already in the rented room. This fortified my view that there was a duplicate made of the room key as well since the evidence was that the rented room would be locked by the user when he left.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The evidence suggested that the cannabis was placed in the rented room sometime that day although it was not the Prosecution’s case that it was placed there that day.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">137<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">   </span> Balu was left in no doubt as to what was meant by the ‘thing’ as he had been told in no uncertain terms he would be paid $100 for each block of cannabis that he cut and packed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The accused had demonstrated the cutting to him before and Balu had done such cutting for the accused once on an earlier occasion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The cutting board, the chopper and the small weighing scale were similar to those he had seen in the accused’s flat during the demonstration. The accused also showed he was in no doubt as to what was in the rented room when he reminded Balu that he needed it cut and packed by the next day.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">138<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">    </span> A large quantity of cannabis was involved. The large blocks were to be cut and packed into packets of 50 grams each.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The cutting, weighing and packing paraphernalia also showed beyond doubt that the cannabis in the rented room was meant for trafficking and not for personal consumption. Clearly, by their actions and their words, the accused and Balu were acting in concert in possessing the cannabis for the purpose of trafficking.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">139<span style="mso-tab-count: 1"> </span> I need only deal briefly with a few other matters that buttressed my view of the accused’s guilt.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The accused locked himself in the flat when the CNB arrived on 24 February 2003. <span style="LAYOUT-GRID-MODE: line">He asked, rhetorically again, why he should hole himself up in the flat and not run away if he knew the CNB was around.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The answer is simply that he did not know the CNB was coming specifically for him. Even if he was in the shower when they returned with his wife, it was incredible that he could not hear their knocks the first time. It required little common sense to know that the party of arresting officers could not have been knocking</span> delicately on the main door.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The accused asked Balu in the lock up of the Subordinate Courts to assume responsibility for all ten blocks of cannabis and promised him financial assistance in his defence. His wife tried to get Indra to say that he paid her rent for one month only, obviously with a view to distancing him from the rental of the room.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">140  In all the circumstances of the case, I had no doubt that the accused was guilty as charged and I convicted him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The mandatory death sentence was passed on him according<span style="LAYOUT-GRID-MODE: line">l</span>y.</span></p>
