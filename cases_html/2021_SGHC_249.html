However, the figures “112” (for units) and “70 square metres” (for average unit size) were not mentioned during the meeting, there was no mention of the URA guidelines about the number of units, and Mr Yeo and Ms Lim did not have the number 112 in mind.

This has been described as a species of equitable estoppel.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Under this head, evidence of the knowledge and intention of the defendant is crucial. The relevant test is no longer described as requiring “sharp practice”, rather:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">“the conduct must be such as to affect the conscience of the party who has suppressed the fact that he has recognised the presence of a mistake.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 The quote immediately above is from <span class="font-italic">Thomas Bates and Son Ltd v Wyndham’s (Lingerie) Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[1981] 1 WLR 505 (“<span class="font-italic">Thomas Bates</span>”) at 515 per Buckley LJ. In that case, at 515–516, the conditions for obtaining rectification were set out as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… it must be shown: first, that one party, A, erroneously believed that the document sought to be rectified contained a particular term or provision, or possibly did not contain a particular term or provision which, mistakenly, it did contain; second, that the other party, B, was aware of the omission or the inclusion and that it was due to a mistake on the part of A; third, that B has omitted to draw the mistake to the notice of A. And I think there must be a fourth element involved, namely that the mistake must be one calculated to benefit B. If these requirements are satisfied, the court may regard it as inequitable to allow B to resist rectification to give effect to A’s intention on the ground that the mistake was not, at the time of execution of the document, a mutual mistake.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 If that were the law, the plaintiffs would fail to obtain rectification, for on their own case there was no mistake on the part of the CSC as to what the terms of the SPA <span class="font-italic">were</span>. The CSC knew that the SPA contained the 120 units CP, and agreed to its inclusion. The mistake which the plaintiffs say the CSC made, was as to the <span class="font-italic">nature</span> or <span class="font-italic">quality</span> of a particular term, namely, the 120 units CP – the CSC claims to have thought that 120 was the maximum number of units under the applicable guidelines, when that was actually 112.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Buckley LJ’s conditions in <span class="font-italic">Thomas Bates</span> were applied by the English High Court in <span class="font-italic">Connolly Ltd v Bellway Homes Ltd</span> [2007] EWHC 895, a case similar to the present one. The parties had entered into a written contract with an “Inflation Adjustment” term that had a formula X = (A - B x 100) - C%. In that term a specific figure was stated for B, as follows: “B = £212 (representing the estimated average sales price per net square foot of the Residential Development at the date of this Agreement)”: (see [18] of the judgment).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The plaintiff, Connolly, sought rectification for unilateral mistake on the basis that its intention was that “the figure to be inserted as ‘B’ in the formula ‘would be a genuine and accurate estimate of the average sales price per net square foot of the Residential Development’ at the date of the agreement” (at [106]). However, the parties had discussed and agreed to a specific figure for B, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, £212. They did not contract on the basis of B being expressed as a formula or concept (“the estimated average sales price per net square foot of the Residential Development at the date of this Agreement”). The figure of £212 which they agreed upon had been suggested by Mr Draper, a representative of Connolly’s agent. Connolly sought to rectify that figure from £212 to £173 (at [75]). In denying rectification, the court expressed its decision thus (at [107]–[109]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">[107] </span>It seems clear to me that Mr Draper was in error when he went back to Mr Davis and suggested the figure of £212. But the error he made was in not challenging the figure proposed by Mr Davies. This is not a case where “one party … erroneously believed that the document sought to be rectified contained a particular term or provision”. Mr Draper's error was an error as to the quality (in commercial terms) of the agreed figure.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">[108] </span>There has never been any doubt that both parties intended the agreement to include the figure of £212. Connolly's reliance on the definition of the figure (viz “representing the estimated sales price per net square foot of the Residential Development at the date of this Agreement”) is misplaced: the £212 was what the parties agreed as representing the estimated sales price.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">[109] </span>This is in truth a case where one party has subsequently come to appreciate that it should not have agreed to the inclusion of a particular term. But that is not the sort of error which enables a court to rectify the agreement. The court cannot remake the parties’ bargain just because it has turned out to be significantly to the detriment of one party, and significantly to the benefit of the other.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Likewise, the parties in the present case agreed on a specific number of 120 in the 120 units CP. They did not express the 120 units CP with reference to a concept such as “the maximum allowable number of units under the prevailing guidelines”, although the plaintiffs say the CSC believed that is what the number 120 represented. If the CSC had made that mistake in agreeing to 120 units, as in <span class="font-italic">Connolly</span> it was a mistake as to the <span class="font-italic">nature</span> or <span class="font-italic">quality</span> of the specific figure that had been agreed upon. This is a case, as it was in <span class="font-italic">Connolly</span>, where “one party has subsequently come to appreciate that it should not have agreed to the inclusion of a particular term”, but there is no mistake as to what terms had been included.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Indeed, the plaintiffs’ case for rectification here is even weaker than in <span class="font-italic">Connolly</span>, where the Agreement at least stated that the figure of £212 was “representing the estimated average sales price per net square foot of the Residential Development at the date of this Agreement”; in the SPA in the present case, it is not stated that 120 units represented anything in particular, let alone anything with reference to the prevailing guidelines.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 On the basis of the authorities reviewed above, the mistake the plaintiffs allege is not one which would entitle them to rectification for unilateral mistake.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Local authorities do not assist the plaintiffs in this regard. In <span class="font-italic">Kok Lee Kuen and another v Choon </span><span class="font-italic">Fook Realty Pte Ltd and others</span> [1996] 3 SLR(R) 182 (“<span class="font-italic">Kok Lee Kuen</span>”), the Court of Appeal granted rectification on the basis that there was a concluded oral agreement before it was reduced into writing, with a mistake as to the description of the subject property. The authorities cited by the court included <span class="font-italic">Thomas Bates</span>, and the mistake in question related to what the contractual terms were.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 In <span class="font-italic">Yap Son On v Ding Pei Zhen</span> [2017] 1 SLR 219 (“<span class="font-italic">Yap Son On</span>”) the Court of Appeal noted that it would only have been possible to achieve the outcome the respondent sought, if there had been a successful application for rectification – this was however not pleaded, and in any event the court declined to grant that remedy (see [61] and [68]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 The court said the equitable doctrine of rectification refers to “the reconstruction or amendment of a document” where there is a “mismatch between the parties’ agreement and the instrument which purports to record it” (at [61]). That too indicates that the relevant mistake must be one as to what the terms of the agreement were. The parties here agreed on 120 units and the document reflected that by way of the 120 units CP. There is therefore no mismatch between the parties’ agreement and the instrument which purports to record it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 In my opinion, a mistake on the part of one party as to the nature or quality of what it had agreed to, does not justify rectification of the contract.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Contracts are rectified to give effect to the true agreement/intention of the parties, or at least what the mistaken party believed that to be</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 The second issue is related to the first (discussed above) – in rectifying a contract, is the court seeking to give effect to the true agreement/intention of the parties, or at least what the mistaken party believed that to be? Or can a contract be rectified such that it reflects what the mistaken party (<span class="font-italic">on its part</span>) would like to have agreed to, although that would not be the true agreement/intention of <span class="font-italic">both</span> parties, nor even what the mistaken party believed that to be?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The plaintiffs say that because the CSC’s agreement to 120 units was based on a mistaken premise (that 120 was the maximum permissible number of units under the applicable guidelines), the court should now ask what the guidelines allow, arrive at 112 units, and write “112” into the SPA in place of “120”. Can a rectified contract, however, not reflect the true agreement/intention of the parties, or even what the mistaken party believed that agreement/intention to be? In other words, can a rectified contract only reflect what the CSC would like to have agreed to (112 units), and not what <span class="font-italic">both</span> parties in fact agreed to/intended (120 units) or even what the CSC <span class="font-italic">believe</span><span class="font-italic">d</span> both parties had agreed to/intended (120 units)?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The plaintiffs rely on English authorities for the proposition that the rectified contract need not reflect the true agreement/intention of the parties – a contract may be rectified to reflect what the mistaken party believed that true agreement/intention to be.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 In <span class="font-italic">A Roberts &amp; Co Ltd And another v Leicestershire County Council</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(“<span class="font-italic">Roberts</span>”) [1961] 1 Ch 555, the plaintiff company submitted a tender to carry out certain works for the defendant council on the basis of an 18-month contract period; it did not notice that the period which was then inserted in the written contract differed by a year, such that the contract period would be 30 months instead. The company sought rectification of the completion date from 30 September 195<span class="font-underline">6</span> to 30 September 195<span class="font-underline">5</span>. Pennycuick J stated the principle as follows: “a party is entitled to rectification of a contract upon proof that he believed a particular term to be included in the contract, and that the other party concluded the contract with the omission or a variation of that term in the knowledge that the first party believed the term to be included.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 On the facts of that case, the court found that – prior to the company executing the contract – a representative of the council realised that the company was mistaken as to the contract period, but did not draw this to the company’s attention. Rectification was granted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 The rectified date of 30 September 195<span class="font-underline">5</span> did not reflect the true agreement/intention of the parties: it was what the company intended, but it was not what the council intended. Nevertheless, rectification was granted to reflect what one party mistakenly thought the contract terms were, when the other side knew of that mistake, and did not highlight it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 The plaintiffs also cite <span class="font-italic">FSHC Group Holdings Limited v </span><span class="font-italic">Glas Trust Corporation Limited </span>[2020] Ch 365 for the proposition at [105]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In the case of common mistake it is inequitable for a party to the contract to seek to apply the contract inconsistently with what that party knew to be the common intention of the parties when the written contract was executed. <span class="font-italic">The doctrine of unilateral mistake extends this principle to the situation where a party seeks to apply the contract inconsistently with what that party knew the other party believed to be the common intention of the parties when the written contract was executed.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The English authorities thus support rectification of a contract to the true agreement/intention of the parties, or what the mistaken party believed that to be, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, what the mistaken party believed <span class="font-italic">both</span> parties had agreed/intended.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 I then consider the local authorities. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Kok Lee Kuen</span> stated at [48]: “At the end of the day the court must be satisfied that in granting rectification it is not making a new contract for the parties, but affirming a contract which the parties made.” However, the court had also commented at [44]–[45] that in <span class="font-italic">Frederick E Rose (London) </span><span class="font-italic">Ld v William H Pim Jnr &amp; Co Ld</span> [1953] 2 QB 450 at 461, Denning LJ seemed to think that for rectification there must be a concluded antecedent contract, but there appeared to be authorities which suggest it will suffice to show a common intention to include a term which by mistake was omitted. The court did not resolve that conceptual question as on the evidence there was a concluded oral agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 More recently, in <span class="font-italic">Yap Son On</span> at [67], the Court of Appeal accepted that “a common continuing intention, whether or not amounting to an agreement” will suffice. The court explained (at [62]) the difference between interpretation and rectification as follows: “Rectification … is a form of relief that involves ‘correcting a written instrument which, by a mistake in verbal expression, does not accurately reflect <span class="font-italic">[the parties’]</span> <span class="font-italic">true agreement</span>’ (see <span class="font-italic">Agip</span><span class="font-italic"> SpA v Navigazione Alta Italia SpA (The Nai Genova and Nai Superba</span> [1984] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 353 at 359 <span class="font-italic">per</span> Slade LJ)” [emphasis added].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The court in <span class="font-italic">Yap Son On</span> also endorsed Mustill J’s judgment in <span class="font-italic">Etablissements</span><span class="font-italic"> Georges et Paul Levy v Adderley Navigation Co Panama SA (The Olympic Pride)</span> [1980] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 67 (“<span class="font-italic">The Olympic Pride</span>”) at 72, that equitable rectification is available in two broad situations: (a) common mistake – “where there is a mistake common to both parties, the mistake being the belief that the document accurately records <span class="font-italic">the transaction</span>”; and (b) unilateral mistake – “where one party is mistaken as to the compliance of the document with <span class="font-italic">the transaction</span> and the other party knows of this mistaken belief but does nothing to correct it” [emphasis added] (at [65]). The court further held that “[t]he burden is on the party seeking rectification to show ‘convincing proof’ not only that the document to be rectified was not in accordance with <span class="font-italic">the parties’ true intention</span> at the time of its execution but also that the document in its proposed form would accord with <span class="font-italic">that intention</span>” [emphasis added] (see <span class="font-italic">Industrial &amp; Commercial Bank Ltd v PD International Pte </span>Ltd [2003] 1 SLR(R) 382 at [29]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The court’s acceptance of rectification for unilateral mistake as described in <span class="font-italic">The Olympic Pride</span> indicates that a contract may be rectified not only to reflect the true agreement/intention of the parties, but also to reflect what the mistaken party believed that to be.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47  Indeed, that was already the law at the time of <span class="font-italic">Kok Lee Kuen</span>, where the court stated at [54] that it would have granted rectification for unilateral mistake even if there were <span class="font-italic">part</span> of the subject property that the Vendors did not intend to sell, for the Vendors knew that the purchaser thought he was buying the <span class="font-italic">whole</span> of the subject property, and did not disabuse him of this. The court cited <span class="font-italic">Roberts</span> as authority that rectification could be ordered in those circumstances.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The statement in [48] of <span class="font-italic">Kok Lee Kuen</span> (see [43] above) that rectification affirms “a contract which the parties made” was in the context of rectification for common mistake (the court’s primary finding); the court however also accepted that unilateral mistake would have been available, if only the purchaser were mistaken. Similarly, the reference at [65] of <span class="font-italic">Yap Son On</span> to rectifying a document to accord with “the parties’ true intention” was in the context of common mistake. Where rectification is granted for unilateral mistake, the touchstone is what the mistaken party believed “the parties’ true intention” to be, and that is what the document would be rectified to reflect, as discussed above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The English and local authorities are thus aligned: a contract may be rectified not only to reflect the true agreement/intention of the parties, but also to reflect what the mistaken party believed that to be. But they do not say that a contract may be rectified to reflect what the mistaken party (<span class="font-italic">on its part</span>) would like to have agreed to, although that would not be the true agreement/intention of <span class="font-italic">both</span> parties, nor even what the mistaken party believed that to be.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 In the present case, what the parties agreed to was 120 units, which the plaintiffs wish the court to rectify to 112 units, on the basis that the CSC believed that 120 was the maximum allowable number of units under the applicable guidelines, when that number was actually 112. The only agreement or common intention between the parties was in relation to 120 units, not 112 units, nor whatever the maximum allowable number of units under the applicable guidelines was. The plaintiffs do not contend (nor could they) that the parties had agreed to 112 units; indeed, Oxley had made it plain that it would not agree to a number less than 120, and in the event the parties agreed on the number 120. The number 112 is not what the parties had agreed to, nor what the CSC believed the parties had agreed to; there was no actual/perceived agreement or common intention as to the number 112. The authorities on rectification for unilateral mistake do not support rectification in these circumstances.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The plaintiffs’ claim for rectification thus fails on the law. I go on to consider whether it also fails on the facts.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The facts relevant to rectification</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 I consider whether the CSC had made the alleged mistake, and if so whether Oxley knew of that mistake.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Did the CSC mistakenly believe that 120 was the maximum permissible number of units under the prevailing URA guidelines?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 At the 23–24 March 2018 meeting, the CSC’s lawyers Seah Ong &amp; Partners advised the CSC to confirm with Huttons if the 120 units CP was achievable, and Huttons confirmed this:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Mr Steven Seah of Seah Ong &amp; Partners said he had advised the CSC to ensure that the condition precedent was “achievable”, and Huttons confirmed that it was “achievable”;

He says he used 700 sq ft as the average unit size, not because he had misread the guidelines and used 700 sq ft as the average unit size instead of the prescribed 70 sq m (equivalent to 753 sq ft). Rather, that was the “average of the large, medium and small [units] in Balestier area”, which Stephen had ascertained by a caveat search on a sample size of 30–40 units in Balestier.

Stephen was the plaintiffs’ own witness, and if the plaintiffs wished to contend that Stephen was untruthful in this respect, they ought to have said so when Stephen was on the stand. Indeed, the plaintiffs ought to have applied to treat Stephen as a hostile witness and cross-examine him. It was not fair to Stephen (and Huttons) to belatedly submit that he should be disbelieved as to how he had arrived at the number 120. In the circumstances, I decline to make a specific finding as to whether Stephen had arrived at 120 units in the manner he had explained, or whether (as the plaintiffs now contend) Stephen had made a mistake in applying the URA guidelines – which resulted in him stating “120 dwelling units” in the Information Memorandum which Huttons provided to Oxley.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 That it is unnecessary for me to find whether Stephen/Huttons had made such a mistake, is in line with the plaintiffs’ recognition (at para 26 of their reply closing submissions) that strictly speaking how Stephen had arrived at 120 units as stated in the Information Memorandum is not relevant to the CSC’s state of mind at the 23–24 March 2018 meeting: the Information Memorandum had not been provided to the CSC, and the process by which Stephen had arrived at 120 units was not expressly communicated at that meeting.

</div> The number of storeys was negotiated down to 26 and the condition precedent in clause 7(5)(i)(a) thus referred to OPP being obtained for “no less than 26 storeys”. The reference to the number of dwelling units is similarly worded in clause 7(5)(i)(b) as “no less than 120 dwelling units”. If Mr Yeo believed that 120 was the maximum permissible number of units under the prevailing guidelines, one would have expected him to query whether the CSC should agree to the 120 units CP, as he had with the proposed condition precedent in relation to 36 storeys; but he did not. That indicates that Mr Yeo did not think 120 units was the maximum permissible number under the prevailing guidelines. Indeed, he did not have any particular idea what the maximum permissible number under the prevailing guidelines was – he simply believed that 120 units was “achievable”, as Stephen had said it was.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 It is also noteworthy that the CSC’s case on mistake evolved over time.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Mistake was first raised by the CSC in para 3 of its lawyers’ letter of 3 December 2018, which in material part reads as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">c. In response to your client’s allegation that Clause 7(5)(i)(b) cannot be fulfilled, the CSC’s position is tht there is a clear mistake in the Clause and Clause 7(5)(i)(b) can <span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">nevertheless be fulfilled</span> by rectifying the clear mistake.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">d. The CSC notes that paragraph 2 of the URA Advice states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">“Based on the Master Plan allowable GPR of 2.8 and the subject site’s area, </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">the maximum allowable number of DUs is 112</span><span class="font-italic">.

At that time, the CSC did not say that when the SPA was signed, the CSC had thought 120 units was the maximum permissible number under the prevailing guidelines.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 The plaintiffs’ first pleaded position, in their original Statement of Claim (“original SOC”) dated 11 December 2018, was consistent with the CSC’s lawyers’ letter of 3 December 2018. The CSC’s alleged mistake was pleaded as follows: “that there was no law, regulation or guideline which would prevent the fulfilment of the Condition Precedent” (original SOC at para 45(a)). As a corollary, it was contended that there <span class="font-italic">was</span> some law, regulation or guideline which would prevent the fulfilment of the Condition Precedent, specifically, URA’s 2012 Guideline.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 If that had remained the plaintiffs’ case on mistake, it would have been incumbent on them to prove that, at the time the SPA was signed, it was not possible to obtain an OPP for 120 units within the next nine months, because of URA’s 2012 Guideline. The plaintiffs led no evidence to prove that, nor did they seek to elicit such evidence from Oxley’s witnesses such as the various architects who testified. In their reply closing submissions at para 64, they say they do not dispute that at the time of the SPA, approval for 120 units was “achievable” in the sense that it was within the realm of possibilities.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 In the original SOC, the plaintiff’s case was based on both common mistake (original SOC at paras 45–48) and unilateral mistake (original SOC at paras 49–51).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Common mistake was abandoned by Amendment No 1 dated 16 July 2019 (“SOC Amendment No 1”). The plaintiffs continued to rely on unilateral mistake, but the original version of the CSC’s alleged mistake (as set out in para 45(a) of the original SOC) changed. Instead, it was said that <span class="font-italic">Huttons</span> had made a mistake, which the CSC allegedly shared (for the CSC “depended on Huttons for advice in matters relating to the development potential of the Property”) – SOC Amendment No 1 at paras 52(b) and (c). It was said that Huttons made a mistake in calculating the maximum permissible number of dwelling units under the prevailing laws, regulations and guidelines, by using a minimum average size of 700 sq ft, instead of the formula in the URA Circular (which used 70 sq m, or 753 sq ft) – Huttons thus arrived at a figure of 120 units (which the CSC agreed to put into the SPA) rather than 112 units. The plaintiffs say that Oxley knew of the mistake, which both Huttons and the CSC had made. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 This version of the CSC’s alleged mistake continued through Amendment No 2 dated 6 September 2019 (“SOC Amendment No 2” – see para 52).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 In SOC Amendment No 3 dated 12 April 2021, however, the previous references to Huttons having made a mistake in calculating the maximum permissible number of dwelling units

Mr Lim thought this because, to him, the reference to “120 dwelling units” in Huttons’ Information Memorandum was the result of a calculation error – with Huttons having used 700 sq ft rather than 70 sq m (753 sq ft) in applying URA’s 2012 Guideline to derive the maximum number of units. Since Huttons was advising the CSC, Mr Lim believed that the CSC had made the same mistake. However, he considered that it was not for him to draw the CSC’s attention to such a mistake – he said it was not his job to advise the CSC on commercial terms; that was the job of the CSC’s lawyer and sales consultant.

This would mean that Oxley’s belief that the CSC had made a mistake, was based on Oxley’s <span class="font-italic">mistaken</span> belief that Huttons had made a mistake. But had the CSC in fact made the alleged mistake (which I do not accept), and had that mistake otherwise been sufficient to justify rectification as sought by the plaintiffs (which I also do not accept), I would have regarded Mr Lim’s state of mind as amounting to knowledge on Oxley’s part.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 It remains the case, though, that the alleged mistake is one as to the nature or quality of what was agreed to. Oxley did not think that the CSC meant to agree to some other figure, like 112; from Oxley’s perspective, the CSC meant to agree to 120 units, albeit in the belief that under the prevailing guidelines no waiver by the URA was necessary to meet the 120 units CP. As I have held, such a mistake (even if made) does not justify rectification.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Is bad faith/unconscionability relevant here?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 The plaintiffs also submit that Oxley acted in bad faith, and unconscionably.

</div>
</div> This does not save the plaintiffs’ case on rectification: if the elements for rectification are not established, allegations of bad faith or unconscionability are to no avail.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 For completeness, I accept Oxley’s evidence that it had a genuine intention to build 120 units, and that first obtaining approval for 112 units was a step in that direction. I also accept that Mr Low did not misrepresent at a 23 July 2018 meeting that there had already been a failed application for 120 units. Oxley tried to obtain URA approval for 120 units (which approval would have been in Oxley’s interests to obtain); when that was rejected by URA, Oxley was entitled to rely on the 120 units CP. There was no bad faith or unconscionability on Oxley’s part.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">If the SPA were not rectified, did Oxley have the right to rescind it on 26 October 2018 as it purported to do?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 As I do not agree with the plaintiffs’ case on rectification, it follows that the 120 units CP stands. It was not met, as URA approval for 120 units was never obtained.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 Nevertheless, the plaintiffs contend that Oxley acted prematurely in purporting to terminate the SPA as it did on 26 October 2018, which was before the long-stop date of 27 December 2018 to achieve the 120 units CP (the Contract Date was 27 March 2018, and consequently the date falling nine months after that, <span class="font-italic">per</span> clause 7(5)(i), was 27 December 2018).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 The plaintiffs’ case is:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Oxley could only terminate the SPA pursuant to clause 7(5) read with clause 7(5A), on or after 27 December 2018; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) even if it was not possible to obtain the requisite URA approval, Oxley was still obliged to pay the Further Deposit of $4.75m on 1 December 2018, failing which the Vendors themselves could rescind and cancel the SPA, and forfeit the Initial Deposit – as the CSC purported to do on 10 December 2018.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 Clauses 7(3), 7(5) and 7(5A) are sub-clauses within clause 7 on “Consents, Approvals and Clearances”.

Without prejudice to the provisions of Clauses 7(5) and 7(5A), the Purchaser shall be entitled to waive any one or more of the conditions precedent under these said Clauses and where any such condition precedent is waived, such waiver shall not affect the remaining conditions precedent, except to the extent as determined by the Purchaser to take into account such waiver of that condition precedent.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Clause 7(5) of the SPA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 I start with the observation that clause 7(5) expressly provides that the “sale and purchase herein” shall be subject to the stipulated conditions precedent, “[n]otwithstanding any other provision in the Contract and this provision being paramount in all circumstances”.

</div>
</div> stating in its letter: “Your proposal for a residential flat development with 120 dwelling units (DUs) cannot be supported as it has exceeded the maximum allowable number of DUs for the subject development … the maximum allowable number of DUs is 112. The formula for computing the permissible number of DUs can be found in our external circular dated 4 September 2012, which has been consistently applied to all new developments.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 Second, on 17 October 2018 URA issued a circular (“URA’s 2018 Guideline”) with new formulas for calculating the maximum of dwelling units. URA’s 2018 Guideline was more restrictive than that of URA’s 2012 Guideline: for the Property (in Balestier), the maximum number of units would only be 76, down from 112; if the Property were in an area where more units would be permitted, the maximum number would still only have been 92. On its terms, URA’s 2018 Guideline would only apply to applications submitted to URA on or after 17 January 2019 (and as such, 112 units could still be developed at the Property, based on the approval already obtained), but in view of URA’s 2018 Guideline it was not possible to persuade URA to reconsider its refusal to approve the development of 120 units at the Property. This is especially since Balestier was one of the nine areas identified in URA’s 2018 Guideline “where the cumulative effect of new developments could pose a severe strain on local infrastructure” and as such an even more restrictive formula was stipulated in URA’s 2018 Guideline, than would generally be the case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 As of 26 October 2018 it was thus already the case that the 120 units CP could not be fulfilled. Under clause 7(5), it was a condition precedent that Oxley obtain the requisite URA approval or on before 27 December 2018. That does not mean that the parties had to wait till 27 December 2018 to know whether the 120 units CP had been fulfilled. Once it was not possible to obtain such approval “on or before” 27 December 2018, the condition precedent would not be fulfilled. Once a condition precedent cannot be fulfilled, it is not fulfilled.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 With the non-fulfilment of a condition precedent to the sale and purchase, the parties would be released from their mutual obligations in relation thereto. That is, unless Oxley waived the 120 units CP as a condition precedent (as clause 7(5A) says it was entitled to do). By purporting to rescind and cancel the SPA, however, Oxley made it plain that it did not waive the condition precedent. In the circumstances, the parties were released of their obligations under the SPA (including the payment of the Further Deposit by Oxley). It also follows that Oxley would be entitled to recover the Initial Deposit, since that had been paid as part and parcel of the sale and purchase, for which the condition precedent had not been met.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 The plaintiffs’ interpretation of clause 7(5) is uncommercial: that even though the 120 units CP could not be fulfilled, the parties would have to continue performing the SPA (including Oxley paying more money) until a future date (27 December 2018), when all monies paid would be refunded. The plaintiffs themselves submit that a reasonable deposit is regarded as earnest money given to guarantee the due performance of the contract.

</div>
</div>
</div> It would run counter to that to require Oxley to pay the Further Deposit at a time when URA approval for 120 units could no longer be obtained: what “due performance” was Oxley expected to guarantee when the parties had expressly agreed that the sale and purchase would be subject to the condition precedent of obtaining such URA approval by 27 December 2018, and that condition precedent could not be fulfilled?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 I am reinforced in my conclusions by the “paramount clause” stipulation in clause 7(5), the objective being to relieve the parties of having to proceed with the sale and purchase if Oxley could not obtain URA approval for 120 units on or before 27 December 2018, regardless of any other provision of the SPA. It would go against that to say that even after it was no longer possible to obtain the requisite URA approval by 27 December 2018, Oxley still had to continue performing the SPA until 27 December 2018 – in particular by paying the Further Deposit of $4.75m – or face forfeiture of the Initial Deposit it had already paid. Indeed, the 120 units CP was expressed as a condition precedent to the “sale and purchase”, <span class="font-italic">ie,</span> the whole transaction that was the subject of the SPA. The obligation to pay the Further Deposit was subject to that condition precedent, as was any right to forfeit the Initial Deposit if the Further Deposit were not paid. All those obligations and rights fall away upon non-fulfilment of the condition precedent.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Clause 7(5A) of the SPA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 Clause 7(5A) builds on clause 7(5). It stipulates that Oxley had the right to waive the conditions precedent under clause 7(5), including the 120 units CP. It further states that “[i]n the event that on [27 December 2018] (or such later date as may be mutually agreed between the parties)” Oxley fails to receive such URA approval, Oxley would be entitled to rescind and cancel the SPA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 Oxley relies on <span class="font-italic">Tan Soo Leng David v Wee, </span><span class="font-italic">Satku &amp; Kumar Pte Ltd and another</span> [1997] 3 SLR(R) 257 (“<span class="font-italic">Tan Soo Leng</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>where clause 6 of the option read: “The sale shall also be subject to the consent of the Developers, which said consent to the sale is required under the terms of the principal agreement. In the event such consent is refused or not received by the Completion Date (as defined in Clause 7 below), the sale and purchase herein shall be deemed rescinded forthwith …” (see [12]). The court accepted that the natural and ordinary meaning of the clause was that the sale and purchase would be rescinded in two instances:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) first, immediately, if the Developers refused to give consent, there would be a rescission; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) second, if the Developers did not respond to the request for consent such that by the Completion Date consent had not been received, then the sale would be rescinded on that date;</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">save that the court added that the seller had to have made reasonable efforts to get the consent, or it must have been useless to make such efforts (see [62]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 In the event, the court held that the option was rescinded on 14 July 1992 (when the Developers refused consent), or at the latest, 20 September 1992 (the Completion Date).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 There was an express reference in that clause to consent being “<span class="font-italic">refused</span> or not received by the Completion Date”, whereas clauses 7(5) and 7(5A) here make no reference to any “refusal” by URA, instead they refer to Oxley “obtaining” or “fail[ing] to receive” the requisite approval.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 Given the differences in wording, I have some difficulty interpreting clause 7(5A) in the same way as the clause in <span class="font-italic">Tan Soo Leng</span>. Clause 7(5A) says, “[i]in the event that <span class="font-underline">on</span> 27 December 2018 [Oxley] fails to receive [URA approval]” [emphasis added], and that suggests that it was not until 27 December 2018 that Oxley could give notice under clause 7(5A) to rescind and cancel the SPA. Clause 7(5A) was evidently built upon clause 7(5) – clause 7(5A)(i) refers back to clause 7(5)(i). However, the wording in clause 7(5): Oxley “obtaining [URA approval] on or before [27 December 2018]” was not tracked in clause 7(5A)(i). Instead, clause 7(5A)(i) was drafted as: “[i]n the event that on 27 December 2018 [Oxley] fails to receive [URA approval]”. That allowed the plaintiffs to argue that it was only <span class="font-underline">on</span> (or after) 27 December 2018 that Oxley could issue a notice under clause 7(5A), even if months earlier the condition precedent in clause 7(5)(i) already could not be fulfilled.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 None of this, however, derogates from the effect of clause 7(5) – indeed, it could not, given that clause 7(5) was agreed to be the “paramount clause”. In my opinion, even without clause 7(5A), upon non-fulfilment of a condition precedent under clause 7(5) (here, the 120 units CP) Oxley was still entitled to give notice that it was not waiving the condition precedent, and that consequently the sale and purchase would not proceed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 Taking the plaintiffs’ case at its highest – that Oxley could not give <span class="font-italic">any</span> notice to rescind and cancel the SPA until 27 December 2018, and so Oxley still had to pay the Further Deposit on 1 December 2018 – Oxley would still be entitled thereafter to recover any monies paid (and any monies purportedly forfeited) because of the non-fulfilment of a condition precedent under clause 7(5): there would be a total failure of consideration for the monies paid. That result would be consistent with clause 7(5) being “paramount” as the parties had expressly agreed. The plaintiffs cannot be allowed to keep any monies paid by Oxley and purportedly forfeited, for that would make the “paramount clause” 7(5) subordinate to forfeiture clause 4(6) (set out at [111] below), which would go against the parties’ agreement. It would thus suffice for Oxley’s purposes to rely on clause 7(5) without also having to invoke clause 7(5A).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Clause 7(3) of the SPA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 Oxley says that, besides clauses 7(5) and 7(5A), it can also rely on clause 7(3) to rescind and cancel the SPA. The plaintiffs say that Oxley’s right to rescind and cancel for non-fulfilment of the 120 units CP is exclusively governed by clauses 7(5) and 7(5A) and so clause 7(3) has no application.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 While clauses 7(5) and 7(5A) specifically address the non-fulfilment of the 120 units CP, it does not follow that clause 7(3) would have no application in that scenario.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 Clause 7(3) states that “if the sale cannot be completed by the Completion Date by reason of the Purchaser failing to obtain the requisite consent, approval and clearance then either party shall be entitled at their absolute discretion to rescind the sale and purchase”. Clause 7(3) is a sub-clause within clause 7 on “consents, approvals and clearances”, which consents, approvals and clearances include the matters stated in clause 7(5) as conditions precedent which the sale and purchase was subject to. There is no basis to read clause 7(3) as covering only consents, approvals and clearances in clause 7 <span class="font-italic">other than those in clause 7(5)</span>. Indeed, it would be consistent with the “paramount clause” stipulation in clause 7(5), for clause 7(3) to include the matters in clause 7(5) within the phrase “the sale cannot be completed by the Completion Date by reason of the Purchaser failing to obtain the requisite consent, approval and clearance”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 If the OPP were not obtained on the basis stated in clause 7(5)(i), and Oxley did not waive that as a condition precedent, the sale could not be completed by the Completion Date per clause 7(3), or indeed, at all. Further, clauses 9(1)(i)–(v) stipulate various events, the latest of which would determine the Completion Date. Clause 9(1)(v) was: three months after the date of the Purchaser’s written notice to the Vendors or the Solicitors that the OPP has been obtained – Oxley would not give such written notice if the OPP were not obtained on the basis in clause 7(5)(i), and Oxley did not waive that as a condition precedent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 If, however, the OPP obtained was not on the basis stated in clause 7(5)(i) but Oxley waived that as a condition precedent, then the sale could proceed to completion and clause 7(3) would not then apply. But here Oxley did not waive the condition precedent. As I stated above (at [91]–[93] above), as of 26 October 2018 it was already the case that “the sale cannot be cannot be completed by the Completion Date by reason of the Purchaser failing to obtain the requisite consent, approval and clearance”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 It follows that under clause 7(3), and not just under clause 7(5), Oxley could rescind the sale and purchase whereupon all monies paid to the Vendors by the Purchaser (here, the Initial Deposit) were to be refunded to Oxley.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Was the CSC entitled to forfeit the Initial Deposit as it purported to?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 Clause 4(6) on the Purchaser’s right to forfeit the Deposit reads as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If the Purchaser fails to pay to the Solicitors the sums under this Clause 4 within the period(s) stated, the Vendors shall be entitled at the Vendors’ absolute discretion to (but without any obligation on their part to do so) rescind and cancel the Contract and upon rescission and cancellation the Deposit shall be forfeited by the Vendors and shall belong to the Vendors absolutely and beneficially. Provided that this provision shall be without prejudice to any other rights or remedies available to the Vendors either at law or in equity against the Purchaser.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 The plaintiffs contend that clause 4(6) was triggered by Oxley’s failure to pay the Further Deposit when it was due on 1 December 2018. By then, however, the 120 units CP could not be fulfilled. Moreover, Oxley had indicated that it would not waive that condition precedent; instead it validly rescinded and cancelled the SPA. In the circumstances, Oxley had no obligation to pay the Further Deposit; and the plaintiffs had no right to forfeit, or retain, the Initial Deposit. In any event, given the non-fulfilment of the 120 units CP in clause 7(5) which the parties had agreed was a “paramount clause”, Oxley was entitled to recover the monies it had paid. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 It follows from the above that I dismiss the plaintiffs’ claims for:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) rectification of the SPA;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) declaratory relief that Oxley’s rescission of the SPA was invalid; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) damages.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 As a corollary, I find that Oxley is entitled to a refund of the Initial Deposit in the sum of $4.75m, with interest.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 I will hear parties further on the specific orders to be made in light of the above, including as to the caveats lodged by Oxley, and costs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Andre Maniam<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Lee Ee Yang, Wilbur Lua, Douglas Pang and Michelle Ong</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">(Covenant Chambers LLC) for the plaintiffs;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Kelvin Poon, Devathas Satianathan and Cai Xiaohan (Rajah &amp; Tann Singapore LLP) for the first defendant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Fong Weng Khai (W K Fong &amp; Co) for the second defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-left"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
