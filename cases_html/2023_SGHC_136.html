</div> Consequently, she was also unable to explain to the court why she acted the way she did at the material time. Much of her evidence at trial was therefore limited to confirming what she heard in the audio recordings that were played in court and providing, at the time of the trial, her best explanation and reconstruction of what had occurred. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 As a result of the complainant having no independent recollection of what occurred during the period that the Sexual Acts took place, the only evidence available to the court concerning what occurred during this period were the accused’s testimony and the objective evidence derived from the in-car audio recording.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Role of the factual witnesses in relation to the in-car camera and CCTV recordings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 The complainant’s behaviour at the material time was evidenced in three ways: (a) contemporaneous CCTV footages from the Bar and the Condominium, (b) contemporaneous in-car camera recordings from the Car, and (c) eyewitness evidence from various factual witnesses (including the complainant’s own recollections, where available, and the accused’s police statements). There were no challenges to their admissibility or authenticity.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32  The recordings (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, (a) and (b) in [31] above) constituted real evidence that the court was competent and well-placed to assess. Nevertheless, a court must always be alive to the dangers of assuming that these presented a complete and unambiguous picture. Such dangers stemmed from potential incompleteness (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, visual blindspots, audio without visual footage, stretches of time that went unrecorded) and lack of context (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, situational cues, the manner in which a particular witness would normally speak).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 This was why the evidence referred to at [31(c)] above was important, because it enabled those who witnessed or participated in these events to supply the relevant context. This explained why the key factual witnesses (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the complainant, the accused, LYS and VT) were asked both about:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) their own recollection of events <span class="font-italic">independent </span><span class="font-italic">of</span> the recordings – <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, what they saw and heard, how they acted or reacted, and why they chose to act or react in the way they did; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) how their evidence of the events (based on their recollection) <span class="font-italic">matche</span><span class="font-italic">d up against</span> what was shown on the recordings –<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">eg</span>, when and where a particular event took place and how this was situated in the overall chronology of events. This was achieved through the witnesses being shown relevant portions of the recordings in court and being asked questions about what they could see or hear from the footage. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 At the same time, the dual function performed by these witnesses, and the manner in which this was performed, created its own challenges. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Chief among these was that the line between the two functions was not always scrupulously maintained by counsel. The cleanest way to separate both functions would have been to elicit a witness’ entire testimony from recollection before exposing them to any of the footage. However, based on how parties ran their case, witnesses were sometimes exposed to footage <span class="font-italic">before </span>they were asked for their recollection. A related concern was that questions were not always framed to clearly and exclusively relate to one function or the other. For instance, witnesses were sometimes asked to explain why they acted or reacted in a certain way. Yet the answers to these questions did not always specify whether these reflected the <span class="font-italic">contemporaneous </span>reasons that operated on their minds at the material time (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, statements as to past belief, on a past act), or their <span class="font-italic">present</span> rationalisations or afterthoughts for why they might have acted that way (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, statements as to present belief, on a past act). In most cases only the former would be relevant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 It was understandable that footage could sometimes be used to jog a witness’ memory as to a particular event that took place in the entire sequence. Such an approach, however, posed an obvious risk—that evidence purportedly originating from a witness’ recollection was in fact the product of his or her memory influenced by or reconstructed from the footage itself. Memories lost may now be “recalled”, when in fact the source of this “memory” was really the footage. If so, a witness might appear less forgetful and more reliable than he otherwise would, inflating his credibility and the weight given to his evidence. Additionally, memories inconsistent with the footage may be downplayed or repackaged to present a more coherent and consistent narrative. These potentially undermined two key objectives of witness testimony: one, forensically testing a witness’ credibility (through the completeness, credibility and accuracy of his evidence), and two, elucidating the evidence that a witness is capable of providing to the fullest extent possible.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 An example that illustrated both these concerns was that on the complainant saying “Yah, yah, yah” in response to LYS asking her to text him when she reached home, LYS initially testified that at that point in time, the complainant’s reply “didn’t stood out so much to me”. It “just sounded like a yes to me. Like an acknowledgement”.

</div> Fortunately, this was an instance where the witness was transparent as to how his memory and interpretation of the footage diverged. This might not always be the case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 None of this was meant to suggest that any of the witnesses were deliberately lying.

These observations and impressions were relevant because of the witness’ presence at and participation in those incidents. Thus, to illustrate, a witness asked to describe how the complainant’s speech was at the time might permissibly answer “she sounded like she was pretty damn drunk”.

That constituted real evidence, and the court viewing or hearing it in real time was competent to discern what it showed.

Thus, for instance,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the evidence that LYS gave (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that upon hearing the audio recording in court, he thought that “she sounded like she was pretty damn drunk”) was but an inference derived from the footage.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">A note about the timestamps on the video recordings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 As noted at [20] above, the evidence in this case included video recordings from the Car’s in-car camera, from the Bar’s CCTV and from the Condominium’s CCTV. These video footages bore timestamps based on the time kept by the internal clocks of the respective recording devices. Unfortunately, the internal clocks of these devices did not all keep the same time. The time recorded by the Bar’s CCTV was about 15 minutes ahead of the time recorded by the Car’s in-car camera, while the time recorded by the Condominium’s CCTV was about ten minutes ahead of the time recorded by the in-car camera.

What is required is a <span class="font-italic">qualitative </span>appreciation of whether a reasonable doubt has arisen (<span class="font-italic">Jagatheesan</span><span class="font-italic"> s/o Krishnasamy v PP </span>[2006] 4 SLR(R) 45 (“<span class="font-italic">Jagatheesan</span>”)).

Although the observations in <span class="font-italic">Jagatheesan</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>were made in the context of the reasons that a judge must supply to support a conviction, these observations are equally apposite if a judge should instead decide to acquit as a reasonable doubt is a necessary condition for an acquittal (<span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v GCK and another matter </span>[2020] 1 SLR 486 (“<span class="font-italic">GCK</span>”) (at [131])). The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">GCK </span>further gave guidance on how the principle of proof beyond a reasonable doubt could be conceptualised in two ways. One, a reasonable doubt could arise from within<span class="font-italic"> </span>the Prosecution’s case. Two, a reasonable doubt could arise on an assessment of<span class="font-italic"> </span>the totality of the evidence<span class="font-italic">,</span> which includes a holistic assessment of both the Prosecution’s and the Defence’s cases and the interactions between the two.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 It would be vital to appreciate that the principle of proof beyond a reasonable doubt is grounded in the presumption of innocence. In a passage affirmed by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">AOF v Public Prosecutor </span>[2012] 3 SLR 34 (at [315]), V K Rajah J (as he then was) observed in <span class="font-italic">Jagatheesan</span> (at [59]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It cannot be assumed that an individual is guilty by mere dint of the fact that he has been accused of an offence, unless and until the Prosecution adduces sufficient evidence to displace this presumption of innocence. <span class="font-italic">That threshold below which society will not condone a conviction or allow for the presumption of innocence to be displaced</span> is the line between reasonable doubt and mere doubt.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 He further observed (at [61]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">An accused is presumed innocent and this presumption is not displaced until the Prosecution has discharged its burden of proof. Therefore, if the evidence throws up a reasonable doubt, it is not so much that the accused should be given the benefit of the doubt as much as the Prosecution’s case simply not being proved. In the final analysis, the doctrine of reasonable doubt is neither abstract nor theoretical. It has real, practical and profound implications in sifting the innocent from the guilty; in deciding who should suffer punishment and who should not. The doctrine is a bedrock principle of the criminal justice system in Singapore because while it protects and preserves the interests and rights of the accused, it also serves public interest by engendering confidence that our criminal justice system punishes only those who are guilty.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Accordingly, the court’s task of assessing whether the Prosecution has proven its case beyond reasonable doubt naturally involved assessing whether sufficient doubt had been cast on the Prosecution’s case by the Defence.

A true alcoholic blackout has a starting point, is temporary, and has a vague ending point. Loss of memory during this period is clearly anterograde rather than retrograde, since the ability to form long-term memory is completely blocked. It has been stated that “[an alcoholic blackout] is not forgetting, rather it is not remembering,” implying that, at a high BAC, new memories cannot be formed. The individual may or may not appear intoxicated, but will still be able to maintain a coherent and interactive conversation (short-term memory), recall past events (recall from long-term memory), and perform normal activities (procedural memory). This is a critically important problem from a legal standpoint, because, <span class="font-italic">during a blackout, </span><span class="font-italic">individuals with intact immediate and short-term memory have the ability to form the specific intent needed to commit crimes that require this ability, despite their inability to retain their involvement in the crime in their long-term memory. </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 The experts also agreed that a person experiencing an alcohol-induced blackout might <span class="font-italic">behave</span> in a way that does not appear intoxicated to those around them or does not cause to those around them to suspect that he or she was so intoxicated to the point of having a blackout.

In <span class="font-italic">Pr</span><span class="font-italic">am Nair</span>, the complainant’s estimated BAC was 219 to 257 mg/100ml while in <span class="font-italic">Ong </span><span class="font-italic">Mingwee</span>, the complainant’s estimated BAC was 225 mg/100ml.

In <span class="font-italic">Pr</span><span class="font-italic">am Nair</span>, the court concluded that the complainant in that case lacked the capacity to consent as it was observed that she could not talk in full sentences, could not stand up by herself and was lacking control of basic motor functions. She was seen pushing the accused away very weakly and lying down with little movement. She was also not able to answer her phone. In contrast, the court in <span class="font-italic">Ong </span><span class="font-italic">Mingwee </span>concluded that the complainant in that case had the capacity to consent after observing that, while the complainant was tipsy, not very stable and slightly slurred in her speech, she was able to make coherent conversation, walk unassisted and get into the taxi unsupported and unaided. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(C) The experts’ comments on the complainant’s capacity to consent</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 Before turning to consider the complainant’s observed behaviour, there was one other aspect of the experts’ evidence to be considered.

Her inability to remember the events in the car may indicate an alcohol blackout or that she was in deep sleep from the alcohol consumption.

First, although the complainant told Dr Cheok that she did not drink alcohol regularly, the evidence adduced at trial showed otherwise (see [70] above). As a result, Dr Cheok decided during his examination-in-chief to reclassify the complainant as a “fairly regular drinker” (as opposed to a person who did not drink regularly).

</div> Second, the statement “[a]fter sometime [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>], seeing that the victim was not responding, the accused sat at the back seat with her to wake her” was taken from the part of IO Cheang’s summary of facts relating to the period after the complainant had returned to the Car after failing to open the Condominium’s side gate.

</div> The evidence adduced at trial showed that the complainant was not asleep during this period and there was no evidence that the accused woke her up. Third, it was clear from the Condominium’s CCTV footage that, contrary to what the complainant told Dr Cheok about her recollection, she did not fall down at the side gate.

</div> His understanding of “valid consent” thus required the complainant to appreciate the <span class="font-italic">full </span><span class="font-italic">risks</span> or consequences of her actions. This was also evident from the distinction he drew, between consenting to something simple like crossing the road with someone or getting into a car, versus consenting to something “more sophisticated” such as “buying a car, for example, and to have to sign a loan agreement, a sales and purchase agreement”.

</div> On this issue, I preferred Dr Lim’s evidence. However, I would note that, even if the Prosecution was right that not much reliance could be placed by the Defence on this exchange, it did not change the fact that, about 20 seconds after this exchange, the complainant was able to respond with “It’s ok, it’s okay” when the accused said “If you want to puke, just let me know”. When this latter exchange was played to the complainant in court, she agreed that she was responding appropriately to the accused and that she sounded alert when responding.

The complainant replied that she was okay, before continuing to cry. At trial, she explained that she had responded in this way because she did not know the accused and thus did not wish to say much to him. Dr Cheok agreed that this explanation showed an awareness of her surroundings (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, she was aware that she was with a stranger), and of the differences in sharing “personal” information with different people.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 I deal with the evidence of the complainant’s behaviour during the sexual activities in greater detail below when considering the issue of consent in fact. What was significant to the question of capacity was that towards the end of the sexual activities, the complainant started saying “no” and pushed the accused’s hands away. This “no” was verbalised as the accused was trying to move his hand up her thigh and towards her vagina (see [145] below). On cross-examination, the complainant accepted that the “no” indicated that she did not want to be touched anymore but was slow to agree that it <span class="font-italic">evidenced </span>her ability to convey such an intention. The basis of her hesitation to this question, however, was that she thought that she might have been asleep at that time and was capable of making noises while asleep.

</div> But the evidence showed that she was in fact awake and neither was it the Prosecution’s case that she had been asleep during the sexual activities. By process of elimination, it must be taken that the complainant’s verbalised “no” evidenced an ability to convey the intention that she did not want to be touched anymore.

In this sense, they broadly corroborated the accused’s version of events, in that the complainant had been a willing participant and reciprocated his kissing and touching. When listening to the in-car audio recording from this period, the complainant accepted that she was making “loud moaning noises” at various times throughout the first episode of sexual activities.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Consideration of the Prosecution’s submissions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 I turn now to consider the Prosecution’s submissions outlined at [131] above, before making my findings on the credibility of the accused’s testimony. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 First, the Prosecution submitted that the lack of verbalised consent supported an inference that the complainant did not consent. I did not understand the Prosecution to be submitting that consent must always be verbalised and could never be manifested in non-verbal ways. Instead, I believed that the point being made was that, had there been evidence of verbal consent, this would have been a point conclusively in favour of the Defence. However, since there was no verbal consent, it left room for the court to infer from the totality of the evidence that there was no consent. The foregoing understanding was confirmed by counsel for the Prosecution when he agreed with me during oral submissions that the lack of verbal consent was not conclusive because the law does not require consent to be verbal. Understood in this way, I did not find this submission objectionable. However, acceptance of this submission would not automatically lead to the inference that the complainant did not consent. It just meant that the court needed to look to other available evidence to determine the question.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 Second, the Prosecution relied on the evidence of the paramedic, Ms Lee, who attended to the complainant after the event. Ms Lee stated that she had observed the complainant’s behaviour to be similar to those of other sexual assault patients in her experience. This evidence constituted lay opinion as Ms Lee had gone beyond mere observation of the complainant’s state to an evaluative comparison of (i) the complainant’s behaviour with (ii) those observed by her in past cases. Her evidence also consisted of a conclusion<span class="font-italic"> </span>that (i) and (ii) were sufficiently similar as to warrant an inference of sexual assault. It was difficult to see how an assessment of this nature could be reliably conducted without some form of expert scientific evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149  Thus, even if Ms Lee’s lay opinion was admissible, I would not give it much weight. Quite apart from the concerns raised above, her comparisons were drawn from a very small sample size of three or four past cases in her experience of working as a paramedic.

</div> When pressed, she provided details on the behaviour and circumstances of those patients which were, at best, vague and sparse, and could not be tested by counsel or the court.

</div> This offered a reasonable explanation which would be consistent with the facts. The complainant had just been awoken by the paramedics, in an unfamiliar location, with difficulty recalling what had occurred prior because of her alcohol-induced blackout. Accordingly, I decided to give no weight to Ms Lee’s opinion evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 Third, the Prosecution submitted that the complainant’s utterance of “no” towards the end of the sexual activities was an indication that she had not consented to any sexual activity with the accused. The Prosecution suggested that the complainant did not say “no” earlier only because “her state of intoxication rendered her incapable of doing so”.

</div>
</div> Framed in this manner, this submission was in substance premised on the complainant not having the capacity to consent to any of the sexual activities which occurred before she uttered the word “no”.  Given my earlier finding that the complainant had capacity at the time of the alleged offences, this submission would naturally fall away. In fact, my finding on capacity meant that the complainant’s utterance of “no” was more plausibly construed as a prospective <span class="font-italic">withdrawal</span> of consent which had, up to that point in time, been given. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 The Prosecution also made a submission concerning the interpretation of the complainant’s moans. From the way this submission appeared within the structure of the Prosecution’s Closing Submission, it would seem that this was not an independent fourth plank of the Prosecution’s submission, but a rebuttal of an anticipated argument which was foreshadowed in the Defence’s earlier submissions for no case to answer. The submission was that the Defence would be wrong to argue that the only reasonable inference to be drawn from the complainant’s moans was that she had consented to the accused’s advances. My first observation would be that the Defence did not make this argument in its closing submission, so there was no argument along these lines for the Prosecution to rebut. My second observation would be that the Prosecution’s rebuttal referred to Dr Cheok’s comment that the complainant’s moaning could be described as “basal human automatic behaviours”. But Dr Cheok’s comment was made in response to a question relating to the capacity to consent and not to the issue of consent in fact. This was the actual exchange:

The accused explained that he did not go into certain details when describing the sexual activities because he was not sure how much details he was expected to go into, and IO Cheang did not ask for specifics.

</div> I found this explanation reasonable and credible. Often, the level of detail one goes into when narrating a past event depends on the nature of the questions posed as well as on one’s understanding of both the expectations of the questioner and the purpose of the narration. More importantly, there were also instances within the accused’s testimony which suggested that he did not shy away from evidence that could potentially be construed as inculpatory. One example was the accused’s candid admission, maintained across his investigative statements and at trial, that he had <span class="font-italic">initiated </span>the second episode of sexual activities and that the complainant did not appear as “involved” and “participative” to his advances in the same (see [144] and [145] above), even though she had continued moaning and reciprocating his physical touch. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 It was also relevant that the accused’s investigative statements were given at a time when he was unaware that the complainant could not recall what happened during the sexual activities and thus would not be able to contradict him by her account. This suggested to me that he was candid and forthcoming. There was no evidence of any attempt by the accused during the investigative process to conceal his actions. He had returned home and changed his clothes without removing his underwear

</div> I did not find this submission persuasive. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 Given the lateness of the hour and the fact that the complainant was alone, I considered it entirely reasonable and appropriate for the accused to have waited and watched the complainant enter the Condominium safely before driving off, and to have gone to the complainant’s assistance when he observed her not entering the Condominium after some time. Further, if the accused had planned all along to sexually assault the complainant without her consent, he would likely have driven her to a more secluded area before the first episode of sexual activities, instead of engaging in the Sexual Acts in front of the Condominium’s gate in a brightly lit area. The fact that the accused stopped the first episode of sexual activities after a few minutes, upon realising that the Car was in a rather exposed location, tended to support the accused’s account that the sexual activities were spontaneous and unplanned. It was also relevant to note that the accused had initially declined to ferry the complainant upon being told by LYS that she was “a little drunk” but relented after LYS repeatedly reassured the accused that the complainant was okay. Finally, the accused stopped the sexual activities upon sensing the withdrawal of consent. This would clearly not have been the behaviour of a person who was seeking to take advantage of an intoxicated passenger without her consent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">159 I therefore found the accused’s testimony credible and considered that the accused’s version of events should be accepted in the main.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion on whether the complainant in fact gave consent</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">160 In summary, I accepted the Accused’s version of events and rejected the Prosecution’s submission that the evidence presented was sufficient for the court to infer, beyond reasonable doubt, that the complainant did not consent to the sexual activities.

The context of this act was crucial, namely, that the accused had gone to the back seat of the Car with the intention of looking through the complainant’s handbag for a way to contact someone to come and get her, and not to make advances on her. Second, as the sexual activities progressed, the complainant reciprocated the accused’s actions by kissing and touching him, straddling him, and gyrating her hips. She spread her legs and subsequently pulled him towards her. When the accused told the complainant, “I can’t put it in”, she responded by changing her position to accommodate him. The accused interpreted these <span class="font-italic">external </span>signs to mean that the complainant wanted sex. Third, there were no signs of resistance from the complainant throughout. Neither was there any sign of resistance or protest from her during the brief break, during which the accused moved his Car to the other side of the road. Sometime during the first sexual episode, the in-car audio recording captured the accused asking the complainant, “are you okay”, and the complainant appeared to give a short moan in response. This suggested that the complainant had responded favourably to the physical stimulation. Fourth, neither was there any external sign of resistance when the second episode of sexual activities began. Similar to the first episode, the complainant’s moaning continued, with some reciprocation of kissing and touching. Eventually, she indicated through non-verbal cues that she did not wish to continue and said the word “no”, upon which the accused stopped touching her and returned to the driver’s seat.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">181 I was therefore satisfied that the accused had exercised due care and attention in the course of the sexual episodes. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">182 The Prosecution submitted that it was clear from the evidence that the complainant had been too tired to have participated in the manner described by the accused – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, sitting on his thighs with her legs apart and grinding her crotch against his groin.

Admittedly, the complainant was intoxicated, it was already the wee hours of the morning and there was <span class="font-italic">some </span>evidence which suggested that the complainant was sleepy (see [99] and [108] above). But having seen and heard the complainant’s behaviour from the CCTV footages and in-car audio recordings, I would be unable to agree that the complainant was not in a state to perform the types of activities described above. She was able to get out of the Car on her own and walk unassisted, and had sufficient energy to pound on her chest loudly enough for it to be captured in the in-car audio recording.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">183 Neither did the fact that the complainant was later found lying <span class="font-italic">unconscious </span>in the middle of the road support the inference of lethargy to the extent that the Prosecution sought to draw.

The Defence also raised another area of concern in relation to this submission. IO Cheang had acknowledged that there was an available test that could determine whether saliva was present on the accused’s underwear. However, this test was not done during investigations and, by the time the matter came to trial, it was no longer possible to perform such a test.
