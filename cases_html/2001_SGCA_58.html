<p xmlns="">1 This appeal raises a question of construction as to the scope of a charge over money

in a fixed deposit account maintained by the respondents (Tararone) with the appellant

bank (DBS). </p>
<p xmlns="">The facts 2 The circumstances giving rise to the matter before us are not in dispute

and are briefly as follows. In early March 1998, Sogo Department Stores (S) Pte Ltd

(Sogo), an associate company of Tararone, was indebted to DBS to the tune of $18 million

in an overdraft account. There were some discussions between Sogo and DBS. On 4 March

1998, DBS informed Sogo (the facility letter) that they would be willing to continue

granting the latter overdraft facility of up to $18 million, subject to Sogo reducing the

overdraft outstanding in accordance with the following repayment schedule - </p>

<p xmlns="">3 In addition, DBS also required, as a condition, that security be furnished and it was

set out in the letter in these terms:- </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p>"Security </p>
<p>The above facility together with all monies and liabilities which may be owing to the

  Bank from time to time shall be secured by: </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p>(i) (not relevant). </p>
<p>(ii) a fixed deposit (FD) of S$18 million or its equivalent in ACU deposits to be

  placed with DBS Bank. In this connection, the pledgor of the FD, Tararone Investments Pte

  Ltd, shall furnish us with a Resolution (Specimen 1 attached) confirming its agreement to

  stand as surety and execute the charge document in a form acceptable to DBS Bank. The

  pledgor shall be permitted to withdraw sums from the FD corresponding to the amount of

  repayment made by your Company under the Repayment Schedule." </p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns="">4 Accordingly, on 18 March 1998, Tararone executed a charge in respect of a $18 million

fixed deposit (FD), which they placed with DBS, to secure the facilities granted or to be

granted to Sogo. The pertinent clauses of the charge are as follows:- </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p>"1. In consideration of (the DBS) agreeing at (Tararone's) requests to grant or

  continue <u>to grant to Sogo … advances, loans, credit and/or other banking

  facilities or accommodation (hereinafter collectively called the 'banking facilities'</u>

  which expression shall include any part thereof) to such an extent and for so long as (the

  DBS) shall deem fit, <u>(Tararone) hereby covenant to pay to you on demand all sums of

  money which now or hereafter from time to time and at any time shall be owing or remained

  unpaid to you in respect of the banking facilities</u> or incurred or assumed by (the DBS)

  on (Sogo's) behalf .. and all (Sogo's) other liabilities … (the aggregate of all such

  moneys and liabilities being hereafter called the 'Obligations' which expression shall

  include any part thereof). </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p>2. <u>We hereby charge with the payment of the Obligations and with payment of all

  moneys owing by (Sogo) and the discharge of all liabilities .. to you</u> (hereinafter

  called the 'Borrower's Liabilities') by way of first fixed charge the sums which have been

  or may from time to time hereafter be deposited by (Tararone) with (the appellants) under

  (the DBS) FD account … <u>(Tararone) hereby agree and confirm that the FD shall be

  held by (the DBS) as continuing security for the due payment or satisfaction to (the DBS)

  of all the Obligations and the Borrower's Liabilities from time to time owing to (the DBS)</u>

  until the same have been fully paid and discharged subject as provided in clause 4. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p>3. (Tararone) hereby irrevocably authorise (the DBS) at any time and from time to time

  whenever (the DBS) think fit, without notice to (Tararone), to appropriate and apply all

  or any part of the FD … towards payment or satisfaction of all or any of the

  Obligations or the Borrower's Liabilities. 4. Without prejudice to paragraph 1(d)(i) of

  your letter of offer dated 4th March 1998 so long as any part of the Obligations or the

  Borrower's Liabilities remains outstanding or owing, we shall not withdraw any sum from or

  assign, charge, mortgage, or create any security interest over or otherwise deal with the

  Fixed Deposit save that, upon the Borrower making repayment to you in respect of the

  Overdraft Facility extended by you to the Borrower under your said letter of offer in

  accordance with the repayment schedule specified therein, we shall be entitled to withdraw

  sums from the Fixed Deposit corresponding to the amount of repayment made by the Borrower.

  </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p>6. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Charge on FD, <u>it is hereby declared

  that this Charge on FD shall be and remain a continuing security for all moneys and

  liabilities from time to time owing by (Sogo) to (the DBS) in respect of the banking</u>

  facilities for a sum not exceeding ($18 million) in respect of principal moneys owing to

  (the DBS) under or in respect of the banking facilities. (emphasis added). </p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns="">5 This arrangement effectively meant that, while DBS would continue granting facilities

to Sogo, the bank also ensured that their exposure to Sogo would be gradually reduced.

Following the execution of the charge, Sogo made payments and reduced the sums owing to

DBS accordingly. In turn, pursuant to clause 4, Tararone also made corresponding

withdrawals from the FD. 6 However, by mid-July 2000, following the insolvency of Sogo's

parent company in Japan, Sogo was in grave financial difficulties. Thus, on 15 July 2000,

DBS's solicitors notified Sogo of DBS's decision to terminate the overdraft facility

granted to Sogo with immediate effect and demanded the payment of $365,873.87, being the

amount owing by Sogo on that account as at 14 July 2000, plus further interest accruing

thereon. By another letter of even date, DBS also notified Tararone of the same and

demanded that Tararone repay the sum of $365,873.87. 7 On 17 July 2000, the Managing

Director of Sogo wrote to DBS protesting against the latter's decision to terminate the

overdraft facility and not to honour further cheques of Sogo. The letter stated:- </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p>"… we have until today not defaulted on our loans, and together with cash in

  current account, fixed deposits, and also the bank guarantee issued by Industrial Bank of

  Japan Ltd, we are in a credit position with you. </p>
<p>If you will not honour our cheques when we are still in credit with you, we shall hold

  you responsible for breach. This will go beyond damages for dishonour as you, being our

  main bank, will precipitate the collapse of our business." </p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns="">8 On 18 July 2000, DBS in a letter to Sogo, after referring to the termination of the

overdraft facility, stated that, on a without prejudice basis, they would, in their

absolute discretion, "honour specific cheques drawn on the loan accounts as well as

permit certain deductions from such accounts which have now been terminated and/or

recalled" provided that the deductions or the amount drawn in those cheques did not

result in the total outstanding due under the banking facilities exceeding the amount of

the security held by DBS. As a result, by 19 July 2000, 33 cheques drawn by Sogo, and

three GIRO deductions, were honoured or allowed. On 24 August 2000 a sum of $46,889.54 was

also deducted from the overdraft facility, being the amount owing by Sogo to DBS on

account of a payment made by DBS on a letter of guarantee. </p>
<p xmlns="">9 In the meantime, on 19 July 2000, both Sogo and Tararone were placed under interim

judicial management by orders of the High Court. On the same day, the interim judicial

managers instructed DBS to close all of Sogo's accounts maintained with them. However,

that instruction was only received by DBS at 5.58pm, by which time all the 33 cheques had

been cleared, and the overdraft account debited. </p>
<p xmlns="">10 On 8 September 2000, a judicial management order was made against Tararone. By 13

September 2000 the sum owing by Sogo in the overdraft account was $2,878.586.28 and the

principal amount standing in the FD account was $3,025,241. On 15 September 2000, DBS's

solicitors wrote to the solicitors for the judicial managers seeking the consent of the

latter, pursuant to s 227D(4)(d) of the Companies Act, to enforce the charge on the FD by

appropriating the monies in the FD account to satisfy the debt of Sogo in the overdraft

account, plus all accrued interest. By a letter of 11 October 2000 of their solicitors,

the interim judicial managers explained that they had to consider a couple of questions

before a reply was possible. But as of the date the present originating summons was filed,

i.e., 28 November 2000, the consent of the judicial managers had not been received. '</p>
<p xmlns="">11 At the hearing before the High Court, there was only one issue that troubled the

judicial managers. It was whether DBS were entitled to enforce the charge against

liabilities incurred by Sogo after the overdraft facility had been terminated on 15 July

2000. They were advised by their solicitors that any advances made by DBS to Sogo after 15

July 2000 amounted to a new facility which was not secured under the charge. </p>
<p xmlns=""><strong>Decision of the court below </strong></p>
<p xmlns="">12 The judge below held that the charge was only to secure the $18 million overdraft

debt which Sogo owed to DBS at the time the charge was created and that the phrase

"all moneys and liabilities which may be owing to the Bank from time to time"

appearing in the facility letter related to ancillary debts such as interests and costs

arising under the facility; it could not mean any money or liability outside the facility.

He was of the view that while the wording of the charge seemed to be wide, the clauses

therein must be read together to determine the parties' intention. Clause 4 referred to

the termination provision of the facility letter and the right of the chargor to withdraw

such amount from the FD as was commensurate with the sums repaid by Sogo in accordance

with the repayment schedule. Clause 6 referred to Tararone's obligation to keep the charge

as a continuing security up to $18 million and the expression "continuing

security" ought not be given a wider meaning than was plain in the context of the

facility letter and the charge. He felt that it could not have been the intention of the

parties that the charge should secure any further loans made by DBS to Sogo when the

overdraft facility granted under the letter of 4 March 1998 had been terminated. </p>
<p xmlns=""><strong>Issues</strong> </p>
<p xmlns="">13 Before us the main issue centred on the nature and scope of the charge. The second

issue is whether, having informed Tararone that the overdraft facility was terminated, DBS

was under a duty to inform Tararone that the former was proposing to restore the overdraft

facility. The third issue is whether a fresh approval or resolution of the board of

directors was necessary to enable the facilities granted to Sogo after 15 July 2000 to be

secured under the charge. </p>
<p xmlns=""><strong>Nature of charge</strong> </p>
<p xmlns="">14 Tararone seek to construe the charge in the light of the facility letter where it

was provided that the overdraft facility, "together with all monies and liabilities

which may be owing to (DBS) from time to time" would be secured by the FD. Tararone

argue that the expression "all monies and liabilities" must mean, in the

context, all monies and liabilities under the overdraft facility and nothing else. </p>
<p xmlns="">15 We would observe that, if that was the intended meaning, then the word

"thereunder" should appropriately have appeared after the phrase "may be

owing". Indeed, if that was the intention, there would have been no necessity to

refer to "all monies and liabilities which may be owing to the bank from time to

time." It would have sufficed to merely state "The above facility shall be

secured by….." </p>
<p xmlns="">16 We shall now turn to consider the provisions in the charge. Under clause 1, the

charge was expressly stated to be in respect of "advances, loans credit and/or other

banking facilities or accommodation" given to Sogo, all of which facilities are

collectively referred to as "the banking facilities". Under that clause,

Tararone covenanted to pay to DBS, on demand, all sums of money owing by Sogo in respect

of those banking facilities. Clause 2 charged the FD with the repayment of all moneys

owing by Sogo to DBS. Tararone further confirmed that the FD would be held by DBS as a

continuing security for the due payment of all of Sogo's liabilities owing from time to

time to DBS. Clause 3 authorised DBS, without notice to Tararone, to appropriate all or

any part of the FD towards payment of all of Sogo's liabilities to DBS. Finally, clause 6

reaffirmed that notwithstanding the other provisions, the charge "shall be and remain

a continuing security for all moneys and liabilities from time to time owing by Sogo to

DBS in respect of the banking facilities." In the light of the terms of these

clauses, there cannot be any doubt that this was an "all money" charge. </p>
<p xmlns="">17 While it is true that the original reason for the creation of the charge was the $18

million overdraft facility which DBS had then granted to Sogo, and which DBS were prepared

to continue to extend to Sogo, the express terms of the charge clearly go beyond that.

Nowhere is it stated, nor can it be implied, that the charge merely secures the payment of

the overdraft facility. The court ought to give effect to what the document expressly and

specifically stated. </p>
<p xmlns="">18 In this connection reference may be made to Bank of India v Trans Continental

Commodity Merchants' Ltd &amp; Patel [1983] 2 Lloyd's Rep 298 and Re Rudd &amp; Son Ltd

(1986) 2 BCC 98,955. Admittedly, in these two English cases, the charging provisions were

not identical to that of the present case and they also specified "on any account

whatsoever" or "any other account", which are not to be found in our

instant charge. However, in our opinion, these differences notwithstanding, they do not

render the charge here any less an "all-money" charge. While the words "any

other account" do not appear in the present charge, it must be borne in mind that

clause 1 refers to "advances, loans, credit and/or other banking facilities or

accommodation". It is a very wide clause. If the intention was merely to secure that

specific overdraft account, it would have easily so stated. Furthermore, Tararone also

covenanted to pay on demand "all sums of moneys <u>which now or thereafter from time

to time and at any time</u> shall be owing" in respect of the aforesaid banking

facilities. This is again inconsistent with any intention to only repay the debt in the

overdraft account. </p>
<p xmlns="">19 In our judgment, the charge is truly a charge in respect of all moneys from any

account which are owed by Sogo to DBS. We would reiterate that, if the overdraft account

was all that the parties had in mind, they would have simply referred to that and would

not have widened the clause to cover any "advances, loans, credit and/or other

banking facilities." Most of the clauses in the charge may well be standard

provisions (as clause 4 is clearly not) but there is no canon of construction which allows

the court to ignore the express words in a document, or to rewrite the terms which the

parties have agreed, unless a plain construction of the words would lead to absurdity </p>
<p xmlns="">20 In this regard, it would be useful to examine the case of Bank of India v Trans

Continental Commodity and glean the purposive and practical approach taken by the court in

relation to a wide "all money" clause in a guarantee given to a bank. There, the

operative wording was "in consideration of the (bank) … affording banking

facilities" to the borrowers, the guarantors agreed to pay the bank "all and

every sum and sums of money which are now or shall at any time be owing to the bank

anywhere on any account whatsoever." In that case the claim related to losses

suffered by the borrowers on some twelve foreign exchange contracts. The arguments

advanced by the guarantors were that the foreign exchange transactions did not come within

the terms "banking facilities". Both the English High Court and the Court of

Appeal refused to let the wide terms of the guarantee be circumscribed by the opening

words of the clause. At first instance, Bingham J said ([1982] 1 Lloyd's Rep 506 at 512):-

</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p>"I am, however, of opinion that the language of this guarantee was deliberately

  drawn in the widest possible language so as to cover any liability of the company to the

  bank arising out of their mutual relations as banker and customer, however that liability

  might arise and whether it arose out of what may be called a pure banking activity or not.

  I consider the language of the substantive clause so clear as to obviate the need for

  reference to the introductory recital, but even if regard is paid to that recital and

  "banking facilities" were assumed not to include foreign exchange facilities I

  could not read the recital as cutting down in any way the deliberately wide language which

  follows. I would not, in any event, construe 'banking facilities' as excluding foreign

  exchange facilities offered by and through the bank. It is true that these are not what I

  have called pure banking activities. It is however indisputable that the major

  international banks conduct a large and regular business in foreign exchange dealing,

  which operations play a very large part in the business of some of them. It would, I

  think, be unrealistic in the modern financial world to treat facilities for the conduct of

  foreign exchange deals by and through banks as not being banking facilities, even though

  these are not facilities exclusively offered by banks." </p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns="">21 This view of Bingham J was affirmed by the Court of Appeal where Robert Goff LJ said

([1983] 2 Lloyd's Rep 298 at 301):- </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p>"… there is no ambiguity in the body of the guarantee justifying recourse to

  the introductory words to resolve any such ambiguity; but even if such recourse were

  justified, I would not myself read the words "banking facilities" in those

  introductory words as excluding foreign exchange transactions of the type which were

  entered into in the present case. I am therefore unable to accept this argument." </p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns="">22 In Re Rudd &amp; Son Ltd (supra), the issue was whether contingent liabilities were

secured by the mortgage, which provided that "all … sums … owing anywhere

on the current account of the firm (the borrower) or any other account …

including" and naming various kinds of liability. The contingent liabilities were

counter-indemnities given by the firm to the bank in respect of performance bonds given by

the bank to a local authority in connection with road works to be carried out by the firm.

The liquidators of the mortgagor company argued that the contingent liabilities were not

secured by the mortgage. It should be mentioned that, sometime after the liquidation of

the mortgagor company, the local authority did call on the performance bonds. The Court of

Appeal, reversing the High Court, took into account commercial sense in arriving at its

decisions. Dillon LJ said (at 98,959):- </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p>"in my view it does not make commercial sense that the mortgage should cover

  contingent liabilities once they are called but not otherwise." </p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns="">23 Nicholls J, the second member of the panel, said (at 98,961):- </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p>"In the proviso for redemption there are several references to transactions which

  at their inception would give rise to a contingent liability of the firm to the bank. I

  mention some of them. When a bill is discounted the liability of the firm to the bank will

  be contingent on the bill being dishonoured, which may not happen. Likewise, if the credit

  is made for the accommodation or at the request of the firm, the firm's liability to the

  bank in respect of this will be contingent until payment is made by the bank under the

  letter of credit. Again, liability of the firm to the bank as surety will normally be

  contingent on the primary debt accruing due as a present liability. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p>To my mind it is abundantly clear that the security was intended to embrace these

  contingent liabilities. But that intention will not be given effect to if the proviso is

  read in such a way that only money which is shown as presently owing on a current or other

  account of the firm is covered by the security. </p>
<p>For my part, I can see no justification for so reading the proviso. A common, if not

  strictly accurate, usage of the word "including" by draftsmen is to refer to

  matters which are not embraced by the preceding words. So used, the word

  "including" enlarges, or extends, as well as particularises. I think it is

  evident that the word "including" is so used in this mortgage document. </p>
<p>So construed, the security created by this mortgage will extend to contingent

  liabilities, notwithstanding that the provision at the beginning of the proviso refers

  only to payment to the bank of 'all and every the sum and sums of money which shall for

  the time being be owing to the Bank by the Firm anywhere on the current account of the

  Firm or any other account." </p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns="">24 We have considered these two cases purely to gauge judicial attitudes in relation to

such "all money" clauses. We recognise that in each case, the relevant document

must be considered as a whole in order to obtain its true sense. More significantly, the

court has to interpret such clauses in accordance with its commercial sense, in order to

give effect to the parties' intention. </p>
<p xmlns=""><strong>Alleged contradiction</strong> </p>
<p xmlns="">25 At this juncture, we would refer to an alleged contradiction between clause 1 and

clause 4, as contended by Tararone. The judge below, in arriving at his conclusion, felt

that clause 4 was relevant to determining the scope and intent of the charge. Here, we

would refer to what DBS's counsel, Mr Leslie Chew, submits is an erroneous reference made

by the judge. The judge said that clause 4 "referred specifically to the termination

provision under the facility letter." Mr Chew pointed out that there is no

termination provision in the facility letter. We note that the opening of clause 4

provides that "without prejudice to para 1(d)(i) of the facility letter." Para

1(d)(i) of the facility letter states that "DBS reserves the right to review the

above banking facility from time to time at its absolute discretion" which would

undoubtedly give DBS the right to terminate the facility. In our view, this was probably

what the judge had in mind when he stated that clause 4 referred specifically to the

termination provision under the facility letter. Of course, a clause giving the bank a

power to review should not be regarded as a termination provision. A review need not

necessarily lead to termination. To this extent, to describe para 1(d)(i) of the facility

letter as a termination provision is not entirely correct. </p>
<p xmlns="">26 The contention of Mr Ronald Choo, counsel for Tararone, is that implicit, if not

explicit, in clause 4 is the acknowledgement that the charge is really intended to cover

the overdraft facility and nothing else. This is because the clause permits Tararone to

withdraw sums from the FD in line with the repayment of the sum outstanding in the

overdraft account. If the charge was intended to cover all debts or liabilities due from

Sogo on any account with DBS, besides the overdraft account, then Tararone should only be

allowed to withdraw sums from the FD in line with the total liabilities of Sogo to DBS and

not just based on what was outstanding in the overdraft account to DBS. </p>
<p xmlns="">27 Mr Chew, however, argues that clause 4 does not affect the "all money"

nature of the charge set out in clause 1. It is effectively a provision which sets out how

much monies can be withdrawn by Tararone from the FD. For example, in accordance with the

repayment schedule, as at 31 July 1998, the maximum limit of the overdraft account had to

be reduced from $18 million to $10 million and in turn Tararone could withdraw $8 million

from the FD. Similarly, on the day preceding the date the overdraft facility was

terminated, in accordance with the repayment schedule, the maximum overdraft allowed to

Sogo was $3 million. What Tararone could withdraw from the FD at that point in time was

such sum as would leave behind in the FD a sum of not less than $3 million. </p>
<p xmlns="">28 On a true construction, we would agree with counsel for DBS that what clause 4

really provides is a right for Tararone to withdraw sums from the FD in accordance with

the repayment schedule. It is really a provision of a consequential nature, because, with

the compliance of Sogo with the repayment schedule, the maximum accommodation which DBS

would allow to Sogo was to be reduced in stages. In line with that, there would be no

reason for DBS to hold onto the original FD of $18 million but to allow Tararone to

withdraw therefrom corresponding with DBS's exposure. Just as an illustration; on 28 April

2000, Sogo would have reduced the outstanding amount owed to DBS to $3,000,000. So from

that day onwards DBS would only grant Sogo facilities up to that limit and no more. Of

course, the account being a current overdraft account, the amount outstanding therein

would vary from day to day but under no circumstances would DBS grant facilities beyond

that limit. Thereafter, the next milestone would be 31 July 2000 when Sogo would only be

accorded facilities of up to $2 million. Between 28 April 2000 and 31 July 2000, even

though there might well be some days where the sum in debit in the account might be very

much less than $3 million, say $1.5 million, there would still be no right on the part of

Tararone to request a further withdrawal of $1.5 million from the FD. The right of

withdrawal of Tararone must follow the milestones set out in the repayment schedule. Sogo

was entitled to expect DBS to accord to it the facilities up to the extent as specified in

the repayment schedule. Tararone could not demand the acceleration of withdrawal from the

FD based on the day to day variations in the outstanding sum in the overdraft account. </p>
<p xmlns="">29 Accordingly, it is our opinion that clause 4 is not inconsistent with clause 1,

where the scope of the charge is set out. </p>
<p xmlns="">30 Finally, we ought to mention that counsel for Tararone relied upon the following

passage of Young J in the Australian case Estoril Investments Pty Ltd v Westpac Banking

Corporation (1993) 6 BPR 13,146 to contend that, in relation to the present charge, it

should sensibly be read down to circumscribe its application:- However, in my view it is

valid to say in Australia that when one sees a mortgage in wide words and, as I believe is

the situation in the instant case, one would get absurdities if one read the wide words

literally, one should pause to see whether the parties intended when they entered into the

mortgage that it should cover the circumstance which has now arisen. </p>
<p xmlns="">31 We do not see how this passage assists Tararone when the crucial qualification in

that passage is "one would get absurdities if one read the wide words

literally." The absurdities which counsel thought existed in the present charge was

the alleged contradiction between clause 1 and clause 4. We have explained above the

consistency between the two clauses. To give clause 1 of the charge its plain meaning

would not lead to any absurdity. It is a common phenomenon for banks, in granting

facilities, to require the execution of an "all-money" charge. It is also a

common feature for banks to set a limit to the facilities it would accord to the borrower,

which facilities would be secured by a charge. </p>
<p xmlns=""><strong>Letter of 15 July 2000 and estoppel </strong></p>
<p xmlns="">32 We now turn to consider the letter of 15 July 2000 of DBS (15 July letter) notifying

Tararone of the termination of the overdraft account and demanding that Tararone repay the

sum of $365,873.87 then outstanding in that account. The effect of that notification is no

more, and no less, than what it stated - that the overdraft account had been terminated

and that the outstanding debt was $365,873.87 and that Tararone as the guarantor, should

pay up the same to DBS. It did not refer to the charge in any way. Therefore, it could not

have impinged on the continued validity or enforceability of the charge. </p>
<p xmlns="">33 It is not reasonable to infer from the letter that DBS would not grant any further

facility to Sogo, or for that matter, to revive the overdraft account (effectively

granting a fresh facility). As the coverage of the charge is in very wide terms and as it

is an "all money" charge, then, until the charge is validly withdrawn, it would

cover all sums which Sogo may be owing from time to time to DBS, including any new

facility extended by DBS to Sogo. </p>
<p xmlns="">34 Counsel for Tararone has argued before us that the 15 July letter, by stating that

the overdraft facility had been terminated, had represented that DBS would not permit

further drawings or offer new facilities to Sogo. It seems to us that this argument raises

the question of estoppel. </p>
<p xmlns="">35 For estoppel to apply, three elements must be satisfied and they are encapsulated in

three words: representation, reliance and detriment. It is clear that the 15 July letter

(a) notified Tararone of the termination of the overdraft facility and (b) demanded

payment from Tararone as the guarantor of what was outstanding then in the account of

$365,873.87. Looking at the letter objectively, we do not think anything more can or

should be read into it. This is very much the usual letter of demand issued by a bank to a

guarantor. It says nothing with reference to the charge. We do not think it warrants any

inference that DBS would not be offering any fresh facility to Sogo or that the amount

stated in the letter was the final amount that Tararone would be liable under the charge

and that the charge would effectively come to an end. To find an estoppel, a

representation must be clear and unambiguous. This can hardly be said to be satisfied

here. Accordingly, we hold that the first element to raise estoppel is not met. </p>
<p xmlns="">36 We would further add that the second element of reliance is also not fulfilled.

Tararone argued that they could have withdrawn the charge subject to putting up adequate

security for the outstanding sum owing by Sogo under the overdraft account. This, Tararone

said, was the reliance. To constitute reliance, there must be substantive evidence on

that. There is, in truth, no evidence whatsoever of any reliance. There is no evidence

that Tararone was contemplating withdrawing the charge and had refrained from doing so on

account of the alleged representation that Tararone's liability under the charge was fixed

at $365,873.87 and that thereafter the charge would be of no effect. This alleged reliance

smacks entirely of an ex post facto rationalization. Accordingly, as there was no

reliance, there could not have been any damages suffered on account of that. </p>
<p xmlns="">37 In this regard, it is pertinent to point out that Mr Takeshi Tsujita, who was the

Managing Director of Sogo and who wrote the letter of protest of 17 July 2000 to DBS, was

also the Managing Director of Tararone. He was clearly running both Sogo and Tararone. So

we are unable to see how Tararone can claim to be ignorant of what transpired between DBS

and Sogo. It is significant that no one from Tararone has affirmed any affidavit to say

that Tararone was not aware of the further accommodation extended by DBS to Sogo on 17

July 2000. </p>
<p xmlns=""><strong>Other issues </strong></p>
<p xmlns="">38 In 13 above, we have identified two other issues raised by Tararone. In our

judgment, they are without merits and may be disposed off shortly. </p>
<p xmlns="">39 In the light of our views as to the nature and scope of the charge, there was no

necessity for DBS to obtain the approval of the board of Tararone before DBS could extend

fresh facilities to Sogo after the termination of the overdraft account. </p>
<p xmlns="">40 The other point is whether, DBS, having informed Tararone of the termination of the

overdraft facilities, was under a duty to further inform Tararone when the bank intended

to revive the overdraft account or grant further facilities to Sogo. Tararone put this

argument on the basis that a bank must disclose to a surety "unusual features"

relating to a transaction and reliance was placed on Habibullah Mohamed Yousuff v Indian

Bank <nobr>[1999] 3 SLR 650</nobr>, which was a case where the Court of Appeal granted leave to a

guarantor to defend the claim in an Order 14 application. Unlike the situation there,

there is nothing unusual for a bank to terminate a facility and later, upon

representation, to either revive the facility or offer fresh facilities. Indeed, such a

situation clearly falls within the terms of clause 1 of the present charge. The situation

in Habibullah Mohamed Yousuff was really quite different. </p>
<p xmlns=""><strong>Judgment </strong></p>
<p xmlns="">41 In the result, we would allow the appeal and declare that the further facilities,

extended by DBS to Sogo after 15 July 2000, were secured under the charge. DBS were,

therefore, entitled to recover the outstanding amount in the overdraft account of Sogo

from the FD of Tararone. </p>
<p xmlns="">42 The appellants shall have the costs here and below. The security for costs, together

with any accrued interest, shall be refunded to the appellants. </p>
