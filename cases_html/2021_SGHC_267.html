I will consider this matter in the following order: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The effect of the joint tenancy of the legal estate;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The proportion of beneficial interests in the AMK property;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The proportion of beneficial interests in the Sunrise property;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Proprietary estoppel.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 1: The effect of the joint tenancy of the legal estate</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 To recapitulate, Chuan Wei’s case is that at the time of purchase of each of the properties, the parents, for reasons of succession planning, made a conscious and informed decision to be joint tenants together with him, which meant that the right of survivorship applied in his favour. Geri and Luke’s case is that there was no such conscious and informed decision. On their account, their parents believed that they owned the whole of the AMK property, two thirds of the Sunrise property; and considered that they were able to deal with their interests in the properties as they thought fit, including by testamentary disposition. Geri and Luke also note that Chuan Wei was the only sibling who had reached 21 at the time of the purchase of the AMK property.

These contra-indications include cases of unequal contributions to purchase price and purchasers who are commercial partners or business tenants.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">92     The statutory presumption of joint tenancy also requires one to consider the corresponding application of the equitable tendency towards tenancies in common as manifested in the presumption of resulting trust arising in particular circumstances. Under s 53(1) of the LTA, there may exist situations where co-owners hold land as legal joint tenants without fully appreciating or voluntarily intending the consequences of such manner of holding; there is, therefore, room for the intervention of equity to ensure fairness between the parties. Indeed, although co-owners may be reflected as joint tenants in the land register, and although they will be treated as joint tenants in so far as third parties are concerned, this does not preclude the court from investigating the beneficial ownership of the parties inter se in order to determine if they are to be treated as joint tenants or tenants in common as between themselves …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">93     At this point, it is pertinent for us to emphasise that it is only where the registered co-owners of land had not made a conscious and informed choice to hold as joint tenants at law that equity kicks in to presume a tenancy in common. In contrast, where co-owners had expressly specified their intention to hold land in a legal joint tenancy, there would be no cause for equity not to follow the law; thus, in such instances, legal joint tenants should also be beneficial joint tenants unless it may be shown that the expressly-stated choice should be vitiated for some reason. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">95     However, given the present s 53(1) of the LTA, there may still be cases whereby the co-owners of land would have been stated as holding land as joint tenants <span class="font-italic">as per the default position</span>. It is our view, therefore, that any steps towards the wholesale renunciation of the equitable presumption, which mitigates the rigours of a default legal joint tenancy, may presently be premature. … <span class="font-weight-bold">In our judgment, if cogent evidence is adduced to show that registered co-owners had in fact exercised their informed and voluntary intention to hold land as legal joint tenants, and if this evidence is accepted by the court, then the presumption of resulting trust which may arise to impose an equitable tenancy in common should be displaced and equity should, instead, as a matter of course, follow the law.</span> Such evidence could take the form of sworn testimony from the solicitor attesting to the completion of the land transfer form, or even from one of the co-owners concerned; each case must, ultimately, be decided on its facts.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original in italics, emphasis added in bold]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Thus, the first question is whether the parents and Chuan Wei did in fact intend to hold the properties as legal joint tenants, and made an informed choice to do so. If so, then the equitable estate would also be held in joint tenancy such that the right of survivorship would apply in respect of the co-owners’ beneficial interests. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Chuan Wei relied on the independent evidence of the lawyers who acted in the conveyancing. I accept that both did their best to assist the court. Turning first to the evidence of Mr Joethy, he gave his evidence in terms of what his practice would have been at that point in time over 20 years ago. His evidence was that he would have arranged for a Chinese speaking member of his staff to be present,

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The evidence of the two lawyers must be weighed against the evidence of what the parents and Chuan Wei themselves thought and believed. Starting with the parents, their state of mind must be inferred from evidence of what they did and said. The mother made her will on 15 June 2012, while the father made his on 19 May 2018. It is clear that they both attempted to bequeath their share of the two properties to Luke, which suggests that at the time the wills were made they believed they were entitled to do so. The question is whether this was because they had always believed they could do so, or whether they had originally intended that the properties would vest in Chuan Wei as the surviving joint tenant but had forgotten this original intention. I leave aside the possibility that the parents deliberately changed their minds knowing they had no right to do so as there was really no evidence of this third possibility.  The content of their wills does not by itself favour either the inference that the parents always believed they were entitled to dispose of their interest by will or initially understood they could not do so (without a prior severance of the joint tenancy in equity) but later forgot this. The same point can be made in respect of the evidence from Mdm Lim, which I accept, that the father told her a year or two after the mother’s death that he and his deceased wife wanted the Sunrise property to be shared by Chuan Wei and Luke,

I now turn to those documents.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 These concern communications among the siblings in the few months between their mother’s death and the day on which her will was read. After the mother passed away, Geri took the lead in trying to sort out arrangements concerning the properties and other family matters. I have no doubt that she did so in good faith. Moreover, at this time, none of the siblings knew the contents of the mother’s will. Nor did they know the tenure of the properties or any legal implications that might flow from that tenure. This includes Chuan Wei. Immediately after the will was read, he wrote an email to Geri and Luke dated 7 October 2013:

For the AMK property, he just signed without any explanation being given to him. For the Sunrise property, he did not remember any explanation and so thought that it would be held in joint tenancy as “the default”. When something happens by default, it means there has not been a deliberate choice. Accordingly, I find that prior to the reading of his mother’s will, Chuan Wei did not know that the legal estate of the properties was held in joint tenancy, nor did he know of any implications following from such tenure. In making this finding, I reject his evidence during cross-examination that his parents told him about the tenure and its implications in relation to the AMK property;

Thus, at a time when his father was alive, and so able to corroborate or contradict any assertion by Chuan Wei that he was to have the entirety of the properties, Chuan Wei agreed with his siblings that each of his parents had a one third share in each of the properties. The inference is that he too had a one third share.

</div> that he did not read the agreement attached to the email. In concluding that he did in fact read the agreement at the time, I also rely on my observation of his character as someone who is careful and guarded, including with his siblings. I am of the view that he would have carefully read every communication from them that concerned his own interests, and also responded carefully in return if there was anything with which he did not agree. Moreover, I am satisfied that Chuan Wei is not someone who would happily give away anything he believes himself entitled to. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Accordingly, I find that he agreed on the four points reproduced in [49] above.  I find that he had read the agreement when it was sent to him by email and did not respond to disagree with its summary of what had been agreed at the meetings because he considered it accurate. At that time, Chuan Wei did not believe that he had any right of survivorship.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 It is possible that he truly believed he was the favoured son and that his mother’s will would make a gift of her shares to him, in whole or in part but that is a different matter from knowing and believing that his parents had already decided and intended at the time of purchasing the properties that he would inherit them by the right of survivorship. I find that he did not have any such belief, and that the parents made no such representation to him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 It is a reasonable and compelling inference that if, as the 2013 documents show, Chuan Wei had no understanding of joint tenancies at the time the properties were acquired and did not believe that there had been a conscious choice of joint tenancy, the parents had not in fact made any conscious choice of joint tenancy. I conclude that the parents did not understand or intend at the time the properties were purchased that their interests in them would go to Chuan Wei automatically upon their deaths. I find that the legal estate was held in joint tenancy only because that was the “default”. It was not their deliberate and informed choice. Consequently, I hold that in equity, they purchased the properties as tenants in common, and so, such beneficial interest as they had in the properties could be bequeathed by them under their wills. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 For clarity, I note that these discussions in 2013 are not relied on as having resulted in an agreement on which Geri and Luke now found their claim. Rather, they are relied on as evidence of what was known and understood within the family concerning the properties. This is of assistance in two distinct ways. First, the discussions completely undercut Chuan Wei’s claim to have been told by the parents that he would inherit the properties by virtue of the right of survivorship. Secondly, they are indirect evidence of what the parents’ intentions were as well, because the siblings appear to have proceeded based on a family understanding. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 The evidence of the parties traversed later events and communications in some detail. However, I am of the view that by 2014 the parties had settled into antagonistic positions and there is little assistance to be gleaned from the communications among parties after that. Once the mother’s testamentary intentions were revealed upon the reading of her will, and as they became understood and their significance appreciated, the potential for things said or done to be self-serving grew.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 2: The proportion of beneficial interests in the AMK property</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 I return to the analytic framework set out in <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan </span>set out at [18] above. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 At the first step of the <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan</span> framework, the question is whether there is sufficient evidence of the parties’ respective financial contributions. The parties agree that the parents contributed the entire down payment for the AMK property and had serviced the mortgage for the AMK property at least until the mother’s death. At this step, the entirety of the equitable interest in the property belonged to the parents in equal shares, as neither the plaintiffs nor Chuan Wei have been able to show intention of any different apportionment between the father and the mother. As stated by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Su Emmanuel v Emmanuel Priya Ethel Anne and another </span>[2016] 3 SLR 1222 (“<span class="font-italic">Su Emmanuel</span>”) at [87]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">87     In <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span> ([77] supra), we addressed the question of whether subsequent mortgage payments could amount to a direct contribution to the purchase price for the purpose of establishing a resulting trust. We adopted (at [112]–[113]) the orthodox conception of the resulting trust as a trust which crystallises at the time the property is acquired. On this basis, we concluded (at [117]) that the extent of the parties’ beneficial interests under a resulting trust must be determined at the time the property is purchased because that is when the trust arises. In line with this approach, we held in <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span> that subsequent mortgage payments may only be taken into account if there was a prior agreement between the parties at the time the mortgage was obtained as to who would repay the mortgage. If, however, there was no such agreement, then subsequent mortgage payments would not count as direct contributions. In short, the critical question is whether the parties were in agreement, at the time of the acquisition of the property, as to what liability each party would undertake in respect of the mortgage.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 There was no prior agreement for Chuan Wei to make any contribution to the mortgage over the AMK property, nor does he allege that there was any subsequent agreement for him to do so. In fact, Chuan Wei’s own evidence in court was that he had made mortgage contributions on his own accord, without any indication or prompting from the parents.

</div> Accordingly, any contributions he may have made towards the AMK property would fall outside any expected mortgage repayments on his part, and equitable accounting would be brought into play (see <span class="font-italic">Su Emmanuel</span> at [105]). On this note, as stated in <span class="font-italic">Su Emmanuel</span> at [103], no distinction should be drawn between payments of capital and interest, and <span class="font-italic">a fortiori</span> any contribution from CPF monies should not be distinguished from cash repayments as the payment would enhance the equity of redemption. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 At the second step of the <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan</span> framework, the question is whether there is sufficient evidence of an express or an inferred common intention that the parties should hold the beneficial interest in the property in a proportion that is different from that set out in the first step. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Tan Yok Koon v Tan Choo </span><span class="font-italic">Suan and another and other appeals</span> [2017] 1 SLR 654 (“<span class="font-italic">Tan Yok Koon</span>”) at [110], approved reliance on parties’ subsequent conduct in rebuttal of a presumption of advancement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 For the reasons set out in [45] to [56] above, I do not accept Chuan Wei’s testimony that his parents told him that they intended him to have the entirety of their beneficial interest in the AMK property.

</div> This addresses the first three steps of the <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan</span> framework. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Turning then to the fourth step of the <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan</span> framework, the question is whether there is sufficient evidence that the party who paid a larger part of the purchase price (here the parents) had intended to benefit the other party (here Chuan Wei). On the facts, there is no evidence to support such a finding. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 At the fifth step of the <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan</span> framework, the court is asked to decide if the presumption of advancement would operate to rebut the presumption of resulting trust. While the parental relationship does give rise to a presumption of advancement (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, parent-child relationship), I consider that there is sufficient evidence of their actual intention, which was not to benefit Chuan Wei to the exclusion of their other children. I consider that they retained the entirety of the beneficial interest in the AMK property, and only later decided, as shown by their wills, to bequeath their interests to Luke.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 At the final step of the <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan</span> framework, the question is whether there is sufficient and compelling evidence of a subsequent express or inferred common intention that would alter the proportions in which the parties are found to have held the property after an application of the first five steps of the framework. Neither party has pressed such an agreement. Indeed, they principally differ over what the parents and Chuan Wei’s intentions were at the time of the original purchase of the properties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 There is one conundrum that arises. As I have observed at [50] and [55] above, the discussions among the siblings in 2013 appear to reflect a family understanding that Chuan Wei had a one third interest in both properties. However, Chuan Wei did not in his testimony suggest that during his parents’ lifetimes he owned a one third share of the equitable estate in the AMK property. His evidence in chief was only that his “parents intended for the AMK Property to be held in joint tenancy so that they can pass down the property to [him] when they pass away”.

</div> Thus, at the time of acquisition, the beneficial interest of the AMK Property was intended to be held entirely by the parents. Chuan Wei has not relied on the discussions in 2013 as giving rise to a changed common intention, and I agree that these discussions cannot be relied on for this purpose because they did not involve the father. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 In summary, after applying the various steps of the <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan</span> framework, I hold that the beneficial interest in the AMK property remained with the parents notwithstanding the joint tenancy of the legal estate. What is left to be decided is the issue of equitable accounting due to Chuan Wei. Chuan Wei has claimed that he contributed a total of $120,000 to the AMK property. First, there are two sums of $25,000 and $74,000 for which there is clear documentary evidence that I accept. Secondly, there is a sum of $21,000 in arrears claimed for the years 2011 to 2013. There is no documentary evidence of these arrears, but I accept Chuan Wei’s testimony on this point. It fits with another part of his evidence which was not challenged, namely that the retail business was unprofitable and the property in a state of disrepair and neglect.

</div> Accordingly, the sum of $120,000 is justly accountable to Chuan Wei. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 3: The proportion of beneficial interests in the Sunrise property</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Applying the <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan</span> framework, the first step considers the parties’ respective financial contributions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 The Sunrise property was purchased for $980,000 in about June 1999, with an initial down payment of $261,000 and the balance of $719,000 paid by a mortgage loan taken from DBS. From the start, Chuan Wei contributed financially, although the amount of his contribution is disputed. While Geri and Luke dispute the $45,000 that Chuan Wei claims to have contributed towards the down payment of the house, they do not dispute that Chuan Wei had contributed $9,500 to the initial payment from his CPF account and thereafter consistently contributed one-third of the mortgage repayments up until the father’s passing. As noted in <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan</span> at [53] to [57], while the orthodox approach is to determine each party’s share of the beneficial interest with reference to their contributions to the purchase price of the property at the time of acquisition, such a strict approach may not be consonant with the realities of mortgage repayments. Further, in <span class="font-italic">Su Emmanuel</span> at [87], it was held that subsequent mortgage repayments may be taken into account if there is a prior agreement between parties concerning the apportionment of payment of the mortgage. I hold that Chuan Wei was expected to pay for one third of the Sunrise property in accordance with the parties’ common intention considered in the next paragraph.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Turning to the second step of the <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan</span> framework, I find that the parents and Chuan Wei had the common intention to hold the Sunrise property in the proportion of one third each.

</div> written to Luke and copied to Geri just a month before his mother’s untimely and unexpected demise. This email concerned the proposed sale of the Sunrise property, but also set out Chuan Wei’s ideas concerning the AMK property. The email contained details on which Chuan Wei wanted Geri’s and Luke’s agreement, but the premise on which it was written was that he had a one third share in the Sunrise property while his parents had two thirds. He proposed a minimum sale price for the Sunrise property of $1.85 million. After paying off certain expenses and contributions, including Luke’s, he estimated that the parents’ two thirds of the surplus sale proceeds would be about $700,000 of which some would be returned to their CPF accounts. With this, they could pay off the loan for the AMK property (stated to be about $85,000), live there (for the second floor of which he would bear the cost of renovation up to a cap of $20,000), and use the leftover monies for their old age.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 I consider that the stated premise of the parents having a two-thirds share of the Sunrise property was not something he was merely proposing but reflected a common intention and understanding known within the family from the time of the original purchase. That it roughly accorded with the proportions of contribution supports this inference. It is also significant that Chuan Wei made this proposal to his parents via Luke, and not directly. He was cross-examined on this mode of communication,

</div> This was paid after the passing of the parents and departed from the common understanding of the parties. Accordingly, these sums will be subject to the remedy of equitable accounting and should be returned to Chuan Wei from the sale proceeds of the Sunrise property. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 For completeness, on the facts of this case, I do not accept that any interest savings resulting from the refinancing of the properties in 2001 are to be attributed to Chuan Wei.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 In summary, it is my view that the three named joint tenants owned the Sunrise property beneficially in equal shares. After accounting for the $271,000 paid by Chuan Wei, the remainder of the net sales proceeds should be split into three, with one third given to Chuan Wei and two thirds to Luke. Two thirds have been paid into court, and so only two thirds of the $271,000 should be deducted from them for payment out to Chuan Wei, while the balance should be paid out to Geri and Luke as executors of their parents’ estates.   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 4: Proprietary estoppel</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Finally, I turn to the claim of proprietary estoppel raised by Chuan Wei. It fails for the simple reason that I do not accept that the parents ever represented to Chuan Wei that he would have the entire legal and beneficial interest in the properties upon their passing.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 In conclusion, I find that the AMK property was beneficially owned in equal shares by the parents, and that Chuan Wei holds the AMK property on trust for the estates of the parents, to be distributed in accordance with their respective wills. The estates of the parents are to account to him $60,000 each (totalling $120,000) as reimbursement for Chuan Wei’s payments towards the discharge of the mortgage of the AMK property.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 As for to the Sunrise property, I find that the three named joint tenants had owned the property in equity as tenants in common in equal shares. From the net proceeds of the sale of the Sunrise property, the sum of $271,000 is to be accounted to Chuan Wei as reimbursement for his payments towards the discharge of the mortgage of the Sunrise property. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 I do not award any interest on the sum that is the subject of equitable accounting in relation to the AMK Property. For the Sunrise Property, such interest that has accrued on the monies paid into court should be paid out in accordance with the proportions ordered in respect of the principal sum standing in court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 I will hear parties on the drafting of the appropriate orders, any consequential orders, and costs.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Philip Jeyaretnam<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"><br/></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Rabi Ahmad s/o M Abdul Ravoof and Joshua Chow Shao Wei (IRB Law LLP) for the plaintiffs;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Koh Choon Guan Daniel, Clarence Cheang Wei Ming and Raheja Jamaluddin (Eldan Law LLP) for the defendant. </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
