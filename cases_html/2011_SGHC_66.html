<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an application for the extension of time
                    to file a Notice of Appeal against an order made in the course of divorce
                    proceedings. The applicant is the husband/defendant (“the
                    Defendant”) in the divorce proceedings brought by the plaintiff/wife
                    (“the Plaintiff”). Interim judgment has been entered, and orders
                    on the ancillary matters, in particular the custody, care and control of the
                    children of the marriage and the division of matrimonial property have been
                    made, followed by the final judgment. The Defendant wished to appeal against the
                    orders on the ancillary matters made on 12 August 2009 (“the ancillary
                    orders”), and therefore made this application for an extension of time to
                    file the Notice of Appeal. I dismissed the application, and the Defendant is
                    appealing against my order.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Chronology of developments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>2.1    19 February 2008 – The divorce
                    proceedings were commenced.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>2.2    15 August 2008 – Interim judgment was
                    entered (the Defendant did not contest the writ.)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>2.3    21 January 2009 – The Plaintiff’s
                    Affidavit of Assets and Means was served on the Defendant’s solicitors in
                    Malaysia, Chong &amp; Poh. (The Defendant was informed that he was to file his
                    Affidavit of Assets and Means.)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>2.4    12 August 2009 – Justice Tan Lee Meng
                    made orders on the ancillary matters (“the ancillary orders”) in
                    the absence of the Defendant who had also not filed his Affidavit of Assets and
                    Means.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>2.5    2 September 2009 – Final judgment was
                    entered.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>2.6    12 February 2010 – The Defendant
                    applied for extension of time to appeal against the ancillary orders of 12
                    August 2009. The application included a second prayer which the Defendant did
                    not pursue.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The ancillary matters</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       In the Plaintiff’s Affidavit of Assets and
                    Means she had stated that she was seeking: an order on the custody, care and
                    control of two of the children of the marriage, B and C and an order for the
                    transfer of a property in Singapore registered in the joint names of the
                    Plaintiff and the Defendant (“the Property”) to her.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       By a letter of 17 June 2008, Chong &amp; Poh
                    informed the Plaintiff’s solicitors that:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">i)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Our client is agreeable to the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Subsequently, Chong &amp; Poh ceased to act for
                    the Defendant after they informed the Plaintiff’s solicitors that they did
                    not have the Defendant’s instructions or <em>locus
                        standi</em> to appear in court on his behalf on the hearing of the
                    ancillary matters, and that they had informed him to attend in

                    Defendant did not appoint other solicitors to act for him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Consequent to Chong &amp; Poh’s response,
                    the Plaintiff’s solicitors corresponded with the Defendant at his address
                    in Ipoh. After the ancillary orders were made, the Plaintiff’s solicitors
                    sent a copy of the orders to the Defendant on 25 August 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Order of Court of 12 August 2009</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The Defendant eventually took action in the
                    proceedings. On 11 November 2009 he wrote and informed the Registrar of the
                    Supreme Court (the “Registrar”) that he did not agree with the
                    ancillary orders. A reply from the Registrar dated 17 November 2009 was sent
                    informing him <em>inter alia</em> that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.    The contents of your letter is noted. If a litigant

                        appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.    In the meantime, please seek legal advice from a

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The application</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       This application for the extension of time to
                    file a notice of appeal was filed on 12 February 2010 supported by an affidavit
                    of the Defendant of the same date. In the affidavit, the Defendant deposed
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_a"></a>(a)     upon being served the divorce papers
                        on or about 6 May 2008, he engaged Chong &amp; Poh to act on his
                        behalf;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_b"></a>(b)     he
                        informed his solicitors that he did not agree with the Plaintiff’s
                        proposals on the ancillary matters, especially the division of the
                        matrimonial assets, and he wished to be heard on the
                    matters;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_c"></a>(c)     his
                        solicitors did not update him on the progress of the case because while they
                        may have tried to keep him informed by mail, he was travelling, and did not
                        open his mail box, and his solicitors did not contact him by telephone, and
                        that lead to his not being represented at the hearing on the ancillary
                        matters;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_d"></a>(d)     he
                        became aware of the ancillary orders when he opened his mail box on
                        6 November 2009 and found the copy of the Order of Court of 12 August
                        2009 and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-No">11.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-Item">It was at this point that I sought the advise
                                of friends who then advised me to engage a Singapore solicitor to
                                try to set aside the Order obtained a [<em>sic</em>] apply for a fresh hearing date so that the
                                    [<em>sic</em>] I would have a chance to
                                present my evidence and my side of the story. I could only engage a
                                Singapore solicitor in late December 2009 as I did not have
                                sufficient funds in November 2009 and some of the solicitors that I
                                had earlier approached were reluctant to take on my
                            case.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-No">12.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-Item">I then engaged a Singapore lawfirm, M/s Peter

                                that as the time for Appeal against the Order of Court has lapsed
                                the [<em>sic</em>] I would be required to file
                                Summons supported by an Affidavit to apply for leave to file my
                                Notice Appeal out of time and therefore I am now doing
                            so.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">It is to be noted that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_a_1"></a>(a)     he made no reference to his letter
                        of 11 November 2009 and the Registrar’s reply of 17 November
                        2009, and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_b_2"></a>(b)     he
                        was inconsistent over the time he engaged his Singapore
                    solicitor.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The application and the contended merits of the ancillary orders </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The Defendant did not take issue with the
                    validity of the ancillary orders. He did not dispute that the orders could be
                    made in his absence and without any evidence from him. The grounds for the
                    application were set out in his affidavit filed in support of the
                    application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     With regard to the order on the custody, care
                    and control of the children, the Defendant deposed:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">14.    I aver that my appeal to be allowed to have joint
                            custody, with care and control to the Defendant with reasonable access
                            of the two minor children of the marriage is not unreasonable and
                            disruptive to lives of the said children.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">(This was at odds with his solicitors’ letter of 17 June
                    2008 (see <a href="#p1_4">[4]</a> <em>supra</em>.) Order (1) of the ancillary orders
                    reflected exactly what he had wanted.)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     With regard to the order on the Property, he
                    deposed:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I verily believe that the Learned Justice Tan made such an Order because I
                        did not present my evidence and my version of facts so that he could make an
                        informed decision ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The delay</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Under O 57 r 4(a) of the Rules of
                    Court (Cap 322, R5, 2006 Rev Ed), the Defendant had one month from the date when
                    the orders were pronounced or when he first had notice of the orders to appeal
                    against them. That means that if he was aware of the orders when they were made,
                    time will run from the date of the orders, but if he was not aware of the orders
                    when they were made, time will run from the date when he had notice of
                    them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     By his admission, the Defendant had notice of
                    the ancillary orders on 6 November 2009. On that basis, he had up to
                    6 December 2009 to appeal, but he did not do that although he was informed
                    by the Registrar that he should appeal if he was not satisfied with the
                    orders.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     He was also advised by his Singapore solicitor
                    in December 2009 that the time for appealing had lapsed and he had to apply for
                    leave to appeal out of time. It is reasonable to infer that the solicitor must
                    have also warned him that he should proceed with his intended appeal without
                    further delay. Nevertheless, he did not file his application till 12 February
                    2010, more than two months after the time for appealing.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The principles which apply to applications for
                    extension of time in appeals are well established. They have been set out in
                    several cases, and it suffices to refer to the decision of the Court of Appeal
                    in <em>AD v AE</em> [2004] 2 SLR(R) 505 which dealt
                    with an application to serve a Notice of Appeal out of time. The Court held that
                    such an application was to be dealt with on the same basis as an application to
                    extend time to file a notice of appeal, and went on to state that it is settled
                    law that in determining whether to grant an extension of time, four factors are
                    to be considered:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_a"></a>(a)     the length of the
                    delay;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_b"></a>(b)     the reason
                        for the delay;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_c"></a>(c)     the chances of success of the appeal;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_d"></a>(d)     the prejudice to the potential
                respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In that case, a delay of 49 days was held to
                    be “(b)y any standard ... very substantial”. The Court also held
                    that the delay in that case, which was caused by the inadvertence of solicitors,
                    “could hardly be a sufficient reason” for obtaining an extension
                    of time. On the third factor, the Court found that it could not be said that the
                    appeal if allowed to proceed would be hopeless. On the last factor, the Court
                    found that there would be no prejudice to the respondent if the application was
                    granted. Against the background of those findings, the Court set aside an order
                    which extended time for the service of the notice of appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     When the present application is examined, the
                    following facts emerge:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_a"></a>(a)     the period of delay or more than two
                        months is substantial;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_b"></a>(b)     the causes of the delay, <em>ie</em>, that he did not read his mail, that he did not maintain
                        effective communication with his solicitors and that he did not have
                        sufficient funds, were matters of his own making;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_c"></a>(c)     the chances of success of the intended
                        appeal are low, because:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_18-p2_c-p3_i"></a>(i)       the order on custody, care
                            and control was identical to the arrangement that the Defendant had
                            wanted;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_18-p2_c-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       as no evidence was put forward by the Defendant at the hearing on
                            the division of the matrimonial assets, the facts that the Defendant set
                            out in his affidavit in support of his present application are very
                            unlikely to be admissible under the test laid down in <em>Ladd v Marshall</em> [1954] 1 WLR 1489 and applied
                            in applications to admit new evidence in appeals to the Court of Appeal,
                                <em>ie</em>, that the evidence could not have
                            been obtained with reasonable diligence at the hearing; that the
                            evidence must be such that if given, would probably have an important
                            influence on the result of the case, though it need not be decisive; and
                            that the evidence is apparently credible. The Defendant would have
                            difficulties with the first requirement.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_d"></a>(d)     the Plaintiff would suffer some
                        prejudice if the appeal is allowed to proceed because she had enforced the
                        order on the transfer of the Property and had incurred costs and expenses to
                        have the Property transferred to her name on 23 October 2009. While the
                        prejudice can be redressed with the reimbursement of the costs and expenses,
                        the Defendant has not given any assurance that he is able and ready to
                        reimburse to the Plaintiff those costs and expenses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Upon reviewing the application against the
                    evidence and the legal requirements that the Defendant had to satisfy, I found
                    that he had not put up a sufficient case for time to be extended for him to file
                    a notice of appeal against the ancillary orders.</p>
