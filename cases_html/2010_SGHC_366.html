<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The accused was born in November 1975. He is now
                    35 years old. He was last residing in a one-bedroom rental flat (“the
                    flat”) in the Ang Mo Kio public housing estate with his wife and three
                    children. He married his wife in 1992. He divorced her by consent in the Syariah
                    Court in February 2010 in the matrimonial proceedings commenced by her, while he
                    was in custody in respect of the present case. Their three children comprise two
                    daughters (referred to henceforth as C1 and C2) and a son (C3). C1 was born in
                    March 1993 and is now 17 years old. She is the complainant in the charges
                    against the accused. C2, born in 1997, is now 13 years old while C3, born in
                    2001, is now 9 years old.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The charges</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The accused, who conducted his own defence
                    initially, claimed trial to the following five charges:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">That you, [accused],</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(1)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">sometime in 1999, in [the flat], voluntarily had
                            carnal intercourse against the order of nature with [C1] (DOB: xx March
                            1993), to wit, by having the said person perform fellatio on you, and
                            you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 377 of
                            the Penal Code, Chapter 224 (1985 Rev Ed).</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(2)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">on one occasion in the period from March 2003 to

                            occasion) which was after xx March 2004, in [the flat], committed rape
                            on [C1] (DOB: xx March 1993), while she was under the age of 14 years,

                            376(2) of the Penal Code, Chapter 224 (1985 Rev Ed).</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(5)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">on 29<sup>th</sup> day of April
                            2009 at about 2.30pm, in [the flat], used criminal force on [C1]
                            intending to outrage her modesty, to wit, by undoing one button at the
                            front of her blouse, and further, in order to facilitate the commission
                            of the said offence, you voluntarily caused wrongful restraint to the
                            said [C1], to wit, by grabbing her right wrist with your hand, and you
                            have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 354A(1) of
                            the Penal Code, Chapter 224.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">The date redacted in the first line of the fourth charge set out
                    above was C1’s date of birth. The last charge was amended by the court at
                    the conclusion of the prosecution’s case by deleting
                    “undoing” and substituting the words “attempting to
                    undo”. Four other charges (alleging fellatio in 2000 and rape in 2004, in
                    July 2006 and in November 2006 in the flat) were stood down.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       At the conclusion of the trial, the accused was
                    convicted on the five charges that the prosecution proceeded on (with the last
                    charge amended as indicated above). The prosecution then withdrew the remaining
                    four charges pursuant to section 177 of the CPC (Cap 68) and the accused
                    was granted a discharge amounting to an acquittal on those four charges
                    accordingly.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       As mentioned earlier, the trial commenced with
                    the accused conducting his own defence and speaking through a Malay interpreter.
                    After 12 prosecution witnesses had testified (including C1 on 26 August
                    2010), on Friday, 27 August 2010, the accused informed the court that
                    his family wished to engage defence counsel for him. This was confirmed by the
                    accused’s father. The court then adjourned the trial to Monday
                    30 August 2010 for the family to do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       On 30 August 2010, the present defence
                    counsel attended court and confirmed that they had been instructed to act for
                    the accused. They applied for time to study the papers and to take further
                    instructions. I directed that defence counsel be provided with the necessary
                    documents and the notes of evidence recorded thus far and adjourned the trial. I
                    was of the view then that the trial, when it resumed, should carry on from where
                    it stopped, with no recall of the prosecution witnesses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       At the start of the continued hearing, defence
                    counsel informed the court that, after having perused the notes of evidence and
                    interviewed defence witnesses, it was necessary to recall four prosecution
                    witnesses for the purpose of cross-examination only. The prosecution had no
                    objection to the recall. The four prosecution witnesses recalled were PW 6
                    (SSSGT Mohamed Lathiff) (“Lathiff”), PW 9 (Dr Cindy Pang), PW
                    10 (ex-wife of the accused and mother of C1 – hereinafter referred to as
                    “the mother”) and PW 12 (C1).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The prosecution’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The arrest of and the charges against the
                    accused came about this way. A few days before 29 April 2009, the mother
                    and the three children moved out of the flat after the mother and the accused
                    quarrelled. They went to stay with the children’s maternal grandmother in
                    the Yishun housing estate. Apparently, moving out with the mother after their
                    parents quarrelled was not new to the children.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Sometime past 2pm on 29 April 2009, C1
                    returned to the flat to collect some items which she needed for school and which
                    had been left in the flat when she moved out. The accused returned to the flat
                    and, noticing that C1 was in the bedroom, went in to talk to her, sitting a few
                    feet away from her. He grabbed her right wrist with his left hand and tried to
                    undo the first button (the one just below the collar button) of her school
                    blouse. During the struggle, C1 used her mobile phone to call the mother (with
                    whom she had agreed to go shopping and whom she had arranged to meet at a fast
                    food outlet at Ang Mo Kio Central) and informed her that she was leaving the
                    flat. Unlike an earlier telephone call, the mother noted that C1 was speaking in
                    a trembling voice and sounded sad. The accused stopped his actions. She then
                    left the flat quickly and went to meet the mother.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The mother noticed that C1 looked like she had
                    been crying although she had sounded delighted earlier when the mother told her
                    that she was going to buy her some clothes. Upon questioning, C1 informed her
                    mother tearfully that the accused wanted to have sex with her again. The mother
                    was shocked upon hearing the revelation that C1 and the accused had sex before
                    and asked C1 to swear upon God that she was speaking the truth. When C1 did so,
                    she brought her to the Ang Mo Kio South neighbourhood police centre
                    (“NPC”) to lodge a police report. For more details about the
                    events on 29 April 2009, see also <a href="#p1_22">[22]</a>
                    to <a href="#p1_24">[24]</a> below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     At the NPC, they approached a female officer.
                    C1 was crying. The female officer tried to calm her down. C1 informed her that
                    she had been raped by her father. The female officer then telephoned Lathiff of
                    Ang Mo Kio Police Division who instructed her to lodge a police report for C1
                    and to ask the mother and C1 to go to the said Police Division to meet him. A
                    male police officer then typed the report (exhibit P 18) which C1 signed. Under
                    “Brief details”, it was stated, “Sometime in year 2006, I
                    was raped by my father one [name of accused, his NRIC no.] at [the flat]. Under
                    “Date/Time of Incident”, it was stated, “12/07/2006 23:55
                    – 12/07/2006 23:55”. The date and time of the said report were
                    stated as “29/04/2009 16:48”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     At the Police Division, Lathiff spoke to C1.
                    Later that evening, PW 7, SI Chandra Seakeran (“the IO”) of
                    Serious Sexual Crimes Branch (“SSCB”), CID, arrived and also spoke
                    to C1. The next day, 30 April 2009, the police arrested the accused at the
                    flat.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     On 5 May 2009, the accused was examined
                    by a doctor from Changi General Hospital and found not to be suffering from
                    erectile dysfunction. On 18 and 25 May 2009, the accused was examined by
                    Dr Seng Kok Han, a psychiatrist from the Institute of Mental Health, and
                    found to have no mental illness. The accused informed the psychiatrist that he
                    never had sexual intercourse or any other sexual activity with C1. He also told
                    the psychiatrist that although he was not close to C1, they did not have major
                    conflicts and he did not know why C1 accused him of rape. During the second
                    session with the psychiatrist, the accused was tearful when he said that he
                    might plead guilty in order not to get C1 into trouble.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     On 3 June 2009, C1 was examined by
                    Dr Cindy Pang of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Singapore
                    General Hospital. C1 informed the doctor that she had her menarche at age 11
                    (see <a href="#p1_19">[19]</a> below for the significance of
                    this) and provided a general history of the alleged sexual acts between the
                    accused and her. The doctor noted (exhibit P 11):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">On examination, the patient appeared calm and looked her age. There were
                        no signs of peripheral injury. Secondary sexual development was appropriate
                        for her age. Her hymen was deficient posteriorly, with old tears at the 2
                        and 9 o’clock position, suggestive of previous penetration. Her anal
                        tone was normal and there were no fissures seen.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Dr Cindy Pang explained that when she interviewed C1, she focused
                    on the history pertaining to penetration and not on non-penetrative episodes.
                    She opined that it was unlikely that the tears were caused by sports or dancing
                    unless there was penetration by some object. In her view, a posteriorly
                    deficient hymen was not more susceptible to tears as compared to a normal
                    one.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     C1 was examined by Dr Lim Choon Guan, a
                    psychiatrist in the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Institute of
                    Mental Health, on 5 June 2009. She gave the psychiatrist a general history of
                    the sexual acts allegedly committed by the accused on her. The psychiatrist
                    noted that C1 was able to give a clear and detailed account of the alleged
                    events. He also noted that she would become teary-eyed at times but was still
                    able to hold her composure, that her mood was not depressed and her thoughts
                    were coherent and logical. C1 was assessed to be functioning in the average
                    range of intellectual functioning. The psychiatrist opined that C1 was not
                    suffering from any major mental illness and did not exhibit any symptom of
                    post-traumatic stress disorder, was fit to testify in court and was aware of the
                    nature and quality of the acts alleged. C1 was referred for counselling with the
                    Child Guidance Clinic’s medical social worker but did not turn up for the
                    appointment on 25 June 2009. The psychiatrist also interviewed the mother
                    on 5 June 2009. He recorded that she declined the institute’s request
                    to obtain a report on C1 from her school.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     C1 testified in open court. I turned down the
                    prosecution’s application (made at the start of her testimony during the
                    first hearing and renewed when she was recalled for cross-examination at the
                    resumed hearing) to allow her to testify <em>in
                    camera</em>. However, the usual order prohibiting the publication of her
                    photograph, name and particulars was made.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     C1 told the court that the accused started
                    engaging in sexual acts with her in 1999 when she was 6 years old and still in
                    kindergarten. The first incident occurred at around midnight in the living room
                    of the flat when C2 was asleep in the bedroom and the mother was on night shift
                    work. C3 was not born yet. C1 was sleeping with C2 in the bedroom when the
                    accused went to wake C1 up and then pulled her to the living room. He told her
                    to sit next to him on the mattress. C1 was in her pyjama dress. He lay down on
                    the mattress, wearing only his shorts. The television was on but the house
                    lights were off. A while later, the accused pulled down his shorts and told C1
                    to hold his penis. When she did so, the penis was erect. He then asked her to
                    perform fellatio on him. She complied for a few minutes and noticed
                    “white liquid” coming out from the penis. At that time, she did
                    not know what was going on.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     When C1 was in primary 4, one night sometime
                    after her birthday in March 2003 and before June 2003, the accused asked her to
                    watch television with him in the living room. C1 was watching television in the
                    bedroom then and C2 and C3 were asleep in the bedroom. The mother was on night
                    shift work. When C1 went out to the living room, the television screen there was
                    showing a naked man on top of a naked woman. C1 did not understand what was
                    going on. She sat down next to the accused while he lay on the mattress, wearing
                    only shorts. He then exposed his penis and told her to hold it. As she did so,
                    he inserted his finger into her vagina. She felt pain and tried to push his hand
                    away. He then told her to suck his penis and she complied. After a while, he
                    made her lie down on the mattress and he removed her panties. He then held her
                    legs apart and inserted his penis into her vagina. She felt him moving back and
                    forth. She felt a lot of pain and tried to push him away but he was too strong.
                    After he ejaculated his “white liquid” on her stomach, he told her
                    to wash up and go to sleep. She followed all the instructions given to her as
                    she was afraid of the accused.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     During the school holidays in June 2003, much
                    the same thing happened in the living room. C2 and C3 were sleeping in the
                    bedroom and the mother was working on night shift. The accused had sexual
                    intercourse with C1 after using his finger to penetrate her vagina while she
                    held his penis and after asking her to perform fellatio on him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     After her birthday in March 2004, the accused
                    raped C1 twice (one occasion was the subject of the fourth charge set out at
                        <a href="#p1_2">[2]</a> above and the other was the subject
                    of one of the stood down charges). She reached puberty around May that year. One
                    incident of rape took place before her puberty and the other occurred after her
                    puberty. The rapes happened in much the same sequence as the earlier ones
                    described above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     C1 was in primary 5 in 2004. That year, there
                    was sex education conducted in her school. It was then that she realized that
                    what had happened between her and the accused was wrong. She contemplated
                    telling the mother about what the accused had done but decided against it as she
                    did not want the mother to be unhappy. This was because she was afraid that the
                    mother would confront the accused and he would beat the mother up, as he had
                    done on other occasions when they quarrelled. She also did not know how to
                    explain to the mother about the incidents. She did not tell her teachers or her
                    classmates then as she did not know how to do so and was afraid they would not
                    believe her.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     C1 was not close to the accused. They only
                    communicated with each other regarding her school work. He was very strict with
                    her and would make her do her school work in front of him, scolding her if she
                    got the answers wrong and sometimes not allowing her to have dinner until she
                    completed her school work. C1 felt that the accused treated C2 better than he
                    treated her.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     On 29 April 2009, C1 was supposed to go
                    shopping at Ang Mo Kio Central with the mother after school. They arranged to
                    meet at the bus stop near the KFC restaurant there. Sometime after 2pm, C1
                    headed for the flat to pick up some school materials left behind when she moved
                    out with the mother and the two siblings. She had her own key to the flat. The
                    accused was not home when she arrived at the flat. While she was in the bedroom,
                    she received an SMS from the mother asking where she was and what time she would
                    be leaving the flat. C1 replied that she was already in the flat and was
                    retrieving some school materials.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     About ten minutes later, the accused went home
                    to the flat too. He went into the bedroom and asked C1 about her studies and her
                    siblings and enquired whether they would be returning home. When C1 sat on the
                    floor to put on her socks, the accused also sat down a short distance away. He
                    held her right wrist with his left hand and pulled her towards him. She stood
                    up. Using his right hand, he attempted to undo the button below the collar
                    button of her blouse. She protested in Malay, saying that she did not want to do
                    it, meaning that she did not wish to have sex. The accused replied in Malay,
                    saying that it was not as if she had not done it before. There was a struggle
                    and she managed to take out her mobile phone from her skirt’s right
                    pocket. She warned him that she was going to call the mother and he tried to
                    close the flip on her mobile phone in order to stop her from doing so. However,
                    she pressed the redial button and the call went through. C1 asked the mother
                    where she was and the mother told her that she was on a bus to their agreed
                    rendezvous point. The mother asked C1 where she was and she replied she was
                    going out of the flat already. C1 then quickly took her school bag and shoes and
                    left the flat. The accused did not try to prevent her from doing
                so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     C1 was crying as she walked to meet the
                    mother. She deliberated on whether to inform the mother about the incident with
                    the accused in the flat. When they met, she tried to stop crying, only to burst
                    out in tears again when C3 asked her why she was crying. She managed to utter
                    only the words, “Daddy, daddy” when the mother asked why she was
                    crying. The mother then asked her whether the accused had scolded her or beaten
                    her up. She told the mother in Malay that the accused “wanted to do it
                    again”. When the mother asked her to elaborate, she used the Malay word
                    “main” (meaning “play”) to explain that he wanted
                    sex. The mother asked her whether the accused put his penis into her vagina and
                    she confirmed that he did. The mother then asked her to swear upon God that what
                    she was telling her was true. When C1 did so, the mother brought her to the NPC
                    in a taxi. In the taxi, the mother asked C1 to re-affirm that everything she
                    said was the truth and C1 did so. The mother asked her whether it was
                    “sedap” (or nice) and C1 said it was not. She asked this question
                    to see whether C1 was a willing participant in the sex acts. C1 felt a sense of
                    relief that she had finally unburdened her secrets to the mother. However, she
                    also feared that the accused’s family members would not believe her or
                    would blame her for making a police report against the accused.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     C1 also testified about another incident that
                    took place in the flat in 2004 (not the subject of any charge). She claimed that
                    one day when she and C2 were in the bedroom, the accused went in and asked C2 to
                    go out as he wanted to help massage C1’s back. After C2 left the bedroom,
                    the accused closed the room door and latched it. He then asked C1 to perform
                    fellatio on him. She recalled this incident as it happened a few months after
                    her puberty and she was having cramps at that time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In 2006, when C1 was in secondary 1, the
                    accused raped her again. In April that year, she ran away from home. During the
                    three days away from home before the mother found her, she stayed with Kak Lia,
                    the god-sister of her friend, Fakir. She had hoped that her running away from
                    home would show the accused that she did not want to continue having sex with
                    him. However, she kept the reason to herself. As a result of this incident, the
                    accused punished C1 by having her “grounded” and did not permit
                    her to go to school for some time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     C1 also tried to avert further sexual
                    incidents with the accused after the last rape which occurred in 2006. She would
                    return to the flat after school only if the mother was at home. Otherwise, she
                    would go to the Ang Mo Kio library and remain there until 8 to 10pm. When she
                    went to bed, she would lie next to C2 so that if the accused attempted to pull
                    her away, she would hug C2 and cause her to wake up.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     C1 claimed that she used to keep two diaries
                    while she was in primary school. The yellow one was for her general matters
                    while the purple one, bought when she was in primary 4 or 5, was to record the
                    sexual abuse by the accused up to 2006. She recorded the dates of the incidents,
                    what happened on those days and her feelings about them and would refer to the
                    diary two or three times every fortnight. Unfortunately, both diaries were lost
                    while she was in secondary 2 or 3, probably thrown away with other books by the
                    mother during spring cleaning of the flat.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     C1 further testified that she had told C2 a
                    little about the sexual abuse while they were staying with their grandmother
                    during the school holidays sometime in 2007 or 2008. One night, she asked C2
                    whether she knew the meaning of “sex”. C2 said that it meant the
                    penis was inside the vagina. C1 then asked her whether she believed that
                    “daddy” had done that to her. C2 appeared shocked and was a little
                    incredulous at first. She asked C1 why she did not inform “mummy”
                    about it. C1 replied that it was not the right time to tell her yet as their
                    parents were quarrelling and she did not want to add to the mother’s
                    problems. C2 asked her whether she would like her to help in telling the mother
                    but C1 said that she would tell the mother when it was time to do
                so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     C1 said that she did not have sex with any
                    other person besides the accused. When the prosecution asked her to look at the
                    accused sitting in the prisoners’ dock in court and to confirm in the
                    presence of her paternal grandparents sitting in the public gallery that the
                    accused had raped her, she did so without flinching.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     During the first hearing when the accused was
                    not represented by defence counsel, he did not challenge or contradict
                    C1’s testimony at all concerning the alleged sexual incidents. He chose to
                    question her instead on matters that were of no real consequence to the charges.
                    The court tried to assist him by suggesting to him that he could perhaps
                    challenge C1’s evidence by stating that C1 was telling complete lies or
                    that some incidents took place while the others did not or that the incidents
                    took place with C1’s consent. After acknowledging that he understood what
                    the court was telling him, he maintained that he had no questions regarding
                    C1’s evidence about the alleged incidents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     At the resumed hearing, C1 was one of the four
                    prosecution witnesses recalled for cross-examination. The accused’s
                    defence counsel put to C1 that her allegations about the incidents of sex were
                    all false. It was also put to her that she had returned to the flat on 27 and
                    28 April 2009 as well (immediately before the alleged incident of outrage
                    of modesty on 29 April 2009) and that the accused was home on those
                    occasions and that nothing untoward happened on those two days. C1 recalled
                    returning home a few times before 29 April 2009 to take her things and also
                    the mother’s belongings but was not sure about the dates. She could not
                    recall whether the accused was home then. On each of those occasions, she left
                    the flat after about half an hour or so. Defence counsel also suggested to C1
                    that she was fabricating the allegations against the accused as he was a strict
                    father and she wanted to get back at him and send him to prison so that he would
                    not be able to control her anymore. It was also suggested to C1 that she bore
                    grudges against the accused as he treated C2 better than he treated C1, had
                    extra-marital affairs and beat up the mother. C1 was also alleged to have had
                    sex with her boyfriend(s) and to have had no fear about returning to the flat
                    when she ran away from home in 2006. She was also said to have discipline
                    problems before and after April 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     C1 denied that she was lying about the sexual
                    assaults and disagreed with the suggestions made by defence counsel. She agreed
                    that she had lied to the mother on two occasions. When she ran away from home in
                    2006 and was located by the mother subsequently, C1 lied to her that she had
                    been staying outdoors when she was actually in Kak Lia’s home. On the
                    second occasion, when the mother told her to return home and not stay in the
                    library, she lied that she had to look for materials there. C1 explained that
                    she did not want to get the friends who sheltered her into trouble as the mother
                    had made a police report about her disappearance. She did not want to return to
                    the flat earlier as she was afraid of being alone with the
                accused.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In respect of her relationship with Lathiff,
                    C1 denied having addressed him as father in Malay. She said that Lathiff only
                    advised her about school work and her future. In re-examination, the prosecution
                    very fairly brought to the attention of the court that, on 22 September
                    2010, in the course of investigations by the Health Sciences Authority into some
                    possible offences regarding cough syrup allegedly taken out by the mother from
                    the private clinic where she worked as a nursing assistant, C1 stated in a
                    statement that she believed that the mother married Lathiff in Batam and that at
                    first, she called the mother’s new husband “uncle” but
                    subsequently called him “Baba” (meaning father). She also stated
                    therein that the mother had known Lathiff since June 2009 when he was the
                    (initial) investigating officer looking into C1’s police report. When
                    shown the statement by the prosecution, C1 looked through the entire statement
                    and then claimed that she did not say those things about the mother and Lathiff.
                    She claimed that she was working as an event coordinator for a fast food outlet
                    and was in the midst of a client’s birthday party at the client’s
                    home when some Health Sciences Authority officers telephoned her and requested
                    to meet her for five minutes. She agreed and went down to the ground floor of
                    the block of flats where she hurriedly answered some questions and then signed a
                    statement after it was read to her as she had to rush back to the party. She
                    signed as the Health Sciences Authority officers had told her that the statement
                    could be of help to the mother. She maintained in court that the contents of the
                    statement were untrue and that she merely called Lathiff uncle and not
                    father.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Both defence counsel and the prosecution
                    agreed initially that the Health Sciences Authority officers who recorded
                    C1’s statement be called to testify. However, the next day, the
                    prosecution informed the court that it was not calling the officers but would
                    take the position that the statement was indeed made by C1 to the Health
                    Sciences Authority officers and that reference could be made to the relevant
                    questions and answers (numbered as 1 to 6) therein on how C1 addressed Lathiff.
                    The prosecution did not wish to have the statement admitted in evidence as it
                    was the subject of ongoing investigations. Defence counsel accepted the
                    prosecution’s position. When C1 returned to the witness stand, she
                    explained that she was sad and concerned as a daughter that the investigators
                    were alleging that her mother was involved in the cough syrup matter. She
                    maintained that she called Lathiff uncle and not father and that she did not
                    know whether calling him father would be damaging to her mother’s case or
                    not. She also maintained that she had no reason to fabricate the charges of rape
                    and sexual abuse by the accused and she did not discuss the case with
                    Lathiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     In respect of the divorce, the mother
                    testified that she commenced proceedings in the Syariah Court because she could
                    not tolerate the abuse by the accused and his financial irresponsibility towards
                    their family and also because of the allegations that he had raped their
                    daughter. However, she agreed that the divorce was granted without the court
                    requiring her to prove her allegations and that the accused merely pronounced
                    the “talak”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The mother explained that she left the flat
                    around 4 to 5pm for her night shift work during the marriage. She testified that
                    she changed primary school for C1 not because C1 had disciplinary problems in
                    the former school but purely because the former school was further away from the
                    flat and travelling to and from school cost money (which the family was short
                    of) while the new school was within walking distance. When C1 was missing from
                    home, the mother took leave to search for her and when someone finally told her
                    where C1 was, her only concern was to bring her home and not to question her
                    about why she had run away from home.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The mother was cross-examined about her
                    relationship with Lathiff, a married man. She was asked whether she had asked
                    the accused’s sister and her husband to arrange a secret marriage for her
                    and Lathiff in Batam. The mother claimed that she got to be friends with Lathiff
                    only some two months after C1’s police report was made. Lathiff called to
                    ask how she was coping and asked her out for a drink. She admitted that she had
                    invited Lathiff to the flat and that he had driven her to Ang Mo Kio Central in
                    a police patrol car before. Lathiff merely advised her children to be obedient
                    and to study hard. He did not try to coach C1 or C2 concerning their testimony
                    in court. She and Lathiff denied being in a love relationship. She suggested to
                    the accused’s sister the secret marriage in Batam merely to anger and hurt
                    the accused’s family by letting them know that she was marrying someone
                    better than the accused. There was no marriage at all. In July 2010, she did go
                    on a one-day shopping trip to Batam with her brother and Lathiff.
                    Lathiff’s wife was supposed to join them but could not because of work
                    commitments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Lathiff, who has been transferred to other
                    duties because of the ongoing investigations regarding the alleged theft of
                    cough syrup which he was suspected of having abetted, testified that after he
                    met C1 and the mother on 29 April 2009, he interviewed C1 for about an hour
                    and spoke to the mother separately. His role was to see whether the allegations
                    of rape were made out or not. C1 was crying and could hardly speak. After she
                    calmed down, she narrated her story to Lathiff who then informed SSCB. When the
                    officers from SSCB arrived later that evening, they took over the investigations
                    and Lathiff was not involved in the case from then on. It was only some two
                    months later that he decided to call the mother to befriend her. They did not
                    know each other before 29 April 2009. He agreed that he had been to the
                    flat but the children were home on those occasions. He merely counselled them
                    and told them to be obedient. His contact with the mother and the children was
                    on a personal basis and had nothing to do with the investigations in this case.
                    He could not recall whether he had given the mother a lift in a police patrol
                    car. He met the accused’s sister and her husband at the flat. The mother
                    told Lathiff that she had informed the accused’s sister and her husband
                    about their supposed wedding as a ploy to hurt the accused’s
                    family.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     C2, now 13, testified that in 2006 (when she
                    was about 9 years old), the accused went into the bedroom and told her and C3 to
                    go outside. C1 was asleep and the mother was not home then. C2 was told to close
                    the room door. C2 did so but felt uneasy. She waited in the living room and did
                    not dare to open the room door as she was afraid of the accused. He emerged from
                    the room about half an hour later. When C2 entered the bedroom, C1 was seated on
                    the bed watching television. Sometime after that day, C2 asked C1 what was going
                    on in the room that day but received no answer from her.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     On another occasion at night in 2006, when the
                    three children were sleeping in the room, C2 was awakened by some movement on
                    the bed. She saw the accused on top of C1 and turned away as she was afraid of
                    him. He was not wearing any shirt but C2 could not see if his shorts were on.
                    The mother was out working that night. Subsequently, the accused left the room.
                    C2 did not ask C1 nor tell anyone about this incident.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     One afternoon in 2008, C1 told C2 that on the
                    occasion in <a href="#p1_40">[40]</a> above, the accused touched
                    her vagina and her body. C2 was shocked to hear this. Both of them cried. C2
                    told C1 she hated the accused for this and would treat him as an uncle and not
                    as their father. C1 told her that the mother did not know about all this and
                    that she would tell her when the time was right.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The case for the accused</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The accused was educated up to secondary two.
                    He started working life as a cleaner and then did sales in a departmental store
                    for a while. He then returned to cleaning service work. In the three years or so
                    before his arrest, he was doing odd jobs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The accused said that C1 returned to the flat
                    on 27 and 28 April 2009 as well. On those days, he was at home. On the
                    first occasion, he was using his computer in the living room and only asked C1
                    whether she had come from school. On the second occasion, he was sleeping in the
                    living room and awoke when C1 was opening the main door to the flat. They did
                    not speak to each other that day. On 29 April 2009, when he returned to the
                    flat, he saw C1’s shoes and heard the sound of running water in the
                    toilet. Subsequently, C1 emerged from the toilet and went into the bedroom. The
                    accused went into the bedroom, sat down near C1 with her on his right and asked
                    her about the children, school, her recent examinations and when the family
                    would be returning to live in the flat. During the conversation, C1’s
                    mobile phone vibrated and she looked at the SMS. He asked her who the sender was
                    and she replied that it was the mother asking her to go home quickly. He said,
                    “OK” and went to the kitchen to make coffee for himself while she
                    continued packing her books. He then heard her making a call using the
                    speakerphone function on her mobile phone. The mother said,
                    “Hello” and the line was then cut off. He next heard her leaving
                    the flat.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The accused said that the mother was probably
                    angry with him over the family’s finances. She had attempted to divorce
                    him before but did not go through with it. They had quarrels and fights over
                    money matters. She also suspected him of having an affair. At the divorce
                    hearing (which was by video-conference), he decided to pronounce
                    “talak” to give her what she wanted. Although he was told about
                    the grounds pleaded by the mother, he was not asked by the court officials
                    whether he admitted them or not. Nobody testified at the divorce hearing. He was
                    not represented by counsel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     His relationship with C1 was normal. They did
                    not talk much to each other except about school and school work. The mother was
                    more involved in C1’s upbringing. He was strict with C1 in respect of her
                    school work as he wanted a good future for her. He disagreed that he treated C2
                    better. When C1 returned home after running away, he did not ask her anything as
                    the mother had told him earlier not to do so and to just let her relax. He
                    decided to “ground” C1, something he had not done before, as she
                    was stubborn and had run away from home. The mother tried to enrol her in a
                    school nearer the flat partly because she wanted to separate C1 from her
                    previous school mates. When C1 was unwilling to help out with the household
                    chores, he left her alone and did not do anything to her. It was possible that
                    C1 was angry with him for having been physically abusive towards the mother and
                    also because C1 believed that he was having an affair.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The accused’s defence to the charges was
                    a complete denial that any sexual contact took place. When asked by the
                    prosecution why he did not challenge C1’s allegations during the first
                    hearing despite the court’s guidance, he said he did not know how to
                    challenge her evidence. He explained that when he told the psychiatrist (see
                        <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a> above) that he might plead guilty
                    in order not to get C1 into trouble, he meant that his daughter had made a false
                    report against him and he might choose to admit guilt rather than have her
                    prosecuted for making a false report. He was “ready to take over her
                    punishment”. It was not an expression of remorse over what he had
                    allegedly done to her. He was sad when he heard C1’s testimony in court,
                    wondering why she was making such allegations and who might be behind
                    this.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     The accused’s sister, who used to be
                    close to the mother, testified that she was told by the mother only in June 2009
                    that the accused had raped C1. Before that, whenever she went to the flat, the
                    mother would say that the accused was out working. The mother was afraid that
                    the accused’s parents would get to know about the case. During the school
                    holidays in June 2009, the sister stayed at the flat for one week while her
                    parents were on holiday in Malaysia and the mother therefore could not hide the
                    fact of the accused’s arrest any longer. The sister was shocked to hear
                    the news. The mother apologised to her, saying she did not know how to tell the
                    accused’s parents. Nothing changed after that as the sister continued to
                    send her children to the flat in the morning for the mother to mind them while
                    the sister was out working. Eventually, the sister felt that things had changed
                    as the accused’s belongings were no longer in the flat.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     In October 2009, the mother informed the
                    sister that she got to know Lathiff when she went to report the loss of her
                    identity card at Ang Mo Kio Police Division. The mother said that Lathiff is
                    married and has four children and wanted to know the sister’s opinion if
                    the mother were to become Lathiff’s second wife. The mother also asked the
                    sister to ask her husband to speak to Lathiff about a plan for her to get
                    married to Lathiff in Batam.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The sister’s husband made the
                    arrangements for them. The plan was to have the marriage during Christmas 2009.
                    Subsequently, the mother informed the sister that the marriage was cancelled as
                    she and Lathiff had a misunderstanding. However, in May 2010, the mother told
                    the sister that she had married Lathiff in Batam. When the sister asked her
                    whether they had obtained the consent of Lathiff’s first wife, she said
                    that the first wife did not agree. The mother showed her some photographs, the
                    wedding ring and the marriage certificate issued in Batam.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     In March 2010, the accused’s sister and
                    her husband met Lathiff in the flat. C1 and C3 were at home too. When they were
                    leaving the flat, the sister offered the mother and Lathiff a lift in her
                    husband’s car but they declined saying that Lathiff had a police patrol
                    car there. They waited nearby to see whether that was true and saw Lathiff
                    leaving with the mother later in a police patrol car driven by
                Lathiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     The sister testified that the accused’s
                    three children were close to Lathiff. They spoke often to him over the telephone
                    and addressed him as “Baba” (meaning father). C1 asked him to buy
                    chocolate while C2 asked him to buy ice cream.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     In June 2009, after the sister’s parents
                    returned from their holiday in Malaysia, the sister arranged a meeting in the
                    parents’ flat. The mother went with the three children. The sister, her
                    other brother and the parents were also there. The three children were asked to
                    go into a bedroom while the adults met in the living room. The mother said that
                    if the accused was willing to divorce her, she would withdraw this case against
                    him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     The sister agreed with the prosecution that
                    the mother and C1 never said that the police report made by C1 was false.
                    Whenever the sister asked C1 whether it was true “what daddy had
                    done” to her, C1 would reply, “Yes” but would then keep
                    quiet when probed further about what the acts were.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     The sister’s husband (she is his second
                    wife) confirmed the evidence regarding the police patrol car. He also testified
                    that at the end of 2009, the sister informed him that the mother wanted him to
                    make preparations for her marriage to Lathiff in Batam. He agreed and asked them
                    what the date was and was told it was to be in March 2010. Some months later,
                    the mother and Lathiff told him that they were not able to perform the marriage
                    there. He heard that they had a break-up in their relationship. However, a few
                    months later, his wife told him that the mother and Lathiff had married in
                    Batam.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     The sister’s husband said that he had
                    asked the mother for permission to speak to C1 about the case but the mother
                    refused to allow him to do so. When he saw Lathiff in the flat, it appeared to
                    him that Lathiff was a strong, influential person whom C1 was afraid of. The
                    sister’s husband also agreed with the prosecution that he had not heard
                    the mother or C1 say that C1 made a false police report against the
                    accused.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The final witness for the defence was the
                    accused’s father. He said that he first knew about his son’s arrest
                    on 27 June 2009 when the mother and the three children went to his flat.
                    The mother wanted him to allow her to tell the story without interruption and so
                    he merely listened to her without asking any questions. The mother said that if
                    the accused divorced her, she would withdraw all the charges against him. At the
                    end of her conversation, he asked her whether it was true that the accused had
                    raped C1. The mother kept quiet and told him he could not ask C1 about this. She
                    said that it was not necessary as, being her mother, she knew what it was all
                    about.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     The accused’s father said that during
                    the marriage, the mother was very aggressive and cruel towards the accused and
                    always accused him of being lazy. Each month, she would approach the
                    accused’s father for financial help as the accused was unemployed. The
                    accused’s mother would pass her $30 to $50. He did not give the mother any
                    money. His relationship with her was not good and he did not like to see her.
                    Before the accused’s arrest, the accused’s father was able to speak
                    to C1 each time for only about 10 minutes before the mother took her away and
                    placed her in the accused’s sister’s bedroom.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     In cross-examination, when asked whether the
                    mother had said that the allegations against the accused were untrue, the
                    accused’s father replied that the mother had told him in front of the
                    accused’s mother and brother that she wanted to send his son (the accused)
                    to prison. When the question was repeated, he said that the mother had never
                    said anything to him. He also said that C1 had never said anything to him when
                    asked whether C1 had said that the allegations against the accused were
                    untrue.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision of the court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     As is common in allegations of this nature,
                    the crucial evidence often comes from the alleged victim only and the court must
                    be aware of the dangers of convicting solely on that testimony, bearing in mind
                    the ease with which allegations of sexual assault may be fabricated and the
                    concomitant difficulty of rebutting such allegations (see the Court of
                    Appeal’s decision in <em>PP v Mohammed Liton Mohammed Syeed
                        Mallik</em> [2008] 1 SLR 601). The Court of Appeal in that
                    case (at [39]) also emphasized that the quality of the testimony must be
                    consistent with the high standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Where a
                    reasonable doubt arises in the testimony, it is axiomatic that the accused
                    should be given the benefit of that doubt.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     Here, C1 was 17 years old at the time of the
                    trial. Although an application was made by the prosecution at the commencement
                    of the trial for her to testify <em>in camera</em>, I
                    decided against it as I was of the view it would be better to hear and observe
                    C1 in open court in the presence of the accused and his family members. I agreed
                    to revisit the application should circumstances warrant it. When the same
                    application was made at C1’s recall for cross-examination during the
                    resumed hearing, I remained of the same view. I had also not noticed anything
                    during the first hearing that would call for a change of position.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     C1 appeared to me to be a forthright person,
                    not given to exaggerations or embellishments. She spoke simply and did not
                    appear to have been coached or “tutored” (the word used by defence
                    counsel in reference to Lathiff) in her evidence at all, whether during the
                    first or the resumed hearing. I was satisfied that she understood the gravity of
                    what she was saying in court about her father and knew the importance of telling
                    the truth. Allowance must obviously be given for the fact that some of the
                    alleged incidents occurred many years ago when she was much younger. It would
                    therefore not be possible to recall with precision every detail of each
                    occurrence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     C1 did not waver or show any uncertainty when
                    asked by the prosecution to re-affirm her allegations about the rapes in open
                    court in the presence of the accused and his family members. She did not hide
                    her perception that the accused favoured C2 over her although the accused denied
                    treating C2 better than he treated C1. She frankly acknowledged that the accused
                    was strict with her school work but denied that she wanted to get rid of him
                    because of that. She showed no animosity towards the accused in court. Other
                    than the “grounding” in 2006, for which there was a valid reason,
                    there was no suggestion that the accused was an impediment to her lifestyle.
                    Indeed, the accused was at a loss when asked for the reasons why he thought C1
                    would be making such serious false allegations against him. Far from wanting to
                    get the accused out of their lives, C1 was concerned that she would exacerbate
                    the family conflicts if she told the mother about what the accused had done to
                    her. She was also unsure about how to break the news to the mother or to anyone
                    else and whether anyone would believe her story. She did not appear to me to be
                    lying about her ambivalence. She was truly in a dilemma from which she, at that
                    young age, did not know how to extricate herself.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Her account about the events of 29 April
                    2009 was particularly clear and cogent, probably due to the fact that it was the
                    most recent incident involving the accused and she was more mature by then. It
                    was also the trigger event that led to the police report. She had no qualms
                    returning to the flat alone to collect her things although the accused could be
                    at home as he had not made any unwelcome overtures to her for several years
                    already. The mother and C1 did not appear to have colluded in any way about
                    these events. It was not as if C1 had returned to the flat in order to set a
                    trap for the accused. After all, as he testified, C1 was also back at the flat
                    on the two days immediately before that date and nothing happened. C1’s
                    genuine distress after the confrontation with the accused in the flat was also
                    noted by the police officers who saw her that day.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     The accused’s inability to put any
                    questions to C1 about the alleged sexual assaults during the first hearing was
                    intriguing. He was not highly educated but was certainly no moron. When invited
                    by the court to challenge C1’s testimony and to suggest to her that
                    perhaps she was lying about all or some of the allegations in the charges, he
                    chose not to do so or to ask her any question regarding the crucial matters. I
                    therefore agreed with the prosecution that the accused’s subsequent
                    evidence about all the possible reasons why C1 could be fabricating evidence
                    against him invited scepticism. It was also strange that he chose to ask about
                    the family’s well-being only on the third consecutive day (29 April
                    2009) that he met C1 in the flat.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     Although C1 may have had some disciplinary
                    problems at school, she did not seem to be a wayward child intent on getting her
                    father out of her life. She candidly agreed that she had lied to the mother on
                    occasions concerning her not returning home after school. She had good reason
                    not to want to return to the flat where she would be alone with the accused who
                    seemed to be home most of the time instead of out working.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Corroborative evidence may be found in
                    C2’s testimony. C1 had confided in C2 about the sexual assaults by the
                    accused and that caused C2 to have such poor regard for their father that he was
                    downgraded to being an uncle in her eyes. No reason has been proffered by the
                    accused why C2 would also turn against him unjustly. She certainly did not
                    appear to have been manipulated by anyone in her evidence despite her
                    age.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     Corroborative evidence may also be found in
                    the medical evidence. What C1 told the doctors was by and large consistent with
                    her evidence in court. Naturally, while the hymenal tears indicated previous
                    sexual penetration of the vagina, they did not point to the accused being the
                    perpetrator.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Two issues raised some concern about the
                    prosecution’s case. The first related to the two diaries that C1 alleged
                    she kept but were somehow lost around 2007 or 2008. Defence counsel argued that
                    these diaries did not exist because the mother could not have discarded such
                    without so much as browsing through them. I did not think C1 was lying about the
                    loss of the diaries. Perhaps the mother was careless in disposing of them
                    without much thought. However, as the diaries were missing, I did not place any
                    weight on C1’s evidence that the alleged sexual assaults were detailed by
                    her in one of them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     The second and much more important matter
                    concerned the Health Sciences Authority investigation statement (see <a href="#p1_34">[34]</a> and <a href="#p1_35">[35]</a>
                    above). This was the only time in C1’s testimony in court that she paused
                    hard and long before answering any questions, including those posed by the
                    court. Despite her denials about the accuracy of the said statement regarding
                    how she addressed Lathiff, the prosecution has accepted that she did give the
                    answers as recorded and that she did refer to Lathiff in more recent times as
                    “Baba” or father.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     I noted that her denials came about only after
                    she had the opportunity to browse through the statement. A quick perusal of the
                    questions and answers from question 8 onwards would show that the answers
                    purportedly made by her were clearly detrimental to her mother in the
                    investigations regarding the cough syrup. I need not rule on the voluntariness
                    or the accuracy of this statement in this trial in view of the position taken by
                    the prosecution regarding its own witness’ previous statement. I
                    highlighted the rest of the contents of this statement merely to explain why I
                    believed C1 was not willing to acknowledge her own statement. By this time, C1
                    obviously realized that if her mother were to get into any trouble with the law,
                    she and her siblings would be left to fend for themselves. She was thus
                    extremely reluctant to accept the statement as having been made by
                her.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     I reconsidered her veracity in the light of
                    this new development and concluded that while she was not entirely forthright on
                    this score, she was completely truthful in her testimony regarding the charges.
                    As explained above, it was perfectly understandable why she sought to disavow
                    the statement. This of course attracted the criticism that she was capable of
                    telling an untruth where it suited her purposes. Nevertheless, bearing in mind
                    the serious charges that the accused faced and the burden on the prosecution to
                    prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, I still held the firm belief that C1 was
                    telling the truth about the sexual assaults. This was so even if the mother and
                    Lathiff were not completely upfront about their relationship. I accepted that
                    any relationship between them developed only a couple of months or so after the
                    police report was made by C1. As mentioned earlier, I did not detect any hint
                    that Lathiff, despite being the apparent father figure to the accused’s
                    children, had sought in any way to influence C1 or C2 in their testimony in
                    court. C1’s evidence, when tested with the rest of the evidence adduced in
                    court, still rang true to me, leaving me with no doubt that she was telling the
                    truth concerning the alleged sexual assaults.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     I therefore held that the prosecution had
                    proved its case against the accused on the five charges beyond reasonable doubt
                    and I convicted him thereon accordingly. It was obvious that the acts of sexual
                    intercourse took place without C1’s consent. She did not even know the
                    nature of the acts until after the sex education lessons in school in
                    2004.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The sentences</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     The first four charges concerned offences
                    governed by the previous Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed)
                    (“the old Penal Code”). The fifth charge was the only one that
                    fell within the present Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the
                    new Penal Code”) which came into force on 1 February 2008. Section
                    377 of the old Penal Code provides for life imprisonment, or imprisonment of up
                    to 10 years and liability to a fine. Section 376(2) of the old Penal Code
                    provides for imprisonment of not less than 8 years and not more than 20 years
                    and caning of not less than 12 strokes. Section 354A(1) of the new Penal Code
                    provides for imprisonment of not less than 2 years and not more than 10 years
                    and mandatory caning.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     The accused admitted a previous conviction in
                    May 1995 for possession of a controlled drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act
                    (Cap 185) for which he was sentenced to 4 months’ imprisonment. He
                    was then 19 years old.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     The prosecution highlighted the following
                    aggravating factors:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the accused is C1’s father;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the sexual abuse began when C1 was only 6 years
                            old;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the physical and psychological harm suffered by
                            C1, including the loss of virginity, and the impact on the relationship
                            within the family; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the accused’s lack of remorse and the
                            aspersions cast on C1.</div>
<p class="Judg-1">Based on sentencing principles and precedents and considering that this
                    case proceeded to trial, the prosecution submitted that the charge under section
                    377 should carry an imprisonment term above 5 years and the one under section
                    354A(1) should carry the prescribed minimum imprisonment term with caning. For
                    each of the three rape charges, the prosecution suggested that imprisonment for
                    15 years and 12 strokes of the cane would be appropriate and that two of these
                    imprisonment terms should be ordered to run consecutively.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     In mitigation, defence counsel submitted that
                    the accused was a simple-minded person earning a meagre income and contributing
                    to the family in his own small way. He was said not to be incorrigible. There
                    was no evidence of further drug abuse after 1995. It was also pointed out that
                    there was no evidence of loss of virginity. On this last point, the prosecution
                    countered that C1 had testified that she had never penetrated herself nor
                    allowed anyone else to do so. I accepted that the only one she had sex with
                    during the material time was the accused.</p>

<p class="Judg-1">I ordered the imprisonment terms for the section 377 charge and two of
                    the section 376(2) charges to run consecutively with effect from 30 April
                    2009 (date of arrest) with the other two imprisonment terms to run concurrently
                    with them. The total imprisonment term was therefore 29 years with effect from
                    30 April 2009. The accused is to be subject to a maximum of 24 strokes of
                    the cane. As stated at <a href="#p1_3">[3]</a> above, he was
                    granted a discharge amounting to an acquittal on the remaining four charges
                    pursuant to section 177 of the CPC (Cap 68).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     I also ordered that the computer seized from
                    the flat be returned to the accused’s family and that all other exhibits
                    be disposed of after any appeal has been dealt with by the Court of
                    Appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     The accused has appealed to the Court of
                    Appeal against both conviction and sentence.</p>
