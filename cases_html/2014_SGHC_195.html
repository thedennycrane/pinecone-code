        Choo Han Teck J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an appeal by the defendant/husband
                    against the order of the District Court made on 16 January 2014 granting
                    the plaintiff’s application to file a writ of summons for dissolution of
                    their marriage notwithstanding that three years have not lapsed since the date
                    of their marriage, namely 26 November 2012. Section 94(1) of the
                    Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) provides as follows:
                        ­</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Restriction on filing of writ for
                            divorce during first 3 years of marriage</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>94.</b>—(1) No writ for divorce shall be
                        filed in the court unless at the date of the filing of the writ 3 years have
                        passed since the date of the marriage;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    The court may, upon application being made in
                            accordance with the Rules of Court, allow a writ to be filed before 3
                            years have passed on the ground that the case is one of exceptional
                            hardship suffered by the plaintiff or of exceptional depravity on the
                            part of the defendant, but if it appears to the court at the hearing of
                            the proceedings that the plaintiff obtained leave to file the writ by
                            any misrepresentation or concealment of the nature of the case, the
                            court may, if it grants an interim judgment, do so subject to the
                            condition that no application to make the judgment final shall be made
                            until after the expiration of 3 years from the date of the marriage, or
                            may dismiss the proceedings without prejudice to any proceedings which
                            may be brought after the expiration of the said 3 years upon the same,
                            or substantially the same, facts as those proved in support of the
                            proceedings so dismissed;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3)    In determining any application under this section
                            for leave to file a writ before the expiration of 3 years from the date
                            of the marriage, the court shall have regard to the interest of any
                            child of the marriage and to be question whether there is reasonable
                            probability of a reconciliation between the parties before the
                            expiration of the said 3 years;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(4)    The court may, before determining an application
                            under this section, refer the differences between the parties to a
                            Conciliation Officer so that a reconciliation between the parties might
                            be effected; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(5)    Nothing in this section shall be deemed to
                            prohibit the filing of a writ based upon matters which have occurred
                            before the expiration of 3 years from the date of the
                        marriage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The plaintiff is 25 years old and the defendant
                    is 26. Nothing is stated in their affidavits as to their occupation and income,
                    save that the plaintiff works in the “IT industry” and the
                    defendant is a “dealer”. The parties had been seeing each other
                    for seven years prior to their marriage. The plaintiff says that she had been
                    intimate with the defendant since she was 17. They have no
                children.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The plaintiff applied to file a writ for the
                    dissolution of marriage on the ground of exceptional hardship. She produced a
                    psychiatric report from Dr Adrian Wang, dated 8 January 2014 in which
                    Dr Wang states that he had interviewed the plaintiff twice in 2013, and he
                    concluded that he diagnosed the plaintiff as suffering from “major
                    depressive disorder”. According to his report, “[the plaintiff]
                    fulfils all the diagnostic criteria for this illness. Of particular significance
                    are persistent sense of gloominess, loss of interest and pleasure, and lack of
                    drive and energy”. He also says that the defendant’s physical and
                    verbal aggression has been the main causative factor for the plaintiff’s
                    major depressive disorder.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The plaintiff also adduced a police report dated
                    25 December 2013 complaining about an incident in Korea on 5 January
                    2013 as well as an incident on 22 October 2013. She says that as a result
                    of these incidents, and the advice of her parents, she left the matrimonial home
                    on 15 November 2013. The two incidents complained of in the police report
                    concerned the allegations that the defendant punched her feet and her face in
                    the two respective dates. Ms Ng Pui Khim, counsel for the respondent, submitted
                    that there were at least six “particular occasions and numerous other
                    occasions” since 2007 that the defendant had abused the plaintiff. The
                    evidence of abuse does not support counsel’s submission in the number of
                    incidents. They were also disputed by the defendant in his version of events,
                    but more importantly, only two of the alleged incidents occurred during the
                    marriage. The plaintiff relied on incidents that happened many years before
                    their marriage in November 2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Although a police report was made, that report
                    was clearly made to serve the purpose of the plaintiff’s application. The
                    plaintiff left the matrimonial home in November 2013, lodged the police report
                    in December 2013, and filed the application (for leave to file the writ of
                    summons) in January 2014. No medical evidence was adduced. Furthermore, even
                    from the plaintiff’s account the two incidents did not result in serious
                    injury to her. She did not seek medical attention in either case. I will not
                    dwell on these incidents because they are disputed and should rightly be
                    considered at a full trial. However, assuming that the plaintiff’s version
                    were to be accepted for the purposes of this appeal, I am nonetheless of the
                    view that they do not constitute sufficient cause to bring the plaintiff’s
                    case within the ground of “exceptional hardship” in s 94(2)
                    of the Women’s Charter such as to warrant the grant of leave to file a
                    writ of summons for dissolution of marriage before the expiry of three years
                    from the date of marriage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The statutory moratorium of three years is to
                    impress upon married couples that marriage is not an event that one can sign in
                    and out as they fancy. In the meantime, there are alternative remedies and
                    relief in cases of abuse and they include applications for a personal protection
                    order. The aggrieved party may also leave the other party, as this plaintiff has
                    done. The moratorium is intended to hold out the hope of reconciliation –
                    and who is to say that even in extreme cases of abuse, the abuser may not see
                    the error of his or her ways and reconcile with the other?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       I am of the view that the circumstances of this
                    case do not meet the requirements in s 94 of the Women’s Charter. The
                    defendant’s appeal is therefore allowed. The order below is set aside. I
                    will not order costs in this case but in future, applications under similarly
                    inappropriate circumstances may be dismissed with costs against the
                    applicant.</p>
