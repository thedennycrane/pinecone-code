<strong>JUDGMENT:</strong>

</p>
<p xmlns=""><font color="#804040" face="Times New Roman"><strong>Gounds of Judgment</strong></font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Background facts</font></p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">1.    The plaintiffs are a

body corporate constituted under the Land Titles (Strata) Act (Cap.158) to manage and

maintain the common property of the strata title development known as Dormer Park

(‘the condominium’).</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">2.    The condominium was

developed and built by Hong Leong Holdings Ltd (‘the developer’). The 1<sup>st</sup>

defendants were the main contractors engaged by the developer to construct the

condominium. The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants were the nominated subcontractors for the

design, supply and installation of aluminium windows and glazing works

(‘works’). </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">3.    The 1<sup>st</sup>

and 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants jointly and severally executed a Deed of Indemnity dated 27

October 1997 (‘deed’) for the works in favour of the developer for a period of

10 years commencing from 13 April 1995, the date of issue of the completion certificate.

The deed was subsequently assigned to the plaintiffs under a deed of assignment dated 30

August 1999.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><b> </b></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Defects</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">4.    The plaintiffs

alleged that the works were defective for the following reasons:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(a) parts of the window frames in the

  condominium had faded and/or discoloured due to the defective powder coating; and</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(b) the window handles were faulty as they

  broke easily.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">5.    The plaintiffs’

solicitors wrote to the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants on 21 February 2000

giving them notice of the defects. They stated that legal action would be taken

immediately if these defects were not rectified within 14 days. The present action was

instituted on 5 April 2000 when the defendants failed to rectify the defects.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">6.    At the commencement

of the trial, I was informed that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendants had gone into liquidation.

The plaintiffs thus decided to proceed solely against the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">7.    After hearing

evidence on the disputed defects and the causes associated with them, I found that (a)

both the window handles and the powder coating of the window frames were indeed defective,

and (b) the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants were liable for these defects under the deed. In my

opinion, the defects were not caused by any act or omission of the plaintiffs, their

servants or agents. Neither were they the result of fair wear and tear. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">8.    The 2<sup>nd</sup>

defendants counterclaimed for rescission of the deed on the basis that it was given by

mistake. They contended that the deed was invalid and of no effect. At the trial, this

issue was not seriously canvassed. In my judgment, the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants’

counterclaim had no merit and I accordingly dismissed it.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">9.    I would not go into

the reasons for dismissing the counterclaim and my finding on the defects since the 2<sup>nd</sup>

defendants did not appeal. The plaintiffs however appealed against the dismissal of their

claim. I now give my reasons. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><b> </b></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Deed of Indemnity</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">10.    Central to my

decision was the construction of the deed, the relevant parts of which are as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">WHEREAS:</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">….</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">3.    The Contractor [1<sup>st</sup>

  fading, peeling, discolouration, watertightness or deterioration in the works to the

</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">THE CONTRACTOR AND THE SUB-CONTRACTOR

  the Recital hereinabove stated are true and accurate in all respects and this Indemnity

  shall have full force and effect notwithstanding any limitation or termination of the

  Contractor’s liability and/or responsibility under the Contract.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">2.    In the event of any deterioration or

  defects (as shall be determined by the Employer) in the workmanship, quality of materials,

  installation, watertightness or deterioration appearing in the works, <u>the Contractor

  (**) shall forthwith upon notice given to <b>either of them</b></u> and within such time

  as the Employer may direct, effect remedial works to the defective area or areas and shall

  make good to the absolute satisfaction of the Employer all damages to surface finishes

  including but not limited to plaster, panelling, tiling and other similar works,

  mechanical, electrical or other installations or other property arising directly or

  indirectly out of the said defects. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">3.    In the event that <u>remedial works

  undertaken by the Contractor <b>or the Sub-Contractor</b></u> prove ineffective as

  determined by the Employer whose decision shall be final and conclusive, or are not to the

  satisfaction of the Employer, <u>the Contractor <b>and the Sub-Contractor</b></u> shall

  effect such additional works in such a manner and within such time as the Employer may

  direct and shall carry out all test, as directed by the Employer until all the defects

  have been remedied to the absolute satisfaction of the Employer.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">4.    Should the Contractor or <u><b>the

  Sub-Contractor</b></u> fail to perform their obligations under Clause 2 and 3 above within

  a reasonable period, the Employer shall entitled to remedy the said defects and the

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">….</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">7.    The obligations of the Contractor and

  Sub-Contractor under this Indemnity are joint and several and the Employer shall be

  entitled to enforce the Indemnity against either the Contractor or the Sub-Contractor or

  both; any failure by either the Contractor or the Sub-Contractor to perform such

  obligations not excuse or discharge the other from performing the same.</font></p>

<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">This Indemnity shall be valid for the

<blockquote>
<p align="justify"> </p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Missing words</font></p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">11.    Plaintiffs’

counsel pointed out that the words "and the sub-contractor" (‘the missing

words’) were inadvertently left out of clause 2 at the location marked with a double

asterisk. The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants prepared the deed based on the standard form

provided by WT Partnership, the Quantity Surveyors and Construction Cost Consultants.

Present in that standard form were the missing words, from which an inference could be

drawn that they were inadvertently omitted. There was no evidence that the 2<sup>nd</sup>

defendants had intentionally left out the missing words when they copied the clauses

exactly from the standard form. I also found other glaring grammatical errors in clauses 4

and 7 where the words "be" and "shall" respectively were omitted but

were present in the standard form. They were probably the result of clerical errors.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">12.    The construction of

the deed clearly calls for the missing words to be read in. Otherwise the words <i>‘to

either of them’</i> will be otiose in the following part of clause 2:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"the Contractor (**) shall forthwith

  upon notice given <u>to either of them".</u></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">13.    Clause 3 states that

if the remedial works undertaken by either ‘<i>the Contractor or the Sub-Contractor

prove ineffective</i>’ [and I think it must be referring to the remedial works done

under clause 2], the contractor and subcontractor shall effect additional works as

directed by the employer. It is within the contemplation of clause 3 that the remedial

works in clause 2 can alternatively be performed by the subcontractor. If clause 2 were to

be construed as <b>not </b>placing any obligation to repair on the subcontractor at all,

then the words "<i>or the Sub-Contractor</i>" in the first two lines of clause 3

would be meaningless. This again supports the contention that those missing words should

have been there. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">14.    Being a joint and

several indemnity, it is not surprising that the deed places the same obligations on both

the contractor and subcontractor throughout. Consequently, it made sense to place the same

obligation on the subcontractor to perform the remedial work upon notice given to him in

clause 2.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">15.    However much I would

like to construe the deed strictly, I found that the deed must be read such that those

missing words are present. In my opinion, it was a clerical error made in copying from the

standard form.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">16.    In any event, this

was not material to the decision. On the facts, the plaintiffs had notified both the

contractor (i.e. 1<sup>st</sup> defendants) and the subcontractor (i.e. 2<sup>nd</sup>

defendants) of the defects. Neither of them did any remedial work. Being jointly and

severally liable, the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants would also be liable if the 1<sup>st</sup>

defendants failed to carry out the repairs. Under clause 4, the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants

would have to indemnify the present assignees of the deed for the cost of making good the

said defects, whether or not those missing words were read into the deed. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Was the deed an indemnity or a warranty</font></p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">17.    Plaintiffs’

counsel submitted that although the deed was titled "Indemnity for Aluminium and

Glazing Works" and the word "indemnify" was used at recital 3, nevertheless

in substance it was a warranty and not an indemnity. He contended that it was highly

unusual in the deed to indemnify the plaintiffs against defects. Counsel urged me to treat

it as a warranty.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">18.    I found it difficult

to construe the deed as a warranty when the deed itself had made it so explicit that it

was an indemnity. The words "indemnity" and "indemnify" were used no

less than 11 times in the 3 page deed. In contrast, the word "warranty" never

appeared.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">19.    On examination of

the terms of the deed, I found that the substance of the deed was also in the nature of an

indemnity, which was entirely consistent with the title given. Under clause 4, should the

contractor or the subcontractor fail to perform their obligations under clauses 2 and 3,

the employer shall be entitled to claim reimbursement from the contractor and

subcontractor of all its costs and expenses for making good the defects, including the

legal costs for enforcing clause 4 on a ‘Solicitor and Client’ basis.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">20.    I therefore

concluded that on a true construction, it was a Deed of Indemnity and not a Deed of

Warranty.</font><i><b></b></i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Separate and Distinct Obligations </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">21.    Plaintiffs’

counsel submitted that clauses 2, 3 and 4 were separate and distinct. There was no basis

to suppose that ‘and’ was to be added at the end of clauses 2 and 3 when they

end with a full stop. Thus the clauses must be read disjunctively and not conjunctively.

Accordingly, any failure or refusal of the 1<sup>st</sup> or 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants to

perform their obligations to remedy the defects under clause 2 of the deed immediately

gave rise to a cause of action and a claim for damages against the two defendants.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">22.    The plaintiffs’

claim here was based entirely on a breach of the express terms of the deed. The breach

stemmed from the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants refusal to take any steps to

rectify or replace the discoloured window frames and window latches within the 14 days

stipulated by the plaintiffs in their notice to them dated 21 February 2000. It was not

disputed that both defendants were served notice of the defects in accordance with clause

2 of the deed.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">23.    In the course of the

trial, the plaintiffs clarified that they were not relying on any breach of clause 4 of

the deed, which they said gave them an additional right against the defendants but did not

take away their remedies for breach of either clause 2 or 3.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">24.    Since the plaintiffs

had not done any remedial works themselves, they accepted that they could not claim any

reimbursement under clause 4 simply because no costs and expenses for remedial works were

incurred as yet. However, they maintained that they could still claim damages (to be

subsequently assessed) for breach of clause 2 of the deed at this moment without resorting

to clause 4.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">25.    It was argued that

if the remedy for clauses 2 and 3 were to be limited to clause 4, then it was tantamount

to having an exemption clause restricting the liability of the defendants. As the deed had

to be construed strictly and since there were no clear words taking away the rights of the

plaintiffs, it was submitted that the said clauses of the deed were not to be construed as

being restricted in this manner.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><i><b> </b></i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Construction of the terms of the Deed of

Indemnity</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">26.    Defendants’

counsel argued that until the plaintiffs had paid for remedial works, the issue of

reimbursement under clause 4 did not arise. The nature of the indemnity under the deed is

an indemnity against payment.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">27.    I substantially

agreed with the submissions of counsel for the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants that clauses 2, 3

and 4 have to be read together. These three clauses are interrelated and are

interdependent. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">28.    When defects arise,

the plaintiffs cannot simply sue for damages under the deed. First the plaintiffs (as the

assignees of the employer) must give notice to either the contractor or subcontractor who

will then have to remedy the defects forthwith as provided for in clause 2. The manner of

rectification is left to the contractor or subcontractor as the case may be. If the

rectification proves ineffective, then the contractor and subcontractor will have no

alternative but to effect additional works in the manner as directed by the plaintiffs

under clause 3. But at least, they still have the opportunity to carry out the remedial

works although they now have to comply with the directions and instructions of the

plaintiffs. This appears logical to me because the contractor and subcontractor have been

unsuccessful earlier with their own methods. Clause 4 stipulates clearly what is to happen

if the contractor or subcontractor fails to perform any of their obligations under clauses

2 and 3. The plaintiffs shall be entitled thereafter to remedy the defects and

subsequently claim reimbursement (plus all legal costs of enforcement) from them. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">29.    Clause 4 is thus the

machinery by which the indemnity under the deed is to operate for any breach of clause 2

or 3. The plaintiffs should not be allowed to circumvent the deed of indemnity by suing

for damages for breach of clause 2 or 3 <i>per se</i> as if the deed were a warranty.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">30.    In this deed, the

contractor and subcontractor had volunteered to subject themselves only to an indemnity

and no more, provided that they are allowed the right to do the remedial works themselves

first. The entire mechanism or the mode of indemnity is very clear. Only if they for some

reason are unable to remedy the defects or they fail to do so, then the plaintiffs have

the right to claim an indemnity for the costs of rectification, which can either be done

by the plaintiffs themselves or by another third party contractor. This was the manner

agreed to by the contractor and subcontractor by which their risks under the indemnity

were to be distributed or allocated.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">31.    Unlike a claim for

damages which can be at large, the amount payable under the indemnity has been explicitly

limited to the costs of making good the defects plus legal costs on an indemnity basis.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">32.    Since the plaintiffs

have not expended any monies to remedy the defects, they cannot claim any reimbursement

under the deed of indemnity as yet. The plaintiffs’ claim under the indemnity is thus

entirely premature and their action has not yet accrued against the 1<sup>st</sup> or 2<sup>nd</sup>

defendants. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">33.    A few more scenarios

to test the operation of clauses 2, 3 and 4 will make it reasonably obvious that the

clauses operate together. If the subcontractor were to carry out some repairs under clause

2, which prove ineffective, can the plaintiffs immediately sue for damages? If indeed each

is a separate and distinct clause breach of which gives rise to damages, then the

plaintiffs will be able to sue for damages immediately without clause 3 coming into play.

I do not think that is a fair construction of the deed. I hold the view that the

contractor or subcontractor must still be given the chance to remedy the defects again

under clause 3, although this time they have to follow the plaintiffs’ instructions

on the manner of rectification. It is only after the contractor or subcontractor has

exhausted all avenues available that they become liable to indemnify the plaintiffs in the

manner provided under clause 4.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">34.    Similarly, if one

stretches the argument of plaintiffs’ counsel, it will appear that recital 3 and

clause 1 read together permits the plaintiffs to sue for damages the moment defects arise

regardless whether the contractor and subcontractor have been given the chance to remedy

the defects at their own expense first. I think that is a wrong construction of the terms

of the deed.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">35.    The fact that

reimbursement of legal costs on a ‘Solicitor and Client’ basis is provided for

only in clause 4 suggests that the sole remedy for breach of clauses 2 and 3 resides in

clause 4. At the trial, I asked plaintiffs’ counsel what sort of legal costs would

the plaintiffs be entitled to for a successful claim based on a breach of clause 2 alone.

He submitted that it would only be ‘party and party’ costs. To my mind, that

seems incongruous having regard to the entire scheme of the deed of indemnity. It must be

contemplated that there shall be full indemnity from the contractor or subcontractor with

regard to all the legal costs of enforcement on a ‘Solicitor and Client’ basis,

which I shall interpret as an indemnity basis. Since this is provided for only under

clause 4, which explicitly refers to the contractor’s or subcontractor’s failure

to perform under clauses 2 and 3, I arrive at the inescapable conclusion that clauses 2, 3

and 4 work together as a whole, and not independently as contended by plaintiffs’

counsel. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><b> </b></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Orders made</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">36.    Accordingly, I

dismissed the plaintiffs’ claim because no cause of action has arisen as yet. Their

claim is premature. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">37.    During the course of

the proceedings, I was informed that the plaintiffs did not have sufficient funds and

hence, could not pay for the remedial works and thereafter claim reimbursement under

clause 4. On the other hand, the managing director of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants

offered to do the remedial work. Under the circumstances, it is in the interest of both

parties that I make clear that my decision is without prejudice to the 2<sup>nd</sup>

defendants remedying the defects under clause 2 if they so wish, failing which the

plaintiffs may rely on clause 3 and perhaps even clause 4 eventually, whereupon the 2<sup>nd</sup>

defendants will be liable to fully indemnify the plaintiffs for all the costs of the
