        Woo Bih Li J:</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This
dispute is between the current and previous master tenants of a state-owned
plot of land at the former Bukit Timah Turf Club at 200 Turf Club
Road Singapore 287994 (“the Site”). The current master tenant of
the Site alleges that the previous master tenant conspired with
others to injure it in the period leading up to the handover of
the Site.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Site</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The
landlord of the Site is the Government of the Republic of Singapore
(“the Government”). The Government was, at the relevant time, acting
through the Singapore Land Authority (“SLA”). It is not necessary for
present purposes to draw a distinction between the Government and SLA.
I will henceforth make reference only to SLA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The
Site is one of the subdivided plots that make up the former Bukit Timah
Turf Club. The approximate area of the Site is 178,762m<sup>2</sup> (about 1,923,837ft<sup>2</sup>).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> It
comprises a two-storey car park and a grandstand. The car park was
converted for use as a car mart. It was made up of 137 showroom units
with attached offices.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> The units
were sub-tenanted or licensed to second-hand car dealers. The grandstand
was converted for use as a retail block. It was made up of about
94 retail units.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> The units
were sub-tenanted or licensed to shops, restaurants and other businesses.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The parties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       There
are various parties and witnesses. To minimise confusion, I will abbreviate
the names of corporations and refer to the names of persons in full.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The
plaintiffs are part of the Cogent group. The second plaintiff, Cogent
Land Capital Pte Ltd (“Cogent Land”) is, and has been, the master tenant
of the Site since 1 March 2012. It is responsible for the management and
maintenance of the Site. The first plaintiff, SH Cogent Logistics
Pte Ltd (“SH Cogent”), was the entity that bid for the tenancy which
Cogent Land currently holds. When the tenancy was awarded to SH
Cogent, Cogent Land was incorporated for the purpose of entering
into the tenancy with SLA. Cogent Land is wholly-owned by SH Cogent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The
first defendant, Singapore Agro Agricultural Pte Ltd (“SAA”) was the
previous master tenant of the former Turf Club plot. It became the master
tenant in 2001. During SAA’s term as master tenant, the former Bukit
Timah Turf Club plot was subdivided into smaller plots, one of which is
the Site (the other plots are not material for present purposes).
SAA’s tenancy expired on 29 February 2012, the day before Cogent
Land’s tenancy commenced. The third defendant, Turf City Management
Pte Ltd (“TCM”) was responsible for the management and maintenance
of the Site. The second defendant, Tan Chee Beng, said he was the
“real decision-maker” in SAA<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>.
Tan Chee Beng was a majority shareholder and one of two directors of
SAA (the other, Tan Bee Bee, was his sister) at the material time.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> He
was also a shareholder and a director of TCM at the material time.
The fourth defendant, Koh Khong Meng, also known as Roger Koh, was
a shareholder and a director of TCM at the material time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Assuming
that there was a conspiracy, Cogent Land, the current master tenant,
would presumably have been the entity that suffered the loss, if
any, caused by the conspiracy. TCM would presumably have been the entity
which executed the acts pursuant to the conspiracy. SAA and TCM would
also presumably have been acting in accordance with the instructions
and the intention of Tan Chee Beng, Roger Koh, or both. They were
directors of one or both companies at the material time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The
parties, however, have not attempted to distinguish the various entities
and persons in their pleadings and submissions. Further, none of the
defendants sought to distance himself or itself from the intention
or conduct of any of the others. Therefore, for the sake of convenience,
I will make reference to “the Plaintiffs” and “the Defendants” instead
of the individual entities and persons, unless it is appropriate
to refer to an individual entity or person.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The cases of the parties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The
Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants conspired to injure the Plaintiffs
by damaging their business of sub-tenanting and licensing the units
as the subsequent master tenant of the Site. The Defendants did
so by preventing the Plaintiffs from hitting the ground running
when the Plaintiffs took over the Site from the Defendants. The
Defendants did this in two ways.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     First,
the Defendants removed electrical fittings, utilities equipment and
structures while carrying out reinstatement work at the Site prior
to the handover. The Plaintiffs complain, in particular, of the
Defendants’ deliberate removal of 18 items (these items are listed
in the annexure to this judgment, and I shall refer to them collectively
as “the 18 Items”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> The Defendants
accept that they removed five of the 18 Items, but dispute having
removed the rest. The Plaintiffs allege that they had to incur expense and
time to replace these removed items.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Second,
the Defendants obstructed existing sub-tenants and licensees at
the Site from continuing with their sub-tenancies and licences under
the Plaintiffs. This obstruction was the cumulative result of two
acts of the Defendants:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_a"></a>(a)     The
Defendants created an air of uncertainty and anxiety which caused
then-existing sub-tenants and licensees to leave the Site. The Defendants
sent letters to the sub-tenants and licensees insisting that all
of them (even those that were prepared to consider entering into new
agreements with the Plaintiffs) vacate their units by 31 January 2012.
This was disruptive to the businesses of those sub-tenants and licensees
who intended to continue under the Plaintiffs as they would have
to vacate their units for a month or more before returning when the
Plaintiffs’ tenancy commenced on 1 March 2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
Defendants deliberately stopped supplying utilities and waste-disposal
services at the Site between 31 January 2012 and 29 February 2012,
even though there were sub-tenants and licensees still occupying
units at the Site.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">According to the Plaintiffs, many sub-tenants and licensees
left because of the Defendants’ acts. The Defendants’ acts foiled
the Plaintiffs’ attempts at persuading these sub-tenants and licensees
to continue under the Plaintiffs, leading to loss of income from
rent and licence fees.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The
Defendants deny intending to cause damage to the Plaintiffs. The Defendants
say that their position and actions were motivated by their desire
to comply with obligations owed to SLA under their tenancy, and
the Urban Redevelopment Authority (“URA”) under certain regulations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     On
20 January 2012, the Plaintiffs obtained an injunction (“the Injunction”)
restraining the Defendants from carrying out reinstatement work
at the Site and from acting in a manner prejudicial to the sub-tenants and
licensees who remained at the Site. The Defendants applied to discharge
the Injunction on 20 February 2012, and it was discharged on 24 February
2012. In the present action, the Defendants counterclaim for damages
against the Plaintiffs for obtaining the Injunction wrongly.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The law on conspiracy</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     I
will touch on the law on conspiracy in brief before stating the
issues that arise in this case. As a preliminary point, the Singapore
Court of Appeal in <em>EFT Holdings, Inc and another
v Marineteknik Shipbuilders (S) Pte Ltd and another</em> [2014]
1 SLR 860 at [90] questioned whether the tort of conspiracy should
even continue to be part of the law of Singapore. The Court of Appeal
eventually refrained from deciding the point.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     I
recognise the force in the argument that the tort of conspiracy appears
to be an aberration in the common law. It is difficult to explain
why an act, when committed pursuant to an agreement between a number
of persons triggers liability, while the very same act, when committed
by one person alone does not. However, I do not think that it is
for the High Court to say that the tort of conspiracy should no
longer apply.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In <em>Lonrho Ltd v Shell Petroleum Co Ltd (No 2)</em> [1982]
AC 173 at 188, Lord Diplock (whose speech the rest of the House
of Lords agreed with) expressed dissatisfaction at the rationale
underlying the tort of conspiracy. Lord Diplock nonetheless held
that the tort was too well-established for it to be discarded. If
the tort of conspiracy is abolished, the lacuna could possibly be
filled by a widening of the unlawful interference tort coupled with
joint tortfeasorship. But as these issues do not arise for consideration,
I shall say no more.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     I
turn now to the law on conspiracy proper. The essence of conspiracy is
an agreement between two or more persons to act in a manner that
is intended to, and does injure another. There are two branches
to the tort of conspiracy. The first, where the acts committed pursuant
to the conspiracy are lawful. The second, where the acts committed
pursuant to the conspiracy are unlawful. I will refer to the former
as “lawful means conspiracy” and the latter as “unlawful means conspiracy”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The
elements of the tort of conspiracy were set out in <em>Nagase Singapore
Pte Ltd v Ching Kai Huat and others</em> [2008] 1 SLR(R) 80
at [23]:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_a"></a>(a)     an
agreement between two or more persons to do certain acts;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_b"></a>(b)     if
the conspiracy involves:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_18-p2_b-p3_i"></a>(i)       
              <em>unlawful</em> means, the conspirators
must have <em>intended</em> to cause damage
to the claimant;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_18-p2_b-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       
              <em>lawful</em> means, then the conspirators
must additionally have had the <em>predominant
purpose</em> of causing damage to the claimant;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_c"></a>(c)     the
acts must have actually been performed in furtherance of the agreement;
and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_d"></a>(d)     damage
must have been suffered by the claimant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The
elements of the two forms of conspiracy are therefore similar, save
for one distinction: the mental element is less stringent where
unlawful means, as opposed to lawful means, are employed pursuant
to the conspiracy.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The
Plaintiffs’ claim in conspiracy raises four issues:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether
the Defendants committed acts pursuant to an agreement between themselves;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_b"></a>(b)     whether
the Defendants’ predominant purpose (or intention) was to cause
damage to the Plaintiffs;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_c"></a>(c)     whether
the Defendants employed unlawful means; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_d"></a>(d)     whether
the Plaintiffs suffered damage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">If it is found that the Defendants’ predominant purpose was
to cause damage to the Plaintiffs, then the issue of unlawful means
becomes academic.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The
Defendants’ counterclaim raises a single issue: whether the Injunction
was wrongly obtained such that the Defendants should be entitled
to damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The facts</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Extension Tenancy</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     SAA
became the master tenant of the site in 2001. Its tenancy of the Site
was due to expire on 31 August 2011. In a letter dated 12 March
2011, SAA wrote to SLA requesting an extension of the tenancy to
29 February 2012.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The
thrust of SAA’s proposal to SLA was that the extension would be <em>beneficial for the sub-tenants and licensees</em>.
SAA stated that the sub-tenants and licensees would prefer to move
out after the Chinese New Year of 2012, which fell on 23 and 24 January
2012. An extension of the tenancy to 29 February 2012 would give
the sub-tenants and licensees three to four weeks to reinstate their
units after Chinese New Year, before returning the units to SAA.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> Further,
the expiry date of the then-existing tenancy (31 August 2011) coincided
with the seventh month of the lunar calendar. The seventh month
was an inauspicious period for the sub-tenants and licensees to
vacate their units. SAA also stated that the children’s education vendors
which occupied the Site would benefit from being able to conduct classes
till the end of the calendar year in 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In
a letter dated 3 June 2011, SLA wrote to SAA agreeing to the extension.
SAA’s final tenancy with SLA, extended up to 29 February 2012, will
be referred to as “the Extension Tenancy”. In the letter, SLA stressed that
the purpose of the Extension Tenancy was to “facilitate the relocation of
businesses to alternative premises” and to allow more time for SAA
“to complete all the requisite reinstatement works in a satisfactory
manner prior to handing over”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The tender for the new tenancy
of the Site</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In
June and July 2011, SLA launched a tender for the new tenancy of the
Site. This tenancy was to commence on 1 March 2012, immediately after
the Extension Tenancy expired on 29 February 2012. 12 bids were received.
SH Cogent and SAA were among the bidders. SH Cogent’s bid was the
highest, at a monthly rental rate of $1,065,678 per month. SAA’s
bid was the fourth-highest, at $718,888 per month.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     SLA
disclosed the identity of the bidders and their respective bids
to the public shortly after the bidding had closed in July 2011.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> SLA did not, however, award
the new tenancy to any of the bidders at that point in time. The
award of the new tenancy by SLA was only to be done on 10 October 2011.
There was therefore a period of approximately four months between the
date the bidders and their bid amounts became public information,
and SLA’s eventual award of the new tenancy. Tan Chee Beng said
he knew that SAA did not have a realistic chance of being awarded
the tenancy once the identity of the bidders and their respective
bids were disclosed, because SAA was only the fourth-highest bidder.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In
August 2011, SAA entered into extension agreements with the sub-tenants
and licensees at the Site. This was because the then-existing agreements
were made on the basis that SAA’s own tenancy would expire on 31 August
2011. The sub-tenancies and licences were extended up to 31 January
2012, with an option for a further extension to 29 February 2012,
conditional on SAA being awarded the new tenancy which commenced
1 March 2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     On
10 October 2011, SLA awarded the new tenancy of the Site to SH Cogent.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Defendants’ reinstatement
work and letters to sub-tenants and licensees</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     On
1 November 2011, SAA sent a letter to its sub-tenants and licensees.
SAA stated that their sub-tenancies and licences would expire on 31 January
2012, and that the reinstatement work for their respective units was
to be completed by that date.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     On
3 November 2011, Benson Tan and Yap Chee Sing conducted an inspection
of the Site. At the material time, Benson Tan was the deputy chief
executive officer of SH Cogent and a director of Cogent Land. Yap Chee
Sing was the general manager of SH Cogent and a director of Cogent Land.
Both were involved in the preparation for the taking-over of the
Site on behalf the Plaintiffs. They were also the Plaintiffs’ principal
witnesses at the trial. At this inspection, Benson Tan and Yap Chee
Sing were accompanied by two SLA officers. Benson Tan and Yap Chee
Sing claimed that they noticed parts of the main grandstand being
removed by workers.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Benson
Tan and Yap Chee Sing met with Ong Ah Sui, TCM’s chief security
officer, after the inspection was completed. Benson Tan and Yap Chee
Sing alleged that Ong Ah Sui told them that Roger Koh wanted to meet
with them. Ong Ah Sui also purportedly informed them that Roger Koh
had threatened to dismantle all the fixtures and fittings at the
Site unless the Plaintiffs paid the Defendants $3m.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     On
8 November 2011, Yap Chee Sing emailed SLA. He raised concerns about
SAA’s reinstatement work.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> He also stated that the sub-tenants
and licensees who wanted to continue under the Plaintiffs were concerned
about having to vacate their premises on 31 January 2012 and to return
only on 1 March 2012. This would result in the sub-tenants having to
stop their businesses for effectively two to three months. Yap Chee
Sing stated that unless the continuity of these sub-tenants’ and
licensees’ businesses was preserved, most of them would look for
alternative locations and not continue under the Plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     On
29 November 2011, SLA sent a letter to SAA. The letter stressed that
the very basis for the extension of SAA’s tenancy to 29 February
2012 was to “minimise the disruption to existing businesses”. SLA
stated that sub-tenants and licensees had given feedback that they
were being required to vacate the Site on or before 31 January 2012,
even though they were negotiating with the next master tenant to
remain on-site. SLA indicated that SAA was to take necessary steps
to facilitate the continued stay of interested sub-tenants and occupants
beyond 31 January 2012.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Benson
Tan conducted another inspection of the Site on 30 November 2011.
He stated that he witnessed workers using a blowtorch to dismantle
the metal deck flooring on the fifth level of the grandstand (“the
Metal Deck Flooring”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> The Metal Deck Flooring
was a structure which increased the useable floor area on the fifth
level of the grandstand. Yap Chee Sing wrote an email to SLA on
the same day complaining of this incident.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     On
1 December 2011, Benson Tan and Yap Chee Sing met up with Tan Chee
Beng and Roger Koh. The meeting concerned the Defendants’ reinstatement
work and their requirement that the sub-tenants and licensees to
vacate their units by 31 January 2012. Benson Tan and Yap Chee Sing
made a concealed audio recording of this meeting. There was disagreement
as to the effect or implication of what was said at this meeting. The
Plaintiffs claim that the Defendants were extorting or seeking a
corrupt payment from the Plaintiffs so that the Defendants would
stop their disruptive conduct. The Defendants claim that they were
merely seeking a “commercial resolution” to the problem.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     On
the same day, SAA sent out another letter to the sub-tenants and licensees.
This was the second letter that SAA had addressed to the sub-tenants
and licensees (the first is mentioned at [29] above). SAA reminded them
of the obligation to hand over their units to SAA by 31 January 2012.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     On
the other hand, SLA reiterated its position to SAA that business continuity
was of paramount importance. In letters dated 2, 6 and 16 December
2011, and 4 January 2012, SLA requested that SAA assist sub-tenants
and licensees who had arrangements with the incoming master tenant,
so as to minimise business disruption, and also stated that reinstatement
work need not be carried out at certain areas at the Site. I refer
to the five letters from SLA to SAA—dated 29 November 2011 (at [33] above),
2, 6 and 16 December 2011, and 4 January 2012—collectively as “the
Five SLA Letters”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     SAA,
however, wrote a third, more aggressively-worded letter to the sub-tenants
and licensees on 4 January 2012.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> The letter reminded the sub-tenants
and licensees that their agreements with SAA would expire on 31 January
2012. It also stated the consequences that would follow if their units
were not vacated by then.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     On
9 January 2012, SAA wrote to SLA. In that letter, it mentioned for the
first time that it was carrying out reinstatement work at the Site pursuant
to regulatory requirements imposed by URA.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The undertaking from SLA to
SAA and continued reinstatement work</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     On
11 January 2012, SLA held a press conference concerning the problems
at the Site. SLA also wrote to SAA on the same day, reiterating that
SAA was not required to carry out reinstatement work on units where sub-tenants
or licensees would continue operating beyond 29 February 2012. SLA
further undertook not to hold SAA “liable for loss or damage which
may be caused by the retention of the Works on [the Site]”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> SLA granted
the undertaking to SAA only because SH Cogent had agreed to grant
a cross-undertaking to SLA. In the cross-undertaking, SH Cogent undertook
a number of obligations, one of which was to indemnify SLA against
any liability or loss arising from a breach of SH Cogent’s undertakings
to SLA.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Notwithstanding
SLA’s undertaking, SAA wrote to URA on 16 January 2012 stating that
it was removing temporary structures in compliance with URA’s directions
and in reliance on SAA’s consultants’ advice.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     In
an email to SLA dated 17 January 2012, Yap Chee Sing stated that SAA
was still engaging in reinstatement work.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> He
appended pictures which he had taken of such work being carried
out at the Site.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     SLA
wrote to SAA on 20 January 2012.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> The
letter appended a list of reinstatement work that SLA required SAA
to perform. This list revised a previous list that SLA had sent
to SAA on 20 June 2011 by reducing the scope of reinstatement work
which SLA required SAA to perform.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Injunction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The
Plaintiffs sought and obtained the Injunction on 20 January 2012. The
Injunction restrained the Defendants from: carrying out reinstatement work;
demanding that present sub-tenants or licensees carry out reinstatement
work; and evicting any of the sub-tenants or licensees, or impeding
the sub-tenants’ or licensees’ access to, use and enjoyment of the Site.
The Injunction also specifically prohibited the Defendants from ceasing
the supply of utilities at the Site, such as power, water and communication
lines, up till and including 29 February 2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Despite
the Injunction, SLA officers observed that items had been removed
from the main grandstand building and car park at site inspections
conducted on 25 January 2012 and 31 January 2012. The removed items
included partitions, glass enclosures, air-conditioning diffusers,
lighting and floor, wall and ceiling finishes. Electrical wires
had also been cut.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     SLA
wrote to SAA on 1 February 2012 placing on record these observations.
The letter stated that SAA’s reinstatement work amounted to a failure
to comply with SLA’s instructions.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     SLA
also wrote another letter to SAA on 1 February 2012 stating that the
lighting in the common areas had been switched off, and that there
was improper disposal of waste at the Site. SLA stressed that this
created health and safety concerns.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> SLA wrote again on 2 February
2012 stating that their officers had inspected the site on the afternoon
of 1 February 2012, and observed that the lighting remained switched
off and that the waste was still not properly disposed of.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     On
10 February 2012, URA replied to SAA’s letter of 16 January 2012 (see
[41] above). URA stated that it “will not require … existing additions and
alterations erected to be demolished at this juncture”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The
Defendants subsequently applied to discharge the Injunction. They
succeeded in doing so. The Injunction was discharged on 24 February 2012.
SLA wrote to SAA on that day acknowledging the discharge of the Injunction.
SLA nonetheless urged SAA to take a reasonable approach, and to
facilitate a smooth transition for businesses continuing to operate
at the Site.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> The letter also reiterated
SAA’s obligations under the Extension Tenancy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The
Defendants returned possession of the Site to SLA on 29 February
2012. The Plaintiffs took over possession of the Site the following
day, on 1 March 2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the Defendants committed
acts pursuant to an agreement between themselves</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Conspiracies
are usually conceived of in private. The agreement between the conspirators
is usually tacit. Courts have thus inferred the existence of an
agreement from the conspirators’ acts (<em>OCM
Opportunities Fund II, LP v Burhan Uray</em> [2004] SGHC 115
at [47]). It has also been held that a company can, together with
its controlling director, be liable for the tort of conspiracy (<em>Visionhealthone Corp Pte Ltd v HD Holdings Pte Ltd
and others and another appeal</em> [2013] SGCA 47 at [39]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     On
the facts before me, this was not just a case of SAA acting only through
its controlling director, Tan Chee Beng. The Defendants did not dispute
that TCM and Roger Koh were parties to what SAA and Tan Chee Beng
were trying to do.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The
first issue is whether Tan Chee Beng, Roger Koh, SAA and TCM had
agreed to, and actually did, carry out reinstatement work at the
Site and cause the sub-tenants and licensees to vacate their units
by 31 January 2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Tan
Chee Beng was a majority shareholder and director in both SAA and
TCM. Roger Koh was a shareholder and director in TCM. SAA was the master
tenant; it had signed the sub-tenancies and licences with the occupants
of the various units at the Site. TCM was in charge of managing the
Site. In the light of the relationship between the parties and the undisputed
facts, it is clear that the Defendants had agreed to implement reinstatement
work at the Site and to cause the sub-tenants and licensees to leave
by 31 January 2012. It is also clear that the Defendants had carried
out acts pursuant to this agreement. Indeed, the Defendants did
not seriously dispute these allegations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     The
crux of the dispute was whether the Defendants’ predominant purpose
(or intention) was to injure the Plaintiffs. The Defendants also disputed
the extent of the acts which the Plaintiffs allege were carried
out pursuant to the conspiracy, if any. I will address the second
point later on. I turn first to the crucial question of the mental
element behind the Defendants’ agreement and the acts committed
pursuant to that agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the Defendants’ predominant
purpose (or intention) was to injure the Plaintiffs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     In
most cases of conspiracy, it is difficult to prove that the conspirators
intended to cause damage to a claimant because the acts committed
pursuant to the conspiracy usually also benefit the conspirators. One
shades into the other. It is often not clear where to draw the line between
when the conspirators intended to benefit themselves and when they
intended to cause damage to the claimant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     That
difficulty does not arise here. Rather, it is quite the opposite.
It would not have been in the Defendants’ commercial interest to
require sub-tenants and licensees who wanted to continue under the
Plaintiffs to vacate their units by 31 January 2012. The Defendants
would have earned an additional month’s rent for February 2012 if
they were prepared to allow those sub-tenants and licensees to continue
till 29 February 2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     It
would also not have been in the Defendants’ commercial interest
to engage in reinstatement work which SLA had informed them was unnecessary.
The Defendants would have incurred expense in doing so. The Defendants
would also have put themselves at risk of legal liability to SLA
for breach of contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Clause 9.1.1
of the Extension Tenancy stated that “all renovations, repairs and
authorised alterations, additions and structural changes shall remain
the property of the Landlord”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> Further, cll 7.3 and 9.5.2
of the Extension Tenancy stipulated that SAA was to carry out reinstatement work
only “if so required by [SLA]”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> Clause 9 of Appendix A-1
to the Extension Tenancy stated that SAA was not allowed to demolish
existing structures at the Site without the written consent of SLA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     The
scope of reinstatement work that SAA was required, or indeed, <em>permitted</em> to undertake under the Extension
Tenancy was subject to the instructions of SLA. This was not a situation
where the Defendants were entitled to deal freely with the additions
and alterations on the Site because they had renovated the grandstand
and the car park and converted them to retail use. The Defendants
were contractually constrained to comply with SLA’s instructions
on what, if any, and how much was to be removed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     SLA’s
instructions to SAA in letters dated 20 June 2011,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> 2 December
2011,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> 4 January 2012<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> and
20 January 2012<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> had significantly reduced the
scope of reinstatement work that SLA required of SAA. The Defendants
did not contest the Plaintiffs’ allegation that the five of the
18 Items (which the Defendants agreed that they had removed) were removed
in contravention of SLA’s instructions. In fact, Tan Chee Beng admitted
in cross-examination that by removing electrical cables, pipes, fittings,
the fire safety system and the fire protection system, SAA did not comply
with SLA’s instructions, and accordingly, with SAA’s obligations under
the Extension Tenancy.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Yet
the Defendants were unrelenting in both requiring sub-tenants and
licensees to vacate by 31 January 2012, and the reinstatement work.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     The
Defendants’ explanation for requiring sub-tenants and licensees to
vacate by 31 January 2012 was that they wanted a one-month buffer between
the handover of the units from the sub-tenants and licensees to SAA,
and the handover of the Site from SAA to SLA on 29 February 2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     The
Defendants’ explanation for engaging in reinstatement work was that
they believed that they were obliged to do so because of the lapse
of a written permission dated 19 August 2010 (“the 2010 WP”) issued
by URA. They maintain that the obligations under the 2010 WP existed independently
from the any contractual obligations which SAA may have owed to
SLA under the Extension Tenancy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     I
do not accept these explanations. In my view, the Defendants’ acts were
motivated by a predominant purpose to cause damage to the Plaintiffs.
I make this finding for three reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     First,
the transcripts of the meeting of 1 December 2011 (see [35] above)
showed that the Defendants threatened to injure the Plaintiffs <em>unless</em> the Plaintiffs were willing to
provide the Defendants with adequate compensation. Second, the Defendants’
persistent pressure on sub-tenants and licensees to vacate by 31 January
2012 was done against SLA’s express requests to facilitate a smooth
transition for those persons. Third, the Defendants did not genuinely
believe that they were legally obliged to carry out reinstatement
work under the 2010 WP.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Proof
of conspiracy and the requisite mental element will normally be inferred
from objective facts (<em>Asian Corporate Services
(SEA) Pte Ltd v Eastwest Management Ltd (Singapore Branch)</em> [2006]
1 SLR(R) 901 at [19]). The three reasons mentioned above are derived
from objective facts which, in my view, lead to the inexorable conclusion
that the Defendants’ predominant purpose was to cause damage to
the Plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The meeting of 1 December 2011</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     The
meeting of 1 December 2011 was between Benson Tan and Yap Chee Sing
of the Plaintiffs, and Tan Chee Beng and Roger Koh of the Defendants.
It was secretly recorded by Benson Tan and Yap Chee Sing, and subsequently
translated into English (the conversation was a mixture of Mandarin
and Hokkien interspersed with English) and transcribed by the Plaintiffs.
Parties agreed to the accuracy of the transcript, save for some minor
amendments made by Tan Chee Beng.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span> The amendments are immaterial, and
any reference to or excerpts from the transcript are from the amended
version.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     In
my view, what transpired at the meeting cast the Defendants’ intentions
into sharp relief. The message Tan Chee Beng and Roger Koh conveyed
to Benson Tan and Yap Chee Sing at that meeting was a straightforward
one: pay the Defendants a sum of money or the Defendants will continue
with their systematic reinstatement of the Site and eviction of the
sub-tenants and licensees. While none of the statements were phrased in
explicit terms, it is clear from the entire conversation on 1 December 2011
that the Defendants were making thinly-veiled threats.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     Below
are extracts quoted <em>verbatim</em> from
the transcript of the meeting which illustrate the point. In the
portions of the conversation quoted, Benson Tan was expressing his
concern about the reinstatement work and the letter dated 1 November
2011 which SAA had sent to the sub-tenants and licensees. This was
the first letter SAA sent to remind these occupants of their obligation
to vacate their units by 31 January 2012. In the meeting, Tan Chee
Beng was warning the Plaintiffs that unless the Defendants were compensated,
the Defendants would follow up with a second and a third letter
to the sub-tenants and licensees along similar lines as the first
letter. Tan Chee Beng alluded to a three-month fitting-out period
which SLA gave to the incoming master tenant. Tan Chee Beng’s point
was that if the Plaintiffs hit the ground running, they would be
able to earn rent for that three-month fitting-out period. The quantum
of compensation which the Defendants wanted was based on this three-month
fitting-out period.</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     It
is clear to me that Tan Chee Beng wanted compensation to stop doing
what was not in the <em>bona fide</em> interest
of the Defendants to do in the first place. If no such compensation
was forthcoming, the Defendants would continue “the system” of reinstatement
work and eviction of the sub-tenants and licensees.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     The
Defendants were aware that continuing with “the system” would derail
the Plaintiffs’ plans to replace the Defendants as master tenants
with minimal interruption to the business of sub-tenanting and licensing
the units. The Plaintiffs would be forced to expend time and money
replacing what had been removed and sourcing for new occupants.
The Defendants wanted to be compensated for not making things difficult
for the Plaintiffs. The Defendants were, in substance, engaging
in commercial blackmail or extortion, or were attempting to do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     The
Defendants’ counsel, Mr Andre Yeap SC, raised two points in an attempt
to explain the conversation at the meeting. Mr Yeap stated that
the meeting was “more akin to an amicable business discussion”,
and that if the price was right, the Plaintiffs would have agreed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span> Mr Yeap also accused the
Plaintiffs of “baiting” Tan Chee Beng at the meeting.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> Mr Yeap emphasised,
in particular, the “surreptitious” manner in which the meeting was
recorded.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     I
do not accept these two points. First, they are inconsistent positions that
cannot be credibly advanced together. To suggest that Tan Chee Beng was
baited necessarily assumes that his statements were improper. The assumption
of impropriety contradicts the point that the meeting was really a <em>bona fide</em> business discussion. The Defendants’
suggestion of baiting actually <em>supports</em> the
Plaintiffs’ case that they had been the subject of threats to pay.
There would have been no need for the Plaintiffs to bait the Defendants
unless the former genuinely believed that the latter wanted such compensation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     Second,
even if the Plaintiffs would have been willing to pay the Defendants
if the price was right, that would not make the transaction a <em>bona fide</em> commercial resolution of matters.
It would merely have meant that the Plaintiffs had yielded to the
blackmail or extortion. Whether or not the Plaintiffs yielded to
the blackmail or extortion would not affect the true nature of the
transaction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     The
evidence on the reason why the 1 December 2011 meeting was arranged
fortifies my conclusion drawn from the conversation at the meeting.
Benson Tan’s evidence was that prior to the 1 December 2011 meeting,
he and Yap Chee Sing met with Ong Ah Sui at the Site (see [30] and
[31] above). Ong Ah Sui told them that Roger Koh wanted to meet
with them. Ong Ah Sui said Roger Koh wanted the Plaintiffs to pay
the Defendants $3m, if not the Defendants would “dismantle all fixtures
and fittings found [at the Site]”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span> Benson Tan’s evidence
was that this formed the basis of the meeting on 1 December 2011.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span> A similar account was given by Yap
Chee Sing.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     The
Defendants dispute that such instructions had emanated from Roger Koh.
The Defendants assert that even if Ong Ah Sui had threatened the
Plaintiffs to pay $3m, he had done so without authority from either
Tan Chee Beng or Roger Koh.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     Neither
Roger Koh nor Ong Ah Sui was called to give evidence. The fact that
Ong Ah Sui made the statement to Benson Tan and Yap Chee Sing therefore
cannot be relied on to prove the <em>truth of the </em><em>content</em> of Ong Ah Sui’s statement (<em>ie</em>, that Roger Koh had issued the threat).
That would violate the rule against hearsay evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     I
nonetheless accept Benson Tan’s and Yap Chee Sing’s evidence that Ong
Ah Sui had made such a statement to them on 3 November 2011, and that
that statement was the reason the meeting was arranged. Benson Tan was
a steady and credible witness. It was not put to Benson Tan in cross-examination
that Ong Ah Sui did not say what Benson Tan was alleging. Also,
such an explanation for the 1 December 2011 meeting is consistent with
Benson Tan’s and Yap Chee Sing’s eventual decision to record it.
They would not have done so unless they sensed something was amiss.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     The
reason the meeting was arranged, coupled with what was said at the
meeting further confirms the role that Roger Koh played in the Defendants’
scheme. At the meeting Benson Tan said that “Roger [Koh] has told
some people … [s]ee what kind of arrangement Cogent can make with you.
Otherwise, you will demolish everything” (see [70] above). Benson
Tan went on to say, “[y]ou know you can’t take over something torn
down and empty”. Although Roger Koh did say in response, “you are
wrong”, I am of the view from the rest of his response that this
was not a denial of his threat. Rather, it was to make the point
that the Defendants did not have the benefit of taking over something
from an existing master tenant (unlike what the Plaintiffs wanted),
and that the Defendants had to convert the Site from scratch so
that it could be used for retail purposes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     It
was open to the Defendants to call Roger Koh and Ong Ah Sui to give
evidence to dispute the allegation of the Plaintiffs or support
those of the Defendants. This was not done.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     The
Defendants argue that an adverse inference should not be drawn against
them for their failure to call Roger Koh and Ong Ah Sui. In respect of
Roger Koh, the Defendants say that they offered him to the Plaintiffs
for cross-examination. The Plaintiffs chose not to do so.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span> In respect of Ong Ah Sui, they
argue that they had subpoenaed him, but he refused to attend court
in breach of the subpoena.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span> They therefore
say that there was a good reason for Ong Ah Sui’s absence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     I
do not accept these arguments. Benson Tan and Yap Chee Sing had given
damning evidence of what Ong Ah Sui had said about Roger Koh’s purported
instructions, and also what Tan Chee Beng and Roger Koh had said
at the meeting. Since Ong Ah Sui was not attending court as a witness in
violation of the subpoena, then <em>all the more</em> the
Defendants should have called Roger Koh to give evidence to rebut
the Plaintiffs’ allegations. I do not think it is a sufficient answer
for the Defendants to say that they offered Roger Koh to the Plaintiffs
for cross-examination.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     There
was no suggestion that Roger Koh was unable or unwilling to give
evidence for the Defendants. He was present in court in the course
of the trial, if not throughout the entire trial. Roger Koh chose
not to give evidence to dispute what the Plaintiffs said at the
meeting, <em>ie</em>, that they had heard
that Roger Koh wanted to see what arrangement the Plaintiffs could make,
otherwise everything would be demolished. Neither did he give evidence
to disclaim his involvement in “the system” that the Defendants had
in place, which Tan Chee Beng had made so many references to. I
draw an adverse inference against all the Defendants for not calling
Roger Koh as a witness.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     I
therefore conclude that the Defendants were making implicit threats for
the Plaintiffs to pay them compensation at the 1 December 2011 meeting.
The threats emanated from and were communicated through both Tan
Chee Beng and Roger Koh.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The obligations to SLA under
the Extension Tenancy</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     The
Defendants argue that the reason they were insistent on the sub-tenants
and licensees vacating their respective units by 31 January 2012
was to create a one-month buffer before handing the Site back to
SLA. The Defendants rely on provisions in the Extension Tenancy
which stipulated that SAA was responsible to SLA for the sub-tenants’
and licensees’ compliance with the relevant obligations under the
Extension Tenancy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     As
a precursor, the argument about a buffer does not sit well with SAA’s
original reason for seeking the extension of their tenancy up till 29 February
2012 from SLA. SAA’s proposal was made on the basis that it would
be beneficial for the sub-tenants and licensees to be able to enjoy
the Chinese New Year Holiday (see [23] above). By requiring the
sub-tenants and licensees to vacate their units by 31 January 2012,
the Defendants were effectively preventing them from enjoying Chinese
New Year (which fell on 23 and 24 January 2012) at the Site, as
the sub-tenants and licensees would take between two to four weeks
to reinstate their units prior to vacating them.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span> This
was confirmed by Tan Chee Beng in cross-examination.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     Even
if the Defendants had only subsequently realised that they ought to
have a one-month buffer in case any sub-tenant or licensee was dilatory in
returning its unit, SLA had made it clear that SAA was to assist
with the continuity of businesses that intended to remain at the
Site under the Plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     The
emphasis of the Five SLA Letters sent in November 2011, December
2011, and early-January 2012 (see [33] and [37] above), was that the
continuity of existing businesses was paramount, <em>especially</em> for
those sub-tenants and licensees which were continuing under the
subsequent master tenant after 29 February 2012. Further, on 11 January
2012, SLA agreed not to hold SAA liable for loss or damage caused
by the retention of works at the Site.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     By
late-2011 through to early-2012, events had overtaken any legitimate
concern that the Defendants might otherwise have had about the late
return of units. By that point in time, the Defendants were not
justified in relying on SAA’s original contractual obligations to
SLA in order to compel sub-tenants and licensees to vacate their
units by 31 January 2012 so as to create a one-month buffer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     All
the Defendants had to do was to inform sub-tenants and licensees that
if they could produce documentary evidence of a new sub-tenancy
or licence with the subsequent master tenant commencing 1 March
2012, they would be allowed to stay on until 29 February 2012. The
rent or licence fee for the month of February 2012 could have been
easily resolved. Indeed, the Defendants did not suggest that the
rent or licence fees for that last month in February 2012 would
have been an issue if they were minded to allow these sub-tenants
and licensees to stay on until 29 February 2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     The
Defendants, however, did not inform the sub-tenants and licensees
that they might be allowed to stay on until 29 February 2012. Instead,
between late-2011 and 29 February 2012, the Defendants’ posture towards
the sub-tenants and licensees became increasingly severe.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     On
1 November 2011, SAA wrote to the sub-tenants and licensees. SAA
reminded them that their leases would expire on 31 January 2012. SAA
stressed that the reinstatement work for their respective units
was to be completed by that date in order to “smoothen the … process
of [their] rental deposit refund.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span> SAA also stated that the sub-tenants
would be responsible for any loss or damage that arose from failure
to reinstate and hand over their units by 31 January 2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     On
1 December 2011, SAA sent out a second letter to the sub-tenants repeating
the contents of their letter dated 1 November 2011.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_52" id="Ftn_52_1"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span> SAA
added that if the sub-tenants and licensees failed to comply, SAA
would recover possession of the units and claim damages for trespass
and breach of contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     SAA
wrote a third letter to the sub-tenants on 4 January 2012 repeating
the contents of the earlier two letters. SAA asserted that it will
cut off all electricity and water supplies, terminate fire safety,
and cease management and maintenance services on 31 January 2012.
SAA also stated that in the event of non-compliance, it would “exercise
[SAA’s] rights as the Licensor immediately without further notice
and all costs and expenses including removal fees, contractor costs
and legal fees, incurred will be borne by [the sub-tenants and licensees]”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_53" id="Ftn_53_1"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     The
Plaintiffs obtained the Injunction on 20 January 2012. The Defendants’
response to the Injunction was striking. SAA sent a letter to the sub-tenants
and licensees on 25 January 2012, informing them that an injunction
had been obtained by the Plaintiffs. SAA stated that it had instructed
lawyers to apply to set aside the Injunction. SAA concluded by stating
that if the Injunction “is discharged, <em>we will
no longer be prohibited from evicting any sub-tenant or licensee
that remains on our property</em> after the expiration of
their [licence] or sub-tenancy on 31 January 2012” [emphasis added].<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_54" id="Ftn_54_1"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     All
this was done in the face of SLA’s repeated letters informing SAA about
the importance of ensuring continuity for the businesses of sub-tenants
and licensees beyond 31 January 2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     On
a separate but related point, there was also some dispute as to whether
the Defendants maintained utilities and waste-disposal services
at the Site between 31 January 2012 and 29 February 2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     The
Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants ceased providing these services
to the sub-tenants and licensees at the site after 31 January 2012, even
though the Defendants knew that many of them were still in occupation
of their units. The Plaintiffs say that this was part of the Defendants’
plan to force the sub-tenants and licensees out of their units, and
to prevent them from continuing under the Plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    The
Defendants disagree. They deny that they failed to provide adequate
lighting in the common areas. The Defendants also assert that they
continued to provide waste-disposal services. They claim that they maintained
a “skeletal but functional force to carry out some basic cleaning and
maintenance”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_55" id="Ftn_55_1"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    Lincoln
Gabriel and Tan Lay Hoon gave evidence on behalf of the Plaintiffs.
Both were sub-tenants at the Site when the Defendants were still master
tenants. They gave evidence that the Defendants failed to maintain basic
amenities such as lighting and waste-disposal services after 31 January 2012.
Lincoln Gabriel’s affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”) further exhibited
photographs taken in January and February 2012 of dimly-lit or dark
corridors and walkways.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_56" id="Ftn_56_1"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    Ang
Kiong Teng, who was the chief operating officer of TCM at the material
time, gave evidence for the Defendants. He filed an affidavit in response
to Lincoln Gabriel’s and Tan Lay Hoon’s AEICs. He stated that the
“decrease in illumination was due to the fact that by 2 February
2012, most, if not all, of the [sub-tenants and licensees] at [the
Site] had vacated their units”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_57" id="Ftn_57_1"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span> In support
of this contention, Ang Kiong Teng exhibited invoices for utilities
charges for the month of February 2012 which the Defendants incurred
in respect of the Site.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    I
prefer the evidence of the Plaintiffs’ witness on this point. Their evidence
was unchallenged in cross-examination. Their evidence is further corroborated
by contemporaneous letters from SLA to SAA in February 2012 (see
[47] above). In those letters, SLA complained to SAA of the inadequate
lighting and improper waste disposal at the Site, highlighting the
“safety and security concerns” and the “[disruption] for businesses”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    I
do not find the reason for the Defendants’ reason for the “decrease in
illumination” persuasive. First, any loss of illumination from lights
being turned off in the vacated units should have had little impact
on the amount of lighting in the common areas, which was what was
being complained of. Second, I doubt that a decrease in illumination
merely from the vacant units would have been sufficient to motivate
SLA to write two letters in rapid succession to SAA, warning them
of the safety and security concerns arising from the lack of proper
lighting. Also, the mere fact that the Defendants exhibited invoices
for utilities for the month of February 2012 does not assist them.
While it proves that the Defendants did incur <em>some</em> utilities
expenses, it does not show that the Defendants did not cut back
on lighting and waste-disposal services during that period.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    In
my view, it was no coincidence that the Defendants’ pressure on the
sub-tenants and licensees began in November 2011, after the tender
was awarded to Cogent Land on 10 October 2011. Neither was it coincidence that
this pressure intensified after the non-conclusive meeting on 1 December
2011. The Defendants further carried through with their hostile
behaviour beyond 31 January 2012, by switching off lighting and ceasing
other basic services despite being aware that some units at the
Site were still being occupied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    I
therefore conclude that the Defendants’ attempts to force the sub-tenants
and licensees to vacate their units by 31 January 2012 were not
in the hope of creating a one-month buffer prior to the handover
of the Site to SLA. There was no need for a buffer for those who
were continuing with the subsequent master tenant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The obligations to URA under
the 2010 WP</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    The
Defendants argued that they carried out the reinstatement work with
the “genuine belief” that they were “duty bound” to do so.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_58" id="Ftn_58_1"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span> They believed
that they were legally obliged to do so under the 2010 WP issued
by URA, notwithstanding SLA’s instructions to the contrary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    URA
is the authority that oversees the uses that land is put to. If
a land occupier wants to apply a plot of land to a particular use,
he would first need to seek URA’s approval. URA gives such approval
in the form of written permissions (“WPs”). The necessity for a
valid WP for the use that a particular plot of land is put to is
a regulatory requirement. This requirement exists independently
from any contractual permission which SAA might have had to obtain
from SLA under the Extension Tenancy, or any of the earlier tenancies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    SAA,
during their term as master tenants, had applied for and obtained
a number of WPs and subsequent extensions for the use of the Site.
Each of these WPs (or their extensions) was only valid for a period
of between one and three years. SAA would therefore have had to
make applications for new WPs (or extensions of existing ones) as
and when the validity of an existing WP was about to lapse.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    The
WP in question is the 2010 WP. It was the last WP that SAA obtained
from URA in respect of the Site prior to its handover on 29 February
2012. The 2010 WP was granted on 19 August 2010 and was valid until
31 August 2011. Planning Condition (c) of the 2010 WP stated that
“[u]nless renewal of planning permission is granted, the approved
use shall cease and the <em>structures erected
shall be demolished </em><em>upon the expiry
of this permission</em>” [emphasis added].<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_59" id="Ftn_59_1"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span> Similar
conditions were present in all the previous WPs that SAA had obtained.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    Planning
Condition (c) was the lynchpin of the Defendants’ case on the reinstatement
work. The Defendants argue that they carried out the reinstatement
work believing that they were required to do so under Planning Condition
(c). They did not, therefore, intend to cause damage to the Plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    The
Defendants rely on two letters purportedly received from their architectural
advisors, Samson Tan Associates (“STA”), to buttress this argument.
These letters were dated 19 August 2010 and 31 August 2011. I will
refer to them collectively as “the STA Letters”. The dates on the
STA Letters coincided with the dates of the grant and expiry of
the 2010 WP.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    The
first STA letter purported to remind SAA of its obligation under Planning
Condition (c) of the 2010 WP to demolish “temporary structures” upon
the expiry of the 2010 WP. It also emphasised that for safety reasons, “temporary
works” should be removed after their temporary uses have expired
by August 2011.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_60" id="Ftn_60_1"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    The
second STA letter purported to reiterate Planning Condition (c) of
the 2010 WP. The second letter stated that STA absolved themselves from
professional liability for uses that extended beyond the expiry
date of the 2010 WP. The second letter further stated that “temporary
works including the M&amp;E works, partitions, the light weight
metal plate floors and metal sheet walls” were only certified temporary
and not meant to last for more than ten years. They were to be removed
“for reasons of public safety”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_61" id="Ftn_61_1"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    The
Plaintiffs dispute the authenticity of these letters. The Plaintiffs claim
that the STA Letters were fabricated to support the Defendants’
case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    I
am of the view that the Defendants did not carry out the reinstatement
work because they believed they were legally obliged to do so under
the 2010 WP. Rather, the Defendants’ reliance on the 2010 WP and the
STA Letters was a convenient and belated excuse to mask their predominant
purpose to cause damage to the Plaintiffs. The reasons for this conclusion
follow below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Defendants failed to establish
the authenticity of the STA Letters</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    I
find that the Defendants have failed to establish that the STA Letters were
genuine letters issued by STA on the purported dates stated in them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    Instead,
I am of the view that Ong Cher Keong fabricated and backdated the
STA Letters to assist the Defendants with their case. Ong Cher Keong
was one of the Defendants’ witnesses. He was a director of SAA from
1999 to 2003. During that time, he was a majority shareholder of
OCK International Development Pte Ltd (“OCK International”). OCK International,
in turn, owned 40% of the shares in SAA.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_62" id="Ftn_62_1"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span> He was a certified
architect until 2003, when his certification lapsed due to his bankruptcy.
He was thereafter consulted on an <em>ad hoc</em> basis
by SAA on matters pertaining to planning, building control approval
and construction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    The
following factors lead me to believe that Ong Cher Keong fabricated
and backdated the letters to assist the Defendants’ case:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_119-p2_a"></a>(a)     The
originals of the STA Letters were not produced. Only copies were
produced. No satisfactory reason was given as to why the originals
were not produced. Ong Cher Keong said he had handed the letters,
presumably on two different occasions, to Ang Kiong Teng, the chief
operating officer of SAA, who also gave evidence for the Defendants
at trial. Ang Kiong Teng did not explain what had become of these
originals.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_119-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
signatory of the STA Letters was not identified by name in the letters.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_119-p2_c"></a>(c)     It
was only during cross-examination that Ong Cher Keong testified
that he had drafted and signed the STA Letters himself. He claimed
he did so in consultation with Samson Tan (who was apparently STA’s
principal architect).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_63" id="Ftn_63_1"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span> Yet no mention was
made of these points in Ong Cher Keong’s AEIC. I find it unlikely
that Samson Tan would authorise Ong Cher Keong to issue letters
on STA’s behalf, as there was no apparent reason for granting him
such authority. There was no clear evidence that Ong Cher Keong
was employed by STA. Neither was he a certified architect on the
dates that the letters bore. His certification had lapsed long before,
in 2003, when he was made a bankrupt.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_119-p2_d"></a>(d)     The
Defendants did not call Samson Tan as a witness to corroborate Ong
Cher Keong’s evidence that he had consulted with Samson Tan before
each letter was sent.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_119-p2_e"></a>(e)     Ong
Cher Keong was an interested party in SAA. In his AEIC, Ong Cher
Keong had disclosed his previous directorship and interest in SAA
through his OCK International Shares. However, he did not disclose
that although he was no longer a shareholder in OCK International,
he had transferred his shares in OCK International to his brother, David
Ong Chit Beng, in 2002. Ong Cher Keong also did not disclose that
his brother continued to hold a 75% interest in OCK International
at the time of the proceedings. This information only surfaced when
Ong Cher Keong was being cross-examined.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_64" id="Ftn_64_1"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_119-p2_f"></a>(f)     The
STA Letters were only brought to SLA’s attention very much later
than the dates that they bore. The STA Letters were dated 19 August
2010 and 31 August 2011. The first time SAA made mention of the
STA Letters to SLA was only on 9 January 2012. If the STA Letters
were genuine and were as crucial as the Defendants made them out
to be, they would have been raised to SLA much earlier.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_119-p2_g"></a>(g)     The
first STA letter misquoted Planning Condition (c) of the 2010 WP
by inserting an additional word “temporary” to the word “structures”
(see [113] above). The word “temporary” did not appear in Planning
Condition (c) of the 2010 WP (see [110] above). The addition of
this word appeared to be deliberate to support the Defendants’ case
that the structures in question were temporary and hence had to
be demolished.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_119-p2_h"></a>(h)     The
second STA letter stated that the works were to be removed for reasons
of “public safety”. But in cross-examination, Ong Cher Keong admitted
that he was not in a position to comment on the safety of the structures
because he was not a structural engineer.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_65" id="Ftn_65_1"><sup>[note: 65]</sup></a></span> He also accepted that he had
drafted the STA Letters without the knowledge or expertise to comment
on the safety of the structures.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_66" id="Ftn_66_1"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_119-p2_i"></a>(i)     The
content of the second STA letter goes beyond what was necessary
for the protection of the architects. Ong Cher Keong claimed in
cross-examination that the purpose of the STA Letters was to discharge
STA from their professional liability.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_67" id="Ftn_67_1"><sup>[note: 67]</sup></a></span> Yet the
second STA letter did more than that. It “strongly advised” SAA
to ensure that its tenants remove the works in question. The “advice”
appeared to be calculated to provide the basis for the Defendants’
reinstatement work.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    I
am therefore of the view that the STA Letters were fabricated. This removed
an important plank on which the Defendants’ argument about the 2010
WP stood.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Defendants adopted inconsistent
positions in respect of their obligations under the 2010 WP</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    The
evidence given by the Defendants’ witnesses attempting to justify their
reinstatement work with the 2010 WP was unsatisfactory. Tan Chee Beng,
Ong Cher Keong and Ang Kiong Teng gave evidence on this point for
the Defendants. Some of the evidence was incoherent, and there were inconsistencies
in their evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    I
begin with Ong Cher Keong’s evidence. It was convoluted and difficult
to follow. It was also characterised by constant shifts to make
up for apparent inconsistencies in the positions he took.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    His
AEIC stated that 76 groups of works, which he referred to as “temporary
structures”,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_68" id="Ftn_68_1"><sup>[note: 68]</sup></a></span> needed to be
removed pursuant to Planning Condition (c) upon the lapse of the
2010 WP.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_69" id="Ftn_69_1"><sup>[note: 69]</sup></a></span> However, in
cross-examination, Ong Cher Keong admitted that URA approved the
use of space, and not actual structures.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_70" id="Ftn_70_1"><sup>[note: 70]</sup></a></span> He conceded that
many of the 76 temporary structures were not reflected in the plans
that were submitted to URA for approval.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_71" id="Ftn_71_1"><sup>[note: 71]</sup></a></span> This did not
sit well with the position taken in his AEIC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    Ong
Cher Keong then changed tack. He stated that when a WP expires,
the approved use of space expires, and consequently, any structure that
encloses or defines the space must be demolished.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_72" id="Ftn_72_1"><sup>[note: 72]</sup></a></span> The
term “structures enclosing or defining space” was not mentioned
in his AEIC. Further, it was apparent that many of the 76 temporary
structures (which included the likes of drains, air-conditioning
units and fire-protection systems) could not be conceived of as
structures enclosing space.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    Ong
Cher Keong also attempted to justify his use of the phrase “temporary
structures”, which did not appear in the 2010 WP. He acknowledged
that the 2010 WP only mentioned “structures” and not “temporary
structures”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_73" id="Ftn_73_1"><sup>[note: 73]</sup></a></span> He went
on to state that “temporary structures” were works that were restricted
by time, and that the time restriction was “specified by URA that
approved use is [<em>sic</em>] only for three
years”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_74" id="Ftn_74_1"><sup>[note: 74]</sup></a></span> Ong Cher Keong, however,
accepted that the works were not intended to last only for three
years,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_75" id="Ftn_75_1"><sup>[note: 75]</sup></a></span> and that SAA did
not intend the temporary structures to last only for a specified
period of time.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_76" id="Ftn_76_1"><sup>[note: 76]</sup></a></span> Yet Ong Cher Keong refused
to admit that there was no basis for him to label the works “temporary”,
and he was unable to satisfactorily explain the use of that phrase.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_77" id="Ftn_77_1"><sup>[note: 77]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    Tan
Chee Beng’s evidence did not suffer from the same inconsistencies
that Ong Cher Keong’s did. There were, however, conflicting accounts
between Tan Chee Beng’s and Ong Cher Keong’s evidence. This was
so notwithstanding that the Defendants had elected for Tan Chee
Beng to give his evidence last (even though he was the Defendants’
main witness). Tan Chee Beng, being a named defendant in the proceedings,
was entitled to be present in court throughout the trial. Tan Chee
Beng therefore had the opportunity of listening to Ong Cher Keong’s evidence
in full before he gave his evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    For
example, when Ong Cher Keong was questioned about whether SAA would
be required to remove the structures and replace them if SAA won
the new tender, he stated that SAA would have to take the structures down
and study them, before putting them up again.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_78" id="Ftn_78_1"><sup>[note: 78]</sup></a></span> This stood in stark contrast
to Tan Chee Beng’s evidence on the point. Tan Chee Beng stated that
if SAA won the tender, they would not have removed the structures (see
[146] below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    Another
example of the inconsistencies in the Defendants’ case and evidence
is their position on the Metal Deck Flooring. This is one of the
18 Items that the Plaintiffs complain the Defendants removed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    The
Defendants’ pleadings took the position that the Metal Deck Flooring
was required to be demolished because it was a “structure” under Planning
Condition (c) of the 2010 WP.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_79" id="Ftn_79_1"><sup>[note: 79]</sup></a></span> Ang Kiong Teng’s AEIC, however,
indicated that the Metal Deck Flooring was required to be removed,
not because it fell within the scope of the 2010 WP, but because
it was an <em>illegal structure</em>.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_80" id="Ftn_80_1"><sup>[note: 80]</sup></a></span> In cross-examination, he acknowledged
the inconsistency but was unable to explain it.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_81" id="Ftn_81_1"><sup>[note: 81]</sup></a></span> Ang Kiong Teng
later admitted that he signed his AEIC simply to comply with the
instructions of Tan Chee Beng.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_82" id="Ftn_82_1"><sup>[note: 82]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    Tan
Chee Beng’s evidence was that the Metal Deck Flooring was an illegal
structure from the outset. But that position is a curious one, in
three respects. First, Tan Chee Beng claimed that the Metal Deck
Flooring was erected in 2002 by an unnamed sub-tenant. I do not
find his explanation as to why an illegal structure was even allowed
to be constructed satisfactory. Second, if the structure was illegal
from the outset, then it is surprising why the Defendants allowed
it to stand for nine years before it was removed in 2011. They did
not say that they had discovered the existence of the structure
or its illegality only in 2011. Third, the Metal Deck Flooring was present
in the drawings that were submitted to URA for approval, and was approved
as an area for “institutional” use.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_83" id="Ftn_83_1"><sup>[note: 83]</sup></a></span> Tan Chee
Beng attempted to explain why the Metal Deck Flooring was illegal
even though URA had approved it for institutional use. Tan Chee
Beng stated that the Metal Deck Flooring was being applied to a
“commercial” use instead of the “institutional” use that approval
had been granted for.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_84" id="Ftn_84_1"><sup>[note: 84]</sup></a></span> But this
would merely mean that the Defendants were applying the Metal Deck
Flooring to an incorrect use, rather than the structure being illegal
in the sense that it did not fall within the scope of the WPs to
begin with.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_85" id="Ftn_85_1"><sup>[note: 85]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    The
Defendants argue that they have maintained a consistent position on
the illegality of the Metal Deck Flooring. They rely on the fact
that Tan Chee Beng alluded to the illegality at the meeting of 1 December
2011. I do not think that Tan Chee Beng’s mere reference to the
fact that it was illegal at the meeting is enough to remedy the
other patent inconsistencies in the Defendants’ position. In the
first place, it was not even made clear at the meeting what Tan
Chee Beng meant when he said that the Metal Deck Flooring was illegal.
Was it illegal because it did not have the necessary approval from
some other authority, or was it illegal because the 2010 WP had
lapsed?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132    The
Defendants’ contradictions on the Metal Deck Flooring were not limited
only to the reason for its removal. The Defendants prevaricated even
on the location of the Metal Deck Flooring, and which portions of
the Metal Deck Flooring they had removed. This is apparent from
the differences between the Defendants’ case which was put to the
Plaintiffs’ witnesses, and the subsequent evidence that Tan Chee
Beng gave.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a>133    The
Metal Deck Flooring was situated on the fifth level of the grandstand.
The floor plan of the fifth-level grandstand was segregated into four
areas, which I shall refer to as Areas A, B, C and D for convenience.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_86" id="Ftn_86_1"><sup>[note: 86]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a>134    The
Plaintiffs’ witness, Tan Tze Suen, gave evidence on which portions
of the Metal Deck Flooring had been removed. She was a registered
architect since 2007, and a qualified person for the purpose of
the Planning Act (Cap 232, 1998 Rev Ed) (“the Planning Act”). Tan
Tze Suen’s evidence was that the Metal Deck Flooring was removed
from Areas B, C and D.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_135"></a>135    In
cross-examination, Mr Yeap referred Tan Tze Suen to Area A. Mr Yeap
stated that the Defendants’ instructions were that the Metal Deck Flooring
was removed from Area A.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_87" id="Ftn_87_1"><sup>[note: 87]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_136"></a>136    Tan
Tze Suen stated that there had never been any Metal Deck Flooring
constructed within Area A, because that area was “in its original conditions
[<em>sic</em>] with tile floors and steps”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_88" id="Ftn_88_1"><sup>[note: 88]</sup></a></span> She stated that there was
no debris or marks in Area A. This was in contrast with Areas B,
C, and D, which were littered with hacked-off metal stumps and other
fragments, indicating that structures had been destroyed and removed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_89" id="Ftn_89_1"><sup>[note: 89]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137"></a>137    When
Tan Chee Beng was on the stand, he took a completely different position
from what Mr Yeap had put to the Plaintiffs’ witnesses. Tan Chee
Beng stated that the Metal Deck Flooring at Area A was still intact,
and that no Metal Deck Flooring had been removed from Area A at all.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_90" id="Ftn_90_1"><sup>[note: 90]</sup></a></span> He further
stated that the removal of the Metal Deck Flooring was from areas <em>outside</em> of Areas A, B, C and D referred
to by Tan Tze Suen.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_91" id="Ftn_91_1"><sup>[note: 91]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a>138    Not
only was Tan Chee Beng’s evidence inconsistent with the case that
the Defendants’ counsel had put to the Plaintiffs’ witnesses, it
also did not meet the Plaintiffs’ contention. If the Metal Deck
Flooring was removed from an area outside Areas A, B, C and D, then
it would have been a non-issue, as the Plaintiffs were complaining
only about the removal of such flooring from Areas B, C and D.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a>139    In
totality, the evidence of the Defendants’ witnesses and the case
they put forth was unimpressive. The incoherence and inconsistencies
suggested that they did not genuinely believe that the 2010 WP required
the reinstatement work and the removal of the 18 Items. Rather,
the inevitable conclusion is that the Defendants’ relied on the
2010 WP as an excuse to justify their reinstatement work.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Defendants relied on the
2010 WP belatedly</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_140"></a>140    Third,
the Defendants’ reliance on the 2010 WP was belated. The Defendants
did not make any mention of the 2010 WP until 9 January 2012 in
a letter from SAA to SLA, despite there having been frequent correspondence
about the reinstatement work throughout November and December 2011,
and January 2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_141"></a>141    In
the Five SLA Letters sent to SAA over that period (see [33] and
[37] above), SLA emphasised that it did not require extensive reinstatement work
for units that would be used by existing occupants beyond 29 February
2012. SLA also stated that there was no need to remove “renovations,
repairs and authorised alterations, additions and structural changes”
from the first level of the main car park building.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_92" id="Ftn_92_1"><sup>[note: 92]</sup></a></span> In
the letter of 4 January 2012, SLA also appended a reduced list of
reinstatement work, and also stated specific structures which were
to be retained.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_93" id="Ftn_93_1"><sup>[note: 93]</sup></a></span> SAA did not raise the 2010
WP in response to any of these letters.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_142"></a>142    Further,
there was no mention of the 2010 WP at the meeting of 1 December
2011 between Benson Tan, Yap Chee Sing, Tan Chee Beng and Roger
Koh. At no time did Tan Chee Beng and Roger Koh say that there was
no choice but to carry on with the reinstatement work because of
the 2010 WP. On the contrary, their message was that they were prepared
to stop such reinstatement work if appropriate compensation was
paid by the Plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_143"></a>143    The
lateness of the Defendants’ mention of the 2010 WP is even starker
in the light of their assertion that they acted in reliance on the second
STA letter dated 31 August 2011. If the Defendants were well informed
and aware of their obligations under the 2010 WP because of STA’s
advice, as was their case, then it is inconceivable that they did
not raise the purported obligations under the 2010 WP to SLA at
the first instance that SLA informed the Defendants to cease reinstatement
work.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_144"></a>144    The
Defendants’ failure to raise the 2010 WP as a concern till so late in
the day contradicts its own position on the authenticity and importance of
the STA Letters. The lateness supports the conclusion that it was
never a genuine concern to begin with.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Defendants did not believe
that SLA and URA would adopt independent and conflicting positions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_145"></a>145    Finally,
I do not accept a suggestion for the Defendants that they believed
that the obligation to reinstate under the 2010 WP existed independently
from SLA’s instructions, which had significantly pared down the
scope of reinstatement work required under the Extension Tenancy. Rather,
I am of the view that Tan Chee Beng himself believed that SLA and URA
would not adopt independent and conflicting positions, and that
SLA and URA would work together to resolve any outstanding issues.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_146"></a>146    In
cross-examination, Tan Chee Beng was asked what SAA’s position on
the reinstatement work would be if SAA won the tender for the new tenancy,
SLA stated that there was no need to reinstate, and URA was silent on
it (apart from the 2010 WP).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_94" id="Ftn_94_1"><sup>[note: 94]</sup></a></span> Tan Chee
Beng stated that “[l]awfully, SAA has to, but SAA will not have
to [reinstate].”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_95" id="Ftn_95_1"><sup>[note: 95]</sup></a></span> Tan Chee
Beng later explained that if SAA won the tender for the new tenancy,
SAA would not have carried out reinstatement work pursuant to its
obligations under the 2010 WP as “SAA considers this is something
that will be sorted out between URA and SLA, because [Tan Chee Beng
considers that he is] dealing with the government as one body”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_96" id="Ftn_96_1"><sup>[note: 96]</sup></a></span> Tan Chee Beng also stated that
this was the reason that SAA operated without a valid WP for the period
between 27 October 2004 and 30 November 2005.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_97" id="Ftn_97_1"><sup>[note: 97]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_147"></a>147    Tan
Chee Beng’s oral evidence was also corroborated by independent contemporaneous
documents. SAA’s tender proposal for the new tenancy that was submitted
in July 2011 indicated that no monies were estimated to be spent
on structural and building works, M&amp;E works, architectural equipment,
fittings and fixtures.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_98" id="Ftn_98_1"><sup>[note: 98]</sup></a></span> The tender proposal was made
on the basis that SAA would not need to carry out reinstatement
work, and then replace all the items they had removed, if they won
the tender.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_148"></a>148    It
therefore appears to me that Tan Chee Beng’s understanding of the situation
was that SLA and URA would work together to determine what had to
be removed and what need not be removed. It was not a case where Tan
Chee Beng genuinely believed that even though SLA was urging SAA to
stop reinstatement work, URA would take a different position.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_149"></a>149    The
Defendants in their reply submissions point to the fact that SH Cogent’s
undertaking to SLA dated 11 January 2012, required SH Cogent to indemnify
SLA from any potential claims including “any civil penalty which
may be imposed by URA as a debt”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_99" id="Ftn_99_1"><sup>[note: 99]</sup></a></span> The Defendants argue that it was
clear from this undertaking that SLA itself contemplated the possibility of
a civil penalty imposed by URA if SAA did not remove the structures
as required by the 2010 WP. They say that “SLA saw the issue … as
a real and legitimate concern” and that “[t]he Defendants’ concern
can only be even greater given that they were the ones who erected
these additions and alterations”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_100" id="Ftn_100_1"><sup>[note: 100]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_150"></a>150    This
argument misses the point. The question is not whether SAA or SLA
would <em>actually</em> have faced potential
liability to URA for a civil penalty if the reinstatement work was
not carried out. Rather, the question is whether the Defendants
carried out the reinstatement work because they were motivated by
the belief that SAA was required to do so under the 2010 WP, and
the desire to avoid the consequence of potential liability if they
did not. The Defendants were clearly not concerned about the lapse
of the 2010 WP. It was never mentioned at the meeting of 1 December
2011 (see [142] above) and was mentioned late only in SAA’s letter
to SLA dated 9 January 2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_151"></a>151    The
reasons I have discussed above lead me to the conclusion that the Defendants
did not carry out the reinstatement work because they believed that
they were obliged to do so under the 2010 WP. Tan Chee Beng believed all
along that URA would not complain if no reinstatement work was carried
out because there was a subsequent master tenant taking over the Site
who wanted to use it in its existing state. It was just a matter
of formalising the permissions and approvals between the subsequent
master tenant and URA. This belief was the reason SAA’s tender proposal
for the subsequent tenancy of the Site indicated that no money was
to be spent on additional works. This belief was reaffirmed by URA’s
letter to SAA dated 10 February 2012 stating that URA did not require
the demolition of any of the structures for which the approved use
had ceased.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_152"></a>152    Rather,
the reason the Defendants carried out the reinstatement work against
the instructions of SLA, and the reason the Defendants attempted
to force the sub-tenants and licensees to vacate their units by
31 January 2012 was because the Defendants’ predominant purpose
was to injure the Plaintiffs. The Plaintiffs refused to provide
the Defendants with the compensation they wanted, and so, the Defendants
wanted to make the Plaintiffs pay the price for their refusal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the Defendants employed
unlawful means</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_153"></a>153    In
view of my finding above that the predominant purpose of the Defendants
was to injure the Plaintiffs, the question of whether unlawful means
was employed becomes academic. It is no longer necessary for me
to address this point, and I will not do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the Plaintiffs suffered
damage</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_154"></a>154    The
Plaintiffs argued that they suffered three categories of damage
as a consequence of the Defendants’ conspiracy. First, the expenses
incurred in replacing the 18 Items that were removed in the course
of the Defendants’ reinstatement work. Second, loss of income in
the form of rent and licence fees from the sub-tenants and licensees
who would have continued under the Plaintiffs but did not. Third,
expenses incurred in uncovering the Defendants’ conspiracy and minimising
the damage done to the Plaintiffs, namely, legal and private investigation
costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_155"></a>155    Proof
of damage is necessary to establish the tort of conspiracy. However,
once the Plaintiffs prove actual pecuniary loss, “the damages are at
large, in the sense that they are not limited to a precise calculation
of the amount of actual pecuniary loss actually proved” (<em>Lonrho plc and others v Fayed and others (No 5)</em> 1
WLR 1489 (“<em>Lonrho v Fayed (No 5)</em>”)
at 1494). The hearing of liability and quantum has been bifurcated.
Therefore, as long as the Plaintiffs prove some actual pecuniary
loss, I leave the precise extent of damage to be assessed at the
hearing to determine quantum.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Damage from the removal of the
18 Items</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_156"></a>156    The
Plaintiffs’ pleaded case relies on the Defendants’ purported removal
of the 18 Items from the Site. The Defendants admit that they removed
five of the items (see the annexure to this judgment). They deny removing
any of the rest. As I am concerned only with liability at this stage of
the proceedings, I need not go into the question of whether all
of the 18 Items were removed by the Defendants. The precise number
of items that were removed goes to quantum rather than liability.
I will therefore proceed on the basis that the Defendants have only
removed five items.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_157"></a>157    I
am of the view that the Plaintiffs have suffered some actual pecuniary
loss as a result of the removal of the five items. I accept the evidence
of the Plaintiffs’ witness, Loh Yi-Shin, on this point. She was
a professional engineer of nine years’ standing, and a qualified
person for the purposes of the Planning Act. She was an employee
of Cogent Holdings at the material time. She was assigned to oversee
planning, renovation and refurbishment of the Site.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_158"></a>158    In
her AEIC, she gave evidence that the removal of the five items resulted
in the Plaintiffs having to incur expenses replacing them, with some
of the replacement work needing to be carried out on an urgent basis.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_101" id="Ftn_101_1"><sup>[note: 101]</sup></a></span> Her AEIC also exhibited a spreadsheet
listing the estimated cost of replacing the structures that the
Plaintiffs alleged were removed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_102" id="Ftn_102_1"><sup>[note: 102]</sup></a></span> I am of
the view that the removal of the five items resulted in some actual pecuniary
loss to the Plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_159"></a>159    The
Defendants argued that the Plaintiffs suffered no loss because the Plaintiffs
were not entitled to any fixtures, fittings or structures under
the Plaintiffs’ agreement with SLA. The Plaintiffs were only entitled
to the Site on an “as is where is” basis. In other words, the Plaintiffs
could not suffer a loss from the removal of what it was not entitled
to.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_160"></a>160    I
do not accept this argument. It wrongly presupposes that loss can only
be suffered in respect of damage done to property owned by the Plaintiffs.
But the Plaintiffs could have suffered loss by delays and/or being required
to incur expenses that they would not have had to, had the tort
not been committed. It is clear that but for the Defendants’ acts
committed pursuant to the conspiracy to injure the Plaintiffs, the
expenses and time that was wasted would not have materialised.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Damage from loss of income from
rent and licence fees</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_161"></a>161    The
Plaintiffs allege that the loss of income they suffered arose in
two ways. First, the Defendants’ acts created an atmosphere of anxiety
and uncertainty amongst the second-hand car dealers at the car mart.
This caused car dealers who were prepared to consider entering into
licence agreements with the Plaintiffs to leave the Site, in search
of alternative locations. As a result, the Plaintiffs did not enjoy
licence fees they would have obtained until they were able to find
replacement licensees for the vacated units. Second, the handover
of units to sub-tenants and licensees of the Plaintiffs was delayed
due to the time the Plaintiffs had to spend replacing the items
which had been removed from the Site by the Defendants. The delay
resulted in them not being able to start collecting rent or licence
fees for those units from an earlier date.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_162"></a>162    On
the first ground, the Plaintiffs claim loss of income for the period between
1 March 2012 and the date replacement licensees were found for the
units concerned. 1 March 2012 would have been the date the Plaintiffs started
receiving licence fees from those existing car dealers who would have
continued under the Plaintiffs if they had not left the Site. The Plaintiffs
provided particulars of 13 car dealers who purportedly left due
to the Defendants’ conduct.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_103" id="Ftn_103_1"><sup>[note: 103]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_163"></a>163    The
Defendants, on the other hand, argued that the car dealers did not
leave as a result of their conduct. Rather, they left because of
the significantly higher licence fees that the Plaintiffs were asking
for.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_164"></a>164    Sean
Peh, the Plaintiffs’ witness, gave evidence on this point. He was head
of the automotive department of Cogent Automotive Logistics Pte
Ltd at the material time. His evidence in cross-examination was
that of the 13 car dealers, two left due (either in whole or in
part) to the uncertainty and anxiety. Two of the car dealers did
not leave the Site, but merely switched units after the handover.
The remaining nine of the 13 car dealers left as a result of the
increase in licence fees.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_104" id="Ftn_104_1"><sup>[note: 104]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_165"></a>165    It
is not yet clear to me at this stage that the increase in licence
fees was so significant that it was the sole, decisive, factor.
In my view, the Defendants’ acts would have had a role to play in
the car dealers’ departures. Sean Peh’s evidence that two car dealers
left as a result of the anxiety and uncertainty was not challenged.
In respect of the other 11 car dealers, Mr Adrian Wong, counsel
for the Defendants who was conducting the cross-examination of Sean
Peh, stopped short of suggesting to Sean Peh that the <em>sole reason</em> they left the Site was the
higher licence fees. The higher licence fees may merely have been
one of the factors that resulted in them leaving the Site. It is
open to the Plaintiffs to prove the precise extent of loss suffered
at the quantum stage of the proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_166"></a>166    On
the second basis of the Plaintiffs’ claim for loss of income from rent
and licence fees, I accept that the evidence given by Loh Yi-Shin.
As mentioned above (at [157]), she gave evidence that the reinstatement
work resulted in the Plaintiffs having to replace the items that
the Defendants had removed, some on an urgent basis.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_105" id="Ftn_105_1"><sup>[note: 105]</sup></a></span> The spreadsheet referred to above also
listed the commencement date and expected end date of the replacement
work in respect of each of the items.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_106" id="Ftn_106_1"><sup>[note: 106]</sup></a></span> I accept
her evidence that the time spent replacing these items would have
delayed the earliest date which the Plaintiffs could have let out
the affected units, and resulted in them suffering a loss of rent
or licence fees for those units.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Damage from expenses incurred
in uncovering the conspiracy</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_167"></a>167    The
Plaintiffs argue that the damage necessary for actionable conspiracy
can be established by expenses incurred in exposing the conspiracy.
They rely on the English High Court case of <em>British
Motor Trade Association v Salvadori and others</em> [1949]
Ch 556 (“<em>British Motor</em>”) at 569.
The Plaintiffs argue that they incurred expenses in the process
of uncovering the Defendants’ conspiracy, and attempting to prevent
further harm by the Defendants. For the former, they had to hire
private investigators to conduct surveillance at the Site and to
uncover what the Defendants’ were doing. For the latter, they had
to obtain the Injunction to prevent the Defendants from causing
further loss pursuant to the conspiracy. The Plaintiffs argue that
this expense was, in itself, able to satisfy the requirement of
damage for actionable conspiracy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_168"></a>168    The
Defendants argue that <em>British Motor</em> is
distinguishable. They argue that the facts of <em>British
Motor</em> were exceptional; the English High Court there
found that the conspiracy “imperil[ed] [the claimant’s] very existence”
(<em>British Motor</em> at 569). They also
argue that the court in <em>British Motor</em> did
not hold that expenses incurred in exposing the conspiracy were, by
themselves, sufficient for the purpose of making out a case for conspiracy.
They say that if that were the case, the requirement of damage for
actionable conspiracy would be rendered otiose, as the claimant
would almost always incur expenses in uncovering a conspiracy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_169"></a>169    In
view of my findings above that the Plaintiffs have suffered actual pecuniary
loss over and above the expenses incurred in uncovering the conspiracy,
I do not need to decide whether such expenses are, by themselves,
sufficient to establish damage. The expenses can nonetheless be recovered
by the Plaintiff, subject to proof at the quantum stage of the proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the Defendants are entitled
to damages on the Plaintiffs’ undertaking in respect of the Injunction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_170"></a>170    I
now address the Defendants’ counterclaim. The Defendants seek damages
for what they say was the Plaintiffs’ wrongful application for the Injunction.
The Defendants are asking the court to enforce the Plaintiffs’ undertaking
to abide by any order for damages which the Plaintiffs gave to the
court when they applied for the Injunction on 20 January 2012.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_107" id="Ftn_107_1"><sup>[note: 107]</sup></a></span> Further,
the Defendants, in their closing submissions, rely on <em>Rookes v Barnard</em> [1964] 2 WLR 269 to argue
that the Plaintiffs should be required to pay exemplary damages.
They say that the Plaintiffs’ “conduct in seeking an injunction
to advance their financial interests [is] an abuse of process”,
and “was a cold and calculated act on the part of the Plaintiffs”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_108" id="Ftn_108_1"><sup>[note: 108]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_171"></a>171    The
court has the discretion in deciding whether or not to enforce a claimant’s
undertaking in damages. It is to be exercised by reference to all the
circumstances of the case (<em>Tribune Investment
Trust Inc v Soosan Trading Co Ltd</em> [2000] 2 SLR(R) 407
(“<em>Tribune Investment</em>”) at [54]).
In order for the court to be persuaded that a claimant’s undertaking
in damages should be enforced, it has to be satisfied of two things:
first, that the injunction was wrongly granted; and second, that
there are no special circumstances militating against the enforcement
of the claimant’s undertaking (<em>Canadian Pacific
(Bermuda) Ltd v Nederkoorn Pte Ltd and another</em> [1999]
1 SLR(R) 628 at [50]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_172"></a>172    Once
it is established that the undertaking should be enforced, the court
can decide whether to do so summarily, or by ordering an inquiry
as to damages (<em>Tribune Investment</em> at
[53]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_173"></a>173    I
pause to mention that a claim in respect of an undertaking in damages
should not be pleaded as a counterclaim (David Bean, Isabel Parry &amp;
Andrew Burns, <em>Injunctions</em> (2012,
11th Ed, Sweet &amp; Maxwell) at para 6–14), as the Defendants have
done in this case. The undertaking in damages, which the claimant
gives upon the grant of an injunction, is given to the <em>court</em> and not to the defendant. It does
not create any right on the part of the defendant which can found
a cause of action (<em>Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester
Building Society (formerly Portsmouth Building Society) v Ricketts</em> [1993]
1 WLR 1545 (“<em>Cheltenham</em>”) at 1551D,
per Neill LJ). The defendant can ask the court to enforce the undertaking.
But the defendant “has no right to its enforcement or any right
to damages until the discretion is exercised in his favour and damages
are awarded” (<em>Cheltenham</em> at 1555B, per
Peter Gibson LJ). Notwithstanding the Defendants’ incorrect approach of
characterising the enforcement of the undertaking as a counterclaim rather
than an application, I will nonetheless deal with the merits of
their claim for the undertaking in damages to be enforced.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_174"></a>174    I
turn to the question of whether the Injunction was wrongly granted. The
success of the claimant at trial and the circumstances in which
the order was obtained are important to this question (<em>Marubeni International Petroleum (S) v Projector
SA</em> [2004] 4 SLR(R) 233 at [15]). If the claimant fails
in its claim at the trial, then the injunction would usually have
been wrongly granted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_175"></a>175    The
Defendants’ position runs into difficulties at this point. They have
not elucidated in their pleadings or submissions a basis for their assertion
that the Injunction was wrongly granted. Their position appears to
have been premised on the discharge of the Injunction and perhaps
the expected failure of the Plaintiffs’ claim. But the latter premise
falls away with my finding in favour of the Plaintiffs in respect
of their substantive claim in this action. As for the former premise,
the Defendants assume that the discharge of the Injunction at the
interlocutory stage must mean that it was wrongly obtained in the
first place. This is incorrect.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_176"></a>176    The
facts and the decision of the English Court of Appeal in <em>Cheltenham</em> are instructive. There, the
plaintiffs obtained an interlocutory injunction against the defendants
in a fraud claim. The injunction was discharged prior to the trial
of the main action. The judge discharging the injunction ordered
that the plaintiffs’ undertaking in damages be enforced, and that
there be an inquiry as to damages. The Court of Appeal set aside the
order. The Court of Appeal held that the decision of the judge enforcing the
plaintiffs’ undertaking in damages was premature. If the allegation
of fraud was made out at the trial, it would have been material
to the exercise of the discretion whether to enforce the undertaking
in damages. Neill LJ observed at 1551F that “[i]t is important to
underline the fact that the question whether the undertaking should
be enforced is a <em>separate question</em> from
the question whether the injunction should be discharged or continued”
[emphasis added].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_177"></a>177    The
judge in the present case who granted and discharged the Injunction
must have been aware of this distinction. The judge expressly reserved
the issue of whether an inquiry as to damages was to be ordered
for the trial judge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_178"></a>178    No
written reasons were given by the judge for the decision to discharge
the Injunction. However, with the benefit of the dispute being ventilated
in the trial before me and a full picture of the facts as they unfolded,
I am of the view that the Injunction was not wrongly obtained. This
is therefore not a proper case for the court to exercise its discretion
to enforce the Plaintiffs’ undertaking in damages. The Defendants’ counterclaim
is dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_179"></a>179    The
Defendants’ conduct was reprehensible. While they intended to target
the Plaintiffs, it is troubling to note that others were also adversely affected
by their conduct.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_180"></a>180    The
Defendants must have known that the systematic conduct they embarked
on was causing anxiety, inconvenience and probably loss to their own
sub-tenants and licensees, that is, those who were prepared to consider entering
into new agreements with the Plaintiffs. The plight of these sub-tenants
and licensees came to the attention of the media and of SLA. But notwithstanding
SLA’s intervention, the Defendants remained callous and unrelenting
in what the Plaintiffs have aptly described as the Defendants’ scorched-earth
policy.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_109" id="Ftn_109_1"><sup>[note: 109]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_181"></a>181    Yet,
despite the Defendants’ own wilful conduct, they have suggested in
their closing submissions that they are entitled to exemplary damages from
the Plaintiffs, whom the Defendants allege acted in a “cold and calculated
manner” by obtaining the Injunction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_182"></a>182    In
the future, landlords who operate through a master tenant should consider
including adequate legal rights for themselves to protect the interests
of sub-tenants, licensees and other beneficiaries from the acts
of an unreasonable master tenant. Landlords must also be courageous
enough to exercise those rights to protect such interests.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_183"></a>183    As
an example, landlords should consider including for themselves the
right to compel the master tenant to grant fresh sub-tenancies or licences
up till the end of the existing tenancy, and to enter into such agreements
on behalf of the master tenant if it refuses to do so. Accompanying
this should also be the right of the landlord to insist that the master
tenant stop reinstatement work and to seek injunctive relief to
stop such work.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_184"></a>184    In
the present case, SLA did try to help sub-tenants and licensees
who wanted to continue under the Plaintiffs. SLA sent numerous letters
to SAA to that effect. However, SLA stopped short of taking any
legal action to compel SAA to cooperate. Perhaps SLA did not have
the appropriate legal rights to commence legal action against SAA
and intervene more directly. I hope it was not a lack of courage
or a wish simply to avoid litigation that precluded them from intervening
more directly.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_185"></a>185    I
grant the Plaintiffs judgment against the Defendants for damages
to be assessed for the loss and damage caused by the Defendants’
conspiracy to injure the Plaintiffs. The assessment of damages is
to be conducted by me or another judge (or judicial commissioner)
of the High Court. I will hear the parties and make a final decision
on the costs of the action at a later date, after the quantum of
damages has been resolved. However, if either party wishes such
costs to be determined before the quantum of damages is resolved,
that party may make a written request accordingly.</p>
