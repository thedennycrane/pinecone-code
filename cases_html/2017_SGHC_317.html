In the Liu SPA, GIIS was named as the vendor of a total of 250,000 NCJV shares. However, it will be recalled that GIIS had, by this time, transferred its entire previous shareholding of 750,000 NCJV shares away: GIIS transferred 450,000 shares to HYH, 150,000 shares to Karna, and 150,000 shares to E&amp;S (see [67], [71(b)(iii)] and [71(b)(v)] above). Pursuant to those transfers on 1 April 2013, GIIS’s shareholding as reflected in NCJV’s register of members was correspondingly reduced to zero.

These changes in the plaintiffs’ case will be explained and explored below (see [159] and [275] below). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The issues</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 Before setting out the specific issues to be dealt with in this judgment, I first discuss the context of these issues and the manner in which I propose to deal with them. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 The plaintiffs raise three causes of action: (a) dishonest assistance, (b) knowing receipt, and (c) an equitable proprietary claim in respect of some of the Charged Shares. As will be seen (see [182] and [284] below), the first two causes of action are premised on there being a trust or a fiduciary relationship between the plaintiffs on the one hand, and HJS and HJK on the other hand, in respect of the Charged Shares. The first section of this judgment will therefore explore the various arguments raised by the plaintiffs in relation to the existence of such a trust or fiduciary relationship. If no such trust or fiduciary relationship exists, the plaintiffs’ first two causes of action must fail from the outset.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 Even assuming that there is a trust or fiduciary relationship, the other elements of the causes of action in dishonest assistance and knowing receipt respectively and the defences thereto must also be addressed in order to determine whether the plaintiffs have established either of their first two causes of action. These issues are discussed in the second section of this judgment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 The third section of the judgment considers the plaintiffs’ third cause of action which is framed as an equitable proprietary claim for the return of the relevant Charged Shares which are in the hands of CBF, Muchsin, and Liu. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 Based on the overview stated above, the issues to be considered in this case are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Whether HJS and HJK held the Charged Shares on trust for the plaintiffs, or alternatively, whether HJS and HJK owe fiduciary obligations to the plaintiffs in relation to the Charged Shares. In this regard, the constitutive sub-issues include: </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) Based on the plaintiffs’ closing submissions, whether the plaintiffs’ security interest in the Charged Shares still subsists; if so, whether that security interest can properly be characterised as an equitable mortgage; if so, whether a trust relationship arises by mere virtue of an equitable mortgage (collectively, “Issue 1”).</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) Whether the plaintiffs can rely on their case that a trust or a fiduciary relationship arose based on the alleged unconscionable conduct of HJS and HJK (“Issue 2”).  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Even assuming that there is a trust or a fiduciary relationship in respect of the Charged Shares between the plaintiffs on the one hand, and HJS and HJK on the other hand, the following issues arise: </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) Whether the other elements of the claim for dishonest assistance of breach of trust against Wong, Neo, and/or Boo are satisfied (“Issue 3”).</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) Whether the other elements of the claim for knowing receipt are satisfied in respect of HYH and/or the Sub-purchasers; and in this connection, it is relevant to consider whether HYH and/or any of the Sub-purchasers are <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> purchasers of the relevant Charged Shares for value without notice of the plaintiff’s interest therein (if any) (collectively, “Issue 4”). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) If the plaintiffs fail in their claim for knowing receipt against CBF, Muchsin, and/or Liu, whether the plaintiffs have established their alternative equitable proprietary claim for the return of the relevant Charged Shares that remain with CBF, Muchsin, and/or Liu (“Issue 5”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 The final section of the judgment deals with certain other claims and proceedings that do not fall neatly within the sections and issues set out above. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 1: Whether the plaintiffs have a subsisting security interest in the Charged Shares and if so, whether it gives rise to a trust </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 First, I consider the plaintiffs’ case as developed in their closing submissions. In the closing submissions, the plaintiffs’ case was that there existed a trust over the Charged Shares held by HJS and HJK for the plaintiffs’ benefit. This proposition had three conjunctive premises, all of which must be satisfied in order for the proposition to stand: (a) that the plaintiffs have a subsisting security interest in the Charged Shares; (b) that the security interest should be properly characterised as an equitable mortgage and not an equitable charge; and (c) that a trust relationship arises from an equitable mortgage by virtue of the separation of legal and beneficial interests. I turn now to examine each of these premises in turn. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the plaintiffs’ security interest in the Charged Shares still subsists</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 The first issue of whether the plaintiffs have a valid and subsisting security interest in the Charged Shares is fundamental because the plaintiffs’ claims in dishonest assistance, knowing receipt, and even their equitable proprietary claim for the return of the Charged Shares, all rested on the premise that they have such an interest in the Charged Shares. This turns on several sub-issues, including: (a) the terms and construction of the SCAs creating the plaintiffs’ security interests in the Charged Shares, (b) the terms and construction of the Supplemental Deeds which purport to extend the period of validity of those security interests and whether they bind the parties named therein, and (c) the construction and adequacy of the pleadings. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">What interpretation should be accorded to each version of cl 5</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 I turn first to the SCAs.

I add that no one explained how these different versions came about.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 In respect of the short version of cl 5 found in the Infoworks SCAs, its effect is clear. As the underlying agreement ceases after 31 December 2012, the security created under that agreement also ceases to exist after that date. It is admittedly unusual and unfavourable to the plaintiffs as security holders that the SCAs have a fixed expiry date that is independent of the repayment of the underlying debt, but that is what the provision states.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 The long version found in the MKC SCAs is more problematic. The first paragraph provides that the MKC SCAs expire on 31 December 2012. However, the second paragraph provides that the security created under each MKC SCA is a “continuing security for payment of all moneys from time to time owing by [HJP] to MKC” and remains “in full force and effect until the repayment in full and the Security ceases to be available”. There is a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> inconsistency between these two paragraphs: if the SCA itself has expired, how is it possible that the “continuing security” created under the SCA can continue “in full force and effect until the repayment in full” if HJP makes repayment only after 31 December 2012?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 When faced with seemingly inconsistent contractual provisions, the court’s approach is to reconcile these provisions if that result can conscientiously and fairly be achieved (per Steyn J in <span class="font-italic">Pagnan</span><span class="font-italic"> SpA v Tradax Ocean Transportation SA</span> [1987] 1 All ER 81 at 89, upheld on appeal in <span class="font-italic">Pagnan</span><span class="font-italic"> SpA v Tradax Ocean Transporation SA </span>[1987] 3 All ER 565). However, if the inconsistency cannot be resolved by ordinary processes of construction, the court will attempt to discern the overall intentions of the parties from the remainder of the contract and determine which portion of the contract should be given effect to (see Gerard McMeel, <span class="font-italic">The Construction of Contracts: Interpretation, Implication and Rectification </span>(Oxford University Press, 2nd Ed, 2011) at paras 4.12–4.13).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 In my view, the two paragraphs of the long version of cl 5 can be reconciled by adopting a contextual approach to contractual interpretation. The proper interpretation to be accorded to the long version of cl 5 is this: the continuing security created under each MKC SCA subsists until repayment in full, or until 31 December 2012 which is the contractually stipulated date of expiry of the SCA, whichever is the earlier date.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 This interpretation is supported by cl 6.1 of the MKC SCAs, both of which read as follows:

Looking at the long version of cl 5, the term of the deed is up to 31 December 2012 unless otherwise terminated earlier. Therefore, cl 6.1 makes it clear that repayment in full was contemplated to take place either “prior to or on” 31 December 2012. It appears that the parties did not expect repayment of the Loans to take place after 31 December 2012; no mention was made about redemption of the security thereafter. This buttresses the conclusion that the parties’ intention was indeed for the MKC SCAs, and the security interests created thereunder, to expire on 31 December 2012. Accordingly, the long version of cl 5 should be interpreted as providing that the security interests created under the MKC SCAs subsist only until 31 December 2012 at the latest, rather than for an indeterminate and indefinite period until repayment in full.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 Such a construction gives rise to an unusual state of affairs again. A lender takes security to safeguard its interests in the event that the borrower defaults on its repayment obligations. A security interest that subsists only for a fixed period of time is very disadvantageous to the lender if it expires upon a certain fixed date as the lender may not have received payment by that date. One would therefore have expected the plaintiffs to avoid any fixed date of expiry for its security documentation. This is particularly so in light of the fact that the SCAs were entered into after HJP had <span class="font-italic">already</span> defaulted on its initial repayment obligations under the Infoworks Loan. It will be recalled that HJP was supposed to repay JPY 63 million on 31 May 2012, but failed to do so then (see [21] above). The plaintiffs must have been well aware of this default when they entered into the SCAs on 14 June 2012. Yet, based on the documents, they apparently agreed to a security interest that could potentially expire before repayment in full. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 However, notwithstanding this unusual state of affairs, I am of the view that that is the correct construction for the long version of cl 5 which, as mentioned at [103] above, is also the construction of the short version of cl 5. In other words, whether based on the long or the short versions of cl 5 of the SCAs, the plaintiffs’ security interest in the Charged Shares ceased to subsist after 31 December 2012.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether cl 5 of each SCA was effectively amended by the Supplemental Deeds</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 In their closing submissions, the plaintiffs suggested that the effect of cl 5 of the SCAs was not the end of the matter. They relied on the Supplemental Deeds, which had been executed by Horie on behalf of HJS and HJK, and returned to the plaintiffs on 22 January 2013 (see [47]–[48] above). Save for the names of the security holder and the definition of the “Share Charge”, cl 3 of the four Supplemental Deeds are identical in substance. They each read as follows:

</div> Thus, the SCAs continue to have full force and effect, and the plaintiffs’ security interest created thereunder continues to subsist for an indeterminate period until HJP makes repayment in full. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 I agree that if the amendment were effective, the SCAs would continue to subsist until terminated by agreement or by full and irrevocable satisfaction. The terms “continuing security” and “repayment in full” should be given their meanings as ordinarily understood. The deletion of the fixed expiry date in cl 5 would also mean that cl 6.1 of the SCAs, which refers to the satisfaction of the secured obligations “prior to or on the termination of this Deed”, should no longer be read in a restrictive manner to mean “prior to or on” 31 December 2012. Rather, “termination” would take place either by agreement or by full and irrevocable satisfaction and until then, the SCAs would continue to subsist. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 However, the plaintiffs only pleaded the SCAs and did not mention the Supplemental Deeds in their statement of claim. Neither did they plead that the validity of the SCAs had been extended by the Supplemental Deeds. The Supplemental Deeds were mentioned only in evidence and in the closing submissions of the plaintiffs. Accordingly, I am of the view that the plaintiffs are not entitled to rely on the Supplemental Deeds. That being the case, as the SCAs expired on 31 December 2012, the plaintiffs’ security interest in the Charged Shares no longer subsists. Therefore, insofar as the plaintiffs’ claims are premised on their having at least a security interest in the Charged Shares, such claims must fail from the outset.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 Even if the plaintiffs’ pleadings do not preclude the plaintiffs from relying on the Supplemental Deeds, there is a further obstacle. The Supplemental Deeds had only been executed by a representative of the chargors (Horie, and witnessed by Kawai), but not by any representative of the chargees (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, Akimoto or Sato),

</div> even though the Supplemental Deeds were between the chargors and the chargees and the format of the documents suggested that the Deeds were supposed to be executed by both sides.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 However, the plaintiffs argued that the Supplemental Deeds nonetheless have legal effect, relying on the sole authority of <span class="font-italic">Wayne Edward John </span><span class="font-italic">Streat v Fantastic Holdings Limited</span> [2011] NSWSC 1097 (“<span class="font-italic">Wayne Edward</span>”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 The facts of <span class="font-italic">Wayne Edward </span>are these. The defendant had been the plaintiff’s tenant since 1 July 2002. From September 2010, parties commenced negotiations for a new lease. Most of these negotiations took place in September and October 2010 over emails. On 20 January 2011, the plaintiff sent the defendant a formal lease document embodying the terms proposed by the defendant on 20 October 2010, as well as other standard terms that were identical to or materially the same as the existing lease. The defendant executed the lease and returned it to the plaintiff on 1 March 2011. However, the plaintiff did not execute the lease. Subsequently, the plaintiff attempted to withdraw from the lease. The defendant sought an order for specific performance. In response, the plaintiff contended that the parties had not intended to be bound by the lease until both parties had executed it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 The New South Wales Supreme Court observed that in determining whether the parties intended not to be bound until execution by both parties, it was necessary to assess “the objective intention of the parties as disclosed in their correspondence and communications viewed in light of the subject matter and the surrounding circumstances” (see <span class="font-italic">Wayne Edward</span> at [11]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 The court found that by 1 March 2011, if not also by 20 January 2011, the parties had come to an agreement on all of the terms of the lease. No terms remained for further negotiation, and nothing remained outstanding other than execution. When the plaintiff provided the defendant with the lease document, it was making a final offer in a form capable of acceptance, leaving nothing for further negotiation. The defendant’s subsequent execution of the lease and return of it to the plaintiff signified its unqualified acceptance of that offer. In such circumstances, “a reasonable bystander would regard the due execution of the document by the lessor as a formality; whose inevitable likelihood went without saying”: <span class="font-italic">Wayne Edward </span>at [13]. Thus the court inferred from the objective facts that the parties would have regarded themselves bound by the terms of the lease document that had been executed by the defendant and returned to the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 I would caution against applying such an approach in a mechanistic manner. The offer and acceptance analysis may be simplistic. It does not follow that when a party sends a document to be signed by the counter-party and the counter-party signs it without objection, there would necessarily be an offer and acceptance constituting an agreement without the need for the first party to sign the agreement. Indeed the more persuasive view may be that the signature of the counter-party is the offer and the signature of the first party, if provided, would constitute the acceptance. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 Further, in the context of commercial relationships, I would have thought that the parties to a written agreement would normally expect each party to sign that agreement in order for it to come into effect and be binding on all the parties. There is no evidence to suggest a departure from this expectation at the time Horie (representing the chargors, HJS and HJK) signed the Supplemental Deeds. The decision in <span class="font-italic">Wayne Edward </span>should be confined to its facts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 After closing submissions were exchanged, the parties in the present case were invited to make further submissions on the relevance of the Scottish case of <span class="font-italic">W </span><span class="font-italic">S Karoulias, SA Pursuer v The Drambuie Liqueur Co Ltd (No.2)</span> 2005 SCLR 1014 (“<span class="font-italic">Karoulias</span>”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 In <span class="font-italic">Karoulias</span>, the plaintiff brought an action seeking specific implementation of an exclusive distribution agreement that had been allegedly concluded with defendant on 5 February 2003. The plaintiff’s basis for this was the fact that the plaintiff had sent an email to the defendant on 5 February 2003, in response to a final draft agreement sent by the defendant. That email stated: “Many thanks for the above final draft which is ok with thanks from us. So pls. send us two copies for signing.” However, the defendant never sent the signing copies to the plaintiff and the agreement ultimately remained unsigned by both parties (<span class="font-italic">Karoulias</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [8]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 The court held that the parties had reached <span class="font-italic">ad idem</span> on 5 February 2003 in the sense that there was nothing further to be discussed or agreed. However, the court held that there was nonetheless no <span class="font-italic">binding</span> agreement because the parties did not intend to be bound by the agreement until it had been formally executed. In arriving at this conclusion, the court evaluated the way in which the parties had conducted their contractual dealings in the past, and observed that they regulated their contractual arrangements with a significant degree of formality. The court had before it three written agreements between the parties dating back to 1990, all of which had been signed by both sides. From this, the court noted that “[t]here was certainly nothing in the way that the parties had dealt with each other, in the past, to lead [the plaintiff] to believe that they would consider themselves bound before formal execution of the relevant agreement” (see <span class="font-italic">Karoulias</span> at [50]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 I agree with the proposition stated in <span class="font-italic">Karoulias</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [50] that the question of whether there is a binding agreement without execution by one party depends on whether it was the intention of both sides that execution by that party is not necessary.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 In the present case, the parties’ past contractual dealings makes clear that they had consistently chosen to regulate their contractual arrangements with a significant degree of formality. There were at least 20 agreements or legal documents which preceded 22 January 2013 (the date that the Supplemental Deeds were entered into) that were in evidence before this court. All of these agreements or legal documents had been formally executed by either the first or second plaintiff on the one hand, and either a member of the Honjin Group (comprising the first, second and third defendants) or Kawai (the beneficial owner of the Honjin Group) on the other. These 20 documents, which included the four SCAs, were set out in FGH’s further reply submissions at para 29.

</div>
</div> It is not necessary for me to reproduce the entire list here. It suffices to say that these 20 agreements, which spanned the period from June 2010 to June 2012, demonstrated that the plaintiffs and the Honjin Group had a clear and consistent practice of formally executing agreements. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 Insofar as the plaintiffs argue that the Supplemental Deeds are binding despite the lack of execution by both sides, the burden is on them to show that parties had intended to depart from this practice of formally executing agreements. In my view, they have not discharged this burden. The plaintiffs have not shown that the parties had intended, at the time the Supplemental Deeds were entered into, to treat the Supplemental Deeds any differently from the 20 agreements or legal documents that preceded them.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 In fact, it appears that the objective evidence contradicts the plaintiffs’ case. The Supplemental Deeds had been prepared by the plaintiffs, apparently with legal assistance from Rajah &amp; Tann Singapore LLP. Akimoto emailed Horie on 18 January 2013, attaching drafts of the four Supplemental Deeds. In his cover email, Akimoto requested Horie to examine the drafts attached and told Horie that the plaintiffs “[would] like to have signatures on this agreement”. Thus, he would “like to visit [Horie] to explain the contents and discuss the future before signing, if possible.”

</div> In my view, this strongly suggests that, at least, the plaintiffs had no intention of departing from the practice of both sides having to formally execute each agreement between them for that agreement to be binding.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 There is another point to be made. The plaintiffs argued that equity treats as done what ought to be done: all that was left for them to do was to sign on the Supplemental Deeds, and there was no uncertainty at any time as to the subject matter of the SCAs or the Supplemental Deeds. Thus, the Supplemental Deeds should be considered binding even if the plaintiffs did not sign them.

</div>
</div> This argument does not add anything to <span class="font-italic">Wayne Edward</span> because it does not adequately answer the question as to what is meant by “ought to be done”. Furthermore, if the equitable maxim is indeed applicable in the manner suggested by the plaintiff, it must mean that so long as the counter-party signs a document received from the first party, a contract would <span class="font-italic">necessarily</span> be concluded and binding at that time without the first party countersigning it. That, in my view, is too broad a legal proposition to be correct. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 In my view, where the party who has not executed the contract is alleging that the contract is nonetheless effective and binding, equity will intervene to assist in a limited number of ways. The first is through the doctrine of part performance: despite the parties’ failure to comply with the requisite formalities in executing the contract, equity may intervene if the party who alleges that the contract is binding has partly-performed his obligations under the contract. However, the plaintiffs did not plead part performance and it was never part of their case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 The second manner in which equity may intervene is through the doctrine of estoppel by convention. As set out in <span class="font-italic">Singapore </span><span class="font-italic">Telecommunications v Starhub Cable Vision Ltd </span>[2006] 2 SLR(R) 195 at [28], estoppel by convention arises where the parties to a transaction act on an assumed state of affairs, the assumption being one which both parties share or one that is made by one party and acquiesced in by the other. If these requirements are satisfied then the parties are precluded from denying the truth of that assumption if it would be unjust or unconscionable to allow them (or one of them) to go back on it. The plaintiffs appear to allude to this in their further submissions: it was argued that because HJS and HJK had never sought the return of the Charged Shares after 31 December 2012, this was a “clear acknowledgment” on their part that the plaintiffs were entitled to retain the Charged Shares until the Loans have been fully repaid.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 It is true that neither HJS nor HJK had asked the plaintiffs to return the Original Share Certificates which they had delivered to the plaintiffs on 14 June 2012. It seems to me that if HJS and HJK had truly thought that the plaintiffs’ security interests in the Charged Shares had expired, they would have made such a request of the plaintiffs. To the contrary, HJS and HJK signed and delivered the Blank NCJV Share Transfer Forms to the plaintiffs on 22 January 2013 (see [49] above). This suggests that HJS and HJK thought that the plaintiffs’ security interests under the SCAs still subsisted even after 31 December 2012. However, again the plaintiffs did not specifically plead that HJS’s and HJK’s conduct subsequent to 31 December 2012 gave rise to an estoppel by convention. Therefore, they would have been precluded from relying on this estoppel. As the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Sarah Ellen Mulholland v Roger Philip Edmonds</span> [1998] SGHC 8 observed (at [17], citing Edward Bullen <span class="font-italic">et al</span>, <span class="font-italic">Bullen</span><span class="font-italic"> &amp; Leake &amp; Jacob’s Precedents of Pleadings</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 13th Ed, 1990) at p 1148): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Every estoppel must be specifically pleaded, not only because it is a material fact, but also because it raises matters which might take the opposite party by surprise, and usually raises issues of fact not arising out of the preceding pleadings. ... It is not, however, necessary to plead estoppel in any special form so long as the matter constituting the estoppel is stated in such a manner as to show that the party pleading relies upon it as a defence or answer. ... On the other hand, where a party omits to plead the defence of estoppel, when he has the opportunity of doing so, he cannot thereafter rely on it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 To summarise, my findings above are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Based on the proper interpretation of both the short and long versions of cl 5, the plaintiffs’ security interest in the Charged Shares ceased to subsist after 31 December 2012 because the SCAs had expired as of that date.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The plaintiffs are not entitled to rely on the Supplemental Deeds to argue that their security interests in the Charged Shares under the SCAs were extended beyond 31 December 2012 because they did not plead the existence of the Supplemental Deeds, let alone their effect on the SCAs.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) In any event, even if the plaintiffs were entitled to raise the Supplemental Deeds for the above proposition, the Supplemental Deeds were not binding on the parties thereto because the plaintiffs did not sign the same.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 Accordingly, the plaintiffs do not have any subsisting security interest in the Charged Shares at present. Since the plaintiffs’ causes of action in dishonest assistance, knowing receipt, and their equitable proprietary claim for the return of the Charged Shares are all premised on the subsistence of their security interest in the Charged Shares, their claims necessarily fail at the outset. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the plaintiffs’ security interest in the Charged Shares is an equitable mortgage or an equitable charge</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 However, even assuming that the plaintiffs <span class="font-italic">do</span> have a subsisting security interest in the Charged Shares, the plaintiffs have to establish that they have a beneficial interest (in the trust sense) in the Charged Shares. This would raise the question whether the plaintiffs’ security interest should be properly characterised as an equitable mortgage or an equitable charge. However, I do not propose to delve substantively into this issue because even if I were to assume that it were an equitable mortgage, that would not without more give rise to a trust relationship, as I elaborate on below. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether a trust relationship arises by mere virtue of the equitable mortgage</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 This brings me to the third premise upon which the plaintiffs argue that a trust relationship exists between them and HJS and HJK in respect of the Charged Shares: that such a trust relationship arises by mere virtue of the equitable mortgage (which I assume to be) subsisting between the parties.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 I first set out some basic legal principles relating to mortgages. Broadly speaking, there are two kinds of mortgages – legal and equitable. A legal mortgage over a subject property involves a transfer of legal <span class="font-italic">and</span> equitable ownership from the mortgagor to the mortgagee, subject to the mortgagor’s retained equity of redemption. In contrast, for an equitable mortgage, only the equitable ownership of the subject matter of the security is transferred to the mortgagee; legal ownership as well as the equity of redemption remain with the mortgagor (William Gough, <span class="font-italic">Company Charges</span> (Butterworths, 2nd Ed, 1996) (“<span class="font-italic">Gough</span>”) at pp 16–18). An equitable mortgage can arise in various situations, including: (a) where the parties intend to create a legal mortgage but fail to comply with the necessary formalities to transfer the legal title in the property; (b) where there is an agreement to give a legal mortgage in the future over the asset in question; or (c) where the mortgagor merely had an equitable interest and could therefore only transfer an equitable interest (see Hugh Beale <span class="font-italic">et al</span>, <span class="font-italic">The Law of Security and Title-based Financing</span> (Oxford University Press, 2nd Ed, 2012) at para 6.07). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 The plaintiffs argued that because the SCAs created an equitable mortgage over the Charged Shares, the legal and equitable ownership in the Charged Shares had separated. HJS and HJK therefore held the Charged Shares on trust for the plaintiffs. However, the plaintiffs were unable to cite any authority that stands directly for the proposition that a trust relationship arises between an equitable mortgagor and an equitable mortgagee in respect of the mortgaged property merely by virtue of that equitable mortgage. The plaintiffs first pointed to <span class="font-italic">Walter </span><span class="font-italic">Woon on Company Law </span>(Tan Cheng Han, ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, Rev 3rd Ed, 2009) (“<span class="font-italic">Woon</span>”) at paras 11.111–11.112:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Where shares have been sold but have not been registered in the name of the purchaser, the person whose name is on the register of members remains the legal owner of the shares …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The delivery of a share certificate with a blank transfer to a purchaser gives him an equitable interest in the shares. In such a case, <span class="font-italic">the person whose name is on the register remains the legal owner of the shares and holds them on trust for the purchaser</span>. The purchaser has an inchoate title to the shares which can be perfected by registration.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 This proposition in <span class="font-italic">Woon</span>, however, was made in the context of a <span class="font-italic">sale</span> of shares. Similarly, the other two authorities cited by the plaintiffs, <span class="font-italic">Hawks v McArthur and others</span> [1951] 1 All ER 22 and <span class="font-italic">Lim Eng Yong v Lim Chin Swee</span> [1898–9] V SSLR 4, also concerned sales of shares. I am of the view that those authorities do not assist the plaintiffs as the present case concerns a mortgage of shares. Purchasers and mortgagors stand in quite different positions. A purchaser acquires an <span class="font-italic">absolute</span> interest in the subject property. However, a mortgagee only acquires a <span class="font-italic">limited </span>interest in the subject property – his interest in the mortgaged property is only co-extensive with his interest in the underlying debt obligation in respect of which the mortgage was given as security. I elaborate more on this below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 The plaintiffs’ submission rests on the premise that the separation of the legal and equitable ownership in an asset <span class="font-italic">always</span> creates a trust. To that end, they relied on extra-judicial observations made by Lord Peter Millett in “Restitution and Constructive Trust” (1998) 114 LQR 399 (at pp 403–404):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is necessary to begin with two elementary observations. <span class="font-italic">The first is that a trust exists whenever the legal title is in one party and the equitable title in another. The legal owner is said to hold the property </span><span class="font-italic">in trust for the equitable owner.</span> Lord Browne-Wilkinson denied this in the <span class="font-italic">Westdeutsche</span><span class="font-italic"> Landesbank</span> case and gave examples where he said this was not the case. Of these examples, however, only two were cases where one party held the bare legal title and the other the entire beneficial interest, and with respect neither is convincing. One was the case where title to land is acquired by estoppel as against the legal owner. If the estoppel operates at law, however, then the full legal and beneficial title is in the party holding by estoppel, while if it operates in equity only it is a classic example of a constructive trust. The other is the case of the mortgagor who has paid off the mortgage. Lord Browne-Wilkinson pointed out that the mortgagor enforces his right to recover the mortgaged property by a redemption action and not by an action for breach of trust. But this proves nothing. The purchaser of land enforces his right to obtain the land by an action for specific performance, not by an action for breach of trust; but the vendor holds the land on a constructive trust for the purchaser. Indeed, the right to specific performance demonstrates the existence of the constructive trust. The form of action is irrelevant. What matters is the nature of the obligation which is enforceable by equity.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 I note that this section of Lord Millett’s lecture criticising Lord Browne-Wilkinson’s <span class="font-italic">obiter</span> comments in <span class="font-italic">Westdeutsche</span><span class="font-italic"> Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington London BC </span>[1996] 2 All ER 961 (“<span class="font-italic">Westdeutsche</span>”) has been accorded judicial recognition by the English Court of Appeal (see <span class="font-italic">Independent Trustee Services Ltd v GP Noble Trustees Ltd and others </span>[2012] 3 All ER 210<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [82]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 The plaintiffs also cited Gary Watt, <span class="font-italic">Trusts and Equity</span> (Oxford University Press, 7th Ed, 2016) at pp 25–26 to support the proposition that a trust arises whenever there is a separation of legal and equitable ownership:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">To put it another way, <span class="font-italic">whenever there is a split between legal and beneficial ownership there will inevitably be a trust as a matter of property law</span>, but as a matter of obligations law, the parties will frequently be bound by sets of obligations, whether established by contract or statute, more sophisticated than the crude obligation of a bare trustee to account to his beneficiary for the trust property on demand.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The creation of trusts must be distinguished from their effects on third parties. <span class="font-italic">The separation of legal title from equitable property necessarily creates a trust</span> – it might be helpful to picture trust creation as the process of splitting the formal/external legal title from the beneficial/inner equitable interest, as if one were peeling the skin off a banana.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 It is not clear to me that the proposition stated by Lord Millett and Professor Watt was intended to apply in the context of equitable mortgages. In disclaiming that a trust exists whenever legal title is in one party and equitable title in another party, Lord Browne-Wilkinson in <span class="font-italic">Westdeutsche</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>observed (at 988) that a mortgagor who has repaid his debt reclaims his property by way of a redemption action and not a claim in breach of trust (see [140] above). I accept that there is force in Lord Millett’s observation that this example does not, in itself, negate the possibility that a trust exists as between that mortgagor and mortgagee. However, with respect, Lord Millett’s observations equally did not go so far as to suggest that a trust arises between an equitable mortgagor and an equitable mortgagee by mere virtue of the existence of an equitable mortgage. At most, taking Lord Millet’s and Lord Browne-Wilkinson’s observations together, the fact that a mortgagor reclaims his property by a redemption action and not a claim in breach of trust neither proves nor disproves the existence of a trust between the mortgagor and the mortgagee. In relation to Professor Watt’s comments, with respect, it is not clear whether and how the distinction should be drawn between a trust arising “as a matter of property law”, and some “more sophisticated” set of obligations arising “as a matter of obligations law”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 In any event, I am hesitant to adopt the plaintiffs’ broad proposition that a trust relationship arises in every equitable mortgage. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 First, there are at least three ways in which an equitable mortgage can arise (see [137] above). In relation to an equitable mortgage that arises because the mortgagor only had an equitable interest in the subject property to begin with, there must <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">hypothesi </span>be a third party who is neither the mortgagor nor the mortgagee, but who holds the legal interest in the subject property. In such a situation, to hold that a trust relationship necessarily arises out of an equitable mortgage would mean that the third party (who is <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">hypothesi </span>the trustee) holds the subject property on trust for the mortgagee (who would <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">hypothesi </span>be the beneficiary) even though the third party may not even be aware of the existence of the mortgage or the mortgagee.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 Secondly, it does not appear principled or appropriate to impose on equitable mortgagors additional fiduciary duties which a legal mortgagor would not bear, when it is not always within the control of the mortgagor to determine the nature of the mortgage. To hold that a trust arises by virtue of every equitable mortgage would mean that an equitable mortgagee would be protected by fiduciary obligations, while a legal mortgagee is not. To the extent that the law should encourage proper compliance with the formalities of a mortgage, to place an equitable mortgagee in a more favourable position than a legal mortgagee may create distortive incentives.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 Thirdly, it is not clear what the nature of this trust would be. Consequential issues arise depending on the response. If this is an express trust, given the absolutist position taken by the plaintiffs that a trust arises in every equitable mortgage, a question arises as to whether every mortgage document evinces the requisite certainty of intention to create a trust. If this is a constructive trust, the basis on which the court should or would superimpose such a trust on an equitable mortgage is unclear (see, generally, Tang Hang Wu, “The Constructive Trust in Singapore: Five Persistent Puzzles” (2010) 22 SAcLJ 136 at pp 152–159). These unresolved issues do not necessarily negate the plaintiffs’ submissions, but they raise serious questions as to the scope and precision of the proposition that a trust arises in every equitable mortgage. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 More importantly, there appears to be a fundamental and principled distinction between a creditor-debtor relationship and a trust relationship. A mortgage, whether legal or equitable, is a security interest. In this context, the term “security”, while perhaps susceptible of more than one meaning, has a “narrower primary meaning” of security for the payment or claim, either by “a right to resort to some fund or property for payment or by a guarantee to some person t<span class="font-italic">o satisfy the debt or claim for which another person is primarily liable</span>” [emphasis added] (see <span class="font-italic">Gough </span>at p 3). On this definition, the mortgage, being a right to resort to a subject property in assurance of an underlying debt obligation, is ancillary upon and inseparable from the underlying creditor-debtor relationship. In short, if there is no debt, there can be no mortgage. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 On this premise, even though the mortgagee may be described in some texts as the “equitable owner” of the subject property, or as holding the “beneficial interest” in, or the “beneficial title” to, the subject property, the mortgagee’s interest in that property is only co-extensive with his interest in the underlying debt obligation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 The concept of a trust is quite different. First, the existence of a trust is not necessarily dependent on the co-existence of an underlying debt obligation. Second, even though a security and a trust may share functional similarities as assurances to the secured creditor and beneficiary in the event of the debtor’s or trustee’s insolvency, the nature of the interest held by a beneficiary is conceptually distinct from that held by a secured creditor. The beneficiary’s interest is in, and to the extent of, the <span class="font-italic">trust property</span>; the secured creditor’s interest is in and to the extent of, the <span class="font-italic">underlying debt obligation</span>. The secured creditor does not strictly speaking “own” the subject property. Rather, he or she has a <span class="font-italic">priority</span> to the subject property to satisfy the underlying debt. Thus, in the event of default by the debtor, if the amount of the debt is less than the value of the security, the excess proceeds upon realisation of the security belong to the debtor (or his estate) and not the secured creditor; however, if the amount of the debt exceeds the value of the security, the outstanding sum after realisation of the security remains due and owing by the debtor to the secured creditor.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 The distinctions between the interest under a security and the interest under a trust are described in <span class="font-italic">Goode on Legal Problems of Credit and Security</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(Louise Gullifer ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 5th Ed, 2013)<span class="font-italic"> </span>(at para 1-36): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is … possible for a person to grant an interest in his asset which is not a security interest but an absolute interest. The difference between the two types of interest has two aspects. First, a security interest is always granted to secure an obligation, whereas an absolute interest may be (but need not be) transferred in fulfilment of an existing or future indebtedness or other obligation. Thus, if an interest is to be a security interest, it is necessary to identify a separate obligation which is secured by the grant. Secondly, the security interest is limited to its security function, so that it is defeasible if the secured obligation is paid, and only extends as far as is necessary to secure the obligation, so that on enforcement the grantor is entitled to any surplus value. Further, if, on enforcement, the amount realised is less than the obligation secured, the balance remains payable [by the debtor to the secured creditor].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 Further support for the conceptual distinction between a mortgage (including an equitable mortgage) and a trust can be found in <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s</span><span class="font-italic"> Laws of Singapore</span>, vol 9(3) (LexisNexis, 2017 Reissue)<span class="font-italic"> </span>(“<span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s</span>”) (at para 110.434): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A trust may be distinguished from a mortgage in the same way as a charge. A mortgage may be constituted by way of charge or by a transfer of the property to the mortgagee subject to a re-transfer on payment or satisfaction or discharge of the mortgage debt. <span class="font-italic">Unless the mortgage instrument expressly so states, the mortgagee does not hold the property on trust for the mortgagor, although the mortgagor has </span><span class="font-italic">an equity of redemption</span> … <span class="font-italic">In the case of an equitable mortgage, whether constituted by agreement or by deposit of the title deeds to the property, it is not uncommon for the mortgagor to declare that he holds the legal estate on trust for the mortgagee</span> so that the mortgagee may call for the legal estate to be vested in the mortgagee with a view to selling the property in the event of default by the mortgagor.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 The statement in <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s</span> that “it is not uncommon” for an equitable mortgagor to declare that he holds the legal title to the subject property on trust for the equitable mortgagee implies two things. First, it is not <span class="font-italic">necessarily</span><span class="font-italic"> the case</span> that a trust relationship arises between an equitable mortgagor and an equitable mortgagee. Secondly, the concepts of trusts and equitable mortgages are not mutually exclusive – the parties to an equitable mortgage may agree to the creation of a trust which concurrently governs their relationship, and <span class="font-italic">vice versa</span>. However, again, there is no necessary causation between the two concepts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 I come now to the English Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Re Lehman Brothers International (Europe) (No. 2) </span>[2009] EWCA Civ 1161 (“<span class="font-italic">Lehman </span><span class="font-italic">Brothers</span>”). The issue in <span class="font-italic">Lehman Brothers</span> was whether certain persons fell within the scope of s 899 of the Companies Act 2006 (c 46) (UK) which empowered the court to sanction a scheme of arrangement proposed between a company and its “creditors”. The English Court of Appeal held that the term “creditors” in that provision ought to be given its plain meaning – which the court defined to be “someone to whom money is owed” (at [59]). The court then unanimously held that clients of the company who had beneficial interests in property held by the company on trust for them were not “creditors”, and stood in a distinct position from secured creditors of the company (at [65] and [75]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 Even though <span class="font-italic">Lehman Brothers </span>was, strictly speaking, only concerned with the determination of whether a beneficiary is a “creditor” (and not the converse question of whether a secured creditor is a beneficiary), the principles therein are broad enough for extrapolation and application to the present case. In particular, Lord Neuberger MR (as he then was) held (at [82]) that “a secured creditor <span class="font-italic">merely has the right to look to his security to enable his debt to be repaid, but unlike the beneficiary</span><span class="font-italic"> in relation to the trust property, he does not own the security</span>.” Interestingly, this was the same paragraph that the plaintiffs cited in their further submissions when they appeared to accept that a creditor-debtor relationship does not give rise to a trust relationship.

</div> To get around this, the plaintiffs pursued a different approach to establish a trust in their favour, as I will elaborate on later (see [162] below).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">156 The decision of <span class="font-italic">Lehman Brothers</span> therefore affirms the fundamental conceptual distinction between the nature of the interest held by a secured creditor of a debt in relation to the subject property, and that held by a beneficiary of a trust in relation to that property. In short, a secured creditor is not a beneficiary of the subject property in the trust sense. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">157 For the foregoing reasons, I would have dismissed the arguments raised in the plaintiffs’ closing submissions that a trust arose over the Charged Shares by virtue of the equitable mortgage created by the SCAs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 In the circumstances, the plaintiffs’ first two causes of action against the various defendants in dishonest assistance and knowing receipt must fail, since the shared premise of both of these causes of action has not been established: HJS and HJK did not hold the Charged Shares on trust for the plaintiffs.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 2: Whether the plaintiffs can rely on their case that a trust or fiduciary relationship arose by virtue of HJS’s and HJK’s alleged unconscionable conduct</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">159 As mentioned at [87] above, the plaintiffs claimed against Wong, Neo, and/or Boo for dishonest assistance of breach of trust, and against HYH and/or the Sub-purchasers for knowing receipt.

This induced the plaintiffs not to register the Charged Shares in their names and to refrain from enforcing their security. In turn, this gave HJS and HJK the opportunity to sell the Charged Shares to the Purchasers and Sub-purchasers. Kawai continued to assure the plaintiffs that he was looking for a buyer of the Charged Shares for the benefit of the plaintiffs, all the way until March 2013 (see [44]–[51] above).

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">172 This was a significant divergence from the plaintiffs’ pleadings as developed in their closing submissions. The plaintiffs had not pleaded unconscionability as the basis for the trust over the Charged Shares or a fiduciary relationship between the parties. In fact, the plaintiffs’ case had been premised on the SCAs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">173 First, I refer to the salient portions of the Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 2). In para 18, the plaintiffs pleaded that HJS and HJK had “charged” to the plaintiffs their total beneficial ownership of 3.3 million NCJV shares. The particulars in para 18 then set out details relating to the four SCAs: how many shares were charged, the identities of the chargors and chargees, and the dates of the SCAs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">174 In para 46, under the header “Knowledge of the plaintiffs’ prevailing interest”, the plaintiffs pleaded that at all material times, Yamada, Horie, Wong, Neo, and Boo knew and/or ought to have known of the plaintiffs’ “interests in the [SCAs] mentioned at paragraph 18 above”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">175 In para 48.1(b), the plaintiffs pleaded that several of the defendants were “in knowing receipt of the Charged Shares in NCJV which they knew and/or ought to have known were subject to the [plaintiffs’] prevailing interests.” The phrase “prevailing interests” was not defined in the statement of claim. The only other time that this phrase is used in the statement of claim is in the header of para 46. As mentioned, para 46 in turn refers back to para 18. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">176 It seems clear from the foregoing that para 18 of the statement of claim is the foundation of the plaintiffs’ various causes of action in knowing receipt, dishonest assistance, and their equitable proprietary claim. But para 18 only pleaded the existence and terms of the four SCAs. There was no mention of any alleged unconscionable conduct on the part of HJS and HJK in para 18.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">177 The other paragraphs of the statement of claim referred to above were vague. When the plaintiffs mentioned their “interests” or “prevailing interests” in the Charged Shares, were they referring to <span class="font-italic">security</span> interests or <span class="font-italic">equitable</span> interests? Or were they referring specifically to a trust? This was not clear from the statement of claim. Nevertheless, it is clear from para 18 that the plaintiffs were pleading that their interest in the Charged Shares (however it was to be characterised) had arisen <span class="font-italic">by virtue of</span> <span class="font-italic">the SCAs</span>. The plaintiffs did not plead in para 18 or any other part of the statement of claim that a trust or a fiduciary relationship had arisen <span class="font-italic">by virtue of </span><span class="font-italic">unconscionable conduct</span> <span class="font-italic">of HJS and HJK</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">178 Although the plaintiffs did plead the alleged unconscionable conduct of HJS and HJK at paras 27 to 31A of the statement of claim, the plaintiffs did not plead that such conduct formed the basis of the constructive trust over the Charged Shares, or that such conduct gave rise to a fiduciary relationship between HJS and HJK on the one hand, and the plaintiffs on the other. This point only surfaced very belatedly in the plaintiffs’ further submissions and was then repeated in their further reply submissions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">179 Accordingly, I am of the view that the plaintiffs are not entitled to rely on HJS’s and HJK’s alleged unconscionable conduct as creating a constructive trust over the Charged Shares, or as giving rise to a fiduciary relationship. That being the case, I say no more about the merits of the plaintiffs’ arguments as developed in their further submissions and further reply submissions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">180 For avoidance of doubt, this means that I have only considered the plaintiffs’ case as pleaded and developed in their closing submissions – that their security interest in the Charged Shares created by the SCAs subsists, should be characterised as an equitable mortgage, and gives rise to a trust over the Charged Shares in the plaintiffs’ favour (see [96]–[158] above). I have found that the plaintiffs’ security interest in the Charged Shares no longer subsists (see [134] above). Even if their security interest subsisted and were to be characterised as an equitable mortgage, a trust over the Charged Shares in the plaintiffs’ favour did not arise merely by virtue of the equitable mortgage over the same (see [158] above). On either of these bases, the plaintiffs’ first two causes of action in dishonest assistance and knowing receipt would fail.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 3: Whether Wong, Neo, and/or Boo are liable for dishonest assistance of breach of trust</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">181 Even assuming that a trust and/or fiduciary relationship existed between the plaintiffs on the one hand, and HJS and HJK on the other, in respect of the Charged Shares, I do not think that the outcome would be any different. In my view, Wong, Neo, and Boo did not act <span class="font-italic">dishonestly</span> and the claim for dishonest assistance would have failed on this independent basis.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The law on dishonest assistance of breach of trust</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">182 The elements required to establish a claim for dishonest assistance of a breach of trust are as follows: (a) there was a trust; (b) there was a breach of that trust; (c) the defendant rendered assistance towards that breach; and (d) the assistance rendered by the defendant was dishonest: <span class="font-italic">George Raymond </span><span class="font-italic">Zage III and another v Ho Chi Kwong and another</span> [2010] 2 SLR 589 (“<span class="font-italic">GRZ III</span>”) at [20], citing <span class="font-italic">Caltong</span><span class="font-italic"> (Australia) Pty Ltd v Tong Tien See Construction Pte Ltd</span> [2002] 2 SLR(R) 94 (“<span class="font-italic">Caltong</span>”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">183 I have found that no trust or fiduciary relationship arose (see [157]–[158] above).

The question is what these obligations are and whether they have been breached.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">185 The plaintiffs submitted that the fiduciary obligations owed by HJS and HJK were two-fold: first, the duty not to transfer the legal title in the Charged Shares without reference to the Plaintiffs; and secondly, the duty not to undermine the plaintiffs’ equitable interest in the Charged Shares.

</div> Neither do Neo and Boo appear to dispute this element. Accordingly, each of the transfers listed in the table at [189] above would constitute a breach of trust.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">191 There is one more point to be made about the table above. The last column, labelled “Date of effective transfer”, lists the dates from which each respective transferee was reflected as a member on NCJV’s register of members. Where registered shares are concerned, legal title in a share of a company incorporated under the Companies Act is vested in the person to whom the share is issued or transferred <span class="font-italic">and</span> whose name is on the register of members in respect of that share: <span class="font-italic">Woon</span> at para 11.108. Accordingly, the date from which the transferee is reflected as a member on the company’s register is the date from which legal ownership in the transferred shares vests in the transferee. Presumably, this is so even though the new share certificates were not issued or were issued later, and shareholder details were only updated with the ACRA subsequently. In any event, the parties proceeded on the premise that the date of transfer stated in the register of members was the date of effective transfer and I will proceed on that basis. Therefore, the breaches of trust by HJS and HJK (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the transfers of Charged Shares originating from HJS and HJK) are to be taken as having occurred on the date of effective transfer. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether Wong, Neo, and/or Boo rendered dishonest assistance towards the breach of trust</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The law on dishonesty</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">192 Dishonesty is established if the defendant has such knowledge of the irregular shortcomings of the transactions that ordinary honest people would consider it to be a breach of standards of honest conduct if he failed to adequately query them: <span class="font-italic">GRZ III</span> at [22], affirming <span class="font-italic">Barlow </span><span class="font-italic">Clowes International Ltd (in liquidation) v Eurotrust International Ltd</span> [2006] 1 All ER (Comm) 478 (“<span class="font-italic">Barlow </span><span class="font-italic">Clowes</span>”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">193 The Privy Council in <span class="font-italic">Barlow </span><span class="font-italic">Clowes</span> clarified that although a dishonest state of mind is a subjective mental state, the standard by which the law determines whether it is dishonest is objective.

The Privy Council noted that dishonesty was concerned with advertent conduct, not inadvertent conduct. Carelessness is not dishonesty. Thus for the most part dishonesty is to be equated with conscious impropriety (at 389D). Following from this, the Privy Council observed that acting in reckless disregard of other’s rights or possible rights could also be a tell-tale sign of dishonesty (at 390G), but that acting negligently would generally not suffice for the purpose of liability in dishonest assistance (at 392C).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">195 Subsequent to <span class="font-italic">Royal Brunei</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the House of Lords decision of <span class="font-italic">Twinsectra</span><span class="font-italic"> Ltd v Yardley </span>[2002] 2 All ER 377 (“<span class="font-italic">Twinsectra</span>”) confirmed that negligence is not a sufficient condition for liability in dishonest assistance (at [111]–[113]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Behind the confusion there lay a critical issue: whether negligence alone was sufficient to impose liability on the accessory.

</div> Accordingly, the share transfers <span class="font-italic">per se</span> were not so extraordinary an occurrence.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Application of law to the facts</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">208 Having regard to all the evidence, I am of the view that although Wong did sign the various NCJV BOD resolutions and share transfer forms in connection with the BPA and subsequent SPAs, he was not dishonest.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">209 The first pillar of the plaintiffs’ case is that Wong <span class="font-italic">should have</span> realised from the Email Chain (or at least its subject title) that some arrangement involving the use of the NCJV shares registered in HJS’s and HJK’s names as security was being put together. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">210 It appears from the evidence that Wong did not in fact apply his mind to the subject title of the Email Chain or the substantive content of the Email Chain until the commencement of the present proceedings. The question that then arises is whether Wong <span class="font-italic">should </span><span class="font-italic">have</span> read and attempted to understand the Email Chain and its subject title.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">211 I do not think that Wong should have been expected to do so. Although Wong was a director of NCJV, I accept his evidence that he was ultimately an outsider to the “Japanese clique” comprising Yamada, Yamamoto and other Japanese associates. More importantly, the Email Chain, being entirely in the Japanese language, was clearly intended to be communication amongst only those recipients who read the Japanese language and Wong was not one of them. Wong could not be expected to read through a lengthy email chain not intended for him, in a language foreign to him, just to look out for phrases that he might recognise as being identical to certain Chinese characters. His omission to do so, in my view, would not even be considered negligent. But even if it were negligent, as earlier observed at [194]–[195], that does not suffice to render Wong dishonest.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">212 Thus I am of the view that as of 8 June 2012, all that Wong knew and could be expected to know was that the Original Share Certificates had been delivered to Kawai. He did not know that such delivery was in fact in connection with an arrangement to use HJS’s and HJK’s NCJV shares as security for the Loans. He also did not know that those Certificates would be, and were in fact subsequently conveyed to the plaintiffs on 14 June 2012, where they remain until this day in the plaintiffs’ possession (see [207(e)] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">213 I would add that even if Wong knew of the plaintiffs’ security interest, which he did not, this did not necessarily mean that he had acted dishonestly.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">214 It is not disputed that the Original Share Certificates should have been returned to NCJV for cancellation prior to any subsequent transfers involving those shares. I also accept that Wong knew as much. Although Wong said he was not aware of Article 23, what he meant was that he was not aware of the details in that provision. He did not pretend to be unaware that each Original Share Certificate had to be returned for cancellation to effect a transfer. However, Wong’s evidence was that until 23 October 2013 when the present proceedings were commenced, he did not know that the Original Share Certificates had not in fact been returned to NCJV for cancellation. I accept his evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">215 This brings me to the second pillar of the plaintiffs’ case, which is that Wong should have ensured the return of the Original Share Certificates for cancellation, or asked to see the cancelled Original Share Certificates <span class="font-italic">prior</span> to approving the share transfers pursuant to the BPA or the subsequent SPAs. The plaintiffs say that because Wong failed to do so, he was dishonest.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">216 Critically, however, there was no evidence to prove that it is in the ordinary course of conduct for directors to personally ensure that the share certificates in the name of the transferor are returned for cancellation before approving a share transfer. There was also no evidence that directors are ordinarily expected to ask to see the cancelled share certificates before approving a share transfer. Neo and Lanie, who were present to give evidence at trial, were not asked whether such would be expected of a director, particularly one who had the benefit of being assisted by professional secretaries whose jobs were precisely to deal with these administrative matters. Neither was it put to Wong during cross-examination that a director, acting honestly, would have adopted such a course of conduct.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">217 In the absence of any evidence that it is in the ordinary course of conduct for directors to personally ensure the return of share certificates for cancellation, or to ask to see the cancelled share certificates prior to approving a share transfer, I cannot conclude that Wong was acting dishonestly by omitting to do so in respect of the Original Share Certificates. Rather, I am of the view that Wong was entitled to rely on Neo and Boo, the professional company secretaries (and by extension, Lanie), to ensure that these administrative matters were taken care of.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">218 There remains one point for me to address. The plaintiffs argued that Wong had admitted in cross-examination that he would have been put on notice as to whether the intended transfer of 350,000 NCJV shares from HJS to HYH would go through, given that he knew that the Original Share Certificates were with Kawai, and that they were required in order to effect a share transfer, but they had not in fact been produced.

How could he have been put on notice merely because no Original Share Certificate was produced for cancellation? The plaintiffs were conflating two different points.

First, the Court of Appeal in<span class="font-italic"> GRZ III</span> only mentioned this species of knowledge in the context of knowing receipt, not dishonest assistance (<span class="font-italic">GRZ III </span>at [40]). While the court observed that the thresholds for knowledge in both causes of action are very similar, they nonetheless remain conceptually distinct (<span class="font-italic">GRZ III</span> at [43]). Secondly, it is clear from case law that conscious or intentional impropriety is required. A failure to infer from the available facts, unless amounting to wilful blindness, is more akin to negligence, carelessness or a failure to make inquiries, which is undoubtedly insufficient to constitute dishonesty for the purposes of dishonest assistance (see [194]–[196] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">224 In any event, the plaintiffs’ first alternative argument can be disposed of on the same basis discussed at [211] above. Wong could not have been expected to read the Email Chain in a foreign language and discover from it that the plaintiffs had security interests in the NCJV shares held in HJS’s and HJK’s names. Wong therefore cannot be held liable for his alleged “failure” to infer. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">225 The plaintiffs’ second alternative argument was that Yamada’s knowledge of the SCAs and the plaintiffs’ security interest in the Charged Shares can be imputed to Wong.

The loan had been arranged by one Ricky Goh – he was not a director of the defendant company, but had procured its incorporation to hold property for his other business plans.

</div> I do not accept the broader proposition of law suggested by the plaintiffs (at [225] above). That broader proposition is, in my view, inconsistent with the position that it is generally proper for a director to leave matters to another director of the company, and that he is under no obligation to test the accuracy of anything that he is told by such a person or even to make certain that he is complying with the law (see <span class="font-italic">Huckerby</span><span class="font-italic"> v Elliot </span>[1970] 1 All ER 189 at 194). In these circumstances, the court should be slow to impute the knowledge of one director to another. <span class="font-italic">Peter </span><span class="font-italic">Kwee</span> might have been an appropriate case for the imputation of knowledge to a director, but the present case is far removed from that factual scenario.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">228 Even if the principle in <span class="font-italic">Peter </span><span class="font-italic">Kwee </span>could be extended to cover non-nominee directors, it only goes so far as to allow for imputation of knowledge. However, mere knowledge of a certain state of affairs does not equate to dishonesty. There must first be evidence that an honest director, with that knowledge, would have adopted a certain course of conduct, and secondly it must be proved that the defendant had consciously or intentionally not taken that course of conduct. As I have mentioned, the plaintiffs have not adduced any evidence of the former. Accordingly, the plaintiffs’ second alternative argument must fail.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">229 In conclusion, although Wong did assist in HJS’s and HJK’s breaches of trust (listed at [189] above), he was not<span class="font-italic"> </span>dishonest.

</div> She did so without asking for the Original Share Certificates to be produced. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">236 To summarise, Neo knew that the Original Share Certificates had been sent to Kawai in Japan in June 2012. She also knew that they had to be produced for cancellation before a transfer of shares in HJS’s and/or HJK’s names could be effected. However, the Original Share Certificates were never returned to NCJV for cancellation at any time. The plaintiffs submitted that the absence of Original Share Certificates meant that they might have been in the possession of a third party, or that there might have been other subsisting interests over the shares.

</div> Yet, Neo – in her various capacities – facilitated the transfers of the Charged Shares pursuant to the BPA and the subsequent SPAs, leading to the dissipation of all of the Charged Shares. The plaintiffs submitted Neo was wilfully blind as to the existence of another party’s interest over the Charged Shares, and that she failed to adequately inquire into the irregularity of the transfers. She was therefore dishonest.

The short point is that it is for the plaintiffs to decide who they wish to sue. Additionally, there is no legal principle stating that employees can<span class="font-italic"> never</span> be sued in their own right if, in the course of their employment, they perform acts that would otherwise amount to dishonest assistance in breach of trust. There is no reason why Neo and Boo cannot properly be made defendants to the plaintiffs’ claim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">242 As for the plaintiffs’ argument on imputation of Horie’s knowledge to Neo, I repeat my reasoning above at [227]–[228] that <span class="font-italic">Peter </span><span class="font-italic">Kwee</span> is not of assistance to the plaintiffs. Accordingly, Horie’s knowledge cannot be imputed to Neo.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">243 I turn now to address the plaintiffs’ main case against Neo. Having regard to all the evidence, I am of the view that although Neo did assist in HJS’s and HJK’s breaches of trust in her various capacities through various means, she was not dishonest.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">244 Like Wong, Neo knew that the Original Share Certificates were delivered to Kawai on 8 June 2012 and also had the opportunity to read the Email Chain. However, I do not think that an honest person in Neo’s position would have attempted to read and understand the substantive content of the Email Chain or its subject title. As with Wong, the Email Chain in a foreign language was clearly not intended for Neo’s reading, especially when there were other addressees of the Email Chain who could read that foreign language. Her omission to read and query did not constitute negligence, let alone dishonesty. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">245 Accordingly, Neo would not have known and could not be expected to know that the Original Share Certificates had been delivered to Kawai on 8 June 2012 as part of an arrangement involving the creation of a security interest in the plaintiffs’ favour, over the NCJV shares registered in HJS’s and HJK’s names. There was also no evidence that Neo knew that the Original Share Certificates were subsequently delivered to the plaintiffs on 14 June 2012. I am satisfied that at the time, she had no reason to think that HJS’s and HJK’s NCJV shares were encumbered in any way.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">246 I accept that as of 23 October 2012, Neo was made aware of the upcoming HJS-HYH Transfer through the Initialling Procedure. Subsequently, sometime in early November, she signed the HJS BOD Resolution approving this transfer although the document itself was backdated to 15 October 2012 (see [57] above). Although Neo signed the HJS BOD Resolution without having sight of the returned and cancelled share certificates in HJS’s name (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, either Share Certificate No. 6 or 7), I do not think that this constitutes dishonest conduct.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">247 As mentioned above, Neo’s position was that she left it to Lanie to complete the transaction. I accept Lanie’s evidence, which was not challenged by the plaintiffs, that she did not inform Neo (and Boo) that the Original Share Certificates had not been returned for cancellation until August 2013 when the Letters of Demand were issued. I also accept Lanie’s evidence that she had not sought Neo’s (or Boo’s) approval before issuing new share certificates in the transferee’s names without having the Original Share Certificates being produced for cancellation. She was content to do so on Yamada’s instructions alone. This evidence was also not challenged by the plaintiffs. Having regard to this, I am satisfied that Neo did not in fact know that Share Certificates No. 6 or 7 had not been returned for cancellation prior to the HJS-HYH Transfer. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">248 Whether Neo ought<span class="font-italic"> </span>to have personally taken steps to confirm that the Original Share Certificates had been returned for cancellation is a separate matter. In my view, Neo should not be expected to query Lanie on whether the Original Share Certificates had been returned for cancellation prior to the transfers. This was routine work. Clearly, Lanie knew, even without any supervision or direction by Neo, that the Original Share Certificates should have been returned for cancellation. In any event, even if Neo should have queried Lanie as to the same but failed to do so, this would at most amount to negligence, but not dishonesty.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">249 I turn now to consider the HJS-GIIS transfer. I accept that as of 30 November 2012, Neo was made aware of the completed HJS-GIIS transfer through an email from Lanie to Yamada informing him that the ACRA register had been updated to reflect the HJS-GIIS Transfer. This email had been copied to the Company’s Email Account. Again, there is no evidence that Neo knew, at this point in time, that the share certificates in HJS’s name (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, either Share Certificate No. 6 or 7) had not actually been returned and cancelled prior to the share transfer to GIIS. Again, I do not think that she should be expected to check on this matter for herself. Therefore she was not negligent, let alone dishonest.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">250 Finally, I turn to consider the various transfers pursuant to the subsequent SPAs. I accept that as of 9 January 2013, Neo was made aware of the upcoming transfers of 900,000 NCJV shares from HJK and 1.3 million NCJV shares from HJS to various third parties, through the Initialling Procedure. As before, there is no evidence that she knew by this point in time that the Original Share Certificates had not actually been returned to NCJV for cancellation. Again she was content to leave the matter to Lanie, and again she failed to personally ensure the return and cancellation of the Original Share Certificates. Yet, this falls short of dishonesty.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">251 In my view, Neo only realised that the Original Share Certificates had never been returned to NCJV for cancellation sometime on or after 16 August 2013, when Neo received the Letters of Demand from the plaintiffs’ solicitors. Neo testified that after receiving the Letters of Demand, she queried Lanie as to the whereabouts of the Original Share Certificates and Lanie confessed that they had never been returned to NCJV for cancellation.

</div>
</div> I note that this was a change from Neo’s earlier oral evidence that she had only confronted Lanie after receiving the writ of summons on 23 October 2013. However, as Lanie also gave evidence that she told Neo of this fact in August 2013, I am satisfied that Neo had queried Lanie on the Original Share Certificates, for the first time, on or after 16 August 2013.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">252 I wish to make an observation on the transfers of NCJV shares that took place after 16 August 2013 (see [82]–[83] above). By this point in time, Neo had clearly been made aware that the plaintiffs claimed some sort of security interest in the Charged Shares and that the Original Share Certificates had not been returned for cancellation. Yet, Neo told Lanie that she could continue to prepare the necessary documents to facilitate these share transfers as long as the immediate prior share certificates were returned. To my mind, such conduct clearly constitutes negligence on Neo’s part. As a provider of professional corporate secretarial services, she ought to have known that a company cannot continue to issue new share certificates in transferees’ names if the underlying certificates (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the<span class="font-italic"> </span>Original Share Certificates) had never been returned for cancellation. She must have known that the omission to insist on the return of the Original Share Certificates and the plaintiffs’ claims could result in competing claims to ownership and further subsequent transfers would only complicate matters unnecessarily. For all the pride that Neo appeared to have in what she perceived as her professionalism, she was in fact acting unprofessionally when she allowed Lanie to continue to issue new share certificates so long as the immediate prior share certificates were returned even though the Original Share Certificates still had not been returned for cancellation. She needs a wakeup call.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">253 However, the relevant share transfers under consideration took place prior to 16 August 2013 (see [189] above). This was prior to Neo finding out that the plaintiffs claimed some sort of security interest in the shares. Thus, although Neo had assisted in HJS’s and HJK’s breaches of trust, she had not done so dishonestly. On this basis alone, Neo would not be liable for dishonest assistance.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Boo</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">254 Boo, as NCJV’s company secretary, allowed her subordinate, Lanie, to effect the various transfers of NCJV shares. Boo was not a witness at trial. In her written submissions, Boo did not appear to dispute the element of assistance. Thus, the only question is whether Boo’s assistance was dishonest.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) The parties’ cases</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">255 As earlier mentioned, the plaintiffs submitted that Boo (and Neo) facilitated the transfer of the NCJV shares registered in HJS’s and HJK’s names in circumstances where they wilfully and recklessly failed to make such inquiries as an honest and reasonable person would make. Additionally, they allowed Lanie, their subordinate, to transfer the Charged Shares at Yamada’s bidding.

The plaintiffs asked this court to draw the inference that because Boo was Lanie’s direct superior, Lanie must have reported back to Boo, and therefore that Boo must have known of this transfer. However, this was directly contradicted by Lanie’s own evidence that although Boo was her direct superior, she would not seek Boo’s approval for effecting such transfers, nor inform her that the registers of transfers or members had been updated. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">263 Even if Boo knew of the HJS-HYH Transfer, the more important question is whether Boo knew that the Original Share Certificates had not been returned for cancellation prior to such a transfer. Again, as was the case with Neo, there was no evidence that Boo knew, at that point in time, that the Original Share Certificates had not in fact been returned to NCJV for cancellation. The same may be said of the HJS-GIIS Transfer, which took place sometime later in November 2012; and also of the various transfers made pursuant to the subsequent SPAs sometime around April 2013. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">264 I am of the view that Boo only realised that the Original Share Certificates had not been returned to NCJV for cancellation sometime on or after 16 August 2013, when she received the Letters of Demand from the plaintiffs’ solicitors. Also, when Neo queried Lanie about the whereabouts of the Original Share Certificates and learned that such certificates had not been returned for cancellation, it was likely that Boo would also have been informed of this discovery.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">265 Like Neo, Boo appeared to have been content to leave it to Lanie to carry out the various share transfers. Boo never personally took any steps to confirm that the Original Share Certificates had been returned for cancellation. However, as was the case for Neo, I do not think that Boo was required to query Lanie on what was routine work for a professional provider of corporate secretarial services. My tentative view is that Boo’s conduct was not negligent, let alone dishonest.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">266 At this juncture, it is apposite to consider the plaintiffs’ argument that an adverse inference should be drawn against Boo because she did not give evidence at trial. Under s 116 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed), illustration (<span class="font-italic">g</span>) states that the court may presume that evidence which could be and is not produced would if produced be unfavourable to the person who withholds it. In other words, the court may draw an adverse inference from the absence or silence of a witness who might be expected to have material evidence to give on an issue in action (<span class="font-italic">Cheong </span><span class="font-italic">Gim Fah </span>at [42]). The principles applicable to absentee witnesses were laid out by the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Cheong </span><span class="font-italic">Gim Fah</span> at [42]–[43], which cited with approval <span class="font-italic">Wiesniewski</span><span class="font-italic"> v Central Manchester Health Authority</span> [1998] 5 PIQR P324 at P340:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) If a court is willing to draw an adverse inference, it may go towards strengthening the evidence adduced on that issue by the other party, or towards weakening the evidence (if any) adduced by the party who might reasonably have been expected to call the witness.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) There must be some evidence, however weak, adduced by the former on the matter in question before the court is entitled to draw the desired inference,<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">ie</span>, there must be a case to answer on that issue.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) If the reason for the witness’s absence or silence satisfies the court, then no such adverse inference may be drawn. If, on the other hand, there is some credible explanation given, even if it not wholly satisfactory, the potentially detrimental effect of his absence or silence may be reduced or nullified.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">267 As earlier mentioned, the plaintiffs in their closing submissions did not specify what adverse inference they wished this court to draw. They only stated in broad terms that “this Court is entitled to draw [an adverse inference] <span class="font-italic font-underline">from the absence of Carole Boo who might be expected to have material evidence to give on an issue in an action</span>” [emphasis original].

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">268 It seems to me that the plaintiffs’ suggestion missed the point. The issue was not so much what instructions Yamada had given but whether Boo was aware that the Original Share Certificates had not been returned for cancellation. The plaintiffs stopped short of asking this court to draw an inference that Boo had the same knowledge as Lanie, who knew that the Original Share Certificates had not been returned for cancellation. Accordingly, I will not draw that inference. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">269 I also find that although Boo assisted in HJS’s and HJK’s breaches of trust, she too was not dishonest. She would therefore not be liable for dishonest assistance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">270 It may even be difficult to conclude that Lanie had a dishonest intention. When Lanie prepared the documents for the HJS-HYH Transfer sometime in early November 2012, she knew that the Original Share Certificates had not been returned to NCJV for cancellation. She testified that she continued to facilitate the Transfer because she trusted that Yamada would return the Original Share Certificates for cancellation as he had promised (see [239(e)] above). Because of this trust in Yamada, Lanie unquestioningly accepted his instructions to issue new share certificates in the transferees’ names without having the Original Share Certificates produced for cancellation. This belief persisted throughout in respect of the HJS-GIIS Transfer and the other transfers pursuant to the subsequent SPAs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">271 As evidence of her trust in Yamada, she did not tell Yamada that his failure to return the Original Share Certificates had caused trouble even after the Letters of Demand were received on 16 August 2013. Indeed, instead of realising that legal troubles were afoot, it appears that Lanie thought that “everything [was] still okay”.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">272 It seems to me that Lanie was naïve in trusting Yamada to return the Original Share Certificates. However, much like the defendants in <span class="font-italic">Banque</span><span class="font-italic"> Nationale</span>, it appeared that Lanie was more a fool than a knave. She should not have trusted Yamada so much, but she did. In my view, her conduct was clearly negligent and fell far short of the professional standard expected of her as a corporate secretarial executive providing professional services to NCJV. Still, foolishness and imprudence is not dishonesty. This is not a case where Lanie had decided not to make an inquiry or to inquire further because she suspected that something was wrong and did not want to know the truth. Lanie was not dishonest because she did not even suspect that something was amiss. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 4: Whether HYH and/or the Sub-purchasers are liable for knowing receipt, and in this connection, whether they are </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">bona fide </span><span class="font-weight-bold">purchasers for value without notice</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">273 I come now to the plaintiffs’ claims against HYH and the Sub-purchasers in knowing receipt. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">274 As I have found earlier, no trust arose between the plaintiffs on the one hand, and HJS and HJK on the other, in respect of the Charged Shares (see [158] above). However, even assuming that a trust or fiduciary relationship arose and that HJS’s and HJK’s disposal of the Charged Shares was a breach of trust or fiduciary duty, that does not necessarily mean that the plaintiffs’ claim in knowing receipt is satisfied. As I have done in relation to Issue 3 (involving dishonest assistance), I shall consider the other elements of the cause of action in knowing receipt and the relevant defences. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The plaintiffs’ case against HYH and the Sub-purchasers</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">275 The plaintiffs’ case against HYH and the Sub-purchasers morphed significantly during the course of proceedings. I first consider the case as pleaded in the statement of claim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">276 At para 48 of the statement of claim, the plaintiffs pleaded the following:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-underline">As regards parties who are currently in wrongful receipt of the Charged Shares</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">48.1 [The 5th to 14th defendants]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) did not obtain beneficial interest in the Charged Shares since the beneficial interest therein remained with the plaintiffs; </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) alternatively, they are in knowing receipt of the Charged Shares in NCJV which they knew and/or ought to have known were subject to the plaintiffs’ prevailing interests.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">48.2 Insofar as any of the defendants who had received the Charged Shares pursuant to the First Transfer, Second Transfer, Third Transfer and/or Fourth Transfer has disposed of any of the Charged Shares (after the commencement of these proceedings), they are liable to the plaintiffs for all proceeds received from such transfers.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">48.3 Insofar as any of the defendants continue to hold any Charged Shares, the plaintiffs shall have the right (at their election) to such shares or the value thereof.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">277 The “First Transfer” and “Second Transfer” are the HJS-HYH Transfer and HJS-GIIS Transfer respectively (see [54] and [58] above). The “Third Transfer” refers collectively to the transfer of 2.95 million NCJV shares, made pursuant to the various transfers mentioned at [67]–[68] above. The “Fourth Transfer” refers collectively to the transfer of 450,000 NCJV shares, made pursuant to the various SPAs mentioned at [73] above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">278 It appears from para 48.1(a) of the statement of claim that the plaintiffs’ primary case was that the “beneficial interest” in the Charged Shares had always remained with the plaintiffs. However, the plaintiffs did not link their claim that they always had the beneficial interest in the Charged Shares to any specific cause of action. It was only in their alternative case, in para 48.1(b) of the statement of claim, that the plaintiffs pleaded a specific cause of action – that the 5th to 14th defendants are in knowing receipt of the Charged Shares.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">279 Paragraphs 48.2 and 48.3 of the statement of claim then mention certain types of relief, differentiating between defendants who are currently holding Charged Shares and those who are not. However, the plaintiffs did not clearly state the relationship between paras 48.1, 48.2 and 48.3. Is the relief mentioned in the latter two paragraphs premised on the primary case in para 48.1(a) or the alternative case in para 48.1(b) or both? </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">280 This ambiguity followed on into the prayers section of the statement of claim. The plaintiffs prayed for the following:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">2. Against the [5th to 14th defendants]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">2.1 a declaration that the beneficial interest in the Charged Shares remain with the plaintiffs; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">2.2 insofar as the 5th to 14th defendants (or any one of them) have, subsequent to the date of this writ, transferred any of the Charged Shares to other parties:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) to account to the plaintiffs for proceeds received pursuant to these transfers […]</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) to pay to the plaintiffs moneys, and all profits, dividends, benefits and/or assets, including simple interest; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) there be an inquiry to trace the assets or proceeds into which the proceeds received pursuant to these transfers had been converted; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) alternative to the above, the value of such shares be paid to the plaintiffs;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">2.3 insofar as any of the defendants continue to be the registered holder of the Charged Shares, an order that any such shares (including any rights or dividends issued under such shares) be transferred to the plaintiffs or alternatively, the value of such shares be paid to the plaintiffs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">281 The plaintiffs’ case in its closing submissions was relatively clearer. I summarised this briefly at [87(b)] and [88] above, but for ease of reference re-state it here:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) HYH and the Sub-purchasers are liable for knowing receipt. In general, the plaintiffs sought the value of the Charged Shares received by each of them. The exception was HYH, against which the plaintiffs sought an additional $390,000 (being the amount it received under the ASO SPA).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) If the court declined to grant the plaintiffs relief in respect of their claim in knowing receipt as against Muchsin, CBF, and/or Liu, the plaintiffs sought, by way of an equitable proprietary claim, the return of the relevant Charged Shares which they still retain and such benefits that they each received whilst in possession of the Charged Shares.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">282 As can be seen, the plaintiffs’ closing submissions clarified that their equitable proprietary claim for the return of the Charged Shares as against Muchsin, CBF, and Liu was <span class="font-italic">not</span> premised on their cause of action in knowing receipt; rather, it was an alternative.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The law on knowing receipt and </span><span class="font-weight-bold">bona fide</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> purchaser defence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">283 I will first set out, as a broad overview, the legal principles relating to knowing receipt and the <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> purchaser defence. Thereafter, I will summarise the approach that this court will adopt in determining the liability of HYH and the Sub-purchasers.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Knowing receipt</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">284 Knowing receipt is a ground to impose personal liability on a third party in equity. The elements required to establish a claim for knowing receipt are: (a) a disposal of the plaintiff’s assets in breach of trust or fiduciary duty; (b) beneficial receipt by the defendant of assets which are traceable as representing the assets of the plaintiff; and (c) knowledge on the part of the defendant that the assets received are traceable to a breach of trust or fiduciary duty: <span class="font-italic">GRZ III</span> at [23], citing <span class="font-italic">Caltong</span> at [31]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">285 In relation to the third element, the defendant’s state of knowledge must be such as to make it unconscionable for him to retain the benefit of the receipt: <span class="font-italic">GRZ III</span> at [23], citing <span class="font-italic">Bank of Credit and Commerce International (Overseas) Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Akindele </span>[2001] Ch 437. The degree of knowledge required to impose liability will necessarily vary from transaction to transaction; in cases where there is no settled practice of making routine enquiries and prompt resolution of the transaction is required, clear evidence of the degree of knowledge and fault must be adduced: <span class="font-italic">GRZ III </span>at [32]. Actual knowledge of a breach of trust or fiduciary duty is not invariably necessary, particularly when there are circumstances in a particular transaction that are so unusual, or so contrary to accepted commercial practice, that it would be unconscionable to allow a defendant to retain the benefit of the receipt: <span class="font-italic">GRZ III </span>at [32]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">286 I should add that the defendant need not <span class="font-italic">know</span> that <span class="font-italic">as a matter of law</span>, the property had been transferred in breach of trust or fiduciary duty. It suffices that the defendant knows all the <span class="font-italic">facts</span> necessary for him to conclude that there was <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>something so unusual or so contrary to accepted commercial practice, and fails to make inquiries under such circumstances. In <span class="font-italic">Barlow </span><span class="font-italic">Clowes</span>, the Privy Council held at [28] that “[s]omeone can know, and can certainly suspect, that he is assisting in a misappropriation of money without knowing that the money is held on trust or what a trust means.” Although <span class="font-italic">Barlow </span><span class="font-italic">Clowes</span> was a case involving dishonest assistance, I am of the view that the same principle is applicable in the context of knowing receipt.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">287 If the defendant is a company, the company will be attributed with the state of mind of the person who is its directing mind and will: <span class="font-italic">Bilta</span><span class="font-italic"> (UK) Ltd (in liquidation) and others v Nazir and others (No 2)</span> [2015] 2 WLR 1168 (“<span class="font-italic">Bilta</span>”) at [67].

It is difficult to imagine a case in which a person who knew that the assets he received were traceable to a breach of trust or fiduciary duty, and had a state of knowledge making it unconscionable for him to retain the benefit of his receipt, could be described as having acted <span class="font-italic">bona </span><span class="font-italic">fide</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">299 On the issue of notice and knowledge, a preliminary point of law should first be dealt with.

</div>
</div>
</div> In my view, this reliance was misplaced. The issue of the <span class="font-italic">bona</span><span class="font-italic"> fide</span> purchaser defence was not even before the court there and it therefore did not have the opportunity to consider the question of whether the defence could be trumped by the defendant’s subsequently acquired knowledge of the fraud, breach of trust or breach of fiduciary duties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">300 Further, the plaintiffs’ unqualified submission on the effect of subsequently acquired knowledge on a <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> purchaser would render the defence too easily negated by, for instance, a letter of demand from the plaintiff or news publicity of a breach. On this point, the comments of Professor Robert Chambers in his article “The End of Knowing Receipt” (2016) 2(1) Canadian Journal of Comparative and Contemporary Law 1 at p 14 are relevant:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Since liability for knowing receipt depends on receiving assets held in trust, it cannot arise if recipients take the assets free of the trust as <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> purchasers for value without notice. This will not change if they later acquire notice or knowledge of the breach. They are free to continue to use and enjoy the assets as they please and can sell them to others who know of the breach of trust. Otherwise, the defence of bona fide purchase would fail to protect them adequately, and a well publicised breach of trust would destroy the market value of the assets.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) The innocent volunteer</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">301 I turn now to briefly discuss the scenario of the innocent volunteer. Such a person has acted <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> and without notice, but is a “volunteer” (as opposed to a purchaser) in the sense that he has not furnished any consideration for the property. For that reason, he is unable to rely on this defence to the plaintiff’s proprietary claim. The innocent volunteer takes the property subject to a plaintiff’s prior equitable interest.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">302 Is an innocent volunteer then necessarily liable for the claim in knowing receipt? As a matter of law, his liability depends on whether the plaintiff can establish the three elements of knowing receipt stated at [284]. One of these elements concerns the defendant’s state of knowledge. Given the significant overlaps between the “knowledge”, “notice”, and “<span class="font-italic">bona fide</span>” elements (as mentioned above at [297]–[298]), an innocent volunteer will in all likelihood <span class="font-italic">not</span> be liable as a knowing recipient. Nonetheless, because he cannot establish the <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>purchaser defence (as mentioned at [301] above), in respect of the plaintiff’s proprietary claim, he may take the property subject to the plaintiff’s equitable interest.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">303 The following passage from <span class="font-italic">Hanbury</span><span class="font-italic"> &amp; Martin’s </span>at pp 341–342 aptly summarises the above:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Not every transferee who fails to prove that he was a bona fide purchaser of the legal estate without notice is subjected to the additional personal liability. An “innocent volunteer”, for example, who took without notice that the property was trust property transferred in breach of trust cannot take free of the trust, but, on the present state of authorities, does not incur personal liability.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The approach</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">304 I now set out the approach I will take for this section of the judgment. It will be recalled that my main finding was that the plaintiffs do not currently have any subsisting security interest in the Charged Shares (see [134] above), but even if they did, no trust had arisen over the Charged Shares in their favour by virtue of that security interest (see [158] above). However, for the purposes of the present analysis, this section of the judgment proceeds on the <span class="font-italic">assumption</span> that the SCAs did not expire and there was a trust or fiduciary relationship in respect of the Charged Shares (see [274] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">305 If so, then HYH and the Sub-purchasers do not dispute the first two elements of knowing receipt, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, they do not dispute that there has been (a) a disposal of the plaintiffs’ assets in breach of trust or fiduciary duty, and (b) beneficial receipt by the defendant of assets which are traceable as representing the assets of the plaintiffs.

</div>
</div> Accordingly, at this stage, the only dispute is whether these defendants have the requisite state of knowledge to be liable in knowing receipt. As mentioned at [297]–[298], this state of “knowledge” overlaps significantly with the “notice” and “<span class="font-italic">bona fide</span>” elements in the <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> purchaser defence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">306 My approach is as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The first question is whether the plaintiffs’ equitable interest in the Charged Shares has been extinguished by the <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> purchaser defence. Each defendant bears the burden of proving that defence. If the defence is successfully established, then the plaintiffs’ claim in knowing receipt fails from the outset.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) If the defence fails, the reason for which it fails would be important. If it fails because the defendant was not <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> and/or had notice of the plaintiffs’ interest in the Charged Shares, then he will also have the requisite state of knowledge to be liable for knowing receipt. Given that the remaining two elements are not in dispute (see [305] above), such a defendant is liable in knowing receipt. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) If the defence fails even though the defendant was <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>and without notice, <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>because the defendant was a volunteer and not a purchaser<span class="font-italic"> </span>for value, then he will not have the requisite state of knowledge to be liable for knowing receipt. This is the situation of the innocent volunteer mentioned above at [301]–[303]. While such a defendant will not be liable in knowing receipt, he may still be liable to return the Charged Shares or assets received in exchange for these shares. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">307 I turn now to consider each relevant defendant, beginning with HYH.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">HYH</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">308 It will be recalled that HYH was involved in the following transfers of Charged Shares:

</div> My main finding (at [134] above) was indeed that the plaintiffs no longer have a subsisting interest in the Charged Shares and on that basis I dismissed the plaintiffs’ claims at the outset. However, as mentioned, I have continued in the analysis on the assumption that the plaintiffs have a subsisting security interest and that security interest gave rise to a trust over the Charged Shares or a fiduciary relationship. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">314 Secondly, in the alternative, HYH argued that the plaintiffs’ equitable interest in the Charged Shares arose only on 22 January 2013 when the Supplemental Deeds removed the fixed expiry date of the SCAs, and the Original Share Certificates and the Blank NCJV Share Transfer Forms were all delivered to the plaintiffs. This took place only <span class="font-italic">after</span> HYH acquired its equitable interest in the Charged Shares<span class="font-italic"> </span>by virtue of the BPA dated 20 June 2012.

Furthermore, cl 3 of the Supplemental Deeds states that each amendment to the SCAs (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, deletion of cl 5) takes place “with effect from 31 December 2012” (see [111] above).

</div>
</div> I can address this last point quickly. Yamada’s motive for arranging the BPA is irrelevant to the question of whether Yamada <span class="font-italic">knew</span> that under the BPA, HYH would receive NCJV shares transferred in breach of trust. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">324 As to the remaining two arguments, these are mere assertions. HYH has not offered any concrete evidence in support of either point. But if one looks to the objective evidence that <span class="font-italic">is</span> before the court, in my view, it is clear that Yamada knew full well that the NCJV shares registered in HJS’s and HJK’s names were subject to a security interest in the plaintiffs’ favour. Even if Yamada might not have realised that a transfer of those shares amounted to a breach of trust or fiduciary duties in law, that knowledge alone made it unconscionable for HYH to retain the benefit of the receipt of the NCJV shares.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">325 The SCAs were entered into on 14 June 2012. Sometime between then and 21 June 2012, Yamada signed the Undertakings in his capacity as director of NCJV (see [35] above). By signing, Yamada undertook that if the security constituted by the SCAs became enforceable, he would vote in favour of any resolution approving that the Charged Shares be registered in either of the plaintiffs’ names. From that, as well as the terms of the SCAs, he must have known that HJS and HJK were not entitled to deal with the Charged Shares in a manner that would defeat the plaintiffs’ security.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">326 Yamada’s knowledge of the plaintiffs’ interest in the Charged Shares would have been reinforced on 8 January 2013 when Akimoto emailed him indicating that the plaintiffs “[would] like to have [the NCJV shares] that were secured by [HJS] and [HJK] previously be ready for immediate transfer of title as soon as possible.” This email had been sent to Yamada at the address <yamada@nextcapital.asia>.

</div> Yamada must have seen Akimoto’s email received just the day before. Yet, the transfer in S/N 2 took place on 1 April 2013, pursuant to instructions he had sent to Boo in his email on 9 January 2013.</yamada@nextcapital.asia></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">327 Yamada’s knowledge would again have been confirmed on 16 August 2013, when he received the plaintiffs’ Letters of Demand in his capacity as director of GIIS, HYH and E&amp;S (see [77] above). His knowledge is also evidenced by his reference to a “mortgage” and a “charge” in his reply to ASO on 20 August 2013 and in his NCJV shareholder letter on 22 August 2013, respectively (see [79]–[80] above). Yet, the transfer in S/N 3 took place on 28 October 2013.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">328 It must be emphasised that Yamada was central to all transfers involving the Charged Shares. He had instructed Boo to prepare documentation for the transfers and signed off on various BOD resolutions and share transfer forms. This was despite his knowledge from as early as June 2012 that the plaintiffs had a security interest in the Charged Shares and that HJS and HJK were not entitled to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of the same. To direct the share transfers (and instruct his fellow directors to approve the same) is conduct that is entirely contrary to accepted commercial practice. Under these circumstances, given that Yamada’s knowledge is to be imputed to HYH, I find that it is unconscionable to allow HYH to retain the benefit of the receipt of the 1 million NCJV shares (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the transfers in S/N 1, 2 and 3 listed at [308] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">329 In the circumstances, HYH would have been liable for:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The sum of S$390,000 received for the sale of 200,000 NCJV shares to ASO under the ASO SPA; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The value of the remaining 800,000 NCJV shares it received, such value to be assessed (subject to the reduction of 250,000 Charged Shares if Liu is held liable).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Sub-purchasers</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">330 It will be recalled that the Sub-purchasers were involved in the following transfers of Charged Shares:

That article says nothing about a <span class="font-italic">purchaser</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>of shares having to ask the vendor or transferor for evidence of title. Rather, it merely states that the director of a company whose shares are the subject of a transfer must be satisfied that the transferor has the right to transfer before he will register that share transfer. Aside from Article 23, the plaintiffs did not point to any other evidence of such a practice. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">340 Aside from a general commercial practice, the plaintiffs pointed to the fact that it was a completion requirement under cl 3.2 of each SPA that “the Vendor shall deliver to the Purchaser a duly executed transfer form in respect of the Sale Shares in favour of the Purchaser, accompanied by the relevant share certificate(s) for all such Sale Shares.”

</div> That is not entirely accurate. Rather, the court said (at 458–459):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Again, if the plaintiffs had made inquiries of the company and had ascertained that J. M. Walker was the apparent owner of the shares, and had then advanced money to him on the faith of his being the owner of the shares, the plaintiffs’ case would have been stronger than it is. But the plaintiffs did not do this; they merely took a blank transfer as the best security they could get for a pre-existing debt. This does not prevent the plaintiffs from being <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> purchasers for value; but as they did not even get the certificates, I doubt whether they can be treated as <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> purchasers without notice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">348 All the court said was that it would be <span class="font-italic">doubtful </span>whether purchasers who do not get the share certificates can be considered <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> purchasers without notice. It does not state that purchasers <span class="font-italic">must </span>ask<span class="font-italic"> </span>for share certificates at the time the sale agreement is entered into. Neither does it state a general principle that all such purchasers will <span class="font-italic">never</span> be treated as <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> purchasers for value. In my view, whether the omission to ask for share certificates prevents a purchaser from establishing the <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> purchaser defence depends on the facts of the case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">349 Thus, I reject the propositions stated at [334(a)]–[334(c)] that there is an established principle of law or practice requiring a purchaser of shares to request the vendor or transferor to produce share certificates, and that a purchaser’s failure to do so necessarily means that he is not acting <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">350 I turn now to consider the proposition in [334(d)] that a purchaser who makes no inquiries of the vendor or transferor for evidence of title should not be a better position than one who makes inadequate inquiries.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… It would indeed be strange if a purchaser who has an abstract delivered and neglects to call for production of the deeds there appearing should be considered in a worse position than a purchaser who calls for production of no title-deed whatever because he knows nothing about the title and makes no inquiry as to it. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">351 I agree that as a general principle, a purchaser should not be allowed to take the benefit of its own inaction. However, that proposition does not answer the anterior question of whether the purchaser should even be expected to make inquiries of the vendor or transferor at all. As I have explained, I do not think so. There is no established principle of law or practice in Singapore to that effect. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">352 That said, if there were indeed some unique facts or circumstances that should have put an individual Sub-purchaser on inquiry and yet it failed to make inquiries, then I agree that such a Sub-purchaser should not be in a better position than one who makes inadequate inquiries. I will return to this point later in relation to each Sub-purchaser.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">353 Finally, I turn to consider the plaintiffs’ proposition in [334(e)] that a purchaser will be fixed with constructive notice of a prior equitable mortgage over those shares if the vendor or transferor fails to produce share certificates corresponding to those shares. I am of the view that this proposition should be considered carefully. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">354 The vendor’s or transferor’s omission to produce the share certificates is a separate issue from whether the purchaser should be affixed with constructive notice. I do not think that the former <span class="font-italic">alone</span> would be sufficient to put the purchaser on inquiry such that he would be expected to carry out inquiries to dispel or confirm the existence of another’s adverse interest in the property. As mentioned above at [295], a purchaser is not required to act on the slightest suspicion as to the existence of a prior equitable interest.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">355 In summary, I am not persuaded by the general Notice Argument mounted by the plaintiffs against all the Sub-purchasers. My decision on whether the <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> purchaser defence is established will therefore turn on an examination of the facts and circumstances in relation to each Sub-purchaser, as mentioned at [352] above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">356 Before moving on, I note that the plaintiffs raised the argument at several points that for some of the share transfers to the Sub-purchasers, the name of the vendor in the SPA(s) did not match with the name of the transferor in the share transfer form for the transfer pursuant to the SPA. They suggest that this was a discrepancy that should have put the Sub-purchasers on inquiry. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">357 I do not think that this takes the plaintiffs very far, because as observed in <span class="font-italic">Woon</span> at para 11-111, it is fairly commonplace for a vendor to sell shares that are not registered in its name:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Where shares have been sold but have not been registered in the name of the purchaser, the person whose name is on the register of members remains the legal owner of the shares.

</div>
</div> However, as I have mentioned, the correct approach requires the <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> purchaser defence to be considered first (see [306] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">361 Before doing so, I briefly address two preliminary arguments raised by FGH. The first argument concerns the equitable doctrine of laches. In summary, FGH argued that there were significant delays between the time when the plaintiffs discovered the transfers of the Charged Shares and the time when the plaintiffs took positive action to prevent further transfers or recover the transferred Charged Shares. Therefore the plaintiffs should not be granted equitable relief.

</div>
</div>
</div> However, equitable defences must be specifically pleaded and FGH did not plead laches in its defence. FGH is therefore not entitled to raise this argument.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">362 The second argument concerns when FGH’s equitable interest in the Charged Shares arose. FGH argued that its interest in the Charged Shares arose on or around 10 to 15 January 2013, when FGH and GIIS made arrangements for the 500,000 NCJV shares to be purchased by FGH, under the FGH SPA. This date falls in the interim period between the expiry of the SCAs (31 December 2012) and the execution of the Supplemental Deeds (22 January 2013). It was argued that because the plaintiffs had no interest in the Charged Shares during this interim period, FGH took the 500,000 NCJV shares free of the plaintiffs’ interests in the same.

The only question was whether FGH had acted in good faith and without notice of the plaintiffs’ equitable interest in the Charged Shares. It was common ground that Shiragami’s knowledge, as the Chief Executive and director of FGH, was relevant to this inquiry.

</div> I agree, and I elaborate more on this later. It was also common ground between parties that good faith and absence of notice are separate elements in the legal test.

Furthermore, in this case, the third party was entirely unknown to Shiragami, who testified that he only came to know of the name “HJK” in August 2013 after receiving the Letter of Demand.

</div> I do not think that this argument takes the plaintiffs very far. First, the plaintiffs stopped short of asking the court to draw an adverse inference against FGH and I will not do so. Secondly, I do not think that either Endou or Kai’s knowledge can be attributed to FGH. Applying the principles set out at [287], only the knowledge of the person who represents the directing mind and will of a company may be attributed to the company. Shiragami was clearly the directing mind and will of FGH in relation to the FGH SPA. It was Shiragami who decided to enter the FGH SPA after some initial discussions with Kai.

</div> Thus, although Shiragami was less involved than Endou and Kai in the documentary and/or administrative aspects of the FGH SPA, he was still the directing mind and will of the company in relation to the FGH SPA. It is his knowledge that is relevant to the inquiry, and not Endou’s or Kai’s. I proceed on this basis.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">368 Returning to the plaintiffs’ main argument at [366], I am unable to accept the plaintiffs’ arguments against FGH insofar as they are premised on the Notice Argument. As I have said, I do not think that FGH was under any obligation to ask for GIIS for evidence of title. I also do not accept that the discrepancy between the named vendor (GIIS) and the named transferor (HJK) would suffice to put Shiragami on notice. As mentioned in the excerpt from <span class="font-italic">Woon</span>, para 11-111 at [357] above, it is fairly commonplace for shares to be sold by one party when they are held in the name of another. Thus even if Shiragami had noticed the discrepancy, that alone would not have been sufficient to put him on notice as regard another party’s interest in the shares.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">369 One pillar of FGH’s defence was that there was nothing unusual about the circumstances of the FGH SPA to alert it to the possibility of any wrongdoing. In particular, FGH emphasised that nothing set the FGH SPA apart from the Marusan SPA, pursuant to which the earlier share transfer in June 2012 was completed without any issues.

</div> To appreciate this argument, it is important to understand how the FGH SPA came about. This is explained in Shiragami’s AEIC at paras 21 to 29, and was not disputed. As mentioned above at [366(a)], the Marusan SPA was concluded in June 2012. Marusan was successfully issued with Share Certificate No. 16 and was reflected as the registered holder of 500,000 shares by 2 August 2012.

</div> Later in November 2012, Kai suggested that Shiragami purchase another 500,000 NCJV shares on the same price and terms as the Marusan SPA. Shiragami agreed. Thus, on 30 November 2012, Marusan entered into a second SPA to purchase 500,000 NCJV shares from GIIS (“second Marusan SPA”). Marusan also paid the consideration sum of S$990,000 to GIIS. However, it appears that this transaction was not reflected in NCJV’s company registers at the time: Marusan’s shareholding was never correspondingly increased by 500,000.

In light of this, Shiragami decided that the 500,000 NCJV shares (that were the subject of the second Marusan SPA) should be purchased and held by FGH instead. This was to be achieved by the cancellation of the second Marusan SPA, the purchase price of S$990,000 to be credited in FGH’s favour, FGH entering directly into a new SPA with GIIS, and FGH remitting the sum of S$990,000 to Marusan in repayment. Thus in January 2013, FGH and GIIS entered into the FGH SPA and backdated it to 30 November 2012 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the original date of the second Marusan SPA). On 14 January 2013, FGH repaid Marusan the sum of S$990,000.

As is evident from [379], the alleged set-off arrangement is on a tripartite basis: the CBF SPA is between CBF and GIIS, but the CBF Loan Agreement is between CBF and Singapore F&amp;B. The burden of proof is on CBF to show some express or implied agreement for such a set-off arrangement (see <span class="font-italic">Cooperatieve</span><span class="font-italic"> Centrale Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank BA (trading as Rabobank International), Singapore Branch v Motorola Electronics Pte Ltd</span> [2011] 2 SLR 63 at [34]). In my view, CBF has not discharged this burden. Other than Ara’s bare assertions of the same at trial, there is no other evidence – let alone documentation, which would be expected of commercial parties – suggesting that such an arrangement exists.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">383 In fact, CBF contradicted itself about whether the consideration sum under the CBF SPA was truly set off against the loan to Singapore F&amp;B. If there was truly a tripartite set-off arrangement as alleged, the debt owed by Singapore F&amp;B under the CBF Loan Agreement should be extinguished with CBF’s purchase of the 250,000 NCJV shares from GIIS. However, puzzlingly, CBF insisted that it had “yet to be repaid for this loan of USD$125,000.”

In general, knowledge acquired <span class="font-italic">before</span> the agency began, or during its currency but <span class="font-italic">outside</span> the scope of engagement should not be imputed to the principal.

This was because it had employed as its agent, one Wallis, to negotiate the sale and act as manager of the property. Wallis had been the manager of the property at the time of the creation of the earlier unregistered interest, of which he had been aware. In deciding that Wallis’ knowledge could be imputed to his principal, it highlighted one significant feature: Wallis had been <span class="font-italic">specifically appointed</span> to negotiate the purchase of the property from the bank because of his knowledge of the property and the business. There was thus a strong case for concluding that he was an “agent to know”, and that his principals had “purchased” (a word to be understood broadly) the knowledge he had. Therefore, his knowledge of a third party’s interest in the property purchased became that of his principals (at 143–144). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">394 The language of the agent being “specifically appointed” does not sit comfortably with the present case since the agency relationship was created retrospectively through ratification. Nonetheless, one must first examine the nature and scope of authority conferred upon Yamada. Since CBF ratified the share transfer itself as well as Yamada’s act of signing the CBF SPA,

</div> CBF conferred upon Yamada the authority to enter into the CBF SPA and sign the share transfer form on CBF’s behalf. It appears that Yamada was allowed to handle the CBF SPA on CBF’s behalf because of his greater knowledge and familiarity with the matter. The CBF SPA was, after all, his idea.

</div> CBF remained passive throughout – this is evident from Ara’s complete lack of familiarity with the details of the CBF SPA. Thus I take the view that CBF has “purchased” Yamada’s knowledge in relation to this particular transaction, and that Yamada is akin to an agent to know. Accordingly, any prior knowledge that Yamada has concerning the 250,000 NCJV shares to be transferred under the CBF SPA can be properly imputed to CBF.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">395 While accepting that the court should<span class="font-italic"> </span>be slow to impute knowledge acquired by an agent before the agency began or outside the scope of his authority, I think it is appropriate in the present case for the agent’s knowledge to be imputed to the principal. Where it is clear that it is <span class="font-italic">only</span> through the auspices of the agent that the principal could have obtained the property or rights that are now contested by the claimant, it would be wrong to allow the principal to adopt the agent’s actions whilst disowning the agent’s knowledge of the claimant’s prior rights: <span class="font-italic">B</span><span class="font-italic">owstead &amp; Reynolds on Agency</span> (Peter Watts, ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 20th Ed, 2014) at p 546.

The <span class="font-italic">bona </span><span class="font-italic">fide</span> purchaser defence therefore fails on two grounds: CBF was neither a purchaser nor was it acting <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>and without notice in respect of the 250,000 NCJV shares. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">397 Accordingly, CBF would have been liable in knowing receipt for the value of the 50,000 NCJV shares that it received under the CBF SPA, such value to be assessed. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Karna</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">398 The plaintiffs argued that Karna is liable in knowing receipt for the value of the 250,000 NCJV shares that he received under the Karna SPA, such value to be assessed.

</div> Relying on this concession, the plaintiffs repeated the Imputation Argument (see [390]–[393] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">415 I agree that Karna’s ratification of Yamada’s acts means that Yamada’s knowledge is to be imputed to Karna. Yamada was clearly aware of the plaintiffs’ equitable interest in the NCJV shares. This knowledge is to be imputed to Karna. In light of this, I find that Karna has failed to establish that he was acting <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> and without notice in respect of the transfer of 150,000 NCJV shares under the GIIS-Karna Share Transfer Form. Accordingly, Karna would have been liable in knowing receipt for the value of 150,000 NCJV shares that he received under the Karna SPA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">416 However, in respect of the transfer of 100,000 NCJV shares under the HJK-Karna Share Transfer Form, I am of the view that the Imputation Argument does not apply. Karna had signed this share transfer form himself. This was not a situation where Karna sought to enjoy the benefits of an agent’s actions while disowning the agent’s knowledge of the claimant’s prior rights. Thus, I accept that Karna has established the <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> purchaser defence in respect of the 100,000 NCJV shares transferred to him under the HJK-Karna Share Transfer Form. Therefore, the plaintiffs’ claim against Karna for knowing receipt of 100,000 NCJV shares would have failed. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Muchsin</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">417 The plaintiffs argued that Muchsin is liable in knowing receipt for the value of the 500,000 NCJV shares, such value to be assessed. It will be recalled that Muchsin first received 500,000 NCJV shares under the Muchsin SPAs and then transferred 250,000 NCJV shares to Gao Ventures on 28 October 2013 (see [82(a)] above). Thus, in the alternative, the plaintiffs seek the transfer of the 250,000 NCJV shares still held in Muchsin’s name into the plaintiffs’ name (or that of their nominee(s)). Finally, the plaintiffs ask that Muchsin be liable to pay S$70,950 to the plaintiffs, being the benefits received by him whilst in possession of the 500,000 NCJV shares, and interest.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">418 Applying my approach as set out above at [306], I will first consider whether Muchsin has successfully established the <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> purchaser defence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">419 It was not in dispute that Muchsin had obtained the legal title to the 500,000 shares that he purchased under the Muchsin SPAs, and that he now only holds 250,000 of those in his name.

</div> Since Muchsin had signed the share transfer form himself, there was no act of Yamada’s that he could ratify. The Imputation Argument did not apply because this was not a situation where Muchsin was adopting an agent’s actions while disowning the agent’s knowledge of the claimant’s prior rights. Thus, I accept that Muchsin was acting <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> and without notice. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">433 Accordingly, in respect of the 250,000 NCJV shares that Muchsin <span class="font-italic">did</span> purchase with consideration, I am of the view that he has successfully established the <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>purchaser defence.

As discussed at [302] above, he is not liable for knowing receipt. I will therefore have to consider the plaintiffs’ alternative equitable proprietary claim against Muchsin for the return of the Charged Shares (see [462] below).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">435 One point remains to be addressed.

From the dates of the payments in the table at [435], it is clear that the payment in S/N 1 was received when Muchsin held all 500,000 NCJV shares. In contrast, it is not clear exactly when in 2013 the payment in S/N 2 was received – it might have been before or after the transfer to Gao Ventures on 28 October 2013. This point was also not clarified at trial. Therefore, I will proceed on the assumption that the payments in S/Nos 2, 3 and 4 were received when Muchsin only held 250,000 NCJV shares.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">437 In other words, Muchsin received S$24,750 by virtue of being a holder of 500,000 NCJV shares, and S$46,200 by virtue of being a holder of 250,000 NCJV shares. As my conclusion above is that Muchsin is a <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> purchaser of 250,000 shares and an innocent volunteer in respect of the other 250,000 shares, I am of the view that Muchsin would only be entitled to retain benefits that accrued to him by virtue of being the holder of shares which he <span class="font-italic">did</span> purchase.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">438 This, however, runs into some difficulty. It is not clear whether the 250,000 NCJV shares that Muchsin transferred to Gao Ventures were shares that he had<span class="font-italic"> </span>purchased (in respect of which he was a <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> purchaser), shares that he did not purchase (in respect of which he was an innocent volunteer), or a mixture of both. It is therefore not clear whether and how much of the S$46,200 he received after 28 October 2013 is attributable to NCJV shares that he did purchase.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">439 One possible approach is that Muchsin is entitled to the full S$46,200 because such payment arose from 250,000 NCJV shares, and Muchsin in fact did pay for 250,000 NCJV shares. However, he would only be entitled to 50% of S$24,750 since that payment arose from 500,000 NCJV shares, of which he only purchased half. However, given that my main conclusion is that the plaintiffs’ claim against Muchsin must fail from the outset (see [134] above), I need say no more.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Ni</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">440 The plaintiffs argued that Ni is liable in knowing receipt for the value of the 350,000 NCJV shares that she received under the Ni SPA, such value to be assessed.

The plaintiffs have proffered no reasoning as to why the corporate veil should be lifted; in any event, I would not consider the present case an appropriate one for me to do so. I do not think it appropriate for the plaintiffs to pursue a proprietary claim against Liu when she does not have any NCJV shares registered in her name. If the plaintiffs are seeking the transfer of the NCJV shares currently held by Hua Lien to themselves, they should have done so by joining Hua Lien as a defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">452 Leaving aside that point, applying my approach as set out above at [306], I will first consider whether Liu has successfully established the <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> purchaser defence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">453 It was not disputed Liu that had paid valuable consideration and had obtained the legal title to 250,000 NCJV shares.

In the circumstances, there is no need to consider the plaintiffs’ alternative equitable proprietary claim against Liu for the return of the 250,000 NCJV shares. In any event, as earlier mentioned at [451], I would not have ordered that Hua Lien transfer the 250,000 NCJV shares currently held in its name into the plaintiffs’ name (or that of their nominee(s)) since Hua Lien is not named as a defendant to these proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">461 There is one final point to be addressed.

</div> I am satisfied that this financial benefit only accrued to Liu because she was a holder of NCJV shares. It would therefore be unconscionable for her to retain the benefit of this S$24,750 as well.

</div> Thus, at the time of the proceedings, Muchsin held 250,000 of the Charged Shares (see [82(a)]). It is in these 250,000 shares that the plaintiffs seek to assert their subsisting equitable proprietary interest. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">465 In order to establish their equitable proprietary claim, the plaintiffs must first establish that they have a subsisting equitable interest in the particular property against which they claim.

There is thus no basis on which the plaintiffs may claim to have any equitable interest in any of the shares held by Muchsin. For this reason alone, the plaintiffs’ claim for the return of the 250,000 NCJV shares presently held by Muchsin must fail. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Observations</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">467 I make three additional observations in relation to the plaintiffs’ equitable proprietary claim. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether the plaintiffs can rely on equitable tracing </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">468 Given that the plaintiffs have mounted an equitable proprietary claim for the Charged Shares held by Muchsin, they must rely on the process of equitable tracing to support their claim that the Charged Shares originally held by HJS and HJK (in respect of which the plaintiffs allegedly have a subsisting equitable interest) are traceable to the shares presently in Muchsin’s hands. Yet, the plaintiffs are unable to show that the orthodox pre-requisite for such equitable tracing is satisfied: that the property in which they claim an equitable proprietary interest has passed through the hands of a fiduciary or quasi-fiduciary in breach of duty (see Graham Virgo, <span class="font-italic">The Principles of Equity and Trusts </span>(Oxford University Press, 2012) (“<span class="font-italic">Virgo</span>”) at p 641). In this regard, I accept that there is some controversy as to the continued relevance of this pre-requisite, which is not required for common law tracing and therefore distinguishes common law tracing from equitable tracing. In the absence of arguments by parties, and since no clear position was taken by the plaintiffs, I will say no more on this. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether a lesser equitable interest than a beneficial interest under a trust can ground an equitable proprietary claim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">469 In assessing the viability of the plaintiffs’ equitable proprietary claim, another issue is whether it is sufficient for the plaintiffs to have an equitable interest in the Charged Shares <span class="font-italic">qua</span> equitable mortgagees, even if the plaintiffs do not have a beneficial interest in the Charged Shares <span class="font-italic">qua </span>beneficiaries in the trust sense. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">470 According to the plaintiffs, their equitable proprietary claim does not depend on there being a trust over the Charged Shares; it suffices for the plaintiffs to establish that they are equitable mortgagees with a corresponding equitable interest in the Charged Shares.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">471 Subject to full arguments in a subsequent case, my tentative view is that the plaintiffs can rely on their equitable interest as equitable mortgagees of the Charged Shares to ground their equitable proprietary claim for the return of the relevant Charged Shares that are currently in the hands of CBF, Muchsin, and Liu, even if that equitable interest does not amount to a beneficial interest in the trust sense. However, the specific nature of the plaintiffs’ interest in the Charged Shares may affect the type of relief that may eventually be awarded by this court in order to give effect to that equity. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">472 In our present case, by asking for the “return” of the Charged Shares the plaintiffs are presumably asking the court to declare that CBF, Muchsin, and Liu each holds the Charged Shares on constructive trust for the plaintiffs, and to order that each of them transfer those shares to the plaintiffs. However, although equitable ownership is vested in the equitable mortgagee, the nature of the equitable mortgagee’s interest is not in or to the extent of the mortgaged property itself; rather, the mortgagee’s interest is only co-extensive with the underlying debt obligation which the mortgage was intended to secure. This is fundamentally different from the nature of the beneficiary’s interest in the trust property. In most situations, a beneficiary would be entitled to lay claim to trust property that is currently being held by third parties; the return of the trust property would be an appropriate form of relief given the nature and extent of the beneficiary’s interest in the property. However, where an equitable mortgagee relies on its interest in the mortgaged property to bring a proprietary claim, the appropriate relief may not be the unconditional return of the mortgaged property. For instance, where the current value of that property significantly exceeds the underlying debt obligation, it may not be appropriate to allow the equitable mortgagee to be unconditionally “returned” the mortgaged property. The nature (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, real or personal property) and state (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, whether it is fungible and mixed with other property) of the subject property, as well as the election of the plaintiff, would also be of importance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">473 In the circumstances, however, it is not necessary for me to come to a conclusive view on whether an equitable proprietary claim is premised on there being a beneficial interest in the trust sense. Nor is it necessary for me to come to a view as to what relief is appropriate to satisfy the plaintiffs’ equity.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether an intervening bona fide purchaser precludes the plaintiffs’ claim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">474 As the plaintiffs have rightly acknowledged, their equitable proprietary claim is subject to the various defendants’ ability to establish the <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> purchaser defence.

</div> This is because, to establish their claim, the plaintiffs must among other things show that they have a subsisting “proprietary base” in the property the return of which they seek (see <span class="font-italic">Virgo </span>at p 631). However, on our facts, it is not clear whether GIIS, from whom Muchsin appears to have obtained his NCJV shares under the Muchsin SPAs, is entitled to raise the <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>purchaser defence. If GIIS can successfully establish the defence, it would provide a further ground to reject the plaintiffs’ case: the plaintiffs’ equitable interest in the relevant Charged Shares, even if it existed, would no longer subsist by virtue of the intervening party (GIIS) whose <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>purchaser defence extinguishes the plaintiffs’ equitable “proprietary base”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">475 GIIS was unrepresented and did not attend trial. However, on their part, the plaintiffs also did not make any allegation against GIIS that it was not a <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> purchaser. Arguably, GIIS would not have been able to establish the “without notice” and “<span class="font-italic">bona fide</span>” elements given that Yamada was its director and his knowledge of the plaintiffs’ prior equitable interest in the Charged Shares would have been attributable to GIIS. However, I need not make any further comment in this regard given that this issue was not argued before me. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Other claims and proceedings</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Claims against Yamada and AI</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">476 As mentioned, the plaintiffs have named causes of action and claimed reliefs against Yamada and AI in dishonest assistance and knowing receipt respectively (see above at [87]). Yamada and AI have each entered an appearance and filed a defence but neither defendant attended the trial. They were also unrepresented. Nevertheless, the plaintiffs do not appear to have pursued their causes of action against Yamada and AI. In the plaintiffs’ closing and further submissions, no mention was made of these causes of action and how the requisite elements are satisfied. I thus consider that the plaintiffs have abandoned their claims against Yamada and AI, and dismiss them accordingly. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Third party proceedings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">477 The third party proceedings are brought by Yamada and Wong against Neo and Boo. After the conclusion of the trial, I gave instructions for the plaintiffs in the third party proceedings to file and serve written submissions by 14 November 2016. On 14 November 2016, solicitors for Wong wrote in to court saying that Wong would not be continuing with the third party proceedings against Neo and Boo, although no notice of discontinuance was filed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">478 Yamada was unrepresented and absent from the trial, although I note that he had been <span class="font-italic">initially</span> represented by the same firm representing Wong, at the time when third party proceedings were commenced. There was no submission from Yamada.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">479 In the circumstances, I need not make a decision on the issues raised in the third party proceedings. I grant Wong leave to discontinue his third party claim. I dismiss Yamada’s third party claim.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Fourth party proceedings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">480 The fourth party proceedings are brought by Neo and Boo against HJS, GIIS, E&amp;S, and NCJV. On 14 October 2015, the Assistant Registrar held in HC/JUD 650/2015 that GIIS was liable to indemnify Neo and Boo against all sums that they may be adjudged liable to pay to the plaintiffs whether by way of damages, interest, costs and alternatively, such contribution hereto as may be just, pursuant to <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span> s 15 of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed). Costs of the fourth party action against GIIS and costs of the application were to be paid to Neo and Boo, to be agreed or taxed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">481 Prior to the commencement of trial, the plaintiffs in the fourth party proceedings filed notices of discontinuance against E&amp;S and NCJV on 22 and 23 August 2016 respectively. Counsel for Neo and Boo orally informed the court on the first day of trial that HJS had not yet been served in relation to the fourth party proceedings.

</div> In the circumstances, I also need not make a decision on some of the issues raised in the fourth party proceedings since there is already a judgment against GIIS.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Summary of conclusions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">482 I set out a summary of my conclusions above: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The SCAs have expired, without a valid extension by the Supplemental Deeds, and thus the plaintiffs do not have a security interest in the Charged Shares that subsists at present. Therefore, all the plaintiffs’ claims must fail at the outset. Even if the plaintiffs do have a subsisting security interest in the Charged Shares that could be characterised as an equitable mortgage, the plaintiffs’ causes of action in knowing receipt and dishonest assistance both fail because they are premised on the existence of a trust and the plaintiffs did not establish that a trust relationship arises by mere virtue of an equitable mortgage subsisting between the parties.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The plaintiffs cannot rely on the arguments raised in their further submissions that as a result of HJS’s and HJK’s alleged unconscionable conduct, a constructive trust over the Charged Shares, or fiduciary relationship between the plaintiffs on the one hand and HJS and HJK on the other, had arisen. This was not pleaded.  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Even if a trust over the Charged Shares or fiduciary relationship between the plaintiffs on the one hand and HJK and HJK on the other had arisen:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) Wong, Neo and Boo are not liable for dishonest assistance because they did not act dishonestly.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) HYH, CBF, Karna, Ni and Liu are liable for knowing receipt.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) FGH and Muchsin (in respect of 250,000 NCJV shares) are not liable for knowing receipt as they are <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> purchasers for value without notice.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) As for the alternative equitable proprietary claim against Muchsin for the return of the relevant Charged Shares, the claim must fail on the basis that the SCAs have expired and thus the plaintiffs do not have a subsisting security interest in the Charged Shares, and hence have no ground to claim any subsisting equitable interest in the relevant Charged Shares. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">483 For the foregoing reasons, I dismiss the plaintiffs’ claims in their entirety.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">484 I will hear parties on costs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">485 I make one final observation. While I have some sympathy for the plaintiffs, they themselves should have been more careful with the documentation and, also, they should have acted sooner to protect their rights. For example, as mentioned at [50] above, an ACRA search conducted by their lawyer on 25 January 2013 revealed that the total number of NCJV shares held by HJS and HJK had decreased to less than the 3.3 million shares which the plaintiffs were supposed to be holding. Yet, the information did not ring any alarm bell for the plaintiffs.  </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Woo Bih Li  <br/>Judge  </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Foo Maw Shen, Chu Hua
