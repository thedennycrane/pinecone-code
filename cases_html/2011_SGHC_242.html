        Andrew Phang Boon Leong JA (delivering the grounds of
                decision of the court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was an application by the Law Society of
                    Singapore (“the Law Society”) for an order that Mr Dixon Ng
                    Bock Hoh (“the Respondent”), be made to suffer such punishment as
                    is provided in s 83(1) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161,
                    2009 Rev Ed) (“the Act”). The Law Society had preferred five
                    charges against the Respondent. A disciplinary tribunal (“the DT”)
                    had found the Respondent liable for three charges (see <em>The
                        Law Society of Singapore v Ng Bock Hoh Dixon</em>
                    [2011] SGDT 7 (“the Report”)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       After hearing the Law Society and the
                    Respondent, who appeared in person, we ordered that the Respondent be struck off
                    the roll of advocates and solicitors of the Supreme Court (“the
                    roll”). We now provide our detailed grounds for reaching that
                    decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The parties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The Respondent was an advocate and solicitor of
                    the Supreme Court at the material time (see the Report at [1]). We should mention that the Respondent is
                    no stranger to disciplinary proceedings. In 2010, a court of three Judges
                    suspended the Respondent from practice for a period of two years for preparing
                    two draft court judgments purportedly issued by the Subordinate Courts of
                    Singapore which he knew were false (see <em>Law Society of
                        Singapore v Ng Bock Hoh Dixon</em> [2010] 2 SLR 1000
                        (“<em>Ng Bock Hoh Dixon (2010)</em>” or
                    “the False Judgment Disciplinary Proceedings”)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       In the present case, the complainant was one
                    Integrax Berhad (“the Complainant”), a Malaysian company. The
                    Chairman of the Complainant was one Encik Harun bin Halim Rasip (“Encik
                    Harun”) (see the Report at [3]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The complaint</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The Complainant claimed that the Respondent had
                    failed to refund a sum of US$100,000 which it had placed with the
                    Respondent’s law firm. According to the Complainant, the US$100,000 was to
                    be held by the Respondent’s law firm as stakeholders “pursuant to
                    an introductory arrangement in relation to a potential project in
                    Cambodia” (“the Stakeholding Agreement”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> The purpose and terms of the
                    Stakeholding Agreement were set out in a letter from the Complainant (signed by
                    Encik Harun) to the Respondent’s law firm dated 20 January 2006
                    (“the January 2006 Letter”). The material terms of the January
                    2006 Letter are as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Complainant had engaged a
                        consultant to assist it in obtaining a Cambodian port concession. The
                        consultant was to receive a success fee of US$200,000 if the concession
                        agreement was made unconditional.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_b"></a>(b)     In order to assure the consultant that the success fee
                        would be paid, the Complainant had agreed to pay 50% of the success fee
                            (<em>ie</em>, US$100,000) (“the Consultancy
                        Fee Deposit”) to a stakeholder before 15 February 2006 on,
                            <em>inter alia</em>, the following terms:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_5-p2_b-p3_i"></a>(i)       The stakeholder was to hold
                            the Consultancy Fee Deposit and release it only upon written
                            confirmation from the Complainant that the requisite concession
                            agreement had been made unconditional.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_5-p2_b-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       The Consultancy Fee Deposit was to be
                            returned to the Complainant when the stakeholder received written
                            confirmation that the Complainant had terminated the consultant’s
                            engagement or after the expiry of 12 months from 20 January
                            2006 (whichever was the earlier).</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The
                    Respondent accepted these terms by signing a copy of the January 2006 Letter on
                    25 January 2006.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> On 21 February 2006, the
                    Complainant paid the sum of US$100,000 to the Respondent’s law firm. The
                    money was <em>not</em> paid into the Respondent’s law
                    firm’s client’s account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Approximately two years later, on
                    4 February 2008, the Complainant gave the Respondent written notice that
                    the engagement set out in the January 2006 Letter had not yielded satisfactory
                    results and was not extended beyond its expiry date of 20 January 2007. The
                    Complainant therefore demanded that the Respondent’s law firm repay the
                    Complainant the Consultancy Fee Deposit together with any interest.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The Respondent failed to repay the money. This
                    led to the Complainant lodging a complaint with the Law Society on
                    29 January 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Respondent’s letter to the Inquiry Committee</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       An inquiry committee was constituted to inquire
                    into the complaint.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The Respondent wrote a letter to the inquiry
                    committee on 17 July 2009. In that letter, the Respondent explained that he
                    did not hold the Consultancy Fee Deposit as a stakeholder. Instead, the
                    Consultancy Fee Deposit was a “Party Political Donation” by the
                    Complainant “for the ruling party in Cambodia”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> The
                    Respondent paid the Consultancy Fee Deposit to a representative of the Cambodian
                    government, one “Seng Phally”, and received a receipt for the
                    payment (“the Seng Phally Receipt”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> The Seng Phally
                    Receipt was annexed to the Respondent’s letter to the inquiry committee.
                    The Respondent further explained that he had rendered a bill to the Complainant
                    for the amount of US$100,000 for “professional charges in connection with
                    the [Sihanoukville Port] matter including other incidental work necessary to
                    carry out the business entrusted to [his law firm]” and for “[his
                    law firm’s] [a]greed costs in introducing and working towards turn key
                    project for the operations and management of Sihanoukville Port,
                    Cambodia” (“the Bill”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> The Bill
                    was dated 15 February 2006.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> The Respondent
                    asserted that the Bill was a contemporaneous document which supported his
                    version of events because it was produced to the Council of the Law Society when
                    it exercised its powers on 11 January 2008 under the Act<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> to conduct an investigative
                    audit into the accounts of the Respondent’s law firm.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     In his affidavit filed for the proceedings
                    before the DT, the Respondent elaborated that the Stakeholding Agreement had
                    terminated after the Consultancy Fee Deposit was not paid by the
                    15 February 2006 deadline indicated in the January 2006 Letter.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> The Respondent then
                    received oral instructions from Encik Harun to pay out the Consultancy Fee
                    Deposit to a nominee of the Cambodian Government.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> As part of these oral
                    instructions, he rendered the Bill to the Complainant.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> After he received the
                    Consultancy Fee Deposit, the Respondent paid it to Seng Phally.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The charges</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The Law Society charged the Respondent with
                    the following:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p>

                        (Cap 161, R 1, 2000 Rev Ed) in failing to use all reasonably
                        available legal means consistent with his retainer to advance the interest

                        Rules”) in failing to pay the US$100,000, which was client’s
                        money, into a client account (“the Client Account

                        (“the Account Inspection Charge”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Report of the DT</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The DT found that the Stakeholding Charge and
                    the Client Account Charge were not proven beyond reasonable doubt because there
                    was some basis to think that the January 2006 Letter, which purported to set out
                    a stakeholding arrangement, was a sham document that did not represent the true
                    intentions of the parties (see the Report at [19]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     However, the DT found that the False Bill
                    Charge, the Accountant’s Report Charge and the Account Inspection Charge
                    were made out. On the Respondent’s evidence, the Bill was a sham. It was
                    not issued for professional charges incurred by the Respondent. Hence, the False
                    Bill Charge was made out. The Accountant’s Report Charge and the Account
                    Inspection Charge were made out because the Respondent had failed to provide
                    accurate information and explanations to his law firm’s accountant and the
                    Law Society as to the true nature of the Bill (see the Report at [25]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The arguments</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     In its written submissions, the Law Society
                    relied on the findings of the DT. The Law Society did not take a firm position
                    on the sanction to be ordered against the Respondent. It pointed out that the DT
                    had not found that the Respondent was dishonest.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> However, the Law Society proceeded to refer

                    authority which held that an advocate and solicitor may be struck off the roll
                    in the absence of dishonesty if he fell short of the “standard of
                    integrity, probity and trustworthiness” required of advocates and
                    solicitors (see <a href="#p1_31">[31]</a> below) and submitted
                    that the Respondent’s conduct fell within this description for the
                    following reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_a"></a>(a)     the Respondent had prepared a false

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_b"></a>(b)     this
                        was not the first time that he had done so (referring to the False Judgment
                        Disciplinary Proceedings (see <a href="#p1_3">[3]</a>

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_c"></a>(c)     the Respondent’s propensity to
                        create false documents to facilitate his client’s needs, if left
                        unchecked, could bring the profession into disrepute;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_d"></a>(d)     unlike the situation with the False
                        Judgment Disciplinary Proceedings, parties other than the Complainant would
                        have seen the Bill.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     At the hearing before us, counsel for the Law
                    Society, Mr Abraham Vergis (“Mr Vergis”), submitted that
                    the Law Society was seeking an order for the Respondent to be struck off the
                    roll. When we pressed Mr Vergis for the Law Society’s position on
                    whether the Respondent was dishonest, Mr Vergis candidly conceded that the
                    Law Society had not pursued the point that the Respondent was dishonest at the
                    proceedings below. However, he expressed his personal view, based on the
                    relevant facts, that the Respondent’s conduct was dishonest (it is
                    apposite to note here that Mr Vergis was not counsel for the Law Society in
                    the proceedings below). Mr Vergis also submitted, in the alternative, that
                    the Respondent’s conduct fell short of the “standard of integrity,
                    probity and trustworthiness” required of advocates and solicitors (see
                        <a href="#p1_31">[31]</a> below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Mr Vergis also ventured to suggest that
                    the Bill was not the only document produced by the Respondent which was false.
                    Mr Vergis suggested that the Seng Phally Receipt, which was one of the
                    documents annexed to the Respondent’s letter to the Inquiry Committee (see
                        <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> above), was false or contained false
                    statements in two respects. First, the Seng Phally Receipt stated that the
                    Consultancy Fee Deposit was received by Seng Phally on 1 March 2006. This
                    contradicted the Respondent’s accounting documents which recorded that the
                    Consultancy Fee Deposit was paid out in <em>three
                        tranches</em>.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> Second, on the Respondent’s
                    evidence, the Consultancy Fee Deposit was a party political donation. The Seng
                    Phally Receipt, on the other hand, described the payment as “50%
                        <font style="text-transform: uppercase;">advance consultancy fees for Sihanoukville Port
                        Project</font>”. We did not, however, think that the Law Society
                    (or indeed the Respondent) could rely on the Seng Phally Receipt. As we
                    expressed to Mr Vergis during his oral arguments, the maker of the Seng
                    Phally Receipt, <em>viz</em>, Seng Phally, had not been
                    called as a witness for the proceedings before the DT.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Respondent’s arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In his written submissions, the Respondent
                    explained that his position would be “one of contriteness and unreserved
                        acceptance”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> The Respondent then proceeded,
                    however, to challenge the DT’s finding that the Accountant’s Report
                    Charge and the Account Inspection Charge were made out. The Respondent submitted
                    that those charges required wilfulness and dishonesty and that there had been no
                    evidence that he had dishonestly and wilfully misled his accountant or that he
                    had dishonestly and wilfully failed to provide information and explanations to
                    the Council of the Law Society.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The Respondent also submitted that his status
                    as a bankrupt (which was referred to in passing in the Law Society’s
                    written submissions<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span>) should not be taken into account in
                    determining the sanction to be meted out to him because he had voluntarily
                    disclosed his bankrupt status to the DT and had provided an explanation for his
                        bankruptcy.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> He also argued that
                    nobody had been misled by his transgression.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> The Respondent urged that he
                    was being rehabilitated through his counselling and work for senior
                        lawyers.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> He asserted that he was
                    not a recalcitrant offender because the circumstances of this case occurred
                    around the same time as the disciplinary offence for which he was charged in the
                    False Judgment Disciplinary Proceedings.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The following issues arose for our
                    consideration:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_a"></a>(a)     Had due cause been shown as to why
                        the Respondent should suffer such punishment as is provided under
                        s 83(1) of the Act?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_b"></a>(b)     If so, what sanction should the Respondent
                    suffer?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Our decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Had due cause been shown as to why the Respondent should suffer such
                punishment as is provided under s 83(1) of the Act?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The relevant legal principles</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Under s 83(2) of the Act, due cause may
                    be shown against an advocate and solicitor if he is, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, shown to be guilty of grossly improper conduct (see
                        s 83(2)(<em>b</em>) of the Act) or misconduct
                    unbefitting an advocate and solicitor as an officer of the Supreme Court or as a
                    member of an honourable profession (see s 83(2)(<em>h</em>) of the Act).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Grossly improper conduct under
                        s 83(2)(<em>b</em>) of the Act refers to conduct
                    which is “dishonourable to the solicitor as a man and dishonourable in
                    his profession”; an advocate and solicitor need not have an intention to
                    deceive in order to be found liable for grossly improper conduct (see <em>Law Society of Singapore v Nor'ain bte Abu Bakar and
                        others</em> [2009] 1 SLR(R) 753 at [59]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Misconduct unbefitting an advocate and
                    solicitor under s 83(2)(<em>h</em>) of the Act is a
                    “catch-all provision” (see <em>Law Society of
                        Singapore v Ng Chee Sing</em> [2000] 1 SLR(R) 466 at
                    [40]; cited in <em>Ng Bock Hoh Dixon (2010)</em> at
                        [19]). This particular limb
                    therefore also applies to conduct in the advocate and solicitor’s personal
                    capacity; the advocate and solicitor only has to be shown to be guilty of
                    conduct which would “render him unfit to remain as a member of an
                    honourable profession” (<em>ibid</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     It should be noted that the court of three
                    Judges has extensive powers in hearing an application for an order pursuant to
                    s 98(1) of the Act (see s 98(8) of the Act):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(8) The court of 3 Judges —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(<em>a</em>) shall have full power to determine
                            any question necessary to be determined for the purpose of doing justice
                            in the case, including any question as to the correctness, legality or
                            propriety of the determination of the Disciplinary Tribunal, or as to
                            the regularity of any proceedings of the Disciplinary Tribunal;
                            and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(<em>b</em>) may make an order
                            setting aside the determination of the Disciplinary Tribunal and
                            directing —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-3">(i) the Disciplinary Tribunal to rehear and reinvestigate the
                                complaint or matter; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-3">(ii) the Society to apply to the Chief Justice for the appointment
                                of another Disciplinary Tribunal to hear and investigate the
                                complaint or matter</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     However, the court of three Judges will not
                    interfere with findings of fact by a disciplinary tribunal unless the
                    conclusions are “clearly against the weight of evidence” (see
                        <em>Law Society of Singapore v Lim Cheong Peng</em>
                    [2006] 4 SLR(R) 360 (“<em>Lim Cheong
                        Peng</em>”) at [13]). A
                    different approach is taken to findings based on inferences. The court of three
                    Judges is as competent as a disciplinary tribunal in drawing inferences of fact
                        (<em>Lim Cheong Peng</em> at [14]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Our view</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Our view was that the DT had correctly found
                    that the False Bill Charge, the Accountant’s Report Charge and the Account
                    Inspection Charge were made out on the evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     We begin with the False Bill Charge. We found
                    that the Bill was a sham on the Respondent’s own evidence. It will be
                    recalled that the Respondent’s evidence was that the Consultancy Fee
                    Deposit was in reality a party political donation and that he had <em>paid </em><em>out</em> the Consultancy
                    Fee Deposit to a representative of the Cambodian government (see <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a>–<a href="#p1_10">[10]</a>
                    above). On this version of events, the Bill was patently false. The Bill
                    represented that the Consultancy Fee Deposit was received by the Respondent as
                        <em>his </em><em>professional
                        charges</em>. This stands in stark contrast to his evidence that he
                    was, in essence, <em>channelling</em> the Consultancy Fee
                    Deposit through his law firm. In fact, the Respondent conceded in
                    cross-examination that the Bill was a sham:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">
<em>Yes</em>.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     We turn now to the Accountant’s Report
                    Charge and the Account Inspection Charge. It would be convenient to deal with
                    both charges together since they are similar. The Accountant’s Report
                    Charge alleges that the Respondent “failed to honestly cooperate and
                    wilfully failed to provide accurate information and explanations to [his]
                    accountants for the purposes of their preparation of the Accountant’s
                    Report” required under the Act by providing inaccurate information to
                    them about the Bill and/or the nature of the payment of US$100,000 to the
                    Respondent’s law firm.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> The Account Inspection Charge is
                    similarly worded save that the Respondent was alleged to have failed to provide
                    accurate information to the <em>Council of the Law
                        Society</em> in its inspection of the Respondent’s law
                    firm’s books. The Respondent’s only contention in connection with
                    these two charges was that there was no evidence that he was dishonest or that
                    his failure to provide accurate information was wilful.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> There was no doubt
                    that he did not in fact provide accurate information to his accountants and the
                    Council of the Law Society.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     We found that there was sufficient evidence
                    before the DT to infer that the Respondent’s failure to provide accurate
                    information to the Council of the Law Society and his accountant was wilful and
                    amounted to a lack of honest cooperation. The Respondent provided the Council of
                    the Law Society and his accountant with the Bill when he was made to produce his
                    accounting records. The Respondent was not under any misapprehension as to the
                    nature of the Bill. He knew that the Bill was a sham. In the absence of a
                    reasonable explanation from the Respondent as to why he submitted a sham
                    document to his accountant and the Council of the Law Society without disclosing
                    its true nature, the only possible inference that we could draw from his conduct
                    was that he intended for the Council of the Law Society and his accountant to
                    accept the Bill as a genuine document. We did not think that an advocate and
                    solicitor who intentionally presents sham documents to his accountant and the
                    Council of the Law Society can be said to have honestly cooperated with
                    them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     We should also mention that the Respondent had
                    in his written submissions referred to a Statement of Auditing Practice
                    (“SAP”) approved by the Council of the Institute of Certified
                    Public Accountants of Singapore in February 1986 (as revised and amended) for
                    use in the auditing of solicitors’ accounts
                        (“SAP 7”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> Like r 4(2) of the Legal Profession
                    (Accountant’s Report) Rules (Cap 161, R 10, 1999 Rev Ed),
                    para 26 of SAP 7 provides, in effect, that an accountant is not
                    required to enquire beyond the information contained in the relevant documents
                    relating to any client’s matter (as supplemented by such information and
                    explanations as the accountant may obtain from the solicitor). The
                    Respondent’s argument was that SAP 7 showed that his accountant would
                    not have been misled by the Bill.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     We did not see the relevance of SAP 7 to
                    the Accountant’s Report Charge. The Accountant’s Report Charge
                    charged the Respondent with failing to honestly cooperate and wilfully failing
                    to provide accurate information to his accountant. The impact of the
                    Respondent’s provision of a false bill on the accountant’s role in
                    preparing his Accountant’s Report is immaterial to the
                charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The appropriate sanction</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The applicable legal principles</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     It is well established that if an advocate and
                    solicitor is shown to be dishonest, he will “almost invariably” be
                    struck off the roll (see <em>Ng Bock Hoh Dixon (2010)</em>
                    at [31]). However, dishonesty is not the
                    only situation which will warrant striking an advocate and solicitor off the
                    roll; an advocate and solicitor <em>may</em> be struck off
                    even where dishonesty is not shown if he is “shown to have fallen below
                    the required standards of integrity, probity and trustworthiness” (see
                        <em>Ng Bock Hoh Dixon (2010)</em> at [32] citing the English Court of Appeal
                    decision of <em>Bolton v Law Society</em> [1994]
                    1 WLR 512 at 518):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">32     However, it
                            does <em>not</em> follow that an absence
                        of dishonesty will <em>never</em> result in
                        an advocate and solicitor being struck off the roll. In the oft-cited words
                        of Sir Thomas Bingham MR in the English Court of Appeal decision
                            of <em>Bolton v Law Society</em> [1994]
                        1 WLR 512 at 518:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Any solicitor who is shown to have discharged his professional duties
                            with anything less than complete integrity, probity and trustworthiness
                            must expect severe sanctions to be imposed upon him ... Lapses from the
                            required high standard may, of course, <em>take
                                different forms and be of varying degrees</em>.
                                The <em>most
                                serious</em> involves <em>proven
                                dishonesty, whether or not</em> leading to criminal
                            proceedings and criminal penalties. In such cases the tribunal
                                has <em>almost invariably, no matter how strong
                                the mitigation advanced for the solicitor, ordered that he be struck
                                off the Roll of Solicitors.</em> Only infrequently,
                            particularly in recent years, has it been willing to order the
                            restoration to the Roll of a solicitor against whom <em>serious dishonesty</em> had been established,
                            even after a passage of years, and even where the solicitor had made
                            every effort to re-establish himself and redeem his
                                reputation. <em>If a solicitor is not shown to
                                have acted dishonestly, but is shown to have fallen below the
                                required standards of integrity, probity and trustworthiness, his
                                lapse is less serious but it remains very serious indeed in a member
                                of a profession whose reputation depends upon trust. A striking off
                                order will not necessarily follow in such a case, but it may well.
                                The decision whether to strike off or to suspend will often involve
                                a fine and difficult exercise of judgment, to be made by the
                                tribunal as an informed and expert body on all the facts of the
                                case. Only in a very unusual and venial case of this kind would the
                                tribunal be likely to regard as appropriate any order less severe
                                than one of suspension.</em> [emphasis added]</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Our view</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     We found that the Respondent’s conduct
                    clearly fell below the standards of integrity, probity and trustworthiness
                    required of an advocate and solicitor and that his conduct warranted an order
                    that he be struck off the roll.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     On his own evidence, the Respondent had
                    deliberately created a false document in the course of discharging his
                    professional duties. Although the document that he falsified in the present
                    case, <em>viz</em>¸ the Bill, was not a
                    court document (as was the case in the False Judgment Disciplinary Proceedings),
                    it was nevertheless an important accounting record relating to his law
                    firm’s client’s account. As Mr Vergis had submitted at the
                    hearing before us, courts take improprieties involving the handling of
                    clients’ accounts very seriously (see, for example, <em>Law
                        Society of Singapore v Tay Eng Kwee Edwin</em> [2007]
                    4 SLR(R) 171 (“<em>Edwin Tay</em>”)
                    at [26])<em>.</em>
                    We appreciated that the charges for which the Respondent was found liable did
                    not involve a breach of the Solicitors’ Account Rules and hence <em>Edwin Tay</em> was not strictly relevant. Nevertheless,
                        <em>Edwin Tay</em> is pertinent for this court’s
                    remarks on the importance of proper maintenance of clients’ accounts. It
                    is beyond dispute that bills produced by advocates and solicitors are important
                    documents and it is vital to the proper maintenance of accounting records that
                    they mean what they say. Hence, it could not be argued that the
                    Respondent’s conduct in the present proceedings was less severe than his
                    conduct in the False Judgment Disciplinary Proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In fact, we were of the view that the
                    Respondent’s conduct in the present case was, on one view at least,
                        <em>more egregious</em> than his conduct in the False
                    Judgment Disciplinary Proceedings. One aspect which particularly influenced the
                    court in the False Judgment Disciplinary Proceedings was the fact that the false
                    court document was <em>only meant to be shown to the
                        complainant’s wife</em> in order to placate her (see <em>Ng Bock Hoh Dixon (2010)</em> at [36]). In other words, the false document was not put into
                    general circulation. In contrast, the Bill in the present case formed a part of
                    the Respondent’s accounting documents and was presented to third parties
                        (<em>ie</em>, the Council of the Law Society and the
                    Respondent’s accountant) without further clarification.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     We also took into account the fact that the
                    Respondent had previously been suspended for a period of two years for
                    falsifying a judgment (see <a href="#p1_3">[3]</a> above). The
                    fact that an advocate and solicitor had previously committed a similar
                    disciplinary offence is a significant aggravating factor that the court will
                    consider in determining the appropriate sanction (see <em>Law
                        Society of Singapore v Low Yong Sen</em> [2009] 1 SLR(R) 802
                    at [41]). Having said that, we accepted that the events for which the Respondent
                    was charged in these proceedings occurred <em>before</em>
                    he was subjected to the False Judgment Disciplinary Proceedings. In the criminal
                    law context, the Singapore High Court has observed that if an accused is
                        <em>convicted</em> of an earlier offence only <em>after</em> he <em>committed</em> the
                    offence for which he is being sentenced, the court might consider that he was
                    “not acting in defiant disregard of the law”; in certain
                    circumstances, the court may even sentence such an accused person as a first
                    time offender (see <em>Public Prosecutor v Boon Kiah
                        Kin</em> [1993] 2 SLR(R) 26 at [37]). This is not to say that the first offence is entirely
                    irrelevant to sentencing unless the offender has been convicted of it before he
                    committed the first offence. All that can be said is that the Respondent was not
                    acting in defiance of the disciplinary process. However, the False Judgment
                    Disciplinary Proceedings were certainly relevant because they demonstrated a
                    disturbing <em>propensity</em> on the part of the
                    Respondent to falsify documents. We also pause to note that the Bill was
                    rendered by the Respondent not long after the Respondent had prepared the false
                    court judgments that were the subject of the False Judgment Disciplinary
                    Proceedings. The Respondent’s conduct in the present proceedings did not,
                    therefore, appear to us to be the product of a discrete and momentary lapse of
                    judgment. We did not think that an advocate and solicitor who demonstrated such
                    a propensity could be described as having the requisite standards of integrity,
                    probity and trustworthiness.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     We should also say that we were not impressed
                    with the Respondent’s repeated references in his written submissions to
                    the fact that the DT had not found him to be dishonest. We agreed with
                    Mr Vergis’s submission that a <em>lack</em> of a
                    finding of dishonesty in the Report of the DT does not equate to a finding that
                    the Respondent was <em>not</em> dishonest. Indeed, as
                    already noted above (at <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a>), the Law
                    Society had not pursued the point that the Respondent was dishonest in the
                    proceedings below and it was therefore not surprising that the DT had arrived at
                    the finding it did.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     For all these reasons, we ordered that the
                    Respondent was to be struck off the roll. We made no order as to costs in view
                    of the Law Society’s indication that it was not seeking
                costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Postscript</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     In <em>Edwin Tay</em>,
                    the court expressed its regret (at [29])
                    that it was not informed that another disciplinary proceeding was pending
                    against the advocate and solicitor in question:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">29     Subsequent to the hearing, our attention
                        was drawn to the fact that there was in fact another DC proceeding
                        concerning the respondent which related to a breach of the
                        [Solicitors’ Accounts] Rules. <em>It is regrettable
                            that in a case of this nature, counsel for the Law Society failed to
                            highlight this case to us in her submissions.</em> All that
                        counsel mentioned in passing was that other unrelated DC proceedings
                        prevailed against the respondent. This did not convey the correct picture.
                        The respondent had actually been found guilty by another DC of having
                        breached r 3 of the [Solicitors’ Accounts] Rules (“the
                        second DC proceedings”) as well. No show cause proceedings were
                        subsequently initiated against the respondent only because he had been
                        struck off the roll in the present proceedings. The second DC proceedings
                        had been initiated as a result of the respondent's inappropriate conduct in
                        depositing $15,000 into an overdrawn office account rather than properly
                        into a client's account. While we are satisfied that counsel was not aware
                        of the outcome of these disciplinary proceedings, this does not absolve her
                        from the duty of diligence to draw all material facts to the court's
                        attention. <em>The substance of the second DC proceedings
                            should have been specifically drawn to our attention even if counsel was
                            not aware of the actual outcome of the disciplinary proceedings when we
                            heard this matter.</em> Counsel should not have so quickly echoed
                        the respondent's blithe and by no means verifiable claim that no loss had
                        accrued as a result of his conduct. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Unfortunately, heed was not taken of this caution in the False
                    Judgment Disciplinary Proceedings. The Respondent appeared before a court of
                    three Judges on 2 February 2010 for the show cause proceedings in respect
                    of the False Judgment Disciplinary Proceedings. By this time, the DT for these
                    proceedings had already been appointed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> Counsel for the
                    Law Society should have informed the court of three Judges during the show cause
                    proceedings for the False Judgment Disciplinary Proceedings that the Respondent
                    was facing other charges. We reiterate that the Law Society should attempt its
                    level best to apprise the court of three Judges of all material facts including
                    the fact that the advocate and solicitor in question is facing other
                    disciplinary proceedings. Once apprised of such material facts, the court of
                    three Judges may well decide to adjourn the hearing in order to comprehensively
                    hear all current matters pending against the advocate and solicitor
                    concerned.</p>
