</div>
</div>
</div> When VIG was first set up through an agreement of 1 April 2011, Viking Engineering was the 51% majority shareholder of VIG, and Mr Feen the owner of the remainder of the shares. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 By a share purchase agreement on 10 September 2013 (“the SPA”) between the two parties, Viking Engineering sold 21% of its shareholding to Mr Feen, thereby giving Mr Feen a 70% shareholding in VIG. This resulted in Viking Engineering becoming a minority shareholder with a 30% shareholding in VIG. The SPA obliged Mr Feen to abide by various undertakings. In particular, clause 5.1 of the SPA (“Clause 5.1”) provided that Mr Feen was to change VIG’s name to “Feen Marine Pte Ltd” or some other name agreed between the parties (“the Name-change Obligation”). The same clause also provided that Mr Feen was not to use the “Viking” name in any manner which may compete with the business of Viking Engineering, or be associated with or perceived to be associated with Viking Engineering (“the Non-use Obligation”). Under Clause 5.3, Viking Engineering and Mr Feen were to use their best endeavours to procure a contract for a new inert gas system (“IGS”) and exhaust gas cleaning project for VIG. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 On 4 April 2017, Viking Engineering commenced Suit No 294 of 2017 (“S 294/2017”), as minority shareholder of VIG, seeking various injunctions and remedies for minority oppression under s 216 of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (“CA”) against the first to fourth defendants. Viking Engineering contended that, contrary to the SPA, Mr Feen failed to change the name of VIG to “Feen Marine Pte Ltd”. Instead, he incorporated a new company of the same name, being the second defendant (“Feen Marine”). Mr Feen thereafter transferred his entire shareholding in VIG to Feen Marine without first giving Viking Engineering the option of buying his shares. Viking Engineering contended that this action contravened Article 28 of VIG’s articles of association. The business and corporate opportunities of VIG were alleged to have subsequently been diverted to Feen Marine; the fourth defendant, Scanjet Feen IGS Pte Ltd (“Scanjet Feen”); and the fifth defendant, Feen Marine Scrubbers Pte Ltd (“Feen Marine Scrubbers”). Mr Feen was the sole director of each of these companies, collectively referred to as “the Feen Companies”. Various claims were also made in relation to loans made to VIG and items said to have been taken from Viking Engineering’s premises by VIG. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 Viking Engineering then followed on with Summons No 4101 of 2017 seeking summary judgment in S 294/2017. On 24 November 2017, leave was given to Viking Engineering to amend its summons to include a prayer (as prayed for in its Statement of Claim) for a buy-out of its shares in VIG by Mr Feen. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 On 14 February 2018, I granted an injunction to restrain Mr Feen and his agents from using the name “Viking” in any manner which may compete with the business of Viking Engineering or be associated with or perceived to be associated with Viking Engineering or the business of Viking Engineering. I also ordered Mr Feen to purchase Viking Engineering’s entire shareholding in VIG, with an independent valuer to be appointed to ascertain the fair value of the shares by agreement within 14 days of final judgment. Counsel for the defendants asked for time to submit on whether a discount ought to be applied by the valuer to Viking Engineering’s minority holding in VIG.

</div> At the same time, after Viking Engineering contended that there was also evidence of diversion of business opportunities from VIG to Feen Marine Scrubbers, the latter was added by consent as the fifth defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 On 9 April 2018, after hearing parties on the question of whether a discount for Viking Engineering’s minority shareholding should apply, I held that no discount should be applied. I also ordered that the valuer make adjustments, as part of his valuation, for the diversion of opportunities to the Feen Companies. On the same date, in the course of finalising the form of the final orders, parties agreed that the cost of the valuation exercise would be borne by Mr Feen.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 The orders arising out of the summary judgment application were therefore the following:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">1.

These included claims that Mr Feen, as sole director of VIG, failed to cause VIG to repay loans made by Viking Engineering to VIG and sums that Viking Engineering had paid on VIG’s behalf; and that VIG unlawfully took items from Viking Engineering’s premises.

In this regard, the first consideration in a summons under O 14 is whether the plaintiff has established a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case. Where the plaintiff fails to do so, his application is dismissed. Otherwise, the burden shifts to the defendant who must establish that there is a fair or reasonable probability that he has a real or <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>defence: <span class="font-italic">M2B World Asia Pacific Pte Ltd v Matsumura Akihiko </span>[2015] 1 SLR 325 at [17].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Prohibitory injunction</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 In the present case it was contended that Mr Feen had used the Viking name to divert business to the Feen Companies.

In <span class="font-italic">RGA Holdings International Inc v </span><span class="font-italic">Loh Choon Phing Robin and another</span> [2017] 2 SLR 997, the Court of Appeal set out the principles as follows at [32]:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) A prohibitory injunction to restrain the breach of a negative stipulation in a contract is normally granted as a matter of course.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The court is not concerned with the balance of convenience. That damages would be an adequate remedy is not generally a relevant consideration.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) As the remedy is an equitable one, it is in principle discretionary, and it may be refused on the ground that it would cause particular hardship as to be oppressive to the defendant.

These bases are not to be read disjunctively; instead, “commercial unfairness” is the touchstone of the inquiry: <span class="font-italic">Over &amp; Over Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Bonvests Holdings Ltd and another </span>[2010] 2 SLR 776 (“<span class="font-italic">Over &amp; Over</span>”) at [70] and [81].

Absent equitable considerations such as the “quasi-partnership” status of a company, the unfairness of a party’s conduct is measured against legitimate expectations arising from the members’ legal rights and the company constitution: <span class="font-italic">Leong Chee Kin </span>at [51].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 Viking Engineering essentially made the following assertions about Mr Feen’s actions:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, he did not change VIG’s name to “Feen Marine Pte Ltd” as agreed under the SPA. Instead, he incorporated Feen Marine as a new company.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) He then misused VIG’s name to divert business to Feen Marine.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) He transferred his shareholding in VIG to Feen Marine. In so doing, Feen Marine became the majority shareholder of VIG.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) He set up additional Feen Companies in conflict of interest as a director of VIG and diverted opportunities to them.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) He did not answer requests for information about VIG from Viking Engineering.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 Viking Engineering’s contentions may be summarised into two strands. The first, arising from his actions in (a) and (b) above, was Mr Feen’s failure to protect the “Viking” name, premised on Clause 5.1 of the SPA. These were made out, and I granted the injunction to restrain his further misuse of the “Viking” name. The second related to the diversion of business away from the joint venture company that the two shareholders had devised in the SPA, to the Feen Companies.

</div> To the contrary, Clause 5.1 envisaged that the new joint venture entity would be called Feen Marine. Mr Feen’s incorporation of a new company by the same name in which Viking Engineering had no share was not envisaged by Clause 5.1. And to thereafter represent that VIG had become Feen Marine, a wholly unrelated company, was a breach of the Non-Use Obligation of Clause 5.1. There was, thirdly, a bare assertion that the “Viking” name was not used, which was contradicted by the affidavit evidence. The Dragon Marine contract was a good example of how the failure to abide by both obligations of Clause 5.1 allowed business to be diverted from VIG to the Feen Companies. It was signed on 13 October 2014 between “Viking Inert Gas Systems” and Dragon Marine for the supply of IGS,

However, the defendants’ reading of the clause ignored the opening frame of Article 28. Article 28 first provides that shares may be freely transferred to existing members (“the opening frame”). Because what follows immediately after is “but save as aforesaid, no share shall be transferred to a person who is not a member…”, the opening frame, in effect, became mandatory: shares <span class="font-italic">may only be transferred to members</span>. Article 28 thereafter provides (from “so long as…”) that shares may not be transferred to non–members where there is either: (a) a member willing to purchase the shares at fair value, or (b) “any person selected by the director…” willing to purchase the shares at fair value. It may be said that this reading renders the alternative of “any person selected by the directors as one whom it is desirable in the interest of [VIG] to admit to membership” otiose as these persons are also, strictly speaking, non–members. On balance, however, reading the first line as mandatory does less violence to the clause as a whole. Reading Article 28 as giving members a pre–emption right would also be consistent with the Court of Appeal’s characterisation in <span class="font-italic">Ting </span><span class="font-italic">Shwu Ping</span> of such a clause as one granting pre-emption rights. Lastly, such a reading makes sensible commercial sense because VIG was a company with two members.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29  In any event, breach of the clause <span class="font-italic">per se</span> was not the main point. I did not order any remedies specific to the pre-emption rights. What was important, in my view, was the commercial unfairness in Mr Feen’s conduct. In this context, the transfer of Mr Feen’s shares in VIG to Feen Marine was a step in Mr Feen’s diversionary scheme (see [15] above). In this regard, I note that Mr Feen does not deny that notice of his intention to transfer the shares was not given to VIG as required in Article 29 of VIG’s articles of association.

</div> In this regard, Viking Engineering rely on Clause 5.3, which provided that both parties were to use their best endeavours to procure contracts for exhaust gas cleaning projects for VIG. Mr Feen’s directorship in Feen Marine Scrubbers placed in him in a conflict of interest, and exhaust gas cleaning contracts obtained by Feen Marine were at the expense of VIG. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 The defendants did not deny that Mr Feen was a director of the Feen Companies, nor that he set them up; however, they disputed that Mr Feen acted in breach of his duties. The defendants first argued that Feen Marine and Scanjet Feen were not in competition with the VIG, contending that VIG’s business was in the manufacture and sale of flue gas systems, which was otherwise referred to in the industry as IGS.

</div> Feen Marine, on the other hand, sold “Inert Gas Generator” (“IGG”) systems, which the defendants saw as distinct from IGS in terms of the type of ships it was installed in, and the cleanliness of the inert gas generated. In relation to Scanjet Feen, the defendants asserted that it was the sales and marketing arm of Feen Marine and was thus not in the same business as VIG. The Defendants also asserted that there was a triable issue as to whether VIG was in a position to have entered into or fulfilled IGS contracts.

But the quarterly reports sought did not require auditing. Mr Feen eventually sent the 2013 Annual Report sometime in May 2016. He also held an AGM on 1 August 2016, shortly after a letter of demand was sent by Viking Engineering’s lawyers demanding an explanation for Mr Feen’s current and previous failures to hold AGMs for VIG.

Mr Feen had breached Clause 5.1 of the SPA, which was intended to protect the use of “Viking”, a component of Viking Engineering’s name, in the changed joint venture that undergirded the SPA. This went to the foundation of the understanding between parties. Mr Feen then set up new corporate entities, using for the first the very name that was to have been the name of the renamed joint venture. He diverted business opportunities and customers to these companies when the opportunities should have been directed to the renamed joint venture. Viking Engineering was entitled, on the other hand, to a legitimate expectation that Mr Feen would act in accordance with his fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of VIG: <span class="font-italic">Leong Chee Kin</span> at [65]. In the present case, the diversion of business opportunities to the Feen Companies amounted to egregious commercial unfairness and oppression of minority interest. Such behaviour undermined the basis of the joint effort, as the joint venture partner could no longer participate in any resulting business. Lastly, Mr Feen’s refusal to give Viking Engineering any information on VIG’s financial affairs was further oppression. It kept Viking Engineering in the dark regarding his harmful conduct against VIG and Viking Engineering. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Section 216(2) of the CA permits the court to make any order that it deems fit. In the present case, in view of Mr Feen’s conduct, the only solution that would properly bring the oppression to an end was for Mr Feen to purchase Viking Engineering’s shares. I therefore ordered, pursuant to section 216(2)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the CA, Mr Feen to purchase Viking Engineering’s entire shareholding in VIG at fair value, to be assessed by an independent valuer to be appointed by agreement within 14 days of final judgment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Three other matters were relevant to the valuation. First, VIG was a going concern at the time of the order, and therefore the valuation was on the basis that it was a going concern. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Second, Viking Engineering had asked for an account of all benefits received by Mr Feen and the Feen Companies at the expense of VIG, on the footing that a valuation of VIG would not include the value of the diverted opportunities.

</div> In <span class="font-italic">Kumagai</span><span class="font-italic"> Gumi Co Ltd v Zenecon Pte Ltd</span> [1995] 2 SLR(R) 304 at [77], the Court of Appeal held that s 216 was wide enough to cover an order to make good loss suffered by the company. Rather than to order an account, which involved another step in the process, I decided a more practicable remedy would be to direct the valuer to adjust the valuation of the shares on the assumption that VIG had undertaken the business and earned the profits that were diverted away from it to the Feen Companies. These would have been profits that VIG would rightly have earned, and the intent of the venture was for the partners to share such profits in proportion to their shareholding. The order was limited to the business of VIG, being insert gas systems and exhaust gas cleaners.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Thirdly, I directed that the valuer should not apply any discount to the purchase price to account for the fact that Viking Engineering’s shares represented a minority shareholding in VIG. In <span class="font-italic">Over &amp; Over</span> (at [132]), the Court of Appeal declined to apply a discount where the irreversible breakdown of the parties’ commercial relationship was largely precipitated by the majority shareholder. In the present case, Viking Engineering was initially the majority shareholder. It sold 21% of its shareholding to Mr Feen, entrusting him with the majority shareholding on terms which he intentionally breached, using VIG as a platform while denuding its value by diverting its business and customers. Mr Feen, on the buy-out, would gain full control of the assets of VIG, which was what he sought by his various plans to achieve prior to the suit, in any event. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 For these reasons, I granted the injunction and buy-out order as explained.
