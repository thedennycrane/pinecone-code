The Appellant claimed that the DJ erred in sentencing him to reformative training (“RT”) for the minimum period of detention of six months. He asserted that a sentence of probation would be more appropriate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The Appellant had pleaded guilty to one charge of voluntarily causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapons or means by stabbing and slashing his father with a 8 cm-blade steak knife, an offence under s 326 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the PC”). A further charge of voluntarily causing hurt under s 323 of the PC was taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 After hearing the parties’ submissions, I dismissed the appeal on 11 November 2019. In doing so, I delivered brief oral remarks. My reasons for my decision are now set out in full as follows. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Background </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The Appellant had admitted to the Statement of Facts without qualification. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The Appellant’s father was 46 years old at the date of the incident (29 November 2016). The Appellant was 16 years old, and had been staying at his paternal grandfather’s flat at the material time.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 Prior to 18 November 2016, the Appellant had been asking his father (hereinafter referred to as “the victim”) for money and claimed that he needed $3,000 to pay for car rides as part of his work to survey Uber drivers on behalf of Grab. However, the victim only gave the Appellant $1,000 and transferred the same into his account.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 After spending the $1,000, the Appellant requested for the remainder of $2,000 from the victim. The victim refused this request multiple times. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 On 29 November 2016, the Appellant requested the amount of $2,000 from his grandparents but was also rejected by them. The Appellant subsequently decided to confront the victim at the victim’s flat. He brought a steak knife with a blade length of approximately 8 cm, which he took from his grandfather’s flat.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 At approximately 8.30am, the victim was leaving for work when he saw the Appellant hiding beside a shoe cabinet outside his flat. The Appellant demanded to know why the victim refused to give him the money as requested and started to push and shove the victim. The victim warned the Appellant not to touch him, and told him that he would not give any money to him. The Appellant continued to push and shove the victim, which caused the latter to drop his key pouch. The Appellant then threw the victim’s key pouch towards a drain along the corridor.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 At approximately 8.31am, as the victim was picking up his key pouch from the drain, the Appellant took the steak knife and stabbed the victim’s head continuously for about two to three times. This caused the victim to fall to the ground, upon which the Appellant grabbed the victim’s key pouch.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 The victim screamed for help and tried to stop the Appellant from using his key to enter the flat, but the Appellant continued to stab and slash the victim. He also punched and kicked the victim multiple times.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 The victim continued to scream for help and tried to fend off the Appellant’s blows with his hands. The Appellant shoved a pink recyclable bag into the victim’s mouth multiple times. The Appellant also yanked a haversack that the victim was carrying, which pulled on the victim’s body and shook him around the floor. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 The victim attempted to reach for his phone to call his wife, but the Appellant tried to pull it out of his hand. During the struggle for the victim’s phone, while the victim was lying prone on the floor, the Appellant kicked him in his face.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 At this point, the victim’s neighbours noticed the struggle between the Appellant and the victim, and called the police.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 When the paramedics arrived at the incident location at approximately 8.45am, the victim was found lying on the floor, near a pool of blood. The victim was then conveyed to and admitted to Tan Tock Seng Hospital.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 As a result of the attack, the victim sustained the following injuries:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) multiple stab wounds and lacerations over the scalp;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) left metacarpal dorsum stab wound that required wound exploration, debridement and closure by a hand surgeon;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) two facial lacerations; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) scalp haematomas.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 The victim was discharged from hospital three days later, on 1 December 2016, and was given 20 days of hospitalisation leave. A report dated 10 August 2017 also clarified that injuries sustained by the victim would result in scarring and potential disfigurement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 As a result of the incident, the victim’s family (excluding the Appellant) decided to move out of the victim’s flat for approximately two months as they were concerned for their safety. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The proceedings below</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Following the incident, the Appellant was arrested and referred to the Institute of Mental Health (“IMH”) for psychiatric evaluation. An IMH report dated 19 December 2016 was subsequently adduced.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 The Appellant was eventually charged on 25 May 2018, and indicated, on 8 August 2018, that he was claiming trial as he had acted in self-defence. He was unrepresented at the time and he had applied to the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme (“CLAS”) for a lawyer to be assigned to assist him. He went through the Criminal Case Disclosure Conference process and took trial dates which were scheduled for 27 February to 1 March 2019. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 When counsel was assigned by CLAS in January 2019 to represent the Appellant, his instructions remained to claim trial. On 27 February 2019, the first day of trial, the Appellant indicated that he wanted to plead guilty. The plea of guilt was recorded on the same day.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 In order to determine the appropriate sentence to be imposed, the DJ called for both a Reformative Training Suitability Report (“RT Report”) and a Probation Suitability Report (“Probation Report”). The Appellant was found to be suitable for RT, but not probation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 In sentencing the Appellant to RT for the minimum period of six months, the DJ made five key findings:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, that rehabilitation would remain the dominant sentencing consideration in the sentencing matrix, but that considerations of deterrence were present given several aggravating factors (see the GD at [36]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, that the Appellant did not demonstrate genuine remorse (see the GD at [45]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, that the Appellant possessed risk factors which supported a sentence of RT (see the GD at [48], [59]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Fourth, that there was a lack of effective familial supervision over the Appellant (see the GD at [52]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Fifth, that RT should be imposed instead of probation (see the GD at [60]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Dissatisfied with the DJ’s decision, the Appellant brought the present appeal.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The parties’ cases  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 The Appellant disagreed with all but the first of the DJ’s key findings. In addition, counsel for the Appellant argued that an order of probation with strict conditions would be more appropriate considering the Appellant’s circumstances. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The Respondent, on the other hand, submitted that the DJ’s key findings were correct, emphasising the Appellant’s lack of remorse and the ability of RT to serve both sentencing considerations of rehabilitation and deterrence.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 I first analysed the applicable sentencing considerations, before addressing the parties’ specific contentions.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The applicable sentencing considerations </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The framework provided in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Koh Wen Jie Boaz</span> [2016] 1 SLR 334 (“<span class="font-italic">Boaz</span>”) is readily applicable in the present circumstances. In <span class="font-italic">Boaz</span>, Sundaresh Menon CJ explained at [28] that a court sentencing a youthful offender who is aged 21 years and below should adopt a two-stage test: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… At the first stage of the sentencing process, the task for the court is to <span class="font-italic">identify and prioritise the primary sentencing considerations</span> appropriate to the youth in question having regard to all the circumstances including those of the offence. This will then set the parameters for the second stage of the inquiry, which is to <span class="font-italic">select the appropriate sentence that would best meet those sentencing considerations</span> and the priority that the sentencing judge has placed upon the relevant ones. [emphasis added in italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 While rehabilitation is generally the dominant sentencing consideration in sentencing youthful offenders, where an offender has committed a serious offence, the principle of rehabilitation “may be outweighed by other considerations such as the need for general and specific deterrence and even retribution” (see <span class="font-italic">Praveen s/o Krishnan v Public Prosecutor</span> [2018] 3 SLR 1300 (“<span class="font-italic">Praveen</span>”) at [28]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The need for deterrence was plain. The brutal attack that the Appellant carried out on the victim bore several aggravating factors: the attack was premeditated (the Appellant had brought a kitchen knife from his grandparents’ house), vicious (the Appellant slashed, stabbed, and kicked the victim multiple times), and serious injuries were caused, including potential disfigurement to the victim. These aggravating factors were not disputed by the Appellant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 What the Appellant took issue with was the DJ’s analysis of the second stage of the <span class="font-italic">Boaz</span> test. He argued that the DJ had misconstrued the legal framework in the second stage, by finding that where deterrence features as part of the sentencing considerations, a sentence of probation would be inappropriate, and RT should be imposed instead.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32  With respect, this was a misunderstanding of the DJ’s position. The DJ had made clear that both probation and RT were <span class="font-italic">potentially</span> applicable options in the present case – she did not unequivocally dismiss the possibility of probation outright as a sentencing option simply because there was a need for deterrence. As stated by the DJ at [36] of the GD:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is undisputed that rehabilitation is the dominant sentencing consideration in this case especially where the accused was 16 years old at the material time … Neither was it disputed by the defence that there was a need for deterrence … <span class="font-italic">The issue then is whether rehabilitation should take centre-stage in the sentencing matrix such that probation would typically be imposed or reformative training, which would be the ‘middle ground that broadly encapsulates the twin principles of rehabilitation and deterrence’</span> … [emphasis added in italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 It was hence clear that a sentence of probation was not automatically ruled out by the DJ. The DJ merely stated that in a situation where there was a <span class="font-italic">stronger</span> need for deterrence, RT would be more appropriate. I saw nothing objectionable in principle with this approach.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 In determining the balance to be struck between the twin considerations of rehabilitation and deterrence, the key question was whether, in light of all the relevant factors, the Appellant’s capacity for rehabilitation was demonstrably high such that it outweighed the public policy concerns that are traditionally understood as militating against probation (see <span class="font-italic">Praveen</span> at [29]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 In this regard, factors to be considered include (see <span class="font-italic">Leon Russel Francis v Public Prosecutor </span>[2014] 4 SLR 651 at [15], cited in <span class="font-italic">Praveen</span> at [30]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the strength of familial support and the degree of supervision provided by the offender’s family for his rehabilitation;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the frequency and intensity of the offender’s drug-related activities (which are inapplicable in the present case);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the genuineness of remorse demonstrated by the offender; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) the presence of risk factors such as negative peers or bad habits.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 I thus examined each factor.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the Appellant lacked genuine remorse</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The Appellant asserted that the DJ erred in finding that the Appellant lacked genuine remorse. He argued, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, that his act of pleading guilty at an early juncture, his honesty and candour in his interviews with the Probation Officer and Correctional Rehabilitation (RTC) Specialist, and his reformation of his life in the past three years following the incident demonstrated his genuine remorse. Emphasis was also placed on how the DJ unfairly equated the Appellant’s lack of attempts to express remorse to his parents with a lack of remorse in relation to the incident.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Appellant’s plea of guilt </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Despite counsel for the Appellant’s efforts in attempting to convince me otherwise, the Appellant could not be said to have entered an early plea of guilt. As conceded during oral submissions, when the Appellant was charged in court in May 2018, he took the position that he was claiming trial. He maintained that he had purportedly acted out of self-defence. He continued to dispute the charge for nine months, going through the Criminal Case Disclosure Conference process and taking dates for trial. His trial was scheduled for February 2019. It was only on the very first day of trial (27 February 2019), after he had obtained legal advice on being assigned counsel in January 2019, that the Appellant first indicated to the court his intention to plead guilty. The Appellant’s insistence on claiming trial until the first day of trial, on the basis that the victim had assaulted him first and that he was merely defending himself out of self-defence, betrayed his lack of insight and awareness of his wrongdoing. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Appellant’s purported honesty and candour</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 I also did not think that the Appellant was wholly candid and honest in his interviews with the Probation and Correctional Rehabilitation (RTC) Officers (“the Officers”). Even as of 15 April 2019, when the Probation Report was furnished to the DJ, the Appellant’s accounts were noted to be “often inconsistent” with his parents’ and other agencies’ accounts.

In response to his parents’ confrontation, the Appellant had purportedly shouted, made verbal threats, and lashed out violently – he stabbed a knife into a pile of newspapers, broke a hole in the coffee table with a hammer and hacked the kitchen table with a knife.

He specifically requested the Probation Officer to refrain from contacting his ex-girlfriend as he had already informed her that he was placed on probation.

</div> The Appellant’s paternal grandfather had originally reported that during a confrontation with the Appellant at home, the Appellant had pushed him. The Appellant denied this, claiming that his grandfather had held up a wooden stool, threatened to kill him and grabbed his upper arm. It was only when the Appellant pulled his arm away that the grandfather stumbled. The Appellant did acknowledge, in his interview with the Probation Officer, that the confrontation arose from his grandfather’s suspicion that he had stolen approximately $1,000 that was left on the table.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 I noted, however, that the Appellant’s grandfather subsequently claimed that he was unable to recall whether the Appellant had pushed him or if he had stumbled when the Appellant pulled his arm away. The Appellant’s grandmother had correspondingly then claimed that the grandfather was the initial aggressor. She was however unable to recall details as to when or what precipitated the incident.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 This was consistent with the psychological assessment by the Ministry of Social and Family Development’s clinical psychologist dated 3 April 2019 (“Psychological Report”). The Appellant was observed to downplay the psychological harm caused to his family by his aggressive behaviours. He sought to justify his anger towards them due to their purported mistreatment towards him (<span class="font-italic">eg</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> accusing him of stealing monies). He could not articulate victim impact issues, which went towards showing low victim empathy.

He was discernibly motivated to keep out of trouble after the offence in November 2016, and had not posed any disciplinary problems in school. He was able to lead a pro-social lifestyle and had part-time employment. These factors did demonstrate the Appellant’s capacity for reform. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 However, closer scrutiny would suggest that these indicators of reform may be more perceived than real. They reflected the Appellant’s somewhat selective reform endeavours but these had to be carefully weighed alongside his consciousness of wrongdoing and his professed amenability to supervision. I address the latter consideration more fully below. It will suffice to note for now that as evidenced by their recantation of the October 2018 confrontation, it appeared that the grandparents’ preferred parenting approach was to avoid “further confronting and angering” the Appellant – a point that also goes towards the lack of effective familial supervision over him.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Crucially, the surrounding circumstances suggest that the Appellant has yet to come to terms with his offending conduct, especially with regard to how it has negatively impacted his family. Despite approximately two and a half years having elapsed since the incident (November 2016) to the time he was sentenced (May 2019), the appellant did not express any willingness to acknowledge his wrongdoing to his parents, which serves as the first and necessary step to reconciliation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Counsel sought to attribute the Appellant’s lack of expression of remorse to his feeling that it would be “awkward” to apologise. It was only through counsel’s written submissions on sentencing dated 9 May 2019 that the Appellant first intimated willingness to make a “public and sincere apology” to his parents.

</div>
</div> To date, however, he has yet to do so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 As the DJ rightly noted at [41] of the GD, in the absence of any explanation as to how the Appellant’s “awkwardness” had somehow spontaneously dissipated, the Appellant’s sudden change of heart was “calculated to secure the most favourable outcome for himself, rather than a genuine gesture of remorse”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 More importantly, even if the Appellant was truly remorseful but had chosen to keep his emotions to himself, he did not demonstrate cognition or acceptance that he had done wrong for almost two and a half years. After he was arrested and sent for a psychiatric assessment at IMH in December 2016, his instinctive response was to fabricate a claim of self-defence or accident and pin the blame on the victim as the purported aggressor. He did not cooperate during the police investigations and tell the truth. He maintained this stance after he was charged one and a half years later in May 2018 by deciding to claim trial. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 To my mind, this was simply not how a genuinely remorseful and contrite offender would react. The fact that the Appellant was just over 18 years of age when he was first charged made little difference. Any offender who is sincerely penitent, even a youthful one like the Appellant, would unreservedly acknowledge his wrongdoing. He would hardly need to be prompted or advised by counsel to show his remorse. An expression of remorse should be spontaneous and evident from the offender’s own words and deeds. Regrettably, there was no such spontaneity to be found in the present case. Even more regrettably, this has largely persisted to the date of the appeal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Having considered all the circumstances, I agreed with the Probation Officer’s view that the Appellant remained unwilling to take ownership and responsibility for his actions. I agreed that the DJ was correct in finding that the appellant was not genuinely remorseful. I was not convinced that he had truly gleaned insight, accepted responsibility, and sufficiently internalised his wrongdoing and its consequences.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the Appellant’s risk factors supported a sentence of RT </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 The DJ relied primarily on the following considerations in finding that various risk factors remained extant (see the GD at [59]): </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the psychologist’s opinion that there had been a lack of negative consequences for the appellant’s earlier threatening behaviour towards his family that emboldened him to inflict physical harm onto the victim;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) aggravating factors such as the viciousness of the attack and the fact that it was premeditated;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the Appellant’s moderate risk of family violence; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) the Appellant’s non-compliance with the Mandatory Counselling Order. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The Appellant took issue with the DJ’s consideration of these factors, stating that she had improperly taken into account past circumstances when they were not significant risk factors for the future. It was argued that the appellant’s conduct in the two and a half years following the incident should be given greater consideration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 This, however, ignored the fact that the factors the DJ took into account were those that subsisted during the two and a half year period. The Appellant was assessed to have a moderate risk of “violent[ly] re-offending” in the Psychological Report.

</div> Additionally, he was to attend counselling sessions pursuant to a Mandatory Counselling Order for a one year duration from December 2016 but he attended only three out of the 13 sessions scheduled between January 2017 to December 2017.  He considered therapy unnecessary, despite its importance in regulating his aggressive behaviour.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 In particular, the Appellant’s persistent risk of reoffending is demonstrated through his grandfather’s account of the physical confrontation in October 2018 as well as the circumstances that precipitated it (namely, the Appellant’s alleged theft of cash). These facts spoke to unresolved issues on the part of the Appellant that appeared to persist, even when considering the period after the incident.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 I was thus of the view that the DJ’s assessment of the Appellant’s risk factors was appropriate.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the Appellant lacked effective familial supervision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 The DJ placed significant weight on how the Appellant’s grandparents would not be effective in exerting any form of firm supervision or guidance over him (see the GD at [50]). They would also be unlikely to provide accurate accounts of any of his future infractions or breaches of probation conditions (see the GD at [54]). This was despite the Appellant’s close relationship with them.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The Appellant took issue with this, arguing that the DJ had neglected to consider that in the period following the offence, he had reformed himself significantly under his grandparents’ care and guidance. They had adopted an “advisory style of parenting” that was said to be “fully effective”.

</div> He further emphasised how his grandparents would teach him right from wrong by reprimanding him where necessary – the Appellant’s grandmother had, for instance, scolded and caned him when he was in primary school.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 As alluded to above at [46], I agreed with the DJ that any influence the grandparents may be able to exert over the Appellant would be limited. The Appellants’ grandparents had clearly adopted a ‘hands-off’ approach. As evidenced by their recantation of the October 2018 confrontation, they actively avoided “confronting and angering” the Appellant, preferring to allow him to make his own decisions independently.

</div> This reflected the Appellant’s unwillingness to be supervised or disciplined in a familial setting. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 While his grandparents may have disciplined him in the past, they specifically stated that moving forward, they would “refrain from angering him by being mindful of not confronting or nagging at him”.
