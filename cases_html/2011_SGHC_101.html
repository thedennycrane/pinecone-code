<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This appeal centres on the conditions that have
                    to be met before an interim judgment of divorce is made final. To determine this

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The parties, whom I shall refer to as husband
                    and wife, were married on 2 November 2003. The wife is a Singapore citizen
                    while the husband is a citizen of the United States of America.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       On 23 January 2008, the wife filed for
                    divorce on the ground that the marriage had irretrievably broken down. The fact
                    relied on to prove the irretrievable breakdown was that the husband had behaved
                    in such a way that the wife could not reasonably be expected to live with him
                    (section 95(3)(b) of the Women’s Charter).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The interim judgment of divorce was granted on
                    30 January 2009 by the Family Court. The three-month period for cause to be
                    shown (see section 99(1) of the Women’s Charter) why the interim judgment
                    should not be made final lapsed on 30 April 2009. No application to show
                    cause was made by anyone in this case and neither did the wife apply for the
                    interim judgment to be made final.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       In 2010, the husband applied for leave to make
                    the interim judgment final. This was opposed by the wife. On 20 October
                    2010, the leave sought was granted by the deputy registrar who made no order as
                    to costs (“the 20 October 2010 order”). Pursuant to the
                    20 October 2010 order, the Certificate of Making Interim Judgment Final was
                    issued on 26 October 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The wife appealed against the decision of the
                    deputy registrar. The appeal was heard and dismissed with costs fixed at $1,000
                    by a district judge on 25 November 2010 (“the 25 November 2010
                    order”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       In the present appeal before me, the wife sought
                    to set aside the 25 November 2010 order, the 20 October 2010 order
                    and, consequently, the Certificate of Making Interim Judgment Final dated
                    26 October 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       There are two young children of the marriage,
                    born in 2004 and 2006 respectively. The prayers relating to the ancillary
                    matters have not been concluded. The ancillary matters cover custody, care and
                    control of the two children, maintenance for the wife and the two children and
                    division of matrimonial assets. However, there are interim orders with regard to
                    maintenance for the children, custody, care and control and access. There have
                    been numerous applications for discovery and interrogatories and also committal
                    proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The husband and his new partner have a young
                    child born in 2010 and are expecting a second child. They are hoping to
                    formalize their union by marriage as quickly as possible for the sake of this
                    child and the imminent one.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The effect of section 123 of the Women’s Charter</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Section 99(3) of the Women’s Charter

                        earliest date on which that party could have made such an application, the
                        party against whom it was granted may make an application to the court and

                                of the arrangements for the child before the court within a
                                specified time.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     “Child” in section 123 is
                    defined as a “child of the marriage” who is below 21 years of age
                    (section 122 read with section 92 of the Women’s Charter). Section 123
                    therefore obliges the court to consider whether satisfactory arrangements have
                    been made for the welfare of the two children of the husband and the wife in the
                    present case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The husband contended that the threshold for
                    the court’s satisfaction was not a high one, relying on <em>ZK v ZL</em> [2008] SGDC 376 which held that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
            [8] ...all that is required for the
                        test to be met is that arrangements have been made for the welfare of the
                        children and that those arrangements are satisfactory. The function of the
                        court at this stage is quite different from its function in the hearing for
                        ancillary relief. <em>The test at this stage is not whether
                            the arrangements for the children are ideal or the best. The purpose of
                            the provision is to make sure that the welfare of the children is not
                            overlooked before the judgment is made final</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     In ancillary matters, with regard to custody,
                    care and control, access and maintenance for the children, it is settled law
                    that the first and paramount consideration of the court is the welfare of the
                    children. The protection of the children’s welfare is thus assured in the
                    hearing of the ancillaries. Therefore, at the stage of making the interim
                    judgment final, all the court needs to ensure is that parties involved have
                    addressed their minds to the welfare of their children. Rule 8 of the MPR 2006
                    reinforces the importance of the children’s welfare by requiring the
                    plaintiff filing the writ for divorce to also submit an agreed parenting plan
                    or, failing agreement with the other spouse, a proposed parenting plan. If the
                    children have been provided for, then, as recognised by Lord Wright in <em>Fender v St John-Mildmay</em> [1938] AC 1 at [45] –
                    [46], “the parties are entitled to provide for their future, at the end
                    of the period fixed for the [interim judgment to be made final]”. This
                    was quoted with approval in <em>Sivakolunthu Kumarasamy v
                        Shanmugam Nagaiah</em> [1987] SLR 182 at [23]. Therefore, the role of the court at this stage is to
                    recognise the realities of the situation and allow the parties to move on with
                    their separate lives, provided that they have made satisfactory arrangements for
                    their children’s welfare.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Section 123(3) of the Women’s
                    Charter states that welfare “includes the custody and education of the
                    child and financial provision for him”. In the present appeal, the
                    parties have joint custody and the issue of custody is not in dispute. Pursuant
                    to an order of court, the wife was granted interim care and control of the
                    children, with access to the husband. The husband is not disputing the issue of
                    interim care and control. All outstanding applications relating to access have
                    been determined by the High Court. There is no longer a dispute relating to the
                    education of the children. There is an existing maintenance order relating to
                    the children’s interim maintenance. Further, both the husband and the wife
                    are well-off financially and each is able to provide for the children’s
                    needs. Therefore, the welfare of the children in this case has not been
                    overlooked and satisfactory arrangements have been made for their welfare.
                    Accordingly, the condition under section 123(1)(a) for the interim judgment
                    to be made final has been met.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Rule 59(3)(a) of the MPR 2006</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The wife contended that in addition to section
                    123 of the Women’s Charter, r 59(3) of the MPR 2006 has to be
                    complied with before an interim judgment can be made final. The relevant

                    interim judgment was prohibited under r 59(3)(a). She argued that on the
                    face of r 59(3)(a), the rule is absolute and therefore no question of leave
                    of court arises before the conclusion of all the hearings for ancillary relief.
                    It is only in respect of r 59(3)(b) that an application for such leave is
                    permissible.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The husband submitted that even if this
                    reading of r 59(3) is correct, it has no application to the present
                    situation. Rule 59(1), (2), (3) and (4) of the MPR 2006 only apply where
                    the party seeking to make the interim judgment final is the party in whose
                    favour the interim judgment was pronounced. In the present appeal, this would be
                    the wife. As it was the husband who has applied to make the interim judgment
                    final, it was submitted that the relevant provisions were r 59(5) and (6)
                    and that r 59(3) was inapplicable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The contention in <a href="#p1_18">[18]</a> above was also raised before the district judge in
                        <em>ZK v ZL</em>. At [11] of that case, the district judge opined:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">However that was a minor issue as regardless whether the application is
                        made under rule 59(3) by the party in whose favour judgment was given or by
                        the spouse against whom judgment was given under rule 59(5) the same
                        principles apply.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">I agree that the same principles ought to apply whoever the applicant
                    might be although, in the vast majority of cases, it is likely to be the party
                    who has obtained an interim judgment in his/her favour. There is no
                    justification for a different set of principles to apply merely because the
                    party applying is the spouse against whom the interim judgment was pronounced.
                    Accordingly, r 59(1) to (3) apply equally to an application by the husband
                    in this case as they would to an application by the wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     While a literal reading of r 59(3) might
                    lead to the conclusion contended for by the wife, I am of the view that the
                    clause “without the leave of the court” actually applies to both
                    limbs of r 59(3) and not just to (b). This view is supported upon review of
                    the earlier editions of the MPR which I directed counsel for both parties to
                    look at and submit further on after the first hearing before me. The evolution
                    of the present r 59(3) is as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The current r 59(3)(a) of the MPR 2006
                    was introduced in the 2003 amendments to the MPR. The guide to the 2003
                        amendments<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>
                    provides that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[7.2.2] Under the new rule:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">An application to make a Decree Nisi Absolute shall not be made absolute
                        until all the ancillary matters have been dealt with, <em>unless the court has given leave</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The MPR 2003 shows clearly that the clause relating to leave applied
                    to both limbs (a) and (b). The issue is therefore whether the 2005 amendments to
                    the MPR were intended to bring about any substantive change by confining the
                    court’s discretion to grant leave to limb (b).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Neither the summary of the
                        amendments<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>
                    nor the guide to the 2005 amendments<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>
                    mentions a change to the wording of what was formerly r 34. When the
                    Statutes (Miscellaneous Amendments) (No. 2) Act 2005 (No 42 of 2005)
                    (“the 2005 Act”) was enacted, it brought about a change in legal
                    terminology. Part X of the Women’s Charter was replaced by the current
                    Part X that substitutes, among other things, ‘judgment’ for
                    ‘decree’ and ‘interim judgment’ for ‘decree
                    nisi’. The language used in the MPR was correspondingly changed. There was
                    no indication that the regulatory scheme pertaining to the finalisation of an
                    interim judgment was intended to be changed as well.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In the light of the above analysis, the most
                    probable explanation for the change in wording was that a setting error occurred
                    in the 2005 edition of the MPR which appended the clause “without the
                    leave of court” to only r 59(3)(b). Accordingly, I hold that the
                    said clause applies to both r 59(3)(a) and (b). I note that counsel in
                        <em>ZK v ZL</em> accepted this position although the
                    legal basis for doing so was not articulated in the district judge’s
                    grounds. The district judge’s decision in that case to allow the
                    application to make the interim judgment final was affirmed by the High Court
                    but no written judgment was issued.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Pursuant to my decision, it follows that the
                    court retains its discretion to grant leave to an applicant to make final an
                    interim judgment under r 59(3)(a) even where there are outstanding
                    ancillary matters before the court. The next issue to consider therefore is
                    whether the court should exercise its discretion in favour of the husband in the
                    present case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The wife argued that the court’s
                    discretion ought not to be exercised in favour of the husband. It was submitted
                    that one must comply with the obligations of a first marriage before entering
                    into a second one. The interests of the two children of the marriage would be
                    compromised if the husband were allowed to set up another family now. There was
                    also no urgency as the child of the husband and his new partner was already born
                    and there was therefore no question of trying to legitimise him at birth. The
                    wife contended that the husband is irresponsible and has no regard for the
                    feelings of the two children of the marriage who have to go (during access time)
                    to be with a woman who is not their mother but who is in the position of one.
                    There were also allegations that the husband caused much of the delay in the
                    ancillary proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The husband submitted that both parties are
                    “mega-rich” and own many properties. The wife is a private banker
                    and the husband is retired. There was no question of anyone, in particular the
                    two children of the marriage, being left without financial support. In any case,
                    satisfactory arrangements for the welfare of the two children have been made.
                    After the wife’s appeal was dismissed by the district judge below, the
                    husband proceeded to marry his new partner and she is now pregnant with their
                    second child. He argued that the first marriage was over and that it was not
                    irresponsible for him to want to put his second relationship on a proper footing
                    especially when his new partner is expecting another child. He denied that he
                    was delaying the resolution of the ancillary matters as he wanted to conclude
                    the matrimonial proceedings in order to move on with his new life.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     While there are outstanding ancillary matters
                    in this case, satisfactory arrangements for the welfare of the two children of
                    the marriage have been made (see <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a> above)
                    and while these arrangements could be fine-tuned along the way, there was no
                    question that the two children were more than adequately taken care of. The wife
                    is a wealthy and capable lady who does not require the husband’s financial
                    support. While the husband’s conduct may not be that of an exemplary
                    husband and father, there is really no point in visiting the consequences of his
                    conduct on the innocent children of the second union, especially the imminent
                    one who should not, like its elder sibling, be born out of
                wedlock.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     On the facts of this case, the husband has
                    satisfied the requirements of section 123 of the Women’s Charter and has
                    shown good reasons for the court to exercise its discretion in his favour under
                    r 59(3)(a). I therefore uphold the district judge’s decision to grant
                    him leave to make the interim judgment final. The wife’s appeal was
                    dismissed accordingly. I awarded the husband costs of $1,000 for the factual
                    arguments only since the arguments on the legal issues before me took a somewhat
                    different route from that pursued by the parties in the Family
                Court.</p>
