<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The seven plaintiffs, Diora-Ace Limited, Liteace
                    Management Ltd, Vuitton Assets Ltd, Laser Ace Ventures Ltd, Skytrax Ventures
                    Ltd, Key Navigation Consultants Ltd, and I.Contemporary Living Pte Ltd
                    (“the Plaintiffs”), are subsidiary proprietors of a condominium
                    development known as “Riveria Gardens” (“the
                    Development”). The first defendant, the Management Corporation Strata
                    Title Plan No 3661 (“the MCST”), is the management
                    corporation of the Development, and the second defendant, Dr Sim Chiang Khi
                    (“Dr Sim”), was the former chairman of the second council of
                    the MCST (collectively, “the Defendants”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       In this Originating Summons No 392 of 2014
                    (“OS 392/2014”), the Plaintiffs sought relief from the court
                    in relation to alleged breaches of the Building Maintenance and Strata
                    Management Act (Cap 30C, 2008 Rev Ed) (“BMSMA”) committed by
                    the Defendants. The Plaintiffs applied for, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, the following relief:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_a"></a>(a)     an order that the present council of
                        the MCST be removed, and elections held to elect a new council
                        (“Prayer 1”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_b"></a>(b)     declarations that:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_2-p2_b-p3_i"></a>(i)       the MCST was wrong in
                            insisting that the Plaintiffs produce and deposit a company profile or
                            certificate of incorporation from the authority which registered the
                            incorporation of the corporate subsidiary proprietor at the MCST’s
                            Managing Agent’s office 48 hours before the scheduled time
                            for the general meeting of the MCST
                            (“Prayer 2”);</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_2-p2_b-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       the MCST’s sinking fund was wrongly
                            utilised in April, June and July 2013
                            (“Prayer 3”);</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_2-p2_b-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       the MCST was wrong in requiring the Plaintiffs
                            to submit a copy of their respective tenancy agreement to the management
                            of the MCST (“Prayer 4”); and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_2-p2_b-p3_iv"></a>(iv)       the MCST’s purchase of
                            items from Ikano Pte Ltd (“Ikea”) totalling $2,990 made on
                            30 May 2013 were unauthorised
                            (“Prayer 5”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       After the hearing on 24 December 2014, I
                    dismissed Prayers 2, 3 and 4 against the MCST. In relation to
                    Prayer 5, I ordered that the MCST seek to ratify the purchases within two
                    weeks of the order. Against Dr Sim, I dismissed Prayers 2 to 5. No
                    order was made on Prayer 1, as the Plaintiffs confirmed that they were not
                    proceeding with the prayer. Costs were awarded to the Defendants. The Plaintiffs
                    have appealed against my decision. I now set out my detailed
                reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Parties </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       As mentioned above, the Plaintiffs are
                    subsidiary proprietors of the Development. Together, the Plaintiffs own 18 out
                    of the 49 units in the Development, and 123 out of 321 of the total share value
                    therein. The first to sixth plaintiffs are incorporated in the British Virgin
                    Islands, and the seventh plaintiff, I.Contemporary Living Pte Ltd, is the
                    developer of the Development (“the Developer”). The main
                    contractor of the Development is I.Delight (S) Pte Ltd (“the Main
                    Contractor”). In March 2010, the Temporary Occupation Permit was issued
                    by the Commissioner of Building Control for the Development. During the interim
                    period before the first council of the MCST was appointed, the Developer assumed
                    the duties of the council under Division 1 of Part V of the
                    BMSMA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Colliers International Consultancy &amp;
                    Valuation (Singapore) Pte Ltd (“Colliers”) was the Managing Agent
                    of the Development up to the end of February 2013, when it was replaced by
                    Affinity Property Consultants Pte Ltd (“Affinity”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The first council of the MCST was appointed on
                    18 November 2011, with one Mr Teo Boon Kang Peter
                    (“Mr Teo”) as the chairman. Mr Teo has described himself
                    in affidavits filed on behalf of the Plaintiffs as the “Manager of all
                    the Plaintiffs”. During the term of the first council, in February 2012,
                    a fire broke out at the basement consumer switch room of the Development. The
                    power supply to the Development was cut off for safety reasons until the damaged
                    equipment in the switch room had been repaired. During the interim, a temporary
                    generator was used to supply power to the residents. The repair works cost
                    $165,315 of which $69,550 was paid by the insurers and $15,765 was paid by the
                    MCST. The Main Contractor contributed the remaining $80,000 as a
                    “goodwill gesture”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Acts of the second council </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The second council of the MCST was appointed on
                    19 December 2012, with Dr Sim as its chairman. Mr Teo was also
                    appointed as a member of the second council. During the term of the second
                    council, a council resolution was sought to be passed by simple majority,
                    allowing the chairman and secretary of the council to jointly approve any
                    discretionary expenditure in relation to “maintenance, repair and
                    replacement works” in the Development, “not exceeding $2,000/- per
                    single item or collective items (whichever lower) under each single
                    receipt”. Under this resolution, the MCST made purchases of Ikea
                    furniture in two receipts of $1,976 and $1,014 respectively on 30 May 2013.
                    The Plaintiffs also alleged that the second council of the MCST mismanaged its
                    finances by wrongfully utilising the sinking fund in April, June and July
                    2013.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       On or about 7 November 2013, the MCST sent
                    out a letter to all its subsidiary proprietors requiring, among other things, a
                    copy of the tenancy agreement in relation to their units, if any. The Plaintiffs
                    did not comply. A standing instruction was also issued by the MCST sometime in
                    November 2013, requiring the corporate subsidiary proprietors of the Development
                    to deposit a letter of authority (“LOA”) and a company profile or
                    certificate of incorporation at the Managing Agent’s office 48 hours
                    before the third annual general meeting (“AGM”) of the MCST which
                    was to be held on 1 December 2013 (“the Standing
                    Instruction”). The Plaintiffs did not do so, and did not attend the third
                    AGM. Subsequently, one Mr Joel Chang Chung Yhow
                    (“Mr Chang”) was elected as the chairman of the third council
                    of the MCST.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Proceedings </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On 29 April 2014, the Plaintiffs filed the
                    present action. On the same day, the Plaintiffs, under s 58(3) of the
                    BMSMA, issued a written notice to the secretary of the third council, one
                    Mr Heng Chih Yang (“Mr Heng”) informing him that they
                    opposed any decision of the third council that would result in the MCST
                    incurring legal costs in the present proceedings (“the s 58(3)
                    Notice”). Another application, being Originating Summons No 994 of
                    2014 (“OS 994/2014”), was filed on 24 October 2014 by
                    the Plaintiffs against the MCST, the chairman and the secretary of the third
                    council, being Mr Chang and Mr Heng respectively, seeking an
                    injunction to prevent the MCST from acting in breach of the s 58(3)
                    Notice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Meanwhile, in the affidavit filed on behalf of
                    the Defendants by Dr Sim and Mr Chang in the present action, the MCST
                    alleged that there are potential counterclaims against the Developer, being the
                    seventh plaintiff, in respect of the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_a"></a>(a)     the defects in the common
                        property;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_b"></a>(b)     the
                        Developer’s failure to hand over drawings, plans, warranties to
                        Colliers/Affinity when the first council (comprising the Plaintiff’s
                        representatives) assumed office; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_c"></a>(c)     the design and construction of the basement consumer
                        switch room which led to the fire there in 2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     At the first hearing on 27 October 2014,
                    parties indicated that the fourth AGM of the MCST was due to be held in December
                    2014, and it was likely that no order would be necessary in respect of Prayer 1.
                    I queried the Plaintiffs as to the legal basis for the Prayers, and asked the
                    parties whether there were substantial disputes of fact which might require (i)
                    a conversion of the action to a writ action or (ii) cross-examination of the
                    witnesses, as well as whether the present action should be consolidated with
                    OS 994/2014. The hearing was adjourned for parties to consider these
                    preliminary issues.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The fourth AGM of the MCST was held on
                    13 December 2014. Each of the Plaintiffs submitted its respective LOA duly
                    signed by an identified person with a disclosed designation. The
                    Plaintiffs’ representatives attended the general meeting and voted, but
                    did not garner sufficient votes to be elected into the fourth council of the
                    MCST.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     At the adjourned hearing on 24 December
                    2014, parties confirmed that given that the fourth AGM had taken place, Prayer 1
                    was no longer necessary. The substantial disputes of facts were in respect of
                    potential counterclaims by the MCST against the Developer, as set out in [10]
                    above. The Defendants proposed to proceed by way of a separate claim against the
                    Developer for such matters, which the Plaintiffs did not object to. The
                    Plaintiffs were also of the opinion that OS 392/2014 and OS 994/2014
                    should be dealt with separately, and that the s 58(3) Notice would not bind
                    the court’s discretion on costs of the present action. Given these
                    positions taken by the parties, I proceeded to hear the parties on Prayers 2 to
                    5 of OS 392/2014.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Parties’ submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Plaintiffs’ arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The Plaintiffs submitted that this court had
                    the jurisdiction to grant the declarations sought either under s 88 of the
                    BMSMA or under the inherent jurisdiction of the court. It was the
                    Plaintiffs’ case that the MCST had committed numerous breaches of the
                    BMSMA in issuing the Standing Instruction and requesting for tenancy agreements.
                    The Plaintiffs also pointed to the MCST’s mismanagement of its finances by
                    (i) wrongfully utilising the sinking fund in April, June and July 2013 and (ii)
                    purchasing furniture from Ikea in an unauthorised manner. In this regard,
                    Dr Sim was made a defendant in this action because the Plaintiffs were of
                    the view that he was a “dominating member” of the second council
                    of the MCST. They also pointed out that all the matters complained of happened
                    during the time when Dr Sim was the chairman of the second council of the
                    MCST.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Defendants’ arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The Defendants dealt at length in their
                    submissions about the relationship between the Plaintiffs and the Main
                    Contractor. According to the Defendants, the first to sixth plaintiffs were
                    nominees of, or otherwise closely related to, the Developer. The Defendants also
                    contended that the Main Contractor was a related company of the Developer. It
                    was also the Defendants’ case that Mr Teo, besides being the
                    “Manager of all the Plaintiffs” (see above at [6]) was also the
                    Senior Manager of the Main Contractor. This relationship between the various
                    plaintiffs and the Main Contractor placed Mr Teo, being both a
                    representative for the Plaintiffs and also the chairman of the first council of
                    the MCST and a member of the second council of the MCST, in a position of
                    conflict of interest in a number of situations. These included the MCST’s
                    potential claims against the Developer and Main Contractor in respect of the
                    defects in the common property as well as the fire at the basement consumer
                    switch room. In the Defendants’ view, the relationship between the
                    Plaintiffs and Main Contractor was relevant to the understanding of the factual
                    context of the disputes that have arisen, and why the Plaintiffs were pursuing
                    the present action against the Defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The Defendants also submitted that if the
                    first to sixth plaintiffs were indeed nominees of the Developer, then
                    s 53(12) of the BMSMA would have been breached as the first council would
                    have comprised only representatives of the Developer and its nominees. The
                    Defendants said that it was partly to address this concern that the MCST
                    requested the corporate subsidiary proprietors of the Development to furnish
                    additional documents in the form of a company profile or certificate of
                    incorporation through the Standing Instruction. Further, the additional
                    documents were required to ascertain the identity and authorisation of the
                    Plaintiffs’ respective representatives, as the MCST had concerns with the
                    LOAs which the Plaintiffs submitted previously.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The Defendants were also of the view that
                    there was no unauthorised drawdown of the sinking fund in April, June and July
                    2013, and that the purchase of the Ikea furniture was properly carried out. In
                    relation to the request for the subsidiary proprietors’ tenancy
                    agreements, the Defendants submitted that this was not for the purpose of
                    prejudicing the Plaintiffs’ right to vote at the AGM, but merely in order
                    to ascertain who the tenants of the units in the Development were and, thus, the
                    persons who would be eligible to use the amenities in the
                Development.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The Defendants also submitted that the
                    decisions which the Plaintiffs took issue with were not made by Dr Sim
                    unilaterally, but were decisions of the second council of the MCST. In the
                    Defendants’ submission, there was therefore no reason to make Dr Sim
                    a defendant in these proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In relation to the prayers which the
                    Plaintiffs were seeking, the following issues were in dispute:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_a"></a>(a)     as a preliminary issue, the legal
                        basis for the prayers, and whether this court has jurisdiction and power to
                        grant the bare declarations sought (“the Legal Basis
                        issue”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_b"></a>(b)     whether the MCST was wrong in issuing the Standing Instruction (“the
                        Standing Instruction issue”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_c"></a>(c)     whether the MCST was wrong in utilising the sinking fund
                        for April, June and July 2013 (“the Sinking Fund
                        issue”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_d"></a>(d)     whether the MCST was wrong in requiring the Plaintiffs to submit copies of
                        their tenancy agreements (“the Tenancy Agreements issue”);
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_e"></a>(e)     whether the
                        purchase of items from Ikea was unauthorised (“the Unauthorised
                        Purchase issue”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The Defendants also raised the issue whether
                    there was legal basis to join Dr Sim as a defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">My decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Joinder of Dr Sim </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     I begin by disposing of the matter in relation
                    to Dr Sim. In my view, there was no legal basis for the Plaintiffs to have
                    taken out the application against Dr Sim personally. Even if I were to
                    accept the Plaintiffs’ assertion that Dr Sim was a “dominating
                    member” of the council, given that the claims were for declarations in
                    relation to breaches committed <em>by the MCST</em>, and
                        <em>not</em> Dr Sim, there was no reason for
                    Dr Sim to have been made a party to this action in his personal
                    capacity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Under s 61(1) of the BMSMA, Dr Sim
                    had a statutory duty to act honestly and use reasonable diligence in the
                    discharge of his duties as the chairman of the second council. He also must,
                    pursuant to s 61(2) of the BMSMA, not directly or indirectly, use his
                    position to gain an advantage for himself. However, the Plaintiffs did not
                    allege that Dr Sim had breached his duties under s 61 of the BMSMA,
                    but were seeking declarations that <em>the MCST</em>
                    committed certain breaches. I accordingly dismissed Prayers 2 to 5 against
                    Dr Sim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Legal Basis issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Moving on, I requested parties to address me
                    on the legal basis for the prayers as it was not apparent from the documents
                    whether the Plaintiffs were relying on any particular provision within the
                    BMSMA, and I was concerned as to whether the court has the jurisdiction to hear
                    the application, and the power to grant the declaratory relief sought, without
                    any other consequential relief. The prayers (see above at [2]) were framed only
                    in terms of declaring whether there were breaches by the MCST, without any other
                    relief sought.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In response, the Plaintiffs submitted that the
                    application was brought under s 88 of the BMSMA, and, as required under
                    s 124 of the BMSMA, it had been brought by way of an originating summons.
                    In the alternative, the Plaintiffs also relied on s 18 of the Supreme Court
                    of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) (“SCJA”) read with
                    para 14 of the First Schedule thereof and O 15 r 16 of the Rules
                    of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“ROC”). The
                    Plaintiffs submitted that the court’s jurisdiction has not been ousted by
                    the jurisdiction accorded to the Strata Titles Board
                    (“STB”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The Defendants submitted that neither
                    s 88 of the BMSMA nor the inherent jurisdiction of the court were tenable
                    grounds for the Plaintiffs to rely on to apply for bare declaratory relief. If
                    the Plaintiffs sought to invalidate the acts of the MCST, it should have
                    commenced its proceedings before the STB which has the powers under ss 103
                    and 104 of the BMSMA to make the necessary orders. As the Plaintiffs had instead
                    commenced proceedings before the High Court, the Plaintiffs must then satisfy
                    s 88 of the BMSMA, and the Plaintiffs had failed to do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Specifically, the Defendants argued that a
                    mere declaration was outside the ambit of s 88 of the BMSMA as that section
                    prescribes that the power of the court thereunder is to make a finding of a
                    breach by the MCST <em>and then</em> grant specific relief
                    of an injunction and/or damages. The court was not empowered to act on an
                    application for a bare declaration that the MCST had breached its duties, and
                    grant a bare declaration without any consequential relief.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In respect of the Plaintiffs’
                    alternative submission under O 15 r 16 of the ROC, the Defendants
                    characterised this as the Plaintiffs’ invocation of the inherent powers of
                    the court. Relying on <em>Tan Ah Thee and another (administrators
                        of the estate of Tan Kiam Poh (alias Tan Gna Chua), deceased) v Lim Soo
                        Foong</em> [2009] 3 SLR(R) 957 (“<em>Tan Ah
                        Thee</em>”), the Defendants argued that as s 88 of the
                    BMSMA governed the exercise of the court’s powers in respect of this
                    particular dispute, the Plaintiffs could not invoke the court’s inherent
                    powers to override a statutory rule that dealt with the exact situation.
                    Furthermore, the inherent powers of the court could only be invoked in
                    exceptional circumstances where a clear need for it can be shown. The Plaintiffs
                    could have taken steps either shortly before or after the acts complained of or
                    otherwise raise to the second council its objections or difficulties with
                    complying with the requirements. As the Plaintiffs did not do so, it could not
                    be said that the facts disclosed a clear need or exceptional circumstances for
                    the court to exercise its discretion to grant the declarations
                sought.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The difference between jurisdiction and power </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     At the outset, I should point out the
                    difference between “jurisdiction” and “power”. As
                    Chan Sek Keong J, as he was then, stated in <em>Muhd Munir v
                        Noor Hidah and other applications</em> [1990] 2 SLR(R) 348 (at
                    [19]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The jurisdiction of a court is its authority, however derived, to hear and
                        determine a dispute that is brought before it. The powers of a court
                        constitute its capacity to give effect to its determination by making or
                        granting the orders or reliefs sought by the successful party to the
                        dispute. … A court may have jurisdiction to hear and determine a
                        dispute in relation to a subject matter but no power to grant a remedy or
                        make a certain order because it has not been granted such power, whereas if
                        a court has the power to grant a remedy or make a certain order, it can only
                        exercise that power in a subject matter in which it has jurisdiction.
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     This distinction received recent support by
                    the Court of Appeal in <em>Re Nalpon Zero Geraldo
                        Mario</em> [2013] 3 SLR 258 (at [13] and [31]). The jurisdiction of
                    the court thus refers to the court’s authority to hear and determine a
                    dispute. The power of the court, on the other hand, is the ability of the court
                    to give effect to its determination by making the orders or reliefs sought by
                    the successful party to the dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether this was an application under s 88 of the
                BMSMA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     With this understanding, I turn to consider 88
                    of the BMSMA which states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>88.</b>—(1)  If a
                        management corporation or subsidiary management corporation commits a breach
                        of any provision of this Part, or makes default in complying with any
                        requirement of, or duty imposed on it by, any provision of this Part, a
                        subsidiary proprietor or mortgagee in possession or occupier of a lot shall
                        be entitled to apply to the court —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(<em>a</em>) for an order to restrain the
                            breach of any such provision by; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(<em>b</em>) to recover damages for any loss
                            or injury to the subsidiary proprietor, mortgagee in possession, or
                            occupier or property arising out of the breach of any such provision
                            from,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">the management corporation or subsidiary management corporation, as the
                        case may be.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)  The court may make such order against any such person, the
                        management corporation or the members of its council, or the subsidiary
                        management corporation or its executive committee, or the managing agent, as
                        the court thinks fit.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3)  Where a requirement or duty is imposed on a management
                        corporation or subsidiary management corporation by this Part, any person
                        for whose benefit, or for the benefit of whose lot that requirement or duty
                        is imposed on the management corporation or subsidiary management
                        corporation, as the case may be, may apply to the court for an order
                        compelling the management corporation or subsidiary management corporation,
                        as the case may be, to carry out the requirement or perform the duty and, on
                        such an application being made, the court may make such order as it thinks
                        proper.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Section 88 of the BMSMA is found in
                    Part V of the same Act; under Part V, the duties and powers of
                    management corporations and other details are set out. Section 88(1) of the
                    BMSMA entitles a subsidiary proprietor to apply to court either to restrain any
                    breach of the provisions of Part V of the BMSMA by a management
                    corporation, or to recover damages for any loss or injury occasioned by the
                    breach. Section 88(2) then provides that the court may make any order that
                    the court thinks fit against, <em>inter alia</em>, the
                    management corporation, the members of its council, or the managing agent.
                    Section 88(3) also provides that a subsidiary proprietor may apply to the
                    court to compel the management corporation to carry out any requirement or duty
                    imposed by law, and the court may make such an order, or to make any other
                    orders as it thinks proper.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Thus, it appears that while the applicant must
                        <em>apply</em> for these reliefs as stated in
                    ss 88(1) or 88(3), the court, in hearing the matter under this section, is
                    not limited to ordering only such reliefs as applied for; the court may make
                        <em>any such order</em> as the court thinks fit.
                    However, in seeking bare declarations only, the Plaintiffs, <em>prima facie</em>, fell outside s 88 of the BMSMA. Despite an
                    invitation by the court to do so, the Plaintiffs opted not to amend any of their
                    prayers. Save for Prayer 5 which I shall deal with below, I am doubtful
                    that the remaining prayers could be treated as being made under s 88 of the
                    BMSMA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Jurisdiction to deal with this application outside s 88 of the
                BMSMA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     I turn next to the Plaintiffs’
                    alternative submission that declaratory relief could be granted under s 18
                    of the SCJA and para 14 of the First Schedule of the same, read with
                    O 15 r 16 of the ROC. The Defendants characterised the
                    Plaintiffs’ reliance on these provisions as an invocation of the
                    court’s inherent powers to grant declaratory relief, rather than its
                    inherent jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The difference between the terms jurisdiction
                    and power has been explained above (see [28]–[29]). Under s 16 of the
                    SCJA, the jurisdiction of the High Court may be established by service on the
                    defendant of a writ or other originating process, or by a defendant’s
                    submission to the High Court’s jurisdiction, or where statute vests such
                    jurisdiction in the High Court. The jurisdiction of the court may be ousted if
                    exclusive jurisdiction over a dispute is vested in another tribunal, such as the
                    STB in the present case. However, the Defendants have not argued that the STB
                    has exclusive jurisdiction. In any event, the High Court in <em>Fu Loong Lithographer Pte Ltd and others v Mok Wai Hoe and
                        another</em> [2014] 1 SLR 218 at [24]–[27] (“<em>Fu Loong</em>”) has held that the STB does not have
                    exclusive jurisdiction over disputes falling within the scope of the
                    BMSMA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     In <em>Fu Loong</em>, the
                    plaintiffs were a group of subsidiary proprietors in a strata development. They
                    brought an application against the management corporation as well as the
                    chairman of the second council of the management corporation in the High Court,
                    seeking, <em>inter alia</em>, the invalidation of certain
                    rulings made by the chairman at an extraordinary general meeting, on the basis
                    that these rulings were in conflict, or inconsistent with, the BMSMA. Notably,
                    the application to court in that case was not made under s 88 of the BMSMA.
                    Chan Seng Onn J held that in the absence of an express provision ousting
                    the court’s jurisdiction, the court and the STB both have the jurisdiction
                    to hear matters concerning strata management disputes; would-be plaintiffs thus
                    have two possible forums to choose from to resolve their disputes. I agree with
                    the reasoning set out in <em>Fu Loong</em>. This court thus
                    has the jurisdiction under general law to hear this application which is
                    concerned with breaches of the BMSMA by the MCST.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Power to grant bare declarations </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The next issue then is whether this court has
                    the <em>power</em> to grant a bare declaration. In general,
                    the High Court’s power to grant declarations may be found in s 18 of
                    the SCJA read with para 14 of the First Schedule of the SCJA.
                    Section 18(2) of the SCJA provides that the High Court “shall have
                    the powers set out in the First Schedule”. Paragraph 14 of the First
                    Schedule of the SCJA states that the High Court has the power to “grant
                    all reliefs and remedies at law and in equity”. Order 15 r 16
                    of the ROC supplements this, by providing that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Declaratory judgment (O. 15,
                            r. 16)</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>16.</b>  No action or other proceeding
                        shall be open to objection on the ground that a merely declaratory judgment
                        or order is sought thereby, and the Court may make binding declarations of
                        right whether or not any consequential relief is or could be claimed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The Court of Appeal in <em>Salijah bte Ab Latef v Mohd Irwan bin Abdullah Teo</em> [1996] 2
                    SLR(R) 80 (“<em>Salijah</em>”) considered the
                    above provisions and held that these provisions formed the basis of the
                    court’s power to grant declaratory judgments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The Defendants relied on the case of <em>Tan Ah Thee</em> to argue that the presence of s 88 of
                    the BMSMA limited the powers of the court in granting declaratory relief in such
                    cases. Counsel for the Defendants submitted that as s 88 of the BMSMA dealt
                    with the specific situation at hand, the Plaintiffs could not invoke the
                    inherent powers of the court to override s 88.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     
          <em>Tan Ah Thee</em> was
                    a case that considered, <em>inter alia</em>, whether the
                    court had the power to declare a <em>voidable</em> marriage
                        <em>void</em> where the s 105 of the Women’s
                    Charter (Cap 353, 1997 Rev Ed) (“Women’s Charter”)
                    provided an exhaustive list of grounds on which marriages may be declared to be
                    void, the operative words being “shall be void on the following grounds
                        <em>only</em>” [emphasis added]. The plaintiffs
                    sought, <em>inter alia</em>, to declare the marriage
                    between their late father and the defendant void on the ground of lack of
                    consent, which under s 106(<em>c</em>) of the
                    Women’s Charter, is a ground that renders a marriage voidable. The High
                    Court rejected this, holding that s 105 of the Women’s Charter
                    provided an exhaustive and exclusive list of grounds on which the power to
                    declare a marriage void may be exercised. It leaves no room for the court to
                    declare a marriage void on any other grounds.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     In contrast, s 88 of the BMSMA enables a
                    subsidiary proprietor to apply for certain remedies when a provision of
                    Part V of the BMSMA has been breached or not complied with. However, there
                    is nothing within s 88 which suggests that the court only has jurisdiction
                    to hear disputes about the breaches of the BMSMA under the provision. It is also
                    noteworthy that the provision does not restrict the power of the court to order
                    any relief. In the absence of express wording, s 88 of the BMSMA does not
                    oust the court’s jurisdiction and powers under the SCJA and ROC to hear
                    the dispute and order the appropriate relief, including bare declaratory
                    relief.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Further, s 123 of the BMSMA provides
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>123.</b>  Nothing in this Act shall
                        affect or take away any rights or remedies that a subsidiary proprietor or
                        mortgagee of a lot or a management corporation may have in relation to any
                        lot or the common property apart from this Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     In Teo Keang Sood, <em>Strata
                        Title in Singapore and Malaysia</em> (LexisNexis, 4th Ed, 2012), the
                    learned author made the following comments on s 123 of the BMSMA (at
                    p 841):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The expression “rights or remedies … in relation to any lot
                        of the common property apart from this Act” in section 123 of
                        the BMSMA refers to the rights and remedies apart from those provided by the
                        Act which are the <em>normal incidents of legal relationships
                            that the Act bring[s] into being</em> and those relationships
                        include not only the proprietary rights incidental to lots and common
                        property, but also the contractual rights between the parties concerned
                        arising from their participation in the strata scheme. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Section 123 of the BMSMA thus makes clear that a
                        subsidiary proprietor or management corporation continues to have rights and
                        remedies under general law apart from the BMSMA as a result of the legal
                        relationships in play.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     At the end of the hearing on 24 December
                    2014, I had expressed reservations about the applicability of s 88 of the
                    BMSMA, and the jurisdiction and power of the court to deal with the application.
                    Nonetheless, I had proceeded to deal with the application on the merits. Upon
                    review, I am of the opinion that the court has the jurisdiction to deal with the
                    application, and the power to grant declarations pursuant to s 18 of the
                    SCJA, para 14 of the First Schedule of the SCJA and O 15 r 16 of
                    the ROC.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Discretion in granting bare declarations</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     As conceded by the Plaintiffs, declaratory
                    relief is discretionary in nature. The factors to be considered by the court in
                    deciding whether to grant bare declaratory relief have been considered by the
                    Court of Appeal in <em>Salijah</em> and in <em>Karaha Bodas Co LLC v Pertamina Energy Trading Ltd and another
                        appeal</em> [2006] 1 SLR(R) 112 (“<em>Karaha</em>”). In <em>Karaha</em>, the
                    Court of Appeal held that the following factors governed the exercise of the
                    court’s discretionary power to grant declaratory relief (at [14]):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_a"></a>(a)     the court must have the jurisdiction
                        and power to award the remedy;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_b"></a>(b)     the matter must be justiciable in the
                    court;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_c"></a>(c)     the exercise
                        of the discretion must be justified by the circumstances of the
                    case;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_d"></a>(d)     the plaintiff
                        has <em>locus standi</em> and there must be a real
                        controversy for the court to resolve;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_e"></a>(e)     any person whose interests might be affected by the
                        declaration should be before the court; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_f"></a>(f)     there must be some ambiguity or uncertainty
                        about the issue in respect of which the declaration is asked for so that the
                        court’s determination would have the effect of laying such doubts to
                        rest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     In <em>Salijah bte Ab Latef v
                        Mohd Irwan bin Abdullah Teo</em> [1995] 3 SLR(R) 233 (HC), Judith
                    Prakash J also stated that the remedy of a declaration should provide
                    “relief” in a real sense (at [17]). The court will also require a
                    useful or practical purpose to be served before it would exercise its discretion
                    to grant a declaration (see <em>Scott Latham v Credit Suisse
                        First Boston</em> [1999] SGHC 302 at [59] which was affirmed on appeal
                    at <em>Latham Scott v Credit Suisse First Boston</em>
                    [2000] 2 SLR(R) 30 at [74], and <em>Singapore Court Practice
                        2014</em> (Jeffrey Pinsler gen ed) (LexisNexis, 2014) at
                    para 15/6/8).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     In the present action, the pertinent factors
                    were whether there was a real controversy to be resolved, or if any useful or
                    practical purpose would be served by the grant of a bare declaration. Even if
                    the Plaintiffs’ allegations were made out, in all the circumstances of the
                    case, I was not convinced that I should exercise my discretion in favour of
                    granting the bare declarations sought by the Plaintiffs. The breaches complained
                    of in Prayers 2, 3 and 4 were of acts that have long passed. As contended
                    by the Defendants, the Plaintiffs could have taken prompt steps to get the
                    Defendants to address these issues, but chose not to do so. It seemed to me that
                    there was no real purpose to be served in the grant of such declarations. Again,
                    as the Defendants submitted, the Plaintiffs did not show that they suffered any
                    prejudice, or incurred any loss or damages which required redress. At this
                    juncture, there was no real controversy for the court to resolve, or any real
                    relief to be provided to the Plaintiffs by making bare
                declarations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Further, in respect of Prayers 2, 3 and
                    4, I found that the Plaintiffs had not made out their case on the merits against
                    the MCST. In respect of Prayer 5, I found that there was a breach of the
                    BMSMA by the MCST. However, instead of granting a bare declaration, I ordered
                    the MCST to ratify the unauthorised purchases. Each issue will now be considered
                    in turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Standing Instruction issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Under the Standing Instruction, the MCST had
                    requested that its corporate subsidiary proprietors produce a company profile or
                    certificate of incorporation, and duly lodge such documents with the Managing
                    Agent 48 hours before the scheduled time for the third AGM.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The Plaintiffs submitted that the Standing
                    Instruction was issued wrongfully, relying on s 27(3) and
                        s 29(1)(<em>h</em>) of the BMSMA which requires
                    management corporations to conduct their general meetings in accordance with the
                    First Schedule of the BMSMA. The relevant paragraphs in the First Schedule are
                    paras 16 and 18. Paragraph 16 of the First Schedule of the BMSMA
                    provides that a corporate subsidiary proprietor may, under the seal of the
                    company or hand of its director or a duly authorised attorney, appoint a
                    representative to attend the meetings of the management corporation. There is no
                    mention in para 16 of the need for either a company profile or certificate
                    of incorporation. Paragraph 18 of the First Schedule of the BMSMA provides
                    that the instrument appointing a proxy and the power of attorney or other
                    authority shall be deposited at a specified address not less than 48 hours
                    before the holding of the meeting, in default of which, the instrument would not
                    be treated as valid. The Plaintiffs pointed out that para 18 of the
                    BMSMA’s First Schedule dealt with instruments appointing proxies in
                    relation to individuals, and not LOAs. There was thus no reason why the MCST
                    required the deposit of the LOAs and other company documents 48 hours
                    before the AGM.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The Plaintiffs’ case is that by the
                    issuance of the Standing Instruction, the MCST went beyond paras 16 and 18
                    of the First Schedule of the BMSMA. In seeking to establish that the Standing
                    Instruction was issued wrongfully, the Plaintiffs said that they were prejudiced
                    by these additional requirements imposed by the MCST in that they were unable to
                    appoint authorised representatives to attend and vote at the third
                AGM.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     However, the Plaintiffs conceded that they did
                    not inform the MCST or its council of their concerns with procuring the company
                    profile and/or the certificate of incorporation. The Plaintiffs stated that this
                    was not done because of their previous experience that any such concerns by them
                    would be rebuffed, dismissed or avoided by the MCST or the council members. The
                    Plaintiffs also chose not to attend the third AGM.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     The MCST, on the other hand, submitted that it
                    was reasonable for them to require the additional company documents and their
                    lodgement 48 hours ahead of the third AGM. In the LOAs submitted by the
                    Plaintiffs in 2011, no reference was made to the designation or authority of the
                    person who had signed them. In 2012, the LOAs were signed by an “unnamed
                    person”. Moreover, save for the LOA for the Developer, the LOAs were not
                    on the letterheads of the Plaintiffs. It was the MCST’s position that the
                    additional company documents were required in order to ascertain the identity
                    and designation of any person who would sign the LOAs in 2013 in order to ensure
                    that they were signed by an authorised officer as required by para 16 of
                    the First Schedule of the BMSMA. Given that the first to sixth plaintiffs were
                    incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, the documents requested were either
                    a company profile or certificate of incorporation, with a third option of a
                    board resolution. The MCST also requested for the documents 48 hours before
                    the AGM in order to have sufficient time for verification. These requirements
                    were not inconsistent with para 16 of the First Schedule of the BMSMA, and
                    were introduced to address genuine concerns.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     In response, the Plaintiffs contended that if
                    the MCST was indeed concerned with the authenticity of the LOAs, it should have
                    written to the Plaintiffs themselves, asking for confirmation. It appeared to me
                    that this is exactly what the MCST did. The Defendants have produced
                    correspondence dated January and March 2013, showing the then Managing Agent,
                    Colliers, sending emails and official notices requesting for the name of the
                    authorised signatory of the Plaintiffs’ previous LOAs. These requests
                    appeared to have gone unanswered.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     I am of the view that the Plaintiffs’
                    actions suffer from the same defect that they alleged in the MCST. Just as the
                    Plaintiffs said that the MCST should have written to the Plaintiffs for
                    confirmation, the Plaintiffs should also have, when faced with the Standing
                    Instruction, made their objections with the Standing Instruction known to the
                    Defendants. This they did not do. On the face of it, after the Defendants were
                    apprised of the Plaintiffs’ concerns with the requirement of additional
                    company documents, the MCST did not insist on them. At the fourth AGM, the MCST
                    accepted the Plaintiffs’ LOAs which were signed by an identified person
                    with a disclosed designation. The Plaintiffs’ representatives attended and
                    voted at the fourth AGM, but failed to garner sufficient votes to be elected to
                    the council.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     In my judgment, given that the Plaintiffs did
                    not make their concerns known, and failed to attend the third AGM, it could not
                    be said that the MCST was “wrong in <em>insisting</em>” [emphasis added] on the Standing Instruction.
                    Furthermore, the MCST did not breach the provisions of the First Schedule of the
                    BMSMA by falling below the requirements, but rather, requested for additional
                    documents, and required lodgement of such documents 48 hours in advance of
                    the AGM. Given the circumstances surrounding the Plaintiffs’ LOAs in 2011
                    and 2012, the Standing Instruction was not made unreasonably. Further, as stated
                    in [46] and [54] above, there was no longer any real controversy to be resolved
                    by the court. I therefore dismissed Prayer 2 against the
                MCST.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Sinking Fund issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     The Plaintiffs also alleged that the MCST
                    wrongfully utilised the sinking fund in April, June and July 2013 in
                    contravention of ss 38(6) and 39(2) of the BMSMA by $9,333.25, $3,622.92
                    and $19,472.04 respectively, on the basis that the cash in the MCST’s bank
                    account was less than the value of the sinking fund for each of those
                    months.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The MCST submitted that there was no drawdown
                    on the sinking fund and the shortfall in the sums was due to late payments by
                    the subsidiary proprietors to the management fund and the sinking fund. This was
                    classified as receivables. The MCST produced its monthly balance sheets, and
                    also pointed to its financial statements for the year ended 31 August 2013
                    where the independent auditors reported their opinion that the financial
                    statements were drawn up accurately and in accordance with the provisions of the
                    BMSMA and the Singapore Financial Reporting Standards so as to give a true and
                    fair view of the state of affairs of the MCST as at 31 August 2013
                    (“the Auditor’s Report”). The auditors also stated that in
                    their opinion, the accounting and other records which the BMSMA required the
                    MCST to keep were kept properly in accordance with the provisions of that
                    Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     The Plaintiffs submitted that there were a
                    number of cheques that had been issued by the MCST to various payees such as the
                    Managing Agent and other contractors for the Development which had not been
                    presented by the payees to the bank for payment. On the Plaintiffs’ case,
                    if these un-presented cheques were taken into account, it would be clear that
                    the MCST had wrongly utilised the sinking fund. The Plaintiffs also submitted
                    that the Auditor’s Report did not take into account these un-presented
                    cheques.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Considering all the evidence before me,
                    including the monthly balance sheets, I did not find that the Plaintiffs had
                    made out a sufficient basis to question the management of the funds, or the
                    accuracy or <em>bona fides</em> of the Auditor’s
                    Report. In particular, in coming to their opinion, the auditors would have
                    looked at all the financial documents of the MCST, including the fact that these
                    cheques remained un-presented.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Even if the Plaintiffs were right, and the
                    MCST had wrongfully utilised the sinking fund in April, June and July 2013, I
                    would not have exercised my discretion to grant the declaratory relief sought.
                    These alleged breaches occurred in April, June and July 2013. As is clear from
                    the Auditor’s Report, the management of the sinking fund was in order from
                    August 2013, with the correct sum of cash being appropriated to the sinking
                    fund. The breaches, if any, were not subsisting ones. As stated at [46] above,
                    there was no clear or useful purpose for granting a bare declaration. The
                    Plaintiffs certainly did not claim that they had suffered any loss from the
                    alleged breaches. I therefore dismissed Prayer 3 against the
                MCST.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Tenancy Agreement issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     The Plaintiffs take issue with the
                    MCST’s request for a copy of the subsidiary proprietors’ tenancy
                    agreements in order to update the particulars of the owners. The relevant
                    portions of the letter sent by the MCST read:</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     The Plaintiffs submitted that the MCST’s
                    reliance on s 65 of the BMSMA was wrong in law, as that section does not
                    empower management corporations to ask for such documents. It was the
                    Plaintiff’s view that the MCST cited s 65 of the BMSMA in order to
                    rely on s 65(9) which disentitles any subsidiary proprietor who has not
                    complied with s 65 from voting at any general meeting, as the MCST knew
                    that the Plaintiffs would not furnish copies of their tenancy agreements to the
                    MCST for commercial reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     I found the Plaintiffs’ arguments
                    far-fetched. It was not at all clear to me that the MCST was relying on
                    s 65 of the BMSMA as a method of depriving the Plaintiffs of their right to
                    vote at the general meetings. Although the letter refers to s 65 of the
                    BMSMA, this was in the context of conducting an exercise to update the
                    particulars of the subsidiary proprietors. As is clear from the extract of the
                    letter set out at [61], following the paragraph which referred to s 65 of
                    the BMSMA, the letter then proceeded to call for documents <em>without</em> specifically referring to any powers under s65 of the
                    BMSMA to require these documents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     In oral submissions, the Defendants took the
                    position that s 65(9) of the BMSMA would not have applied to bar the
                    Plaintiffs from voting at a general meeting. This was entirely sensible.
                    Sections 65(2), 65(5), 65(6) and 65(7) of the BMSMA require notice to be
                    given to the MCST when the interest in a lot changes hands. There is no
                    requirement under s 65 for the MCST to conduct such any update of
                    particulars of tenants. In the absence of any transfer of interest in the units
                    by the Plaintiffs to other parties, no obligation on the Plaintiffs’ part
                    to give a notice under s 65 of the BMSMA would have arisen.
                    Section 65(9) would thus have been inapplicable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     However, although the section does not
                    expressly require the MCST to conduct an exercise in updating particulars of
                    tenants, it was not unreasonable that the MCST would have wished to do so in
                    order to know the parties who were substantially interested in the lots in the
                    Development. Indeed, the Defendants stated that the purpose of calling for the
                    tenancy agreements was to ascertain who the occupants of the units in the
                    Development were in order to ensure that those using the Development’s
                    facilities were entitled to do so. This was in line with items (o) and (p)
                    of the Residents’ Handbook, which consisted of various “house
                    rules” that the MCST laid down to ensure the smooth day-to-day running of
                    the common facilities in the Development. Item (o) required subsidiary
                    proprietors to provide the names of the tenants or occupiers of any unit in the
                    Development, and item (p) provided that if a unit was leased out to a
                    tenant, the subsidiary proprietor would no longer be entitled to use the
                    Development’s facilities. The Defendants were prepared to accept redaction
                    of the tenancy agreements and also undertook in the letter to keep the
                    information in the tenancy agreements confidential.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     In my view, there was nothing seriously amiss
                    with the MCST’s conduct. If the Plaintiffs were of the view that the
                    tenancy agreements contained commercially sensitive and confidential terms, it
                    was always open to them to offer to redact the tenancy agreements, or object to
                    furnishing their tenancy agreements, and to provide particulars instead.
                    However, the Plaintiffs again kept silent and made no objections. Furthermore,
                    the letter was addressed to all the subsidiary proprietors, occupiers and
                    tenants of the Development, and was certainly not targeted only at the
                    Plaintiffs. There was no basis for the Plaintiffs to claim that the MCST’s
                    request for the tenancy agreements was motivated by a desire to deprive the
                    Plaintiffs of their rights. Further, as stated at [46], no substantive purpose
                    would be served by a bare declaration. I therefore dismissed
                    Prayer 4.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Unauthorised Purchase issue </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     The Plaintiffs also sought a declaration that
                    the MCST’s purchases of certain items of furniture from Ikea totalling
                    $2,990 in May 2013 were unauthorised.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     The background to the purchases was as
                    follows. Sometime around 13 May 2013, Mr Roger Teo, the property
                    manager from Affinity (“the Property Manager”), circulated an
                    email to the members of the second council of the MCST seeking a mandate for the
                    chairman and secretary of the MCST to jointly approve expenditures in relation
                    to “maintenance, repair and replacement works in the estate not exceeding
                    $2,000 per single item or collective items”. Six out of the 11-member
                    council communicated their assent to the resolution either through email or by
                    signing the resolution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Following this, an email was sent out by one
                    “lo ks” on 23 May 2013 confirming the points of discussion of
                    a meeting held on 21 May 2013 by the maintenance sub-committee. The salient
                    portions of the email were as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Confirming points of Discussion. Tues 21 May 2013.</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     In a follow-up email on 24 May 2013,
                    “lo ks” instructed the Property Manager to proceed with the
                    purchases of the furniture from Ikea. The purchases were made on 30 May
                    2013 in two receipts of $1,014 (for the loungers) and $1,976 (for the garden
                    tables and chairs). The delivery and assembly charges were $178.60 and $158.05
                    respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     The Plaintiffs raised the following issues
                    with the purchases:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_71-p2_a"></a>(a)     The purchases were deliberately
                        split into two receipts so that the chairman and secretary alone could
                        approve the said expenditure.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_71-p2_b"></a>(b)     The resolution permitting the chairman and secretary to
                        approve expenditures below $2,000 did not comply with the Second Schedule of
                        the BMSMA.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_71-p2_c"></a>(c)     The
                        purported resolution did not authorise the purchases as:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_71-p2_c-p3_i"></a>(i)       the total amount of the
                            purchase of garden tables and chairs exceeded $2,000;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_71-p2_c-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       the
                            purchase of the garden tables and chairs did not constitute
                            “maintenance, repair and replacement works” as there were
                            no garden table and chairs in the Development before the
                            purchase.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_71-p2_d"></a>(d)     The purchases were not approved jointly by the chairman and the
                        secretary of the council but by a non-council member known as “lo
                        ks”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     I did not consider it improper for the
                    purchases to be split into separate receipts given that these were separate
                    items dealt with at the meeting of 21 May 2013. I also did not accept the
                    Plaintiffs’ contention that it was “lo ks” who approved the
                    purchases. Although the emails were sent by “lo ks”, the chairman
                    and secretary of the then council were copied in those emails. Further,
                    “lo ks” also stated in his email of 24 May 2013 that the
                    purchases had the “support of the Chairman”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     There were, however, two problems with the
                    purchases which, in my judgment, made them unauthorised. Firstly, it was not
                    entirely clear whether the resolution authorising the chairman and secretary of
                    the council to jointly approve purchases under $2,000 was validly passed.
                    Section 53(11) of the BMSMA provides that the Second Schedule of the BMSMA
                    shall govern the proceedings of the council of a management corporation.
                    Paragraph 7 of the Second Schedule provides that:</p>

                            section 59 may only be decided upon by its council or executive
                            committee, as the case may be, at a meeting.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     The Plaintiffs submitted that para 7 of
                    the Second Schedule was not complied with as no notice was given in accordance
                    with para 7(<em>a</em>) of the Second Schedule of the
                    BMSMA. The MCST has not produced any evidence to the contrary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     Another difficulty that the MCST faced was
                    that in relation to the garden table and chairs, these items did not fall within
                    “maintenance, repair and replacement works”, since prior to the
                    purchase of these items, there were no tables and chairs at the garden of the
                    Development. Due to the above reasons, these purchases were thus
                    unauthorised.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     However, I was not persuaded that granting a
                    bare declaration that the MCST had breached its duties, without remedying the
                    breach, would be appropriate. What was more important was for the MCST to ratify
                    the purchases. Indeed, the Plaintiffs could have applied under s 88(3) of
                    the BMSMA for the court to compel the management corporation to perform any
                    requirement or duty imposed on a management corporation by Part V of the
                    BMSMA. Section 53(11) of the BMSMA imposes a duty on councils of management
                    corporations to conduct their proceedings in accordance with the Second Schedule
                    of the BMSMA. This includes ensuring that resolutions are passed validly, and
                    where these resolutions relate to the purchase of common property for the
                    benefit of subsidiary proprietors, these purchases should be appropriately
                    authorised.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     While it might be noted that the Plaintiffs
                    did not specifically apply for relief under s 88(3) of the BMSMA, as the
                    Plaintiffs indicated that in general, the present action was made under
                    s 88, I was of the view that in this instance, it would be appropriate to
                    treat Prayer 5 as an application under s 88(3), and to make the order
                    for ratification. In any case, as stated above at [33]–[43], this court
                    has jurisdiction over this dispute and the power to order the appropriate relief
                    under general law. I thus ordered the MCST to ratify these
                purchases.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Miscellaneous matters</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     Two other matters should be briefly dealt
                    with. As stated above (at [10]), the potential counterclaims by the MCST against
                    the Developer involved substantial disputes of fact, and the Defendants proposed
                    to proceed by way of a separate claim against the Developer. I granted leave to
                    the MCST to commence a writ action pursuant to O 28 r 8 of the ROC
                    within six weeks of the order made.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     The second is with regard to the s 58(3)
                    Notice, issued by the Plaintiffs to oppose any decision of the council that
                    might result in the incurring of legal costs for the present action. The
                    Defendants submitted that the s 58(3) Notice was issued in bad faith, to
                    intimidate the MCST and prevent it from defending the present action. The
                    Defendants urged this court to declare the s 58(3) Notice null and void. The
                    Plaintiffs submitted that there was no need for the court to deal with this, and
                    that OS 994/2014 should be dealt with separately. In reply, the Defendants
                    accepted that if I took the view that I was not bound by the notice in terms of
                    costs, there would be no need to rule on this issue in the present proceedings.
                    The Plaintiffs accepted that I was not bound by the notice in relation to
                    costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     Accordingly, there was no need for me to deal
                    with the issue whether the s 58(3) Notice was valid. As the Plaintiffs had
                    failed in most of their prayers, save for Prayer 5, and had withdrawn
                    Prayer 1, I awarded costs to the Defendants fixed at $7,000, with
                    disbursements to be agreed or taxed.</p>
