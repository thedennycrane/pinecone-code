For the reasons that I will explain below, I conclude that as long as an applicant is applying for a prohibitory injunction that is, in effect, a proprietary injunction, he or she must have a proprietary interest in the property concerned to seek such an injunction.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The dispute in OC 158 arose out of the conduct of the first to third defendants, who are the majority shareholders in Seng Lee Holdings Pte Ltd (“SLH”). The claimant, the first defendant, and the second defendant are some of the children of the late Dato Lim Kim Chong (“Dato Lim”). On 25 July 2013, Dato Lim and his children entered into a Deed of Family Arrangement (the “Original Deed”) to, among others, distribute a portion of his assets to his eight children in Singapore. He divided his children into two groups (“Group A” and “Group B”). Group A, which included the first defendant, became shareholders of the fourth defendant, Sin Soon Lee Realty Company (Private) Limited (“SSLRC”), with the assets held by SSLRC and its subsidiaries to be held and operated for the Group A members’ benefit. Group B, which included Dato Lim, the claimant, and the second defendant, became shareholders of SLH, with the assets held by SLH and its subsidiaries to be held and operated for the Group B members’ benefit.

Thus, in the Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Tay Long Kee Impex Pte Ltd v Tan Beng </span><span class="font-italic">Huwah (trading as Sin Kwang Wah) </span>[2000] 1 SLR(R) 786, the court explained as follows (at [46]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In our opinion, the terms “interim injunction” and “interlocutory injunction” are not terms of art, and in their ordinary sense, an interim injunction means an injunction made in the meantime and until something is done, <span class="font-italic">eg</span> the final disposal of the matter; and an interlocutory injunction means an injunction made prior to the final disposal of the suit or action, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> at the interlocutory stage of the suit or action. An interim injunction is an interlocutory injunction, and <span class="font-italic">vice versa</span>. We do not think that there is any material difference between the two.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">However, for the purpose of consistency in this judgment, I will use the term “interim injunction”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 As a starting point, the court’s power to grant interim injunctions is provided for in s 4(10) of the Civil Law Act 1909 (2020 Rev Ed), which states: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Injunctions and receivers granted or appointed by interlocutory orders</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(10)  A Mandatory Order or an injunction may be granted or a receiver appointed by an interlocutory order of the court, either unconditionally or upon such terms and conditions as the court thinks just, in all cases in which it appears to the court to be just or convenient that such order should be made.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In turn, the general power of the General Division of the High Court (“General Division”) to grant injunctions is provided by s 18(2) read with paras 5 and 14 of the First Schedule of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1969 (2020 Rev Ed) (the “SCJA”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 More specifically, O 13 r 1(1) of the Rules of Court 2021 provides that “[a] party may apply for an injunction or a search order, whether or not a claim for such relief was included in that party’s originating process, counterclaim or third party notice, as the case may be”. The predecessor to this is O 29 r 1(1) of the Rules of Court (2014 Rev Ed). As observed in Jeffrey Pinsler, <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Practice </span>vol 1 (LexisNexis, 2022) at para 27-3, while O 13 “retains the substance of O 29 … the terminology in O 13 is much clearer than its predecessor”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 In relation to the present application, the generally applicable test for interim injunctions is that: (a) there is a serious question to be tried; and (b) the balance of convenience lies in favour of granting the injunction (see the Court of Appeal decision in <span class="font-italic">RGA</span><span class="font-italic"> Holdings International Inc v Loh Choon Phing Robin and another </span>[2017] 2 SLR 997 (“<span class="font-italic">RGA Holdings</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [28]). This general rule is based on the fundamental principle that “the court should take whichever course appears to carry the lower risk of injustice if it should turn out to have been wrong at trial in the sense of granting relief to a party who fails to establish his rights at the trial, or of failing to grant relief to a party who succeeds at the trial” (see <span class="font-italic">RGA Holdings </span>at [28], citing the Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Chuan Hong Petrol Station Pte Ltd v Shell Singapore (Pte) Ltd </span>[1992] 2 SLR(R) 1 at [88]). Similarly, the Court of Appeal explained in <span class="font-italic">Maldives Airports Co Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> and another v GMR Malé International Airport Pte Ltd </span>[2013] 2 SLR 449<span class="font-italic"> </span>(“<span class="font-italic">Maldives Airports</span>”) (at [53])<span class="font-italic"> </span>that this principle is necessary because the court is asked to assess the balance of convenience at an early stage and based only on affidavit evidence. In particular, the Court of Appeal framed the question as whether the party who is later shown to have been wrongly subjected to an injunction may be adequately compensated by an award of damages.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Further, interim injunctions may be further categorised into interim prohibitory injunctions and interim mandatory injunctions. While the former forbids the commission or continuation of an act, the latter compels the defendant to do a positive act to repair an omission or restore the status quo by undoing some act (see <span class="font-italic">RGA</span><span class="font-italic"> Holdings </span>at [29]). This distinction is important because the grant of interim mandatory injunctions is “a very exceptional discretionary remedy” and there is thus “a much higher threshold to be met in order to persuade the court to grant such an injunction as compared to an ordinary [prohibitory] injunction” (see <span class="font-italic">RGA</span><span class="font-italic"> Holdings </span>at [31], citing the Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">NCC</span><span class="font-italic"> International AB v Alliance Concrete Singapore Pte Ltd </span>[2008] 2 SLR(R) 565 at [75]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">My decision: the interim injunctions should not be granted</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Applying these general principles, I decide that the interim injunctions should not be granted. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">There is no serious question to be tried</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 First, I am not satisfied that there is a serious question to be tried. In sum, the requirement that there is a serious question to be tried necessitates the claimant to prove that their claim is not frivolous or vexatious (see the House of Lords decision of <span class="font-italic">American Cyanamid Co v Ethicon Ltd</span> [1975] AC 396 (“<span class="font-italic">American Cyanamid</span>”) at 407).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The test for a serious question to be tried</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 In this regard, it is relevant to highlight that the test for an interim injunction previously required the claimant to show a “strong <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case that the right which he seeks to protect in fact exists” (see the English Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Smith v Grigg Ltd </span>[1924] 1 KB 655 at 659). However, as Lord Diplock explained, this has since been replaced with the test of whether there are serious questions to be tried, because the evidence before the court during the hearing in relation to the interim injunction would often be incomplete (see <span class="font-italic">American Cyanamid </span>at 406). Indeed, such evidence is also given by affidavit and would not have been tested by cross-examination (see <span class="font-italic">Maldives Airport</span><span class="font-italic">s </span>at [53]). As such, the purpose of interim injunctions – to protect the plaintiff’s interests pending a full trial on the merits – would be stultified if the court’s discretion to grant an interim injunction “were clogged by a technical rule forbidding its exercise if upon that incomplete untested evidence the court evaluated the chances of the plaintiff’s ultimate success in the action at 50 [percent] or less, but permitting its exercise if the court evaluated his chances at more than 50 [percent]” (see <span class="font-italic">American Cyanamid </span>at 406). Ultimately, Lord Diplock emphasised that the court’s function at the interlocutory stages of proceedings is not to try to resolve conflicts of evidence on affidavit as to facts on which the claims of either party may depend nor to decide difficult questions of law that call for detailed argument (see <span class="font-italic">American Cyanamid </span>at 407).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 The threshold for finding a serious question to be tried does not appear to be particularly high. For instance, in the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Chen </span><span class="font-italic">Mingxing and others v Zhang Jian and others </span>[2021] SGHC 3, in relation to the plaintiffs’ application for an interim injunction to restrain the defendants from disposing of any shares in a company pending trial, the court found that there was a serious question to be tried because the evidence disclosed an investment plan that the defendants had known about and had benefitted them. While the court noted that there remained unanswered questions and facts in contention, these remained for the trial judge to determine and what mattered at this stage was that the plaintiffs’ pleaded case revealed serious questions to be tried. Indeed, for a claimant to <span class="font-italic">fail </span>in establishing a serious question to be tried, they must have “prospects [that] are so small that they lack substance and reality” (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure 2022 </span>vol 1<span class="font-italic"> </span>(Cavinder Bull gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2022) (“<span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure</span>”) at para 13/1/13), or the claim must be “largely speculative” (see the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Sang Cheol Woo v Charles Choi Spackman and others </span>[2021] SGHC 42 (“<span class="font-italic">Spackman</span>”) at [95]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The serious question to be tried in the present application</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Before me, the parties differed in their positions on <span class="font-italic">what </span>the serious question to be tried is for the purposes of the interim injunctions sought.

</div> On the other hand, the defendants argue that the serious question to be tried is the more specific question of whether the claimant has proprietary interest over the Properties, since she is seeking, in substance, proprietary injunctions. Framed this way, it is implicit in the claimant’s characterisation of the question to be tried that she does not think that it is necessary for her to have a proprietary interest over the Properties so as to pursue the injunctions sought.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 To resolve this conflict between the parties’ positions, it is necessary to determine what the serious question to be tried is. In my view, while the claimant is correct that the broader question in OC 158 pertains to whether she has a viable case in minority oppression, it does not follow that that is the serious question to be tried in the <span class="font-italic">present</span> <span class="font-italic">application</span>. This is because even if the claimant establishes that she has a viable case in minority oppression, it is a different question whether she is entitled to the specific reliefs which she seeks. To put this in another way, even if the claimant convinces me that there is a serious question to be tried as to whether she has been oppressed as a minority shareholder of SLH, this says nothing about the sort of remedy, which may include a buyout of the minority’s shares, that may be made available to her, as an oppressed shareholder, at the end of trial. Such a remedy of a buyout would not be of the same nature as the proprietary remedies she is asking for in the present application. It follows, however, that even though I have, for the reasons to follow, decided that there is no serious question to be tried in the present application, it does not mean that the claimant’s claim in OC 158 lacks “substance and reality” (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure </span>at para 13/1/13), or that the claim is “largely speculative” (see <span class="font-italic">Spackman</span> at [95]). I am only here concerned with whether there is a serious question to be tried in so far as the interim injunctions sought are concerned.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 I therefore agree with the defendants that the serious question to be tried for the <span class="font-italic">present application </span>is whether the claimant is entitled to the very relief she seeks, which are the interim injunctions over the Properties concerned. This requires me to consider the proper characterisation of the interim injunctions. Since the defendants have argued that these are really proprietary injunctions, I turn next to discuss what is a proprietary injunction. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">There is no serious question to be tried in the present application</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) The claimant requires a proprietary interest to seek the interim injunctions</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 To begin with, a proprietary injunction is a relief that stems from the exercise of the Chancery Court’s jurisdiction, that fastens on the specific asset in which the claimant asserts a proprietary interest, and prevents the defendant from dealing with that asset and its traceable proceeds (see the Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Ernest Ferdinand Perez De La Sala v </span><span class="font-italic">Compañía De Navegación Palomar, SA and others </span>[2020] 1 SLR 950<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [59]). As such, a proprietary injunction is a <span class="font-italic">specific </span>form of prohibitory injunction (see the Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Bouvier, Yves Charles </span><span class="font-italic">Edgar and another v Accent Delight International Ltd and another and another appeal </span>[2015] 5 SLR 558 (“<span class="font-italic">Bouvier</span>”) at [144]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 As with the General Division’s power to grant an injunction generally, the court’s power to grant a proprietary injunction specifically is also located in s 18(2) read with para 5(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the First Schedule to the SCJA. The applicable test is thus the same as the generally applicable test for granting interim injunctions, with the qualification that the first requirement that there is a serious question to be tried will be satisfied as long as the claimant has a “seriously arguable case that they [have] a proprietary interest” (see <span class="font-italic">Bouvie</span><span class="font-italic">r</span> at [151], citing the English Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Derby</span><span class="font-italic"> &amp; Co Ltd v Weldon (No 1)</span> [1990] Ch 48 at 64A–64B). In this regard, it bears mentioning that a proprietary injunction ought not to be confused with a freezing injunction. This is because a freezing injunction is granted in support of a claim for personal relief and does not latch on to any specific asset of the defendant. Instead, it merely prevents the defendant from dissipating his assets beyond a certain value to defeat a possible judgment that may in due course be rendered against him. On the other hand, it is clear that a proprietary injunction is granted in support of a claim for proprietary relief (see <span class="font-italic">Bouvier </span>at [143]–[144]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Given that a proprietary injunction is one which attaches to the property concerned so as to prohibit any dealings with it, I am of the view that the interim injunctions which the claimant seeks should be properly characterised as proprietary injunctions. I say this for the following three reasons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 First, although the interim injunctions sought are framed as “interim prohibitory injunction[s]”,
                   <sup><button class="btn btn-link superscript-btn" data-target="#fn-60a86f59-e37f-49d5-8905-e9729978a805" data-toggle="modal" type="button">11</button></sup>

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> this does not preclude the court from finding that they are, in substance, proprietary injunctions. For instance, in <span class="font-italic">Spackman</span>, although the claimant had applied for an “interim injunction” preventing the defendant from: (a) selling or transferring shares; (b) disposing of the sale proceeds of the shares; and (c) causing the sale proceeds to be transferred to third parties (at [36]), the court characterised the injunction sought as a proprietary injunction because it would “prevent dealings with particular assets or traceable proceeds thereof” (at [97]–[98]). Relatedly, in the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">CLM v CLN and others </span>[2022] 5 SLR 273, the court did not question the plaintiff’s characterisation of an injunction “prohibiting the first defendants from dealing with, disposing of, or diminishing the value of the Stolen Cryptocurrency Assets” as a proprietary injunction. In the present application, because the claimant is applying to restrain the transfer of the Properties to the first and fifth defendants, I am satisfied that the injunctions are, in substance, proprietary injunctions because they seek to prevent any diversion or dissipation of the Properties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Second, I find that it is immaterial that the injunctions sought are intended to prevent the diversion or dissipation of the Properties <span class="font-italic">pending</span> the determination of OC 158, instead of being so-called “freestanding” injunctions (on the issue of whether there can ever be a “freestanding” injunction, see the important discussion of the General Division in the recent case of <span class="font-italic">Gazelle Ventures Pte Ltd v Lim Yong Sim and others </span>[2023] SGHC 328 at [2] and [66]–[72], though see also the UK Supreme Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Wolverhampton City Council and others v London Gypsies and Travellers and others </span>[2023] UKSC 47 at [43]–[49]). This is because the litmus test for determining if an injunction is proprietary in nature remains whether they fasten upon the asset in question, and not the purpose for which the injunction is sought. In this regard, I note that in the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Janesh s/o Rajkumar v Unknown Person (“CHEFPIERRE”) </span>[2023] 3 SLR 1191 (at [25]), the application was for a “proprietary injunction prohibiting the defendant from in any way dealing with the Bored Ape NFT, <span class="font-italic">until after the trial of Originating Claim No</span><span class="font-italic"> 41 of 2022</span>” [emphasis added]. Despite the purpose of the injunction being clear, it did not appear to affect the court’s characterisation of it as a proprietary injunction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Third, I do not think that the claimant’s reference to two English decisions, which have granted what appears to be proprietary injunctions in the context of a minority oppression claim despite the applicant not possessing any proprietary interest over the assets concerned, assists her case. In my view, these decisions are different because they do not involve proprietary injunctions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 The first decision is <span class="font-italic">Re</span><span class="font-italic"> Mountforest Ltd </span>[1993] BCC 565 (“<span class="font-italic">Re</span><span class="font-italic"> Mountforest Ltd</span>”), where Harman J granted, among others, an injunction restraining the respondents from acting upon resolutions intended to be passed at two extraordinary general meetings. These resolutions would authorise the sale of the assets of the company, and Harman J opined that “it cannot be right to allow the company to pass a resolution which will have the effect of purporting to validate a transaction which does not in fact comply with the resolution” (at 571). Where this decision differs from the present application is in the nature of the injunction sought. The claimant there was seeking to restrain shareholders from acting on resolutions proposed to be passed on the basis that the supporting shareholders did not genuinely intend to act in accordance with those resolutions, and are instead seeking to use those resolutions to validate non-compliant transactions. The injunction sought in <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Mountforest Ltd </span>thus does not involve any proprietary interest <span class="font-italic">per se</span>. Yet, while the first defendant had previously requisitioned SSLRC to hold an EGM to vote on the transfer of the Properties on 1 August 2022, following the undertaking by the first defendant on 29 July 2022, the resolutions pertaining to the transfer of the Properties were withdrawn.

</div> Therefore, as it stands, there are no resolutions proposing the transfer of the Properties.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Given my conclusion above that the claimant has failed to establish proprietary interest in the Properties and therefore has not shown a serious question to be tried, I do not find it necessary to decide whether she is a proper plaintiff, which can be left to the hearing of OC 158. This is because, even if the claimant can demonstrate that she is a proper plaintiff, this is insufficient to establish a serious question to be tried in relation to the transfer of the Properties, which is premised on her having the requisite proprietary interest. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Accordingly, for the reasons given above, I am of the view that there is no serious question to be tried in so far as the interim injunctions concerning the Properties are concerned, because the claimant has no proprietary interest in the Properties.

Nevertheless, assuming that there is a serious question to be tried, I now consider whether the balance of convenience lies in favour of granting the injunctions.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The balance of convenience does not lie in favour of granting the interim injunctions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 For the reasons that I will now develop, I find that the balance of convenience does not lie in favour of granting the injunctions.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The test for determining the balance of convenience </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 In determining where the balance of convenience lies, the court proceeds on a two-stage analysis: (a) at the first stage, the court considers whether damages would be an adequate remedy for the respective parties; and (b) at the second stage, if damages would not be an adequate remedy, or if the court is doubtful about the adequacy of damages, the court considers where the balance of convenience lies (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure </span>at paras 13/1/14 to 13/1/16). Relevant factors at the second stage include the risk of irreparable damage (see the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Challenger Technologies Ltd v Courts (Singapore) Pte Ltd </span>[2015] 5 SLR 679 at [32]) and the potential hardship an injunction may bring to the party enjoined (see the Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Reed Exhibitions Pte Ltd v Khoo Yak Chuan Thomas and another </span>[1995] 3 SLR(R) 383 at [21]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 One qualification to the above test in the context of an oppression action under s 216 of the Companies Act 1967 (2020 Rev Ed) is that it should not be framed in terms of the adequacy of damages. This is because in the event that the oppression claim is successfully made out, s 216 does not provide for damages as a remedy. However, there are remedies providing for financial compensation, such as a buyout order. Indeed, the same has been observed in the UK, where because s 461 of the Companies Act 1985 (c 6) (UK) does not provide for an award of damages at common law, but allows the court to order various forms of financial compensation, the inquiry should be whether there is an adequate <span class="font-italic">remedy</span> for the claimant (see the English High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Re</span><span class="font-italic"> Posgate &amp; Denby (Agencies) Ltd </span>[1987] BCLC 8 at 15–16 and the English Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Pringle and others v Callard </span>[2008] 2 BCLC 505 at [26]–[27]). It is therefore more precise to frame the inquiry as whether the claimant may be adequately financially compensated. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The balance of convenience does not lie in favour of granting the interim injunctions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 I begin by considering the first stage in the balance of convenience analysis. In my view, even if the interim injunctions are not granted, and the claimant is successful in OC 158, the claimant may be adequately financially compensated. This is because even if the Properties are transferred, any loss caused to the claimant remains quantifiable. In this regard, I do not accept that the claimant would find it difficult to quantify any potential loss because there are plans to redevelop the Geylang area, on which one of the Properties lie. It cannot be that the mere fact of redevelopment renders it impossible to reach an objective valuation of a property. If so, this would mean that the properties within the area of redevelopment cannot be valued until the redevelopment is completed, which cannot be the case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 In this regard, while the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Bouvier </span>(at [157])<span class="font-italic"> </span>appeared to treat “unique property, or property that cannot be readily purchased or substituted on the market” differently from fungible assets in the context of proprietary injunctions, the claimant’s case is not that the Properties are unique and cannot be easily replaced. Instead, the claimant’s case is premised on the valuation of the Properties, which must mean that the claimant is concerned with the economic value of the Properties, and not any unique value that cannot be quantified in monetary terms. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Further, the claimant had been previously presented with a written offer by the first defendant dated 2 August 2022, which the claimant herself conceded during a hearing on 27 September 2022 to be a reasonable offer that “dealt with” and “sufficiently addressed” the issue of the Properties.

</div> In so far as the adequacy of financial compensation is concerned, this concession suggests that the claimant can be adequately financially compensated. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Accordingly, because the claimant may be adequately financially compensated, the balance of convenience does not lie in favour of granting the injunctions. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Other relevant factors</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 For completeness, I consider other relevant factors, in particular, the behaviour of the claimant in bringing the present application. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Because an interim injunction is a form of equitable relief, the applicant must come to the court with clean hands. This does not mean that the applicant must be blameless in all ways. With that being said, in order to prevent a person from receiving equitable relief, the undesirable behaviour must be more than general depravity. It must also have an immediate and necessary relation to the equity sued for and must be a depravity in a legal as well as in a moral sense (see the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Hong Leong Singapore Finance Ltd v United Overseas Bank Ltd </span>[2007] 1 SLR(R) 292 at [224]–[226]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Additionally, as the learned authors of <span class="font-italic">Snell’s Equity </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 34th Ed, 2020) observed, a claimant applying for an interim injunction must demonstrate the urgency of the application (at para 18-065):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Moreover, interim relief is granted only in matters of urgency, so that a claimant who delays thereby demonstrates the absence of any urgency requiring prompt relief. Even a month’s delay between the assertion of a right and the commencement of proceedings may debar the claimant if in the meantime the defendant has contracted to let the subject-matter to third parties. Delay is, however, of less significance where the case turns simply on the construction of documents.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[footnotes omitted] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Indeed, delay is relevant because it affects the “practical doing of justice on the application” and “raises questions about whether the claimant really needs an injunction pending trial” (see Steven Gee, <span class="font-italic">Commercial Injunctions </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 6th Ed, 2016) at para 2-022). For instance, in the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Meespierson</span><span class="font-italic"> NV v Industrial and Commercial Bank of Vietnam</span> [1998] 1 SLR(R) 287 (at [29]–[30]), the court observed that a delay of nine months before an application for a Mareva injunction was made indicated that there was no real risk of dissipation, and the injunction was to “oppress the defendants and force them to settle and/or to obtain security for the claim”, which “was an abuse of the process of [the] court”. And in the English High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">JSC</span><span class="font-italic"> BTA Bank v Ablyazov and others </span>[2009] EWHC 2840 (Comm) (at [18]), the delay of five months was “a point worthy of consideration because delay in seeking a Freezing Order can indicate that there is no real risk of dissipation”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 In the present case, although I am satisfied that the claimant has not acted with such depravity that would bar the present application, I agree with the defendants that there has been substantial delay in the claimant’s bringing of the present application. The claimant sent a letter to the defendants on 30 March 2022 stating her concerns regarding the transfer of the Properties, but the present application was filed only on 27 July 2022. If the transfer of the Properties were as serious as the claimant alleges, it was unclear why she took close to four months before applying to restrain the transfer of the Properties. In my view, this is a relevant factor that militates against granting the interim injunctions sought by the claimant.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 For all the reasons given above, I find that there is no serious question to be tried in relation to the claimant’s application for the interim injunctions, that the balance of convenience does not lie in favour of granting the injunctions, and that the claimant’s delay in seeking the injunctions militate against granting the injunctions. As such, I dismiss the claimant’s application. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Unless the parties are able to agree on costs for this application, they are to file their submissions on costs, limited to seven pages each, within 14 days of this decision.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Goh Yihan<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Ng Ka Luon Eddee, Tnee Zixian Keith, Lee Pei Hua Rachel and Foo Yiew Min (Tan Kok Quan Partnership) for the claimant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Sarbjit Singh Chopra, Roshan Singh Chopra and Yuen Zi Gui (Selvam LLC) for the first, third and fifth defendants;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Tan Teng Muan and Loh Li Qin (UniLegal LLC) for the second defendant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Eugene Jedidiah Low Yeow Chin (Kelvin Chia Partnership) for the fourth defendant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Tan Kheng Ann Alvin (Wong Thomas &amp; Leong) for the sixth defendant (watching brief).</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
