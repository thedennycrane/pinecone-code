<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The marriage in December
                    1975 between Mr Low Kim Huat (“Mr Low”) and
                    Madam Lina Halim (“Mdm Lina”) did not produce
                    any children. However, Mr Low had children from his previous
                    marriage and they are the plaintiffs in this originating
                    summons. They were said to have been treated by Mdm Lina as
                    if they were her own children. They were all adults when Mr
                    Low and Mdm Lina got married. When Mr Low passed away in
                    1994, he bequeathed his estate to Mdm Lina. She died on 21
                    April 2011 without leaving a will. An unsigned will
                    apparently leaving her estate to the plaintiffs was,
                    however, found in her safe deposit box with a bank after her
                    demise. No evidence was adduced as to how this unsigned will
                    came about.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Mdm Lina’s estate
                        comprises<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       As Mdm Lina, who was not a
                    Muslim, did not leave a will, the Intestate Succession Act
                    (Cap 146, 1985 Rev Ed) (“the Act”) governs the
                    distribution of her estate. The plaintiffs commenced this
                    action for a declaration that, as the step-children of Mdm
                    Lina, their claims in respect of her estate rank higher in
                    priority over the claim of Mdm Lina’s single brother,
                    the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Section 3 of the Act defines
                    a child as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-Heading1">

</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>3</b>.    In this Act —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“child”
                        <b>means</b> a <em>legitimate child</em> and <b>includes</b> any <em>child
                            adopted</em> by virtue of an order of court
                        under any written law for the time being in force in
                        Singapore, Malaysia or Brunei Darussalam;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The issue that has to be
                    determined in these proceedings is whether
                    “child” under s 3 of the Act is to be
                    interpreted as including a step-child. If the answer is yes,
                    the plaintiffs would be deemed to be the
                    “children” of Mdm Lina for the purposes of the
                    Act. Under the rules of distribution in s 7 of the Act, if
                    the plaintiffs are considered Mdm Lina’s children for
                    the purposes of the Act, they are entitled to Mdm
                    Lina’s estate in equal portions to the exclusion of
                    all other parties pursuant to Rule 3 in that section.
                    However, if the plaintiffs are not regarded as Mdm
                    Lina’s children under the Act, then her estate will go
                    to the defendant as her only surviving family member under
                    Rule 6 in the said s 7.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Plaintiffs’ Submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The plaintiffs’
                    submissions were made by Mr Gregory Vijayendran (“Mr
                    Vijayendran”) and comprised two parts. The first was
                    to persuade me that there is no obstacle in the Act which
                    prevents me from interpreting “child” to
                    include a step-child. The second part was an attempt to
                    convince me why I should do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       In the first part of his
                    submissions, Mr Vijayendran stated that the Act does not
                    expressly or impliedly exclude step-children, unlike
                    illegitimate children. According to him, the word
                    “includes” indicates an inclusionary and
                    enlarging definition. It makes clear that the definition
                    includes a matter that otherwise would or might be taken as
                    outside it (see <em>Dilworth v Commissioner
                        of Stamps</em> (1899) AC 99 and <em>Lui Chang Soong v Public Prosecutor</em> [1992] 1
                    SLR(R) 229). Therefore, there is no restriction on reading
                    “child” to include a step-child.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Mr Vijayendran then made
                    four arguments as to why a step-child should be included
                    within the definition of “child”. He
                    submitted, firstly, that this would be in line with
                    Parliament’s intention. In the Parliamentary debates
                    during the second reading of the Intestate Succesion Bill
                    (Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (12
                    December 1966) Volume 25 at column 565<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>),
                    the Minister for Law said the Act was intended to replace
                    the outmoded Statute of Distributions. Mr Vijayendran read
                    this to mean that the Act was intended to accommodate local
                    customs and needs. As there were polygamous marriages in the
                    past, there would have been the well known phenomenon of
                    step-children. Parliament could not have been oblivious to
                    such stepchildren<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> and was likely to have
                    impliedly included them within the Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Mr Vijyanedran’s
                    second argument was that the law on maintenance obligations
                    before and after the death of a step-parent would be better
                    rationalised if the definition of “child” in s
                    3 of the Act included a step-child. Section 70 of the
                    Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed)
                    (“WC”) provides that where a person has
                    accepted a child who is not his child as part of his family,
                    it shall be his duty to maintain that child while he remains
                    a child so far as the father or mother of the child fails to
                    do so. This obligation terminates upon death and if the said
                    person dies intestate, the step-child may not be provided
                    for. However, if “child” in s 3 of the Act
                    includes a step-child, then step-children will still be
                    provided for even after the death of their
                    step-parent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Mr Vijayendran’s
                    third and fourth arguments were pre-emptive
                    counter-arguments. A policy reason why step-children should
                    not come under the Act was the possibility of
                    “double-dipping”, where step-children could
                    potentially claim under the estate of their biological as
                    well as their step-parents. In respect of this policy
                    reason, he argued that this possibility did not appear in
                    the records as a matter of concern for Parliament. Citing
                        <em>Re Leach (deceased)</em> [1985]
                    3 WLR 413 and <em>Re Callaghan
                        (deceased)</em> [1985] Fam 1, he further argued
                    that the double-dipping problem would be mitigated in cases
                    where the step-child was treated as a child of the
                    step-parent and if the deceased step-parent’s estate
                    comprised largely of assets which were derived from the
                    step-child’s biological parent. The fact situation
                    here falls within these two mitigating
                factors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Fourth, in <em>AAG v Estate of AAH, deceased</em> [2010]
                    1 SLR 769 (“<em>AAG v
                        AAH”</em>), the Court of Appeal at [37]
                    said that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… the ordinary literal meaning of
                        “daughter” would appear to have nothing to
                        do with the legal state of legitimacy but with a
                        biological fact.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This suggests that there has to be a biological
                    connection which, in turn, would preclude a step-child from
                    being considered a “child” under the Act. Mr
                    Vijayendran sought to distinguish <em>AAG v
                        AAH</em> on the basis that the statute in question
                    there was the Inheritance (Family Provision) Act (Cap 138,
                    1985 Rev Ed) (“IFPA”) and that the focus in
                    that case was on illegitimate children who, unlike
                    step-children in the Act, were impliedly
                excluded.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Defendant’s Submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Ms Tan Yew Cheng
                    (“Ms Tan”) made two main submissions on behalf
                    of the defendant. She submitted that the use of terms like
                    “issue” and “descendants”
                    suggests an inheritance structure based on blood ties. She
                    also referred to s 6(b) of the Act which states that a
                    person related by half-blood to the deceased ranks after one
                    who is related by whole blood. As step-children do not have
                    blood ties to their step-parent, they cannot claim against
                    the latter’s estate under the Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Second, there are statutes
                    which define a “child” or “family
                    member” to include a step-child. In the light of
                    these statutes, Parliament’s decision not to expressly
                    include a step-child within the definition of
                    “child” in the Act suggests that a step-child
                    was not intended to come within the Act’s purview. The
                    said statutes are:</p>

                                    a member of the family of the
                                person;</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision of the court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The significance of the
                    word “includes” in a definition may be very
                    different when it is used in the phrase “means
                    … and includes”. On its own, the word
                    “includes” makes a definition extensive (see
                        <em>Chin Seow Noi and others v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [1993] 3 SLR(R) 566 at
                    [77]). In contrast, the phrase “means … and
                    includes” may serve two purposes. The word
                    “includes” can either illustrate the main
                    meaning or it can extend the main meaning beyond its natural
                    import (see <em>Pan-United Marine Ltd v Chief
                        Assessor</em> [2008]
                3 SLR 569).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     With these principles in
                    mind, I turn to s 3 of the Act. In my view,
                    “legitimate child” is the main meaning and
                    “adopted child” is the enlarged definition
                    beyond the natural import of the word “child”.
                    Taken as a whole and in its proper context, the Act requires
                    a legal and biological connection between parent and child
                    and hence the exception for lawfully adopted children who
                    satisfy the legal but not the biological
                requirement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     By impliedly excluding the
                    claims of illegitimate children, the word
                    “legitimate” indicates a legal connection is
                    required. The Court of Appeal in <em>AAG v
                        AAH</em> commented on the Act at [38(c)]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Under the Intestate Succession Act, only legitimate
                        children are entitled to claim against their natural
                        parent’s estate. To permit an illegitimate child
                        to claim for maintenance against his or her deceased
                        parent’s estate would be to indirectly allow that
                        child to claim for a share in the intestate
                        parent’s estate, contrary to the provisions of the
                        Intestate Succession Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     A commonsensical reading
                    of the Act would show that a biological connection between
                    the intestate and the child is also needed. The word
                    “child” has various definitions, the most
                    common being a reference to a non-adult. The terms used in
                    the Act, such as “issue” and
                    “descendants”, do point quite conclusively to
                    the need for a biological connection. It must therefore
                    follow that a step-child is not meant to be covered by the
                    Act. Even though the statute in question in <em>AAG v AAH</em> was the IFPA, the Court of
                    Appeal’s statements (quoted at <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a> above) are at least
                    highly persuasive. In that case, the Court of Appeal also
                    noted (at [37] of the case) that the ordinary literal
                    meaning of “daughter” concerned a biological
                    fact and not the legal state of legitimacy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Mr Vijayendran accepted
                    that a step-child would not fall within the main meaning of
                    s 3, <em>i.e</em>. “legitimate
                    child”. His contention was that a step-child comes
                    under an open category indicated by the word
                    “includes”. In other words, the definition has
                    been broadened to encompass adopted children but it does not
                    necessarily confine itself to adopted children only. It
                    could, it was argued, be extended by judicial interpretation
                    to include step-children because this category was not
                    expressly excluded in the Act. Though I appreciate Mr
                    Vijayendran’s valiant attempts to advance the cause of
                    his clients, I have to disagree with him. The maxim,
                        e<em>xpressio </em><em>unius </em><em>est
                        exclusion alterius</em>, means that when
                    Parliament has expressly included one thing, it should be
                    assumed that it did not intend to include other things. On
                    its own, the word “includes” may in some cases
                    suggest an open category where different classes of children
                    could be added over time. However, when the word
                    “includes” is part of the phrase “means
                    … and includes” as in the present case, it
                    simply enlarges the main meaning to include adopted children
                    and only to that extent. This is reinforced by the other
                    provisions in the Act referred to by Ms Tan at <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a> above. Therefore,
                    step-children do not fall within the definition of
                    “child” in s 3 of the Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     There was no extraneous
                    legislative or other evidence adduced that would lead to a
                    different conclusion. As Mr Vijayendran contended,
                    Parliament must have been aware of the phenomenon of
                    step-children during the debates leading to the Act. By
                    choosing not to include them in the definition of
                    “child” while expressly enlarging the said
                    definition to embrace lawfully adopted children, Parliament
                    has made its intention clear. There is no evidence to show
                    that Parliament’s intention was to provide for
                    step-children in the event of intestacy. Step-children were
                    not discussed during the parliamentary debates or in the
                    Report of the Select Committee on the Intestate Succession
                    Bill, Parl 5 of 1967, 7 March 1967. The decision to define
                    “child” to include a step-child in other
                    statutes (see <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a>
                    above) and not to do likewise in the Act (whether at its
                    inception or subsequently when the other statutes were being
                    considered) suggests that Parliament did not intend
                    step-children to be entitled to the estate of an intestate
                    step-parent. I declined Mr Vijayendran’s invitation to
                    consider various foreign authorities as those involved
                    statutes that were not <em>in pari
                        </em><em>materia</em> with
                    the Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The first plaintiff
                    deposed in his first affidavit how Mdm Lina treated him and
                    his siblings as her own children<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>, for
                    example, how she would introduce the first plaintiff and his
                    wife as her son and daughter-in-law respectively. He also
                    asserted that Mdm Lina’s estate rightfully belonged to
                    him and his siblings as their biological father had paid for
                    most of it. These comments relate to the equities of a
                    particular case but have no influence on proceedings to
                    determine the meaning of words in a statute. We are
                    concerned here with the question whether step-children are
                    within the definition of “child” in the Act,
                    not whether the plaintiffs here deserve to be treated as
                    “children” for the purposes of the Act.
                    Similarly, we are not concerned with the question whether
                    the defendant deserves to have a claim to the whole or part
                    of the estate of his deceased sister. Both parties rightly
                    agreed that the equities of this case form only the
                    background facts and are irrelevant to the task of statutory
                    construction. Love and filial piety do not make a person a
                    “child” of the intestate if that person does
                    not come within the ambit of the Act. Even if equities do
                    matter, the step-child is normally not completely without
                    recourse. He would still be entitled to the estate of his
                    biological parent in an intestacy. In this case, however,
                    the plaintiffs’ biological father chose to give
                    everything to Mdm Lina who unfortunately did not leave a
                    will. The parties agreed, again quite rightly, that in the
                    absence of evidence concerning the unsigned will (see
                        <a href="#p1_1">[1]</a> above), it would
                    be highly speculative to make any submissions concerning it.
                    It is therefore incumbent on step-parents wishing to provide
                    for their step-children’s entitlement to their estate
                    to expressly state so in a proper will.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     I declare that
                    “child” under s 3 of the Act does not include
                    step-children. Accordingly, since Mdm Lina did not have any
                    children or other descendants for the purposes of the Act,
                    the defendant is entitled to her entire estate. Whether the
                    defendant wishes to make some provisions out of her estate
                    for the plaintiffs out of goodwill is of course his
                    prerogative but it will be a very good gesture on his part
                    and I would certainly encourage him to do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     In accordance with the
                    parties’ agreement, I order that their costs for these
                    proceedings be paid out of Mdm Lina’s
                estate.</p>
