<font size="3" xmlns=""><i><b>
<p align="justify">Facts</p></b></i>
<p align="justify">1. The Plaintiffs are a bank incorporated in the Netherlands with a

branch office in Singapore.. The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendants are a private limited company

incorporated in Singapore, having as its only two directors the 2<sup>nd</sup> and the 3<sup>rd</sup>

Defendants who, at the material time, were husband and wife. The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendants

obtained banking facilities from the Plaintiffs and were sued as principal debtor whilst

the claim against the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants was in their capacity

as sureties.</p>
<p align="justify">2. On 11 February 2000, the Plaintiffs obtained summary judgment

against all three defendants pursuant to Order 14 Rule 3 of the Rules of Court. This is

the appeal brought by the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant only against the summary judgment

granted by the learned Senior Assistant Registrar.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The Plaintiff granted banking facilities to the 1<sup>st</sup>

Defendant by way of letters of offer. In the Statement of Claim they pleaded specifically,

a letter dated 27 January 1997 whereby short-term multi-currency facilities up to

US$2,500,000.00 were offered. This letter in effect increased an earlier facility granted

in October 1996 by US$500,000.00. It was a term of the offer that the facilities would be

secured<i> inter alia</i> by the joint and several continuing personal guarantees of the 2<sup>nd</sup>

and the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants. The other material terms were as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(1) the Plaintiffs shall be entitled to charge interest and commission

  on the facilities at such rates as particularized in the letter of offer, and in

  particular the interest chargeable on the overdraft facility shall be the rate of 2.5%

  above the Plaintiffs’ cost of funds,</p>
<p align="justify">(2) all legal and out of pocket expenses incurred by the Plaintiffs in

  connection with the enforcement of their rights under the letter of offer and under any

  security document shall be payable by the Borrower (i.e. the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendants),

  and</p>
<p align="justify">(3) save as amended, revised or superseded by the letter of offer of 27

  January 1997, the Plaintiffs’ earlier letters to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendants for

  credit facilities shall continue to apply. </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">4. In their claim against the sureties, the Plaintiffs relied on a Deed

of Guarantee dated 16 October 1996 signed by the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup>

Defendants which provided that,</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">‘In consideration of the [the Plaintiffs] .. extending or

  continuing to extend loans, advances, accommodation, credit or other financial facilities

  of any kind whatever from time to time .. to [the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant] … we [the

  2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants] HEREBY JOINTLY AND SEVERALLY GUARANTEE on

  demand in writing being made to us to pay and satisfy to the [Plaintiffs] all sums of

  money which are now or shall at any time be owing to the [Plaintiffs] anywhere on any

  account whatsoever ..</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">and further,</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">‘This guarantee shall be binding as a continuing guarantee on us,

  our executors, administrators and legal representatives until the expiration of three(3)

  calendar months after the Bank shall have received notice in writing given by us … to

  discontinue or determine this guarantee…. ‘<font size="2"> </font></p>
</blockquote></font>
<font size="3" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">5. In April 1999, the Plaintiffs advised the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendants

that the sums of Japanese Yen 314,399,788 together with interest of Japanese Yen 157,200,

and US$822.18 together with interest of US$1.03 were due and owing. The 1<sup>st</sup>

Defendants failed to make payment. As at 5 July 1999, the sum had increased to Japanese

Yen 316,790,007, US$1,262.22 (‘the principal sums’) and interest of Japanese Yen

131,635 as well as US$1.37. These were the sums claimed in the Writ together with further

interest which continued to accrue. </p>
<p align="justify">6. In their Defence, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendants admitted owing the

Plaintiffs the principal sums claimed but denied that the Plaintiffs were entitled to the

interest portions. Judgment was entered on 16 September 1999 pursuant to Order 27 Rule 3

of the Rules of Court against the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendants for the principal sums. The 1<sup>st</sup>

Defendants made some payments to account in August and October 1999 which were used by the

Plaintiffs to set off against the interest accrued on both the Japanese Yen and US$

accounts. As at 1 November 1999, the Plaintiffs certified the amount due and owing by the

1<sup>st</sup> Defendants to be Japanese Yen 318,951,638 comprising the principal of

Japanese Yen 318,925,061 and interest of Japanese Yen 26,577).</p>
<p align="justify">7. The Plaintiffs sought in their application for summary judgment the

following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) against the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, the sum of Japanese Yen

  2,161,631 less US$1,262.22 (equivalent to the amount owing as at 1 November 1999 less the

  judgment sum of Japanese Yen 316,790,007 and US$1,262.22),</p>
<p align="justify">(b) against the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants, the sum

  of Japanese Yen 318,951,638, </p>
<p align="justify">(c) against all three defendants, further interest at the rate of 2.5%

  above the Plaintiff’s cost of funds, and </p>
<p align="justify">(d) costs on an indemnity basis. </p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
</blockquote>
<i><b>
<p align="justify">The Defences raised in the affidavits</p></b></i>
<p align="justify">8. Although this appeal is by the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant only, I will

mention briefly the defences raised by the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant as the 1<sup>st</sup>

Defendants did not file any affidavit to oppose the application for summary judgment. The

2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant filed two affidavits, the first purportedly on behalf of himself

and the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant and the second on his own behalf. After the 2<sup>nd</sup>

Defendant’s affidavit was filed, the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant instructed separate

solicitors and sought leave to file her own affidavits to oppose the summary judgment

application. </p>
<p align="justify">9. In essence, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant contended that he should be

entitled to defend the action on the basis that the 27 January 1997 letter of offer

required a fresh guarantee to be executed by both the directors. The guarantee signed on

16 October 1996 was for the purpose of securing facilities under a letter of offer dated 3

October 1996 which was subsequently not utilized by the parties. The guarantee signed on

16 October 1996 was therefore not applicable to the facilities offered in the 27 January

1997 letter. These submissions were rejected by the learned Senior Assistant Registrar,

and rightly so, as the guarantee was a continuing guarantee which would extend to all

future loans and facilities. </p>
<p align="justify">10. The Plaintiffs had explained in their affidavit that the letters of

offer dated 3 October 1996 and 27 January 1997 were not the first two letters of offer

made to the First Defendants. The first such letter was in October 1989 and a continuing

guarantee was executed by the 2<sup>nd</sup> and the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants that same

month. The credit facilities were subsequently revised on numerous occasions without the

need for a separate guarantee. The balance drawn on the existing credit facilities was

carried forward to the new facilities upon acceptance of each letter of offer. Therefore,

although no drawdown was made after the execution of the 1996 letter of offer, the

facilities had been activated. The 2<sup>nd</sup> and the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants were

not required to execute a fresh guarantee for each revised letter of offer because the

1989 and the 1996 guarantees were continuing ones. The only reason the 1996 guarantee was

required was that new terms were inserted therein in response to jurisdictional issues and

the effect of the Indonesian Civil Code. All other terms in the two guarantees remained

the same.</p>
<p align="justify">11. The 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant deposed to the following after leave

was granted for her to file her affidavits:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(1) She was estranged from her husband and had entered into a Deed of

  Separation in August 1996. She was also suffering from asthma and herpes. She had decided

  to relocate to the United States and was organizing her move there after returning from

  visiting friends and relatives on or about 27 September 1996.</p>
<p align="justify">(2) The 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant who was then in Singapore requested

  her to sign the guarantee to the Plaintiffs for facilities up to US$2million. She refused

  as they had already entered into the Deed of Separation. The previous guarantee that she

  had signed was for facilities secured by a property owned by the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant.</p>
<p align="justify">(3) The 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant then subjected her to harassment both

  in and out of the home and the office. She was also the victim of his abusive behaviour,

  his vulgarities and his threats of violence.</p>
<p align="justify">(4) She was fearful that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant would create

  problems for her in regard to the removal of items in the matrimonial home to the United

  States, that he would renege on his agreement to maintain their children and that he would

  oppose her divorce petition.</p>
<p align="justify">(5) She therefore succumbed to his demand to sign the guarantee under

  pressure of these difficult circumstances.</p>
<p align="justify">(6) When she signed the guarantee in the premises of the 1<sup>st</sup>

  Defendants, there was no witness present. She was not advised on the terms of the

  guarantee nor the circumstances requiring it.</p>
<p align="justify">(7) She also queried the propriety of the transactions in the account

  and the utilization of the facilities which were not for the benefit of the 1<sup>st</sup>

  Defendants but credited to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant’s personal account. </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">12. The 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant denied the 3<sup>rd</sup>

Defendant’s allegations of undue influence or duress on his part. On the use of the

funds, he further stated that he had kept the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant generally informed

of the affairs of the company. He also pointed out that the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant had

been involved in the affairs of the company as she had contacted the Plaintiffs to discuss

the indebtedness of the company and to ask for time for the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant to

settle the outstanding amounts.</p>
<p align="justify">13. In response to the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant’s allegations, the

Plaintiffs filed the affidavit of one Diana Tee Gek Cher who had attended at the premises

of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendants to witness the signatures of their directors although she

said she had forgotten to append her own signature on the document as witness. I should

add here that the guarantee document exhibited to the Plaintiffs’ 1<sup>st</sup>

affidavit did not show any witness’ signature. The Plaintiffs also filed a further

affidavit exhibiting searches at the Registry of Companies showing that the 3<sup>rd</sup>

Defendant herself had experience in business being a director and major shareholder of

another company, Noahtu Trading Pte Ltd since 1992. </p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<i><b>
<p align="justify">The issues</p></b></i>
<p align="justify">14. The main contention of the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant was that she

had been subject to the undue influence of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant, her then husband,

in signing the guarantee. Relying on the authority of <i><b>Barclays Bank plc v

O’Brien</b></i> <i>[1993] 4 All E R 417</i>, her counsel contended that the

Plaintiffs as bankers ought to have known of this undue influence and taken steps to

advise her that she should seek independent legal advice. The other argument raised by the

3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant was that the irregularities in the account called for further

inquiry and hence, summary judgment was not appropriate. </p>
<p align="justify">15. The issues I had to consider in this appeal were therefore:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(1) In signing the guarantee, was the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant subject

  to the undue influence of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant?</p>
<p align="justify">(2) Should the Plaintiffs as bankers be fixed with constructive notice

  of the alleged undue influence on the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant? </p>
<p align="justify">(3) Did the Plaintiffs’ failure to inform the 3<sup>rd</sup>

  Defendant that she should take independent legal advice prior to signing the guarantee

  entitle her to set aside the guarantee?</p>
<p align="justify">(4) Was the absence of the signature of the witness on the Deed of

  Guarantee sufficient to raise a defence to the Plaintiffs’ claim?</p>
<p align="justify">(5) Were there irregularities in the use of the funds such that further

  inquiry was warranted?</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">16. As this is an appeal from a summary judgment application, the

burden is on the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant to satisfy the Court that there is an issue or

question in dispute which ought to be tried or that there ought for some other reason be a

trial. </p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<i><b>
<p align="justify">The law on undue influence</p></b></i>
<p align="justify">17. The facts in <i><b>Barclay’s Bank plc v O’Brien </b></i>as

summarized in the headnotes of the report are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<font size="2"><p align="justify"></p></font>"The husband, a shareholder in a

  manufacturing company, which had a substantial unsecured overdraft, arranged with the

  manager of the company’s bank that the company would be allowed an overdraft facility

  of 135,000, reducing to 120,000 after 3 weeks, and that as security the husband would

  guarantee the company’s indebtedness, his liability in turn being secured by a second

  charge over the matrimonial home jointly owned by the husband and the wife. The bank

  prepared the necessary security documents, which included the guarantee to be signed by

  the husband and a legal charge over the house to be signed by both the husband and the

  wife. However, although the manager gave instructions that the husband and wife should be

  made fully aware of the nature and effect of the documents they were signing and should

  take independent legal advice if they were in any doubt, those instructions were not

  followed by the bank staff responsible for arranging for the husband and wife to sign the

  documents. The husband signed the documents without reading them and the next day took his

  wife to the bank, where she also signed the documents without reading them. The

  company’s indebtedness increased beyond the agreed limit and the bank brought

  possession proceedings against the husband and the wife to enforce payment under the

  guarantee.

  <p align="justify">By her defence, the wife contended (i) that her husband had put undue

  pressure on her to sign and that she had succumbed to that pressure, and (ii) that her

  husband had misrepresented to her the effect of the legal charge and that although she

  knew she was signing a mortgage of the matrimonial home she believed that the security was

  limited to 60,000 and would only last three weeks.</p>
<p align="justify">The judge gave judgment for the bank, holding that the husband’s

  liability under the guarantee had been established, that the husband had not unduly

  influenced the wife and that although he had falsely represented to her the effect of the

  charge the bank was not responsible for the husband’s misrepresentation.</p>
<p align="justify">The wife appealed to the Court of Appeal, which held that married women

  who provided security for their husband’s debts were to be treated as a specially

  protected class of sureties, that, if in such a situation the relationship between the

  debtor and the surety and the consequent likelihood of influence and reliance was known to

  the creditor, the creditor was under a duty to take reasonable steps to try and ensure

  that the surety entered into the transaction with an adequate understanding of the nature

  and effect of the transaction and the surety’s consent to the transaction was true

  and informed consent, and that the creditor would not be permitted to enforce the security

  if, by leaving it to the debtor to deal with the surety or otherwise, he failed to carry

  out that duty even though he might have had no knowledge of and could not have been

  responsible for the vitiating feature of the transaction."<font size="2"></font></p>
</blockquote></font>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">18. The House of Lords dismissed the bank’s appeal but rejected

the reasoning of the Court of Appeal that wives were to be accorded special rights in

relation to surety transactions. Lord Browne-Wilkinson (with whom the other Law Lords

agreed) in his judgment at p 428 to 429 of the report started by saying that he could find

no basis in principle for affording special protection to a limited class in relation to

one type of transaction only. His Lordship went on to analyze as follows :</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<font size="2"><p align="justify"></p></font>"In my judgment, if the doctrine of notice

  is properly applied, there is no need for the introduction of a special equity in these

  types of cases. A wife who has been induced to stand as a surety for her husband’s

  debts by his undue influence, misrepresentation or some other legal wrong has an equity as

  against him to set<b> </b>aside that transaction. Under the ordinary principles of equity,

  her right to set aside that transaction will be enforceable against third parties (eg

  against a creditor) if either the husband was acting as the third party’s agent or

  the third party had actual or constructive notice of the facts giving rise to her equity.

  Although there may be cases where, without artificiality, it can properly be held that the

  husband was acting as the agent of the creditor in procuring the wife to stand as surety,

  such cases will be of very rare occurrence. The key to the problem is to identify the

  circumstances in which the creditor will be taken to have had notice of the wife’s

  equity to set aside the transaction.

  <p align="justify">The doctrine of notice lies at the heart of equity. Given that there

  are two innocent parties, each enjoying rights, the earlier right prevails against the

  later right if the acquirer of the later right knows of the earlier right (actual notice)

  or would have discovered it had he taken proper steps (constructive notice). In

  particular, if the party asserting that he takes free of the earlier rights of another

  knows of certain facts which put him on inquiry as to the possible existence of the rights

  of that other and he fails to make such inquiry or take such other steps as are reasonable

  to verify whether such earlier right does or does not exist, he will have constructive

  notice of the earlier right and take subject to it. Therefore where a wife has agreed to

  stand surety for her husband’s debts as a result of undue influence or

  misrepresentation, the creditor will take subject to the wife’s equity to set aside

  the transaction if the circumstances are such as to put the creditor on inquiry as to the

  circumstances in which she agreed to stand surety.</p>
<p align="justify">…</p>
<p align="justify">Therefore, in my judgment a creditor is put on inquiry when a wife

  offers to stand surety for her husband’s debts by the combination of two factors: (a)

  the transaction is on its face not to the financial advantage of the wife; and (b) there

  is a substantial risk in transactions of that kind that, in procuring the wife to act as

  surety, the husband has committed a legal or equitable wrong that entitles the wife to set

  aside the transaction.</p>
<p align="justify">It follows that, unless the creditor who is put on inquiry takes

  reasonable steps to satisfy himself that the wife’s agreement to stand surety has

  been properly obtained, the creditor will have constructive notice of the wife’s

  rights.</p>
<p align="justify">What, then are the reasonable steps which the creditor should take to

  ensure that it does not have constructive notice of the wife’s rights, if any?

  Normally the reasonable steps necessary to avoid being fixed with constructive notice

  consist of making inquiry of the person who may have the earlier right (ie the wife) to

  see whether such right is asserted. It is plainly impossible to require of banks and other

  financial institutions that they should inquire of one spouse whether he or she has been

  unduly influenced or misled by the other. But in my judgment the creditor, in order to

  avoid being fixed with constructive notice, can reasonably be expected to take steps to

  bring home to the wife the risk she is running by standing as surety and to take

  independent advice. .. in my judgment a creditor will have satisfied these requirements if

  it insists that the wife attend a private meeting (in the absence of the husband) with a

  representative of the creditor at which she is told of the extent of her liability as

  surety, warned of the risk she is running and urged to take independent legal advice. If

  these steps are taken in my judgment the creditor will have taken such reasonable steps as

  are necessary to preclude a subsequent claim that it had constructive notice of the

  wife’s rights."<font size="4"> </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">19. On the facts, the House of Lords held that the bank knew the

parties were husband and wife and should therefore have been put on inquiry as to the

circumstances in which the wife had agreed to stand as surety for the debt of her husband.

The failure by the bank to warn the wife when she signed the security of the risk that she

and the matrimonial home were potentially liable for the debts of the company or to

recommend that she take legal advice fixed the bank with constructive notice of the

wrongful misrepresentation made by the husband to her and she was therefore entitled as

against the bank to set aside the legal charge on the matrimonial home. I should add here

that Lord Browne-Wilkinson, in summarizing his views (at page 431), extended the above

stated principles beyond the husband-wife relationship to include cohabitees.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">20. It would appear that their Lordships, both in the Court of Appeal

and the House of Lords, were constrained to treat the wife with more

"tenderness" on the justification that (as shown at p 422 of the report) "<i>although

the concept of the ignorant wife leaving all financial decisions to the husband is

outmoded, the practice does not yet coincide with the ideal. In a substantial proportion

of marriages it is still the husband who has the business experience and the wife is

willing to follow his advice without bringing a truly independent mind and will to bear on

financial decisions."</i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">21. The policy considerations that might have influenced the learned

Law Lords would obviously not apply in every case and certainly not to the facts of the

case before me, as will appear later in my judgment. It is important to take heed of the

cautionary note sounded by the House of Lords to "keep a sense of balance in

approaching these cases" and not allow a law designed to protect the vulnerable to

render the matrimonial home unacceptable as security to financial institutions and, I

would add, render the female partner in a relationship immune to legal liability. With the

greatest of respect, I am not sure the courts here should impose a burden on financial

institutions to ensure that in every husband-wife or cohabitee situation, where the

transaction appears to be of no real financial benefit to the wife/cohabitee, the

financial institution must arrange a meeting separately with the wife to warn her of her

potential liability and to advise her to take independent legal advice. It may be taking

rather too narrow a view of the marital relationship to look only at the apparent

financial benefit to a spouse from a commercial transaction entered into by the other. If

the law should presume undue influence arising in such relationships (and the mother

– son relationship as in <i>Lim Lie Hoa v Ong Jane Rebecca <nobr>[1997] 2 SLR 320</nobr>), </i>should

it not likewise presume financial benefit accruing to a wife from the commercial (and

therefore bread-earning) activities of the husband ? If so, then a wife who stands as

surety for her husband in a loan transaction should be presumed to derive at least an

indirect interest in the funds being made available to the husband.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">22. <i>Barclays Bank v O’Brien<b> </b></i>has been followed

recently in Singapore in the case of <i>Bank of India v Sujanani Thakur Rochiram &amp;

Others (High Court Suit No. 600005/1998 - unreported).</i> In that case, Lee Seiu Kin JC

found on the facts that a son had been subject to the undue influence of his father when

he executed guarantees and mortgages required by the bank to secure the facilities granted

for the use of the partnership business of his parents. From evidence adduced at the

trial, the Court came to the conclusion that the son had been completely overwhelmed and

dominated by the father and the bank had actual notice of the father’s undue

influence on the son.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">23. The <i>Bank of India </i>decision is unique in its facts and I do

not see how it assists the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant in the instant case. There is no

evidence in the affidavits of the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant to show that, being the wife,

she was so completely subjugated by the will of the husband that she could do nothing but

obey him, and that the Plaintiffs knew or ought to have known of these circumstances. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">No undue influence; Lack of witness’ signature</p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">24. The facts of this case are clearly distinguishable from <i>Barclays

Bank v O’Brien</i> in any event. Unlike Mrs O’Brien, the 3<sup>rd</sup>

Defendant was a shareholder as well as director of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendants. Mrs

O’Brien was misled by her husband on the effect of the document she signed to secure

his debt. This is certainly not the case with the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant. I note that in

October 1996 when she was called upon to sign the Deed of Guarantee, she was <i>de facto </i>free

of the husband, having entered into the Deed of Separation just two months back in August

1996 which declares, among other things, that she and her then husband have agreed

"to live and will live separate and apart from each other effective from 27<sup>th</sup>

June 1996". Further, the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant was required to guarantee the debts

of a company in which she had an interest and continues to do so up to the hearing of this

appeal although her interest and involvement in the business were significantly less than

the husband’s. It cannot therefore be said that she secured no financial benefit from

the facilities offered to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendants for which she stood surety. In

fact, as the Deed of Separation contemplates the transfer of her shareholding to her

youngest daughter upon her attainment of the age of majority and of whom the 3<sup>rd</sup>

Defendant has custody, I would imagine that, as the mother, she would seek to ensure that

the shareholding to be given to her child would not be worthless. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">25. The 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant is a businesswoman, being the director

and majority shareholder of another company, Noahtu Trading Pte Ltd. and must be aware of

the obligations she undertook as surety. As disclosed in the Deed of Separation, she also

held the entire legal and beneficial interest in another company called Tamtu Investment

Pte Ltd. She was therefore no stranger to the world of bankers and financial obligations.

She had in fact participated in the management of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendants’

business and had communicated with the Plaintiffs herself in her capacity as director. It

was also revealed that after the facilities under the 27 January 1997 offer had been

utilized, she even had the business acumen to instruct the Plaintiffs to convert the

outstanding debt from US$ to Japanese Yen which unfortunately for the Defendants caused

the debt to increase due to the appreciation of the Yen <i>vis-a vis</i> the US Dollar. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">26. It was not the wife’s case that she did not sign the guarantee

or even that she did not know what she was signing. She was well aware of the obligations

that she undertook. Hence, the fact that the guarantee document does not bear the

signature of a witness is completely immaterial to the case. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">27. The affidavit of the intended witness, Diana Tee, is however

significant as it shows that at the time the guarantee was signed by the wife there were

no circumstances out of the ordinary that should have put the Plaintiffs on notice of the

alleged undue influence operating on the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant. Neither did the 3<sup>rd</sup>

Defendant allege that anyone else other than herself knew what pressures she had been

facing. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">28. In my opinion, no undue influence has been shown by the 3<sup>rd</sup>

Defendant and even if the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant had attempted to exert such influence

on her, it could have had no effect on her free will whether to sign or not to sign the

Guarantee.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">Irregularities in the account</p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">29. Counsel for the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant submitted that the

irregularities in the account would afford the wife a partial defence. I do not see how

this allegation, even if true, can affect the wife’s liability under the guarantee.

The Plaintiffs, as bankers, surely cannot be expected to police the use of the funds by

their customer and to ensure that the funds are properly applied to the customer’s

business operations. This would be an unduly onerous duty to impose on any financial

institution. If there were abuses of the funds, that would be a matter entirely between

the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant and the company and its shareholders. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">Conclusion</p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">30. Judgment was entered against the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup>

Defendants as they clearly had no defence. The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendants had practically

conceded judgment. The complaints made by the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant, both on undue

influence and irregularities in the account, may perhaps found a claim against the 2<sup>nd</sup>

Defendant as co-surety but they cannot stand as defences to the Plaintiffs’ claim on

the Deed of Guarantee. The wording of the Guarantee is in clear and unambiguous terms - it

is binding as a continuing guarantee covering all monies due to the Plaintiffs by the 1<sup>st</sup>

Defendants with no limit on the liability of the guarantors to any fixed duration or to

quantum. Accordingly, I dismissed the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant’s appeal with costs of

the appeal fixed at $4,500.00. </p>
