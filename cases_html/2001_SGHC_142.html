Plaintiffs Momentum Creations Pte Ltd (‘Momentum Creations’) were incorporated

on 18 March 1999 and are in the business of manufacturing and selling furniture. Momentum

Creations is a company which is a subsidiary of Nobel Design Holdings Ltd, a public listed

company, and has showrooms at 6 Raffles Boulevard #03-128, Marina Square, Singapore and

also at 290 Orchard Road #04-03/04, Paragon, Singapore.</font></p>

logo. However, the OM name is also used and referred to separately from the logo.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">5.        The

used August 2000 as the cut-off date for the purpose of considering the extent of the

at least $239,000 for their advertisements since 1999 up to the date of his Affidavit of

Evidence-in-Chief (‘AEIC’) filed 19 February 2001. This sum was not just for the

was from a Mr Raymond Cheong who said that at an exhibition held at the Singapore Expo, a

De Angeli’s sales representative had furnished him with catalogues and brochures and

represented to him that De Angeli is the distributor of the brand of sofas known as OM.

Representations were also made to Mr Cheong to the effect that De Angeli is a wholesaler

and was able to offer sofas at much lower prices and of better quality (see Mr Lam’s

AEIC at paras 13 and 14).</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">28.        Mr

Mr Cheong’s AEIC signed on 26 February 2001 (about five months later) he said:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(a) He had come to know about OM

    and their range of furniture through advertisements placed in newspaper and magazines. He

    had been to the OM showroom at Marina Square. He had noticed a tag bearing the OM mark

    sewn onto the upholstery of their sofas (para 3 of AEIC).</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(b) In August 2000, his wife and

    he decided to visit a furniture exhibition at the Singapore Expo, located at 1 Expo Drive,

    with the intention of looking for sofas (para 4 of AEIC).</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(c) De Angeli’s booth at the

    exhibition was located near the entrance of the exhibition hall. It had the words ‘De

    Angeli’ prominently displayed (para 6 of AEIC).</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(d) As they were walking by the

    booth, one of De Angeli’s female sales representatives approached them. She was

    carrying a plastic folder and invited them to look at their furniture (para 7 of AEIC).</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(e) His wife and he spotted an

    L-shape sofa similar to the ‘Case’ sofa being sold by OM. The sales

    representative told them the price of the sofa which was much lower than OM’s price

    (para 8 of AEIC).</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(f) The sales representative

    showed them some fabric samples, lifted up a cushion on the sofa and showed a special

    lining on the sofa. Mr Cheong sat on the sofa to feel its quality (para 9 of AEIC).</font></p>

    OM’s brochure. Mr Cheong examined a brochure (actually a leaflet) identical to

    Exhibit P9. Mr Cheong claimed that the sales representative pointed to the

    ‘Case’ sofa depicted in the leaflet and told his wife and him that that was what

    they were looking at. She then showed him a newspaper cutting of OM’s advertisement

    in the same plastic folder and pointed to the ‘Case’ sofa depicted in that

    advertisement. The copy of the newspaper advertisement exhibited in Mr Cheong’s AEIC

    was similar to the one as the leaflet (para 10 of AEIC).</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(h) The sales representative said

    they were the sofa manufacturers for OM and explained why they could sell at a lower

    price. She also showed him some invoices of sales already concluded (para 11 of AEIC).</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(i) Mr Cheong said that he

    continued sitting on the sofa and noticed that the cushions were thinner, softer and not

    as dense as the ones he had seen in the OM showroom. He also noticed that the fabric

    upholstery was of an inferior quality (para 12 of AEIC).</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(j) He walked around the sofa to

    see if it had the OM tag but could not find any (para 13 of AEIC).</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(k) He became doubtful as to

    whether De Angeli was the sofa manufacturer for OM and asked for a namecard but none was

    given to him. He asked for the address of their showroom but the sales representative

    refused to tell him (para 14 of AEIC).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(l) His wife was quite keen on

    the sofa displayed. He told her not to rush into buying it. She agreed and they left to

    look at other furniture in the exhibition (para 15 of AEIC).</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(m) After walking around and not

    finding anything they liked, they decided to leave the exhibition. However his wife was

    still keen on the L-shape sofa that they had seen. So, Mr Cheong asked her to contact

    OM’s Marina showroom to check their closing time so that they could go there and

    confirm whether De Angeli was indeed the manufacturer of OM sofas (para 16 of AEIC).</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(n) After getting the phone

    number of the OM Marina showroom and contacting them to find out their closing time, his

    wife and he proceeded there (paras 17 and 18 of AEIC).</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(o) Upon reaching the OM Marina

    showroom, he spoke to a man who turned out to be the Retail Manager of Momentum Creations,

    Mr Lam Chee Wai. It was at this showroom that he first met Mr Lam. He told Mr Lam what had

    happened and Mr Lam was quite surprised. Mr Lam told him that De Angeli did not

    manufacture OM sofas. Mr Lam asked for Mr Cheong’s contact number and Mr Cheong

    provided his pager number (para 19 of AEIC).</font></p>

<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(p) Mr Cheong joined his wife in

    looking at the ‘Case’ sofa displayed in the Marina showroom and both were

    convinced that the one in De Angeli’s booth was of a poorer quality in material and

    fabric although identical in design (para 20 of AEIC).</font></p>

</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">30.        In

the course of the cross-examination of Mr Lam and Mr Cheong, contradictions in or between

their evidence surfaced. I will refer to some of the unsatisfactory evidence.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">31.        

First, Mr Cheong had said that it was at the Marina showroom of OM that he had first met

Mr Lam. This was incorrect. Mr Lam had come to know Mr Cheong previously when Mr Lam was

working in a trading company.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">32.        

This led Ms Foo Soon Yien, acting for De Angeli, to submit that Mr Cheong was not a

genuine customer but had been sent by Momentum Creations to check on De Angeli. I was of

the view that this was not a valid argument. First, Mr Lam revealed without hesitation

that he had come to know Mr Cheong in Mr Lam’s previous job. Secondly, if Mr Cheong

had been sent to check on De Angeli, there would have been no difficulty in getting him to

give evidence against De Angeli. As it turned out Momentum Creations managed to get an

affidavit from Mr Cheong only much later. Thirdly, Mr Cheong and Mr Lam were not friends

but business acquaintances. There was no particular reason for Mr Lam to pick Mr Cheong to

help Momentum Creations and indeed none was suggested by Ms Foo beyond the argument that

Mr Lam had known Mr Cheong before. Fifthly, Momentum Creations had no hesitation in using

private investigators as I will elaborate below. If they had wanted to send someone to

check on De Angeli, they would have sent their own employee or a private investigator

instead of an acquaintance of one of their employees.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">33.        A

second illustration of unsatisfactory evidence was when Mr Cheong said in his oral

evidence that he did not collect any brochures from the OM showroom on the night in

question. He had stated to the contrary in his AEIC.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">34.        

Thirdly, Mr Lam had said that Mr Cheong had told him that Mr Cheong had requested the De

Angeli’s sales representative to specifically write on the order form that De Angeli

is the distributor of OM products but Mr Cheong denied telling Mr Lam this.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">35.        

Fourthly, in Mr Cheong’s AEIC, he had said that an OM newspaper advertisement was

also in the folder which De Angeli’s sales representative had shown him but this was

not mentioned in Mr Lam’s AEIC.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">36.        It

seemed strange to me that De Angeli should include in the folder a black and white

newspaper advertisement which was identical to Exhibit P9 which was in colour.

Furthermore, none of the private investigators engaged by Momentum Creations who were

subsequently also shown a folder by a sales representative of De Angeli had mentioned in

their evidence that the folder contained an OM newspaper advertisement.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">37.        On

this point, I found that Momentum Creations had tried to be clever. They must have

realised that there had been no evidence that De Angeli had used their newspaper

advertisements as well and so, when Mr Cheong eventually agreed to provide an affidavit,

they slipped in this evidence. Mr Cheong probably did not check his AEIC carefully. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">38.        

After having heard Mr Cheong’s evidence and seen his demeanour, I was of the view

that Mr Cheong was not so much dishonest but careless. He appeared annoyed at having to

give evidence and even more annoyed at having his evidence challenged, although he tried

not to show it. Once he had given a response, he was also not objective enough to admit

that the response was wrong or inaccurate even when this was the case.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">39.        

However, although Mr Cheong was not credible on various points, I accepted his evidence on

the main point i.e that a sales representative of De Angeli had shown him an OM brochure

and also represented to him and his wife that De Angeli was the manufacturer of the OM

products. That is why he and his wife went to the OM Marina showroom the same night to

check up on what they had been told. </font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">August 2000 – Chu Swee Seng</font></p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">40.        Mr

Lam said that also in August 2000, he had received a complaint from another person, one Ms

Chu Swee Seng, that one of De Angeli’s sales representatives had showed her OM

brochures and represented, inter alia, that De Angeli is the distributor of the OM sofas.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">41.        

However, Ms Chu was not called to give evidence.</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">21 September 2000</font></p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">42.        In

any event, Mr Lam said that he decided to look into the matter. On 21 September 2000, he

decided to go to the Singapore Expo, which was holding the 2<sup>nd</sup> Singapore

Exhibition Home &amp; Garden, where he knew that De Angeli had set up an exhibition booth.

He went with one Ms Teo Hui Ging who is employed by Nobel Design Holdings Ltd.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">43.        He

asked Ms Teo to approach the sales representatives at De Angeli’s booth to find out,

without alerting them, whether they were using the OM brochures to sell furniture.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">44.        Ms

Teo subsequently met up with him and told him that one of De Angeli’s sales

representatives, one Kelly, had shown Ms Teo OM brochures and had represented that De

Angeli were the manufacturers and wholesalers of OM products.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">45.        Mr

Lam said he then instructed Ms Teo to wait while he went to the booth and confronted Kelly

on her use of OM brochures and her representation. However, when confronted, Kelly denied

both allegations. Mr Lam then left De Angeli’s booth.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">46.        Ms

Teo provided an AEIC and gave evidence. She corroborated Mr Lam’s evidence.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">47.        

However there were some inconsistencies in her evidence. For example, during

cross-examination, she initially said she did not raise the OM name or ask Kelly about OM

but later she said she did (NE 104 line 12 to 14 and NE 105 line 18 to 21).</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">48.        She

also said that the purpose of the visit on 21 September 2000 was not to check on De Angeli

which I found strange as, according to Mr Lam, that was the very purpose of the visit and

she must have known about it.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">49.        I

also accept that given that she first provided an affidavit only on 19 February 2001, she

could not have remembered accurately every aspect of her conversation with the sales

representative in detail.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">50.        Mr

Lam’s evidence was also inconsistent. In his AEIC (at paras 24 to 28) he said that he

had requested Ms Teo to approach De Angeli’s sales representative to check on them

and Ms Teo was to call him on his mobile phone once she was done at De Angeli’s

booth. Yet in his first affidavit, filed on 29 September 2000 for an interim injunction,

he said Ms Teo (then identified as Jocelyn Teo) and he had approached the Defendant’s

sales representative Kelly on that day.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">51.        On

the other hand, Kelly, whose full name is Chong Ching Fui, said that in September 2000,

she was only working as a salesgirl for about five months. She claimed that she did not

know about OM or Momentum Creations so she could not have said that De Angeli is the

supplier of OM sofas.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">52.        In

cross-examination, she said she had never heard of the OM brand (NE 244 line 13/14).</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">53.        She

also said she had never seen the OM brochures, i.e the leaflets, with the names

‘Case’ and ‘Globe’ on them (NE 244 line 1 and 2).</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">54.        

Thirdly, she said that she did not write the names ‘Case’ and ‘Globe’

on invoices for furniture sold by De Angeli (NE 241 line 21 to 242 line 3).</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">55.        

Each of these important statements by Kelly was untrue.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">56.        She

had written the names ‘Case’ and ‘Globe’ on invoices for similar

furniture sold by De Angeli. The earliest invoices before me which had either one of the

two names and were signed by her were dated 16 September 2000. She must have seen the OM

leaflets with the names ‘Case’ and ‘Globe’ on them as she did not

dream up these names herself. Furthermore, the leaflets were in one or two folders which

the sales representatives of De Angeli were aware of (para 4 of her AEIC). She was

obviously aware of the OM brand.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">57.        On

the material points as to whether she had shown an OM leaflet to Ms Teo and made the

representation alleged, I preferred the evidence of Ms Teo to Kelly’s.</font></p>

<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">67.        

Momentum Creations then applied on 29 September 2000 for an interim injunction to, inter

alia, restrain De Angeli from using the OM leaflets and to restrain De Angeli from selling

the look-alike ‘Case’ and ‘Globe’ sofas.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">68.        In

the supporting affidavit of Mr Lam, he referred to the two investigation reports of the

investigations done on 23 and 27 September 2000. At that time, the transcripts of the

video recordings were not exhibited. Perhaps they had not been prepared yet.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">69.        On

the same day, an Interim Injunction Order was granted against De Angeli.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">70.        I

need not go into detail about the attempts to serve the relevant cause papers on Mr Tan

personally. Suffice it to say that his sales representatives were served with, inter alia,

the Interim Injunction Order on the same day i.e 29 September 2000 and he knew about it

immediately thereafter or in the night of the same day.</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">7 October 2000</font></p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">71.        In

the third investigation on 1 October 2000, the operatives purchased a sofa from De Angeli.

The invoice No 5845 was issued by Rosalind. It stated ‘Model: Case L-shape

sofa’.</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Responses thereafter</font></p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">72.        

Four affidavits were filed for De Angeli on 10 October 2000. I need to refer to three

only.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">73.        In

para 12 of Mr Tan’s own affidavit, he said that, ‘Neither I nor any of my sales

representatives have the Plaintiff’s catalogue and brochure nor have claimed the

Defendant is the distributor or supplier of the Plaintiff’s brand of sofa known as OM

or linked to the Plaintiff as alleged or at all’. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">74.        In

para 5 of Ang Kim Hua’s (Rosalind’s) affidavit, she said, ‘I did not call

the Defendant’s sofas "Case" or "Globe".’</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">75.        In

para 6 of her affidavit, she said, ‘I deny stating that OM sells the same type of

sofa and I deny informing anyone that OM was at Marina Square’.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">76.        In

para 8 of her affidavit, she said, ‘… I deny pointing to a brochure depicting

the "Case" package of OM with the price of $3,980’.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">77.        In

para 8 of Lin Yee Kum’s (Kym’s) affidavit, she said, ‘… I deny showing

any OM brochures to any customers’.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">78.        As

the video recordings and transcripts showed, all of these statements on behalf of De

Angeli were false. The deponents had not known that the private investigators had

video-recorded the visits on 23 and 27 September 2000.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">79.        

When they eventually realised this, Rosalind and Kym sought to explain away their false

statements by saying that they had been afraid. This begs the question. If they did not

think that they had done anything wrong and since De Angeli had the benefit of legal

advice, there was no reason for them to be afraid and lie about the use of the OM leaflets

in their affidavits.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">80.        The

truth of the matter is that they had lied blatantly, no doubt at the behest of Mr Tan or

his wife Mdm Tang Lee Lee who must have thought that there was no evidence to catch them.

The sales representatives were of course doing as they were told.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">81.        As

for Mr Tan’s evidence, Mdm Tang sought to explain it away by saying that he had tried

to protect Kym and Rosalind and it was on information given by them (NE 148 line 9 to 14).

I did not accept this explanation. If he did not know their evidence was untrue, there was

no question of trying to protect them.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">82.        In

any event, I did not accept his feigned ignorance of the fact that OM leaflets had been

used.</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Interim Injunction Order dated 9

November 2000</font></p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">83.        The

Order of 29 September 2000 was subsequently replaced by another Order on 9 November 2000

which allowed Mr Tan to sell the items of furniture in question provided notices to

disclaim any association with Momentum Creations or OM were displayed.</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">16 February 2001</font></p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">84.        I

would add that even as late as 16 February 2001, an investigation revealed that a sales

representative of Mr Tan, one Jenny, whose full name is Tan Kwee Peng, was referring to a

sideboard and coffee table, sold at a St Louis exhibition booth at the Singapore Expo, as

OM’s design. These were the items similar to the ‘Catena’ and

‘Graves’ sideboard and coffee table respectively.</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Did De Angeli copy the OM design

of the four items of furniture?</font></p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">85.        As

I have said, the main evidence for Mr Tan came from his wife Tang Lee Lee. She was the

first witness for him.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">86.        She

claimed that the designs of the four items of furniture in question were not copied from

Momentum Creations and that the ideas for them were obtained from a perusal of various

brochures of other furniture and/or visits to overseas trade exhibitions. Furthermore, Mr

Tan and her took into account market trends and customer preferences as well as feedback

from their sales staff.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">87.        In

cross-examination, she identified which brochures she and Mr Tan had based their designs

for the sofas on and sought to elaborate as to how they came up with the designs.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">88.        Mr

Tan, who was in court when Mdm Tang gave her evidence, naturally echoed what she had said

when it was his turn to give evidence.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">89.        

However, I noted that at no time in the AEICs of Mr Tan or Mdm Tang did they identify the

specific brochures which were supposed to be the inspirational sources for the designs or

elaborate as to how they had come up with the designs.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">90.        

Secondly, although Desmond Lee of Nikon Furniture was identified as the manufacturer or

contractor of the two sofas in question for De Angeli (see Mdm Tang’s AEIC para 7),

he was not called to give evidence for De Angeli. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">91.        

Thirdly, no drawing or sketch of the sofas was produced in evidence for Mr Tan. According

to Mdm Tang, there was no drawing or sketch.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">92.        As

for the coffee table and sideboard in question, one Mr Teo of Tek Furniture was identified

as the manufacturer or contractor of these two items (see Mdm Tang’s AEIC para 12).

The full name of the contractor is Tek Furniture Contractor (see Mdm Tang’s AEIC p

391).</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">93.        Mdm

Tang mentioned that usually she would describe the furniture or do a sketch of the design

she had in mind. Mr Teo would then come up with the detailed designs and the actual

products (see Mdm Tang’s AEIC para 13). However for the coffee table or sideboard in

question, no sketch was provided to the contractor.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">94.        

Again, the contractor (for the coffee table and sideboard) was not called to give evidence

for De Angeli.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">95.        

Furthermore, for the design of the ‘Graves’ coffee table, Mr Tan said that he

saw the design in Milan and in China. He produced a brochure from Milan (Exhibit D17). He

said twice that he had received it before 1999.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">96.        The

top of the front cover of that brochure has the name ‘Ravarini Castoldi &amp;

C’. More significantly the bottom states, "Novita’ Aprile 2000".</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">97.        Mr

Tan agreed that the bottom date refers to April 2000. When the date was pointed out to

him, he refused to say that he had made a mistake. Instead he suggested that the brochure

must have been printed one year ahead.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">98.        I

did not accept this evidence. Even if the brochure was printed one year ahead, this would

be April 1999 but he had said that he had received it before 1999.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">99.        On

the part of Momentum Creations, their designer, one Adrian Chua was not called to give

evidence. However, Mr Lam of Momentum Creations offered twice to show the technical

drawings (NE 10 line 20 to 22 and NE 11 line 7) but his offer was not taken up by Ms Foo.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">100.        It

was clear to me that De Angeli had copied the designs of the four items of furniture from

the OM range of furniture. Whether Momentum Creations had themselves copied the furniture

from others is a separate matter.</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">What did the OM leaflets in the

folders show? </font></p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">101.        

Mdm Tang said that she was the one who had prepared the folders used by the sales

representatives and there were two folders with the leaflets in question. The folders

contain Exhibits P8, P9 and P28 (NE 144 line 10 to 18).</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">102.        

For Exhibit P8, she said that a customer may have left it in an exhibition booth so she

kept it.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">103.        

For Exhibit P9 and P28, she could not remember how she had obtained the leaflets.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">104.        I

did not accept Mdm Tang’s evidence on Exhibit P8. She had deliberately chosen to use

this leaflet and the others, P9 and P28, to push the sales of similar furniture by De

Angeli.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">105.        I

would give a brief description of the three leaflets.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">106.        

Exhibit P8 is a one-sided colour leaflet with the heading ‘Our Summer

Collection’. The OM mark is at the top right hand of the leaflet. The OM name and

showroom addresses and other particulars are stated at the bottom of the leaflet.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">107.        

Exhibit P9 is a one-sided colour leaflet also with the heading ‘Our Summer

Collection’. Like Exhibit P8, the OM mark is at the top right hand of the leaflet and

the OM name and showroom addresses and other particulars are stated at the bottom of the

leaflet.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">108.        

However, below the heading of Exhibit P9 are the following sentences:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">‘<b>You can’t help but

    love it</b>. <b>OM</b><i> is all about enjoying a quality living environment and the best

    thing in life … at <b>best prices!</b></i></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">With its budget friendly,

    value-for-design approach, we now offer you our <b>Summer Collection packages at

    irresistible prices!</b>’</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">109.        

Exhibits P8 and P9 show, inter alia, the ‘Case’ sofa and ‘Catena sideboard.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">110.        

Exhibit P28 is a double-sided colour leaflet. The top right hand on the front has the OM

mark.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">111.        On

the back, the address of the Marina showroom is stated in full but not the OM name.

Therefore, if one were to look at the back of this leaflet, one would not see the OM name.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">112.        

The back of Exhibit P28 shows, inter alia, the ‘Globe’ sofa and ‘Graves

coffee table.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">113.        In

the course of Mdm Tang’s oral evidence, she said that the OM mark at the top right

hand of each leaflet and the OM name and address at the bottom of Exhibits P8 and P9 were

not visible because she had either bent the top and the bottom or cut them.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">114.        

For Exhibit P28, her evidence was that the leaflet was placed facing downwards so that the

OM logo and the address on the front could not be seen unless the leaflet was taken out

and turned over. This evidence was correct and I need say no more about P28 for the time

being.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">115.        As

for Exhibits P8 and P9, Mr Samuel Chacko, for Momentum Creations, was content to adopt, in

his submission, the evidence of Mdm Tang as to how she had either bent or cut the top and

bottom of Exhibits P8 and P9. I was of the view that this was probably because he thought

it brought the facts closer to a case which he was relying on i.e <i>Bristol

Conservatories Ltd v Conservatories Custom Built Ltd</i> [1989] RPC 455.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">116.        Ms

Foo also urged me to accept this evidence. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">117.        

However, I was not prepared to accept such evidence.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">118.        

When the witnesses for Momentum Creations, including the private investigators, were

giving evidence, their evidence was along the line that Exhibits P8 and P9 had been shown

in their entirety by the sales representatives of De Angeli. There was no suggestion then

that the top or the bottom of either of these leaflets had been bent or cut off.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">119.        

Likewise, Ms Foo did not so much as query or suggest to any of these witnesses that the

top or the bottom of Exhibit P8 or P9 had been bent or cut off. Indeed, her questions were

along the line that it was obvious that the leaflets P8 and P9 were OM leaflets and the

NE 129 line 8).</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">120.        

Furthermore, as I have mentioned, for Exhibit P9, the OM name is also found below the

heading (see para 108 above) so that even if the top and bottom of Exhibit P9 had been

bent or cut off, there was still a reference to the OM name below the heading of ‘Our

Summer Collection’. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">121.        I

found that Mdm Tang had tried to be clever. She had viewed the video recordings and must

have realised that the OM mark at the top and the OM name and address at the bottom of

Exhibits P8 and P9 were not visible from the video recordings. However, she forgot that

the OM name also appeared below the heading of Exhibit P9 so that her story about bending

or cutting off the top and bottom did not help Mr Tan much.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">122.        

Besides, her evidence that the top and bottom had been cut off or bent did not make sense.

The very purpose of using the OM leaflets was to show potential customers the prices of OM

furniture and to lead them to believe that De Angeli’s was of the same quality and/or

from the same manufacturer or supplier, but yet cheaper. If the OM mark or name was not

visible, then this would defeat the purpose of using the OM leaflets in the first place.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">123.        

Even based on her version that these leaflets were used for comparison only, the

comparison would be meaningless if the potential customers did not know whose products

were being compared with De Angeli’s.</font></p>

    The first issue in the appeal is to passing off. ….</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">         

    Every passing-off case at common law involves two propositions, each of which must be

    established by a plaintiff before he can succeed. The first proposition is that the

    plaintiff has a legal right, in the nature of a monopoly: an exclusive right to a

    particular name for his goods or a particular trade description or a particular

    "get-up". In the present case the property – the reputation – claimed

    by the plaintiffs was in respect of the "get-up" of their Louis furniture,

    consisting of its appearance in shape, colour and fittings. The second proposition is that

    the defendant has infringed that right, by selling goods under a name or trade description

    or with a "get-up" which is likely to lead to confusion: which is likely to lead

    buyers to buy the defendant’s goods in the belief that they are the plaintiff’s

    goods.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">       

    It is clear from many authorities, and it has not been challenged on behalf of the

    plaintiffs in this appeal, that the question of confusion – the second proposition

    – does not arise unless and until the plaintiffs have established the reputation of

    the goods – the first proposition. That is something which is sometimes forgotten,

    and which the defendants submit may have been forgotten, or not correctly appreciated, by

    the learned judge in the represent case. That danger was emphasised by Lord Evershed M.R.

    in <i>Tavener Rutledge Ltd. V. Specters Ltd.</i> [1959] R.P.C. 355 at 362, where he said:</font></p>

      like this you sue for copyright, trade mark, and passing off, and regard the whole thing

      really as all turning on one and the same set of facts. That is not so. It was laid down

      many years ago that the first necessity for a plaintiff trying to make out a case of

      passing off is that he must establish that the particular get-up which he has been using

      has become associated exclusively with this business: what, in brief, is called

      reputation."’</font></p>

    successful passing off actions in England had usually, though not invariably, been at the

    particular name, mark or get-up, and who complained that the defendant was invading his

    right by using the name, mark or get-up to misrepresent his goods as those of the

    plaintiff. The exceptions were fully considered by Danckwerts J. in the champagne case.

    They were rather special cases in which by succession from a common author, or in

    consequence of some particular history of events, the right to use a name or description

    for their products was shared by two or more parties to the exclusion of the rest of the

    world. The champagne case was the first case in England that clearly accepted the

    principle that parties who did not have an exclusive right to use a particular trade name,

    but who were only some members of a class consisting of all those who had a right to use

    the name, were entitled to protect the name by a passing off action.’</font></p>

The most generally accepted definition of goodwill is the one formulated by Lord

Macnaghten in <i>IRC v Muller &amp; Co’s Margarine Ltd</i> [1901] AC 217. It was not

too long ago cited by Justice Prakash in <i>Future Enterprises Pte Ltd v Tong Seng Produce

Pte Ltd</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=45511&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1998] 1 SLR 1012</a> (‘<i>Future Enterprises’</i>):</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">‘What is goodwill? It is a

    thing very easy to describe, very difficult to define. It is the benefit and advantage of

    the good name, reputation and connection of a business. It is the attractive force which

    brings in custom. It is the one thing which distinguishes an old established business from

    a new business at its first start. The goodwill of a business must emanate from a

    particular centre or source. However widely extended or diffused its influence may be,

    goodwill is worth nothing unless it has power or attraction sufficient to bring customers

    home to the source from which it emanates.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">       

    Goodwill regarded as property has no meaning except in connection with some trade,

    business, or calling. In that connection I understand the word to include whatever adds

    value to a business by reason of situation, name and reputation, connection, introduction

    to old customers, and agreed absence from competition, or any of these things, and there

    may be others which do not occur to me. In this wide sense, goodwill is inseparable from

    the business to which it adds value, and, in my opinion, exists where the business is

    carried on. Such business may be carried on in one place or country or in several, and if

    in several there may be several business, each having a goodwill of its own (at pp 223

    – 224).</font></p>

Justice Prakash went on to observe:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">‘Several important elements

    of goodwill can be derived from the above passage. The first is that in order to have

    ie a trade and the observations I make are limited to that context. Second, goodwill is

    the power of attraction which draws the customers to buy the goods. The third element is

    that goodwill is territorial because it only exists where the trade exists.’</font></p>

<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">139.        Ms

<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">140.        Ms

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">‘Practically the only

    evidence that MacCoffee was available in the local market prior to October 1995 was the

    packaging for A MaxCoffee he was aware of the plaintiff’s product. That in itself,

    however, is insufficient to show that MacCoffee as such had acquired a certain goodwill or

    reputation in Singapore. Sporadic sales without any evidence of a certain level of local

    consumer/vendor awareness of the brand and its availability cannot in themselves

    constitute the acquisition of a reputation in Singapore.’</font></p>

</ol>
<p xmlns=""> </p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">141.        I

was of the view that this passage did not help De Angeli. It did not say that survey

evidence or trade evidence was necessary to establish goodwill. Secondly, that passage

must be read in the context that, in that case, there was no evidence of any advertisement

of the product for the Singapore market.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">142.        I

was of the view that it was not necessary for a survey to be adduced or evidence from the

trade to be adduced to establish goodwill. This was a matter of evidence and such evidence

could be adduced in various ways.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">143.        I

was also of the view that trading, however short, may be sufficient to establish goodwill

(see the judgment of Justice Selvam in <i>Alteco Chemical Pte Ltd v Chong Yean Wah</i>

<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">145.        In

the case before me, Momentum Creations had carried on business using the OM name from July

1999, if not earlier, and then started advertising the names of the four items of

furniture. The advertisements of the OM name and of the four items were not insignificant.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">146.        On

the other hand, Ms Foo submitted that Mr Tan also had his own advertisements. However the

evidence of the advertisements was in the form of numerous invoices from 1993 up to 14

June 1996. The invoices were addressed to St Louis Furniture. There was no evidence that

the advertisements were advertising any particular brand or that any names had been

attributed to individual items of furniture.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">147.        

According to Mdm Tang, Mr Tan did not place any other advertisement on his own because

after 14 June 1996, he had relied on advertisements of the landlords of the premises which

he was occupying. Likewise, for exhibitions, the organisers of such exhibitions would do

the advertising. However, again, there was no evidence that the advertisements of the

landlords or organisers were advertising any brand for Mr Tan’s furniture or any

particular names for individual items of furniture sold by him.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">148.        At

most, Mr Tan could claim only that he had acquired goodwill in the name St Louis Furniture

which was irrelevant to the case before me.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">149.        In

any event, the use of the OM leaflets by the sales representatives of De Angeli speaks for

itself. On this point, I find the case of <i>Bristol Conservatories,</i> which Mr Chacko

was relying on, helpful.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">150.        In

that case, the defendants’ salesmen showed prospective customers a portfolio of

photographs of the plaintiffs’ conservatories as if they were photographs of the

defendants’ design and workmanship. Nothing in the portfolio referred to the

plaintiffs.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">151.        

Ralph Gibson LJ said at p 465:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">‘… the goodwill was

</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">152.        In

my view, the fact that Mdm Tang had included the leaflets in the folders to be shown to

potential customers and the fact that De Angeli’s sales representatives had used the

leaflets demonstrated the goodwill in the OM name, as well as the names of the four items

of furniture.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">153.        

The claim of Momentum Creations was stronger than that of the plaintiffs in <i>Bristol

Conservatories </i>as here the leaflets contained the OM name and addresses.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">154.        In

addition, Mr Lam did produce evidence of sales, Exhibit P14, by Momentum Creations of the

two sofas in question from May to September 2000 but not for the period before or after.

Taking August 2000 as the cut-off month, the sales of these two sofas for the four month

period from May to August 2000 was $246,419 ($195,494 for 73 ‘Case’ L-shape

sofas at $2,678 each and $50,925 for 15 ‘Globe’ L-shape sofas at $3,395 each).</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">155.        I

was of the view that Momentum Creations had established goodwill in the OM name, as well

as the names of the four items, even though the value of the goodwill may not be as much

as they would like me to believe. That is why Mr Lam adduced evidence of sales by Momentum

Creations of the two sofas for five months only i.e from May to September 2000. I inferred

that the sales for previous and subsequent months were not as good. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">156.        

However, the existence of goodwill should not be confused with the value of the goodwill. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">157.        I

was also of the view that the goodwill in OM belonged to Momentum Creations exclusively

and the goodwill in the names for the four items also belonged to Momentum Creations

exclusively, but only in relation to these four items.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">158.        As

for Ms Foo’s argument that the Statement of Claim had alleged goodwill in the mark OM

only but not in ‘Case’, ‘Globe’, ‘Catena’ and

‘Graves’, I was of the view that this was not fatal to the Plaintiffs’

claim. The four names did not exist separately from the OM mark as they were marketed

under the OM mark. </font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Misrepresentation/Misleading</font></p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">159.        I

was also satisfied that the use of the leaflets was intended to and did misrepresent to

the public that the four items of furniture sold by De Angeli were of the same quality as

those of OM and/or that the manufacturers or suppliers of these items sold by De Angeli

and OM were the same.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">160.        

Secondly, the misrepresentation was not confined to just the showing of the leaflets but

by active representations from sales representatives such as Rosalind (on 23 September

2000) and Kym (on 27 September 2000).</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">161.        

Although Rosalind tried to be more careful in that she had said that De Angeli’s

manufacturers were not the same as OM’s, the thrust of her representation was that

the quality was the same when it was not.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">162.        

Kym’s misrepresentation, as set out in the transcript I have cited in para 66 above,

was more obvious.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">163.        

Thirdly, it will also be recalled that on 1 October 2000, Rosalind issued an invoice using

the name ‘Case’ to describe the sofa sold.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">164.        I

would add that there were other De Angeli invoices issued to customers, in Exhibit D14,

which used the names ‘Case’ and ‘Globe’.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">165.        

The names ‘Case’, ‘Globe’, ‘Catena’ and ‘Graves’

used for the four items sold by De Angeli had been taken from the names used by Momentum

Creations. Indeed, none of the witnesses for De Angeli pretended that it was otherwise. To

me, this was to further the misrepresentation.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">166.        I

was aware that I should not find Mr Tan liable if all he was guilty of was puff which is

not uncommon in such a trade. However, in my view, he had gone beyond mere puff.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">167.

<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">172.        

The situation was not one of isolated instances of misrepresentation by foolish salesgirls

who did not know better, as Ms Foo would have me believe.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">173.        Ms

Foo also pointed out that other retailers were selling furniture similar to the four

items. However, there was no evidence before me that these retailers took the steps that

De Angeli’s representatives did.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">174.        In

the instance of L-shape sofas, some of the retailers even used different names like

‘Dandy’ or ‘Monoca’.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">175.        

The many cases that Ms Foo cited did not help De Angeli as each case must be considered on

its particular facts.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">176.        

However, I should mention two of the cases which she relied on.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">177.        

The first is <i>Wertheimer v Stewart, Cooper &amp; Co</i> [1906] Reports of Patent, Design

and Trade Mark Cases Vol XXIII No 22, 481. At p 482, Kekewich J said:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">‘This case is a peculiar

    one. The Plaintiff has invented or adopted a peculiar mode of advertisement for his goods

    – an advertisement which goes beyond the ordinary objects of advertisements, because

    it offers a premium to those who sell his goods, in the form of a prize, provided they

    sell a certain quantity of seeds at a certain price. The Defendant is struck by the

    ingenuity of this form of advertisement, and he adopts the same method, as he is entitled

    to. But he goes further than that. He thinks the Plaintiff’s language so good that he

    actually adopts that language. Now it cannot be too often said that the Court does not sit

    to consider whether, according to any high standard of honour, things ought to be allowed

    or not. The Court only sits to consider in these cases whether there has been any

    deviation, from the strict path of honesty, which is reached by law – whether there

    has been in any way any tampering with business or property, taking "business"

    as a description of "property". Probably those who listened to this case will

    not give the Defendant credit for very good taste in not only following the

    Plaintiff’s method of advertisement, but in actually copying his language, and, still

    further, not only copying his language, but adopting the embellishments of his language,

    which are striking and have been copied to the very last particular. But unless that

    injures the Plaintiff in his property it seems to me to be wholly immaterial in a Court of

    law. Now, how does it injures his property. What is his property? He has no property in

    the advertisement. Of course he does not claim it as copyright. He has property in his

    goods; in any character by which is goods are known; in any distinguishing device or name;

    and he has the right also to protect his own name. None of these things, as it seems to

    me, does the Defendant at all offend against, so that the Court can, in any way, reach

    him.’</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">178.        

However the facts in that case, which involved an application for an injunction which was

refused, were quite different from those before me. They are summarised in the headnote:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">‘The Plaintiff had devised a

    novel but unregistered scheme of advertising the sale of his packets of garden seeds by

    inserting in numerous newspapers a "stereotyped" combination of lengthy

    letterpress surrounded by pictures of objects, any one of which he offered as a premium to

    purchasers. The Defendant issued advertisements in precisely similar form, including the

    pictures and the arrangement, excepting that he substituted a <u>new </u>name for the

    seeds and a slightly different condition for earning the premium, and put <u>his trading

    name</u> at the foot of the advertisements.’</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">[Emphasis added.]</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">179.        

Next, Ms Foo relied on <i>G. Hensher Ltd v Restawhile Ltd</i> [1973] 1 WLR 144 where

Graham J said at p 150/H:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">‘Now in the present case,

    reviewing the evidence which was called, I do not think that the plaintiffs have

    established sufficiently strongly that the shape of their articles is so well known

    amongst members of the public in contrast to members of the trade as to justify me in

    holding that there is likely to be confusion amongst a substantial number of such members

    of the public. Chairs and settees are not normally bought by members of the public for the

    reason that they are the goods of a particular manufacturer; they are bought because the

    buyers like the shape, the comfort or the look, having regard also to the particular price

    of the suite in question, and the choice is quite regardless of who made them.’</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">180.        I

did not think this passage was applicable as Momentum Creations were not relying on the

similarity of shape alone to establish passing off.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">181.        In

addition, while I agreed that furniture is bought because the buyers like the shape, the

comfort or the look, having regard also to the price, I did not think that the name or

brand was irrelevant to such buyers.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">182.        At

the end of the day, Ms Foo’s submission was also telling. In p 16 of her Reply to

Plaintiffs’ Written Submissions, she said,</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">‘… The OM name and

    Plaintiff’s address were not shown [on the leaflets in question] as to show them

    would mean the Defendant was passing off the Defendant’s products as the

    Plaintiff’s.’</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">183.        As

I have said, the OM mark and the OM name and addresses were shown on the leaflets in

question.</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Damage </font></p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">184.        In

<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Summary</font></p>

<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">185.        

Accordingly, I found that the allegation of passing off had been made out and I granted

judgment in the following terms:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">‘1. An injunction is hereby

</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">186.        

The terms of the judgment took into account the fact that not every sale of the four items

was necessarily the result of passing off.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">187.        I

included sales under St Louis Furniture in the terms because Mr Tan had used that name

interchangeably with De Angeli.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">188.        I

also included sales under Nicoletti Furnishing in the terms because the evidence showed

that after the first interim injunction order on 29 September 2000, Mdm Tang sold the four

items under Nicoletti Furnishing between 7 to 15 October 2000 at an exhibition. Although

this entity was set up by her, her own evidence was that she was selling the same items in

question under this name because she thought they could not be sold under the De Angeli

name in view of the first interim injunction order.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">189.        As

for costs, Momentum Creations was granted 95% costs because they had also relied on the

cause of action known as malicious falsehood, but withdrew this claim only at submission

stage.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">190.        

The second interlocutory injunction order dated 7 November 2000 was discharged as it was

replaced by the injunction under my judgment.</font></p>
