</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font color="#800000"><strong><u>GROUNDS OF DECISION</u></strong></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">1.        The accused is a male aged

42. He was charged with three counts of rape against his step-daughter (referred to herein

as "<i>A</i>", to preserve anonymity) presently aged 13. The offences were

committed between early 2000 and late 2001. <i>A</i> testified that the accused first

molested her on 22 August 1999. Subsequently, the accused molested and raped her on three

separate occasions. The first was in early 2000, the second at the end of 2000, and the

last occasion on 21 September 2001. She was able<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="4"> </font>to recall this last date because that was when she experienced

menstruation for the first time.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">2.        The accused is the second

husband of <i>A's</i> mother (referred to herein as "<i>B</i>" to preserve A's

anonymity). He had two children by his first wife whom he had since divorced. <i>A</i> is

the only child of <i>B</i>. <i>B</i> had since borne a son by the accused. The rapes

became known after <i>B</i> found a love note in the accused's bag. The note was written

by the accused and addressed to <i>A</i>. <i>B</i>, being illiterate, asked her daughter

to read the note to her. The daughter only said that it was a note about her (<i>A</i>). <i>B</i>

then asked her neighbour N to translate the note to her. After that <i>B </i>confronted <i>A</i>

and eventually, the history of rape and molest was revealed. <i>B</i> then lodged a

complaint to the police against the accused. The accused was arrested in his flat on 18

April 2002.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3.        Dr. Codelia Han testified

that A was no longer <i>virgo intacta </i>and that it was consistent with a history of

previous sexual intercourse. The prosecution also led evidence of a note written by the

accused in Malay to his wife acknowledging that he had done wrong and asking for

forgiveness. Evidence was also led, from N, in respect of <i>A</i> telling N that she had

been touched by her step-father, but had asked N not to disclose this to <i>B</i>. SI Mohd

Bakhtiar testified that when he arrested the accused, the accused said that he already

knew why the police had come for him. He had also admitted that he had molested his

step-daughter. Three cautioned statements in respect of each of the charges were adduced

in evidence by the prosecution. The statements were short, and in them, the accused

acknowledged the offence charged, and asked for leniency. He had also confessed to the

rapes in his statement to the investigating officer under s 121(1) of the Criminal

Procedure Code recorded on 24 April 2002. A short oral statement made to the investigating

officer and subsequently recorded in the officer's field diary was also adduced in

evidence. In this statement the accused denied penetrating <i>A</i> and said that he had

only rubbed his penis against her vulva, a stand he maintained throughout the trial. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4.        The accused was not

represented by counsel. He challenged the admissibility of all his confessions on the

ground that the recording officer threatened that he would be locked away for a long time

if he did not tell the truth. Secondly, he was promised the opportunity of seeing his wife

and son after he had given his statement. Finally, he charged that in any event, he never

confessed to rape but only to molest. I am of the view that none of the allegations above

raised any reasonable doubt as to the voluntary nature of the statements. The statements

were, according, admitted in evidence. In any event, I find that the substantive evidence

against the accused was the oral testimony of <i>A</i>. In that regard, I am satisfied

that she was a sufficiently mature and reliable witness. There were moments of confusion

during her cross-examination, but when they were clarified, I found them to be consistent

and reliable. I am satisfied that <i>A</i>’s evidence that the accused had penetrated

her was truthful and that she was fully aware of what her evidence meant.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5.        The accused elected to

give evidence when I called upon his defence. His main plank was that he did not penetrate<i>

A</i>, but had only rubbed his penis against her vulva. He also tried to show that <i>A</i>

had consented to the acts and was a willing participant. He insinuated that <i>A </i>made

the allegations of rape because she was afraid of her mother. I find in none of these

assertions any material to raise a reasonable doubt in my mind. I was therefore satisfied

that the prosecution had proved its case against the accused, and I accordingly convicted

him of the three charges upon which he was tried before me.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6.        The DPP brought my

attention to a list of previous offences upon which the accused was convicted. They

comprised traffic offences and drug related offences. In mitigation the accused merely

pleaded remorse, and appealed for forgiveness and leniency - both appeals arriving a

trifle late. The accused consented to having the remaining six charges for molest taken

into consideration for purposes of sentencing. After hearing the DPP's address on sentence

and the matters raised by the accused I sentenced him to 12 years imprisonment and 12

strokes of the cane in respect of each of the three charges. The sentence of imprisonment

in respect of the first and fifth charges would run concurrently with effect from the date

of his arrest, namely 18 April 2002. The sentence of imprisonment in respect of the eighth

charge shall run consecutively from that of the first and fifth charges. The total number

of strokes of the cane shall not exceed 24 as stipulated under the CPC.</p>
