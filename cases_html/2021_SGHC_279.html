The Defendants pointed to Clause 6(c) which required execution of the broker’s contract by BGC’s representative to constitute a binding and enforceable agreement. It was not disputed that the agreements Warner gave to Yap and Sun to sign were undated and unsigned by BGC’s designated representative.

Rather, by appending their signatures, Yap and Sun had indicated their offers to be employed by BGC, which would have to be formally accepted by BGC by the operation of Clause 6(c) which prescribed a specific mode of acceptance by BGC, before the agreements could be valid and binding.

BGC (through Mr Mark Webster’s words and conduct) breached an implied term of mutual trust and confidence during a meeting with Sun in or around December 2015, which breach was accepted by Sun at the material time or by 31 December 2015 at the latest, thereby bringing the employment agreement to an end that day.

There are two distinct but closely intertwined issues crucial to the finding of whether there were valid and binding contracts between BGC and Yap and/or Sun. The first issue was that of acceptance, and the second related issue was whether the acceptance (on the part of BGC vis-à-vis Shaun Lynn’s execution of the contracts) was effectively communicated to the brokers. The general rule is that communication of acceptance is required for a valid and binding contract to exist, as stated in <span class="font-italic">Chitty on Contracts</span> (H G Beale gen ed) (Sweet and Maxwell, 33rd Ed, 2018) (“<span class="font-italic">Chitty</span>”) at 2-044:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">General requirement of communication</span> The general rule is that an acceptance has no legal effect until it is communicated to the offeror. Accordingly, no contract is concluded by: a person who writes an acceptance on a piece of paper which he simply keeps; a company that resolves to accept an application for shares but does not communicate the resolution to the applicant; a person who decides to accept an offer to sell goods to him and instructs his bank to pay the offeror but neither he nor the bank gives notice of this fact to the offeror; and a person who communicates the acceptance only to his own agent. <span class="font-italic">The main reason for the rule is that it would be unfair to bind the offeror before he knows that his offer had been accepted. So long as the offeror knows of the acceptance, a contract may be concluded even though the acceptance was not brought to his notice by the offeree. However, there will be no contract if the communication is made by a third party without the offeree’s authority in circumstances indicating that the offeree’s decision to accept was not yet regarded by him as irrevocable. </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Acceptance</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 As noted by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Gay Choon Ing v </span><span class="font-italic">Loh Sze Ti Terence Peter and another appeal</span> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 332 (“<span class="font-italic">Gay Choon Ing</span>”) at [47], at its core, acceptance “is a final and unqualified expression of assent to the terms of an offer”, citing Edwin Peel, <span class="font-italic">Treitel</span><span class="font-italic">: The Law of Contract</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 12th Ed, 2007) at para 2-015.

</div>
</div> the alleged act of ratification referred to by BGC was Shaun Lynn’s signing of the agreements. This did not in any way confirm or affirm the actions or communication emanating from Warner, and was in fact the very act of BGC complying with Clause 6(c) itself. BGC relied on the case of <span class="font-italic">Bolton</span> as its sole authority on the point of ratification. As the Defendants rightly pointed out, <span class="font-italic">Bolton</span> is highly controversial and has been criticised (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, in <span class="font-italic">Fleming v Bank of New Zealand</span> [1900] AC 577 at 587; <span class="font-italic">Davison v Vickery</span><span class="font-italic">’s Motors Limited</span> (1925) 37 CLR 1 at 18–19; <span class="font-italic">Hughes v NM Superannuation Pty Limited</span> (1993) 11 ACLC 923 at 930). Leaving aside the controversies surrounding <span class="font-italic">Bolton</span>, I was unable to see how BGC’s subsequent procurement of Shaun Lynn’s signature would amount to a form of ratification of Warner’s purported “offer” of employment on BGC’s behalf.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Having regard to Clause 6(c), the agreements properly construed and implemented would require Shaun Lynn’s endorsement to signify BGC’s <span class="font-italic">final and unqualified</span> approval, and not merely by way of rubberstamping Warner’s “offer” of employment. The fact that the endorsement was only procured <span class="font-italic">after</span> Yap and Sun had signed in both instances would point strongly to the conclusion that when Yap and Sun appended their signatures, they were the ones making the offer to BGC, as the Defendants had contended. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 I emphasise that this conclusion is not as “unorthodox” as BGC had made it out to be. Neither does it fail to accord with a common-sense commercial view or with the “reasonable expectations of … honest sensible business people”, adopting the language that BGC had drawn on from <span class="font-italic">Reveille Independent LLC v </span><span class="font-italic">Anotech International (UK) Ltd</span> [2016] EWCA Civ 443 (“<span class="font-italic">Reveille</span>”) at [53]. It is entirely reasonable and indeed to be expected that BGC should have taken care to act in accordance with the terms of its own contractual documents and to have made offers to contract in a manner compliant and consistent with those terms.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Clause 6(c) was also not a contingent condition precedent. It is artificial for BGC to suggest that a contract may have been entered into but can be dissected or made “severable” so to speak to two stages, according to when it is “valid” first and thereafter “binding and enforceable”. A contract that is validly made should ordinarily also be binding at the same time. It hardly makes sense to speak of a contract that is valid but not yet binding, although I accept that in certain specific circumstances, it may be contemplated that the parties intend for enforceability to be contingent on some other event or action. Unless the parties’ intentions in agreeing to such a form of severance are clearly and unambiguously set out in writing, the court should be slow to infer or impute such an intention. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 On a plain construction, Clause 6(c) speaks of both the “binding and enforceable” nature of the contract becoming operative only when executed by the designated representative. It plainly sets out what BGC ought to have done for firm agreements to be concluded – the agreement(s) had to be executed by its designated representative. Notably, the agreements were both unsigned and undated at the time Yap and Sun signed them. The more reasonable inference is that these constituted Yap’s and Sun’s offers to be employed by BGC, which would have to be accepted by BGC through the requisite execution by Shaun Lynn. On my construction of Clause 6(c), this was BGC’s prescribed mode of acceptance. Unexecuted agreements were presented to Yap and Sun as prospective employees who were asked to append their signatures first. This construction is bolstered by the last paragraph of the agreements, which specify that “one copy of each [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Contract and the attached Terms &amp; Conditions] will be returned to [them] after signature of the Contract on behalf of the [BGC] …”.

</div> If Warner’s explanation was to be believed, it would appear that he was either not familiar with BGC’s own documented terms or had blithely chosen to ignore them, and had erroneously assumed that he had full actual or apparent authority to hire brokers on BGC’s behalf, without needing to comply with Clause 6(c). This is not consistent with the clear language of Clause 6(c), which affirms that Yap’s and Sun’s signatures and handshakes with Warner would not suffice in and of themselves to seal the contracts. Clause 6(c) does not contemplate that contracts will be formed through such means. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Accordingly, I found that the Defendants were justified in submitting that BGC itself regarded Shaun Lynn’s signature as a prescribed mode of acceptance before any valid, binding and enforceable contracts could be said to exist. On the facts, it appeared from the available documentary evidence that the contracts signed by Yap and Sun were sent for Shaun Lynn’s signature (and execution) on 15 July 2015

</div> it was not seriously pursued by either counsel for each of the Defendants at trial or in submissions that Shaun Lynn had not in fact signed and executed the contracts before they were returned to the brokers, after they had made known their intention not to join BGC. I was thus of the view that on a balance of probabilities, the contracts would have to be accepted as per the prescribed mode of acceptance as set out in Clause 6(c), and were in fact accepted by BGC (albeit not at the time when Yap and Sun had signed the agreement(s)). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 At this juncture, I turn to address BGC’s argument that “a contract can be formed by agreement of parties even if parties do not sign.”

</div>
</div> BGC cites the case of <span class="font-italic">Reveille</span> for this proposition. In <span class="font-italic">Reveille</span>, Anotech which was a company marketing home cookware and Reveille, a corporation producing television programmes (such as MasterChef US), had engaged in discussions to feature Anotech’s cookware on MasterChef US. In the course of negotiations, Reveille had sent a contract to Anotech on Reveille’s standard form, with one of the terms stating that the contract “shall not be binding on Reveille until executed by both Licensee [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Anotech] and Reveille”. What ensued was what would conventionally be described as a battle of forms, as well as some concerns over the use of the phrase “The Master Chef” by Gordon Ramsay who was the main presenter of the show. Eventually, Anotech’s director had signed the contract and returned a copy to Reveille, however Reveille did not sign on the said contract. Notwithstanding its failure to sign the contract, Reveille proceeded to feature Anotech’s products on MasterChef US and billed Anotech. When Anotech failed to pay, Reveille repudiated the contract, but Anotech raised the argument that the contract was not binding as Reveille had failed to sign it. Mr Justice Cranston, delivering the judgment of the court, held that as the clause setting out the prescribed mode of acceptance was for Reveille’s benefit it could waive it, provided that there was no prejudice to Anotech. It was also held that “there were clear and unequivocal acts on Reveille’s part, which Anotech knew about, to constitute acceptance by conduct…[c]onduct after 12 March 2011 does not go to acceptance by Reveille of Anotech’s offer but is evidence that the parties believed that there was a binding contract in place” (at [45] –[47]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 In my view, <span class="font-italic">Reveille</span> is distinguishable from the present case and was of no assistance to BGC. First, in <span class="font-italic">Reveille</span> at [45], it was found that even though Reveille had failed to sign the contract as stipulated, Reveille had demonstrated clear and unequivocal acts towards the fulfilment of the contract which would show actual acceptance by conduct. I was not persuaded that there was such communication by conduct as submitted by BGC, simply because Warner had sent Sun some Facebook messages to “effectively” convey to him the allegedly binding effect of the agreements. Second, while the court in <span class="font-italic">Reveille</span> had found that the signature requirement was waived by Reveille, as I will explain below at [48], a waiver as to the prescribed mode of acceptance only deals with the formality of complying with that specific mode, and acceptance still has to be communicated to the offeror in order for a binding contract to be in place. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Effective communication of acceptance </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 As stated at [25] above, in order for acceptance to have legal effect, it must have been effectively communicated to the counterparty.

</div> actually concerned facts which were analogous to those in the present case. In <span class="font-italic">Robophone</span>, the plaintiff, a distributor of a telephone answering machine, offered a machine on hire-purchase to Mr Blank, the defendant. The rental agreement included a clause stating that the agreement would only become binding on acceptance by signature on the part of the plaintiff. The rental agreement was signed by the defendant and the plaintiff only signed it sometime thereafter, although the plaintiff’s representative did call the defendant to fill in additional forms applying for consent to install the machine. On appeal, the majority decision comprising Lord Diplock and Lord Harman found that a binding contract had subsisted even though the plaintiff had failed to comply with the acceptance clause, as the issue of failure to communicate acceptance was not raised in the defendant’s pleadings, and in any event it was held that the plaintiff’s representative’s call to the defendant had to signify to the defendant that the contract was accepted (<span class="font-italic">Robophone</span> at 1438 and 1441). However, Lord Denning in his dissent stated at 1432: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is clear that that document, although called an agreement, was only an offer. It could be revoked by Mr. Blank at any time before it was accepted by the plaintiffs: see <span class="font-italic">Financings Ltd. v. Stimson</span>. In order to become binding, someone duly authorised would have to sign it as accepted on behalf of the plaintiffs: and, moreover, their acceptance would have to be communicated to Mr. Blank. The general rule undoubtedly is that, when an offer is made, it is necessary, in order to make a binding contract, not only that it should be accepted but that the acceptance should be notified: see <span class="font-italic">Carlill v. Carbolic Smoke Ball Co</span>., per Lindley L.J.; <span class="font-italic">Entores Ltd. v. Miles Far East Corporation</span>, per Parker L.J. Clause 14 does not dispense with the necessity of notification. <span class="font-italic">Signing without notification is not enough. It would be deplorable if it were. The plaintiffs</span><span class="font-italic"> would be able to keep the form in their office unsigned, and then play fast and loose as they pleased.</span> Mr. Blank would not know whether or not there was a contract binding them to supply or him to take. Just as mental acceptance is not enough: <span class="font-italic">Felthouse</span><span class="font-italic"> v. Bindley</span>, nor is internal acceptance within the company's office. In this very case we know that the plaintiffs signed it sometime or other (for it was produced at the trial complete with signature), but we do not know when the plaintiffs signed it. No evidence was given on the point. In the circumstances I think that until the plaintiffs notified Mr. Blank of their acceptance, the agreement was not complete. It was, in the words of Mr. Blank himself, provisional.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38  In my view, Lord Denning’s remarks as highlighted above were but an alternate expression of the commercial uncertainty which would prejudice the offeror who would not be able to know for certain if he was or was not bound by the agreement. For completeness, I note that the court in <span class="font-italic">Reveille</span> at [44] had acknowledged this possible outcome, although it was clear in that case from the subsequent conduct of the parties in performing the contract (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, by Reveille featuring Anotech’s cookware on the show, and Reveille asking Anotech where to post the invoices) that the acceptance had already been effectively communicated by Reveille to Anotech. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 In the present case, it did not appear from the evidence that there was any effective communication whatsoever of BGC’s acceptance. It was undisputed that no copies of the fully executed and dated agreements were conveyed to Yap and Sun until after they had informed BGC that they would be remaining at ICAP. BGC further contended that since Clause 6(c) merely laid down a condition precedent, no further express communication was in fact necessary. I was not persuaded by this contention. As noted at [31] above, the last paragraph of the employment agreements <span class="font-italic">expressly</span> required that BGC would return them copies after the designated representative’s signature on behalf of BGC had been obtained. For reasons which were not fully articulated and explained at trial, BGC did not do so until shortly after Yap and Sun informed BGC that they would not be joining them. It was not open to BGC to argue that Yap and Sun themselves could and should have ascertained whether the alleged condition precedent in Clause 6(c) had been fulfilled. Equally, BGC could not maintain that no communication of its fulfilment was necessary. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Warner was the only person from BGC in contact with Yap and Sun until they received letters from BGC’s solicitors. He admitted that he did not know if the agreements were in fact signed by Shaun Lynn, when they would have been signed, and if the agreements were in fact returned to either Yap or Sun after they were signed.

The fact that ICAP gave Yap and Sun indemnities against potential liability was a neutral point; it did not point unequivocally to the Defendants’ acknowledgment that valid and binding agreements were in place and were potentially being breached.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Accordingly, I held that BGC had <span class="font-italic">not</span> effectively communicated its acceptance of Yap’s and Sun’s offers, even though Shaun Lynn may have signed at some subsequent point to signify acceptance. Hence there were no valid and binding contracts in place in late September 2015 when Yap and Sun informed Warner that they would not be joining BGC. This would also explain why Sun was continuing to negotiate his remuneration package with Warner even after signing the agreement on 24 June 2015.

</div> in renegotiating his package, he certainly did not tell him so or express any incredulity in responding to Sun’s messages.

The first was that Clause 6(c) was a condition precedent which had been fulfilled when Shaun Lynn’s signature was procured. In the alternative, Clause 6(c) was waived by BGC (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, no signature was required on BGC’s part).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 In this regard, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Ng Chee Weng v Lim Jit Ming Bryan</span> [2012] 1 SLR 457 at [36] has stated that “while a party has the right to plead inconsistent rights in the alternative, the alternatives cannot offend common sense and justice”. This was recently affirmed by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Liberty Sky Investments Ltd v Aesthetic Medical Partners Pte Ltd and other appeals and another matter</span> [2020] 1 SLR 606 (“<span class="font-italic">Liberty Sky</span>”) at [28]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 I accepted the Defendants’ submission that BGC could not rely on these as alternative arguments. They are binary propositions with different factual premises. A waiver would simply mean that there was no requirement to follow up with compliance with Clause 6(c). It would follow that if BGC’s waiver argument was to be accepted, one would expect that there would be no execution of the documents in compliance with Clause 6(c). But on the objective evidence, there was in fact no waiver since Shaun Lynn proceeded to execute the documents by signing in accordance with Clause 6(c). This fact would be more consistent with BGC allegedly having treated Clause 6(c) as a condition precedent (although I have rejected this argument at [30] above). As such, I did not see how the alternative arguments could be countenanced given that BGC was relying on facts in support of either argument that were plainly contradictory. Whilst the court will afford a party the maximum latitude to state its case, there are limits to the extent two inconsistent cases can be run, such as when the party has <span class="font-italic">actual</span> knowledge of which alternative is true (<span class="font-italic">Liberty Sky</span> at [28]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Could BGC have waived Clause 6(c) unilaterally?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 BGC argued that, in the alternative, Clause 6(c), which was for its sole benefit, could have been and was waived by BGC.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 First, I did not accept that BGC could have unilaterally waived Clause 6(c) as the term does not exist solely for BGC’s benefit. Rather, it ought to be construed as a term that affects both parties and is open to both parties to rely upon for a definitive understanding of when the agreements would be regarded as “binding and enforceable”. As stated by the UK Supreme Court in <span class="font-italic">RTS Flexible Systems Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Molkerei Alois Muller GmbH &amp; Co KG (UK Production) </span>[2010] 1 WLR 753 at [50], “the governing criterion [of contract formation] is the reasonable expectations of honest sensible businessmen” (see also <span class="font-italic">Reveille</span> at [42]). In other words, whether a term is construed to exist solely for the benefit of one party or both parties has to be considered in light of what would have been commercially sensible. In my view, in light of the not insignificant remuneration terms, Clause 6(c) would have allowed BGC the leeway to confirm that it indeed wanted to hire the brokers on those stated terms, and would also have signalled to the brokers that their hiring on those terms had been approved and they were no longer allowed to “bargain” for better terms with BGC or ICAP for that matter (see [54] – [55] below). This would have been the reasonable expectation of both parties; to regard Clause 6(c) as being for the sole benefit of BGC would be prejudicial to Yap and Sun’s ability to know when their employment with BGC was confirmed. In this regard, I would also make the observation that while employer-employee relationships often involve a disparity in bargaining power (see <span class="font-italic">Man Financial (S) Pte Ltd (formerly known as E D &amp; F Man International (S) Pte Ltd) v Wong Bark </span><span class="font-italic">Chuan David</span> [2008] 1 SLR(R) 663 at [48]; <span class="font-italic">Smile Inc Dental Surgeons Pte Ltd v Lui Andrew Stewart</span> [2012] 4 SLR 308 at [20]), neither Yap nor Sun raised the argument that there was such a disparity. In the present analysis, I had proceeded on the presumption that parties were on an equal footing when negotiating the respective employment offers. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Second, it was not disputed that the executed agreements were undated when BGC received them with Shaun Lynn’s signatures. BGC had provided no clarity on exactly when or by whom they were dated. Clause 1(a) stipulates that the provisions of the agreement come into effect on “the date hereof” but Warner had “no idea when, by who” the dates were filled in.

</div> I agreed with the Defendants that in the circumstances, an adverse inference should be drawn against BGC to the effect that the dates were more likely only filled in <span class="font-italic">after</span> BGC realised its failure to follow up on the documentation with Yap and Sun <span class="font-italic">ie</span> after BGC was informed that Yap and Sun would not be joining them. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Third, even if Clause 6(c), properly construed, was for the sole benefit of BGC, any waiver of the clause would not in itself have constituted acceptance of the contracts. As stated in <span class="font-italic">Reveille</span> at [41], “where signature as the prescribed mode of acceptance is intended for the benefit of the offeree, <span class="font-italic">and the offeree accepts in some other way</span>, that should be treated as effective unless it can be shown that the failure to sign has prejudiced the offeror” [emphasis added]. In other words, even if BGC had waived the requirement of Shaun Lynn’s signature, it needed to show both Yap and Sun that it had accepted the contract. Such acceptance can be in the form of the offeree’s conduct, as in the case of <span class="font-italic">Reveille</span> (see above at [38]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Fourth, following from my views as stated at [38] above on the commercial uncertainty arising from the offeror not knowing when he would or would not be bound, I was of the view that allowing BGC to unilaterally waive Clause 6(c) without more would also be considered prejudicial to both Yap and Sun. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Fifth, I should add that if BGC could unilaterally waive Clause 6(c) and did waive it, the purported waiver was invalid. BGC had not complied with Clause 18.3 of BGC’s standard terms and conditions (as incorporated into the contracts) which provides that any waiver of the employment agreement must be “in writing signed by the waiving party”. While BGC argued that a no-oral modification clause only raises a rebuttable presumption that in the absence of an agreement in writing there would be no variation (see <span class="font-italic">Comfort Management Pte Ltd v OGSP Engineering Pte Ltd </span>[2018] 1 SLR 979 at [89] – [90]; <span class="font-italic">Charles Lim Teng Siang and another v Hong Choon </span><span class="font-italic">Hau and another </span>[2021] 2 SLR 153 (“<span class="font-italic">Charles Lim</span>”) at [60] –[61]), it relied solely on the conduct of Warner as evidence that such waiver had occurred.

As can be observed from <span class="font-italic">Malik v Bank of Credit and Commerce International SA (in compulsory liquidation)</span> [1998] AC 20 at 47, the ambit of the term is very wide and “[t]he implied obligation extends to any conduct by the employer likely to destroy or seriously damage the relationship of trust and confidence between employer and employee.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 I pause here to add a caveat: there is at best only <span class="font-italic">implicit </span>acceptance in <span class="font-italic">Wee Kim San</span> of the applicability of the implied term of mutual trust and confidence. Whether the principle will be definitively endorsed as being applicable in Singapore remains to be seen, as the issue has not yet arisen squarely for determination by the Court of Appeal. The parties’ submissions before me proceeded on the common ground that it has been accepted to be part of Singapore law, at least on the basis of High Court decisions such as <span class="font-italic">Cheah Peng Hock v </span><span class="font-italic">Luzhou Bio-Chem Technology Ltd</span> [2013] 2 SLR 577, and I assumed that to be the case for present purposes in making the following observations <span class="font-italic">obiter</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 I did not think that there was any repudiatory breach of an implied term of mutual trust and confidence on BGC’s part as alleged by the Defendants.

Even if the statements were made, notwithstanding Webster’s denials, it did not seem credible that Sun had genuinely felt threatened. It would appear that he felt more irate than intimidated. At any rate, he did not feel compelled to accede to Webster’s alleged threats. He stood his ground and told Webster at the end of the meeting that he would not join BGC.

Assuming that there were valid and binding agreements in place, in deciding not to join BGC, Yap and Sun themselves could already be said to have been in repudiatory breach, tantamount to a breach of mutual trust and confidence on their part. Irrespective of whether BGC had accepted their breach, it was not logical to assert that Webster subsequently was guilty of another breach of mutual trust and confidence, when the substratum of trust and confidence no longer remained. For there to be a breach of mutual trust and confidence, there must be <span class="font-italic">no reasonable cause or proper cause</span> for the employer act in the way it did.

Up until the trial, there was no indication from the pleadings or elsewhere that BGC would be claiming damages pegged to 48 months of “lost” employment due to Yap and Sun’s failure to join them. Their primary pleaded claim was based on the LD clause. However, by the time the trial commenced, BGC appeared to concede that the LD clause was not operative and the LD formula which formed the basis of BGC’s primary pleaded case on damages was unworkable, since BGC had no Peso NDF desk at the material time to peg as a benchmark. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 While I accepted that BGC had not completely omitted mention of this alternative claim in the lead-up to the trial, its belated attempt to re-pivot the case would constitute a surprise to the Defendants, although it could not be said that this would have resulted in injustice or irreparable prejudice that cannot be compensated by costs (see <span class="font-italic">OMG Holdings Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Pos Ad Sdn Bhd</span> [2012] 4 SLR 231 at [18]).

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Taking the LD clauses as they are, the Monthly Gross Revenue is to be derived with reference to the revenue generated by the Peso NDF Desk. In order for BGC to argue that the projected revenues are to be substituted into the formula as set out at paragraph [74] above, BGC would have had to show that such a term can be implied into the contract in the first place. The test for implication of terms has been set out by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp Marine Ltd v PPL Holdings Pte Ltd and another and another appeal</span> [2013] 4 SLR 193 (“<span class="font-italic">Sembcorp Marine</span>”) at [101]: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The first step is to ascertain how the gap in the contract arises. Implication will be considered only if the court discerns that the gap arose because the parties did not contemplate the gap.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) At the second step, the court considers whether it is necessary in the business or commercial sense to imply a term in order to give the contract efficacy.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Finally, the court considers the specific term to be implied. This must be one which the parties, having regard to the need for business efficacy, would have responded “Oh, of course!” had the proposed term been put to them at time of the contract. If it is not possible to find such a clear response, then, the gap persists and the consequences of that gap ensue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 At the first step, it was held in <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp</span><span class="font-italic"> Marine</span> at [96] that where the parties had contemplated the issue but chose not to provide a term for it because they mistakenly thought that the express terms of the contract had adequately addressed it, a “true” gap in the contract would not arise for the court to imply a term. This would apply even where only one party had expressly contemplated an issue (see <span class="font-italic">CAA Technologies Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Newcon Builders Pte Ltd</span> [2017] 2 SLR 940 at [74] – [76]). On the facts, it appeared that while BGC’s contract had contemplated the situation that a broker would be joining the desk without having worked for BGC prior, it clearly failed to provide for the situation where a broker would be <span class="font-italic">starting</span><span class="font-italic"> up</span> a new desk that was never previously in existence. Accordingly, on BGC’s own pleaded case, this would not be a situation where a “true” gap in the contract had arisen. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 At the second step, the court considers whether it is necessary to imply a term. In this case, it would be arguable that such a clause could be necessary in order to give the agreement efficacy. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 At the third step, the court considers the specific term to be implied, with regard to the need for business efficacy. In this regard, I am not persuaded that Yap and Sun would have readily accepted a specific LD term using the projected revenue. Had such a term been put to them at the time of contract, I doubt that they would have given a clear affirmative response. From their evidence, it is clear that while Sun had felt that the targets set out in the contract request forms were attainable, these would have been in the context of a “good market”.

The Court went so far as to opine that it could consider events which occur “after the evidential tranche, during the written closing submissions and before the trial judge delivered judgment, if such events would have falsified some basic assumptions common to both sides or it would have affronted common sense or a sense of justice if the court had failed to take cognizance of them” (see <span class="font-italic">iVenture</span> at [152]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 While the decision in <span class="font-italic">iVenture</span> post-dated my decision which was delivered on 6 September 2021, the principles espoused had already been canvassed in <span class="font-italic">The “STX Mumbai” and another matter</span> [2015] 5 SLR 1 (citing <span class="font-italic">Golden Strait Corp v Nippon Yusen </span><span class="font-italic">Kubishika Kaisha </span>[2007] 2 AC 353 (“<span class="font-italic">The Golden Victory</span>”) at [69]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… on a practical level, even in the situation of an anticipatory breach, by the time the court hears the case, the <span class="font-italic">actual </span>nature and consequences of that breach might, in any event, be <span class="font-italic">known, given the passage of time between the date of the breach and the date(s) of the trial itself </span>(<span class="font-italic">cf</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>also [E Tabachnik,  “Anticipatory Breach of Contract” [1972] Current Legal Problems 149, especially at 153 as well as [Henry Winthrop Ballantine, “Anticipatory Breach and the Enforcement of Contractual Duties” (1924) 22 Michigan L Rev 329] at 340). And, as was made clear by a majority of the House of Lords in <span class="font-italic">The Golden Victory</span>… (whose opinions were recently affirmed by the UK Supreme Court in <span class="font-italic">Bunge </span>at [23]), there is no principled reason why the court should be precluded from taking into account such events which occur subsequent to a breach of contract in assessing the actual nature and consequences of the breach (although, it should be mentioned, that these observations were made in the specific context of the quantification of damages)….</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 Applying the law to the present case, on the assumption that an anticipatory breach of a valid and binding contract on the part of the brokers was accepted by BGC, the losses were to be assessed with reference to the time when the contracted-for performance was to have been performed (see also <span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract in Singapore </span>(Andrew Phang Boon Leong gen ed) (Academy Publishing, 2012) at para 22.009). The non-breaching party (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, BGC) was expected to have taken reasonable steps to mitigate its losses on the date that it accepts the repudiation. Consequently, this would also mean that events that occurred after Yap’s and Sun’s notices to BGC that they were repudiating the contract ought to be taken into account. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 From the evidence, it appeared that BGC was unlikely to have made a significant profit which could be attributed to Yap and Sun, even if they had joined BGC. First, as stated by ICAP’s CEO on the stand, there was the possibility that Yap and Sun would have been placed on different desks or have their existing ICAP lines transferred to other brokers to minimise the impact of their departure.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 Accordingly, I found no basis in BGC’s submissions that the projected revenue of the brokers should be utilised to assess damages where actual information about the revenue they generated (albeit at ICAP) is available. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 As to the expert evidence tendered at trial, I found the evidence of Mr Daniel Corrigan (“Daniel Corrigan”) to have been rather more objective in contrast to the evidence of either Mr Brian Wood, who testified as Yap and Sun’s expert, or Mr Richard Harris, who testified as BGC’s expert. Daniel Corrigan provided the court with useful insight into the factors that would have determined the success of a new desk being set up at BGC. In particular, the list of assumptions laid out by Daniel Corrigan enumerated several factors which were useful in informing an assessment of damages.

</div> These included, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the following: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) ICAP would do little to nothing to defend its business, revenues and market share;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The new Peso NDF brokering desk at BGC would be established and become functioning quickly; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The market volume stays the same or grows; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Volatility in Peso NDF rates would remain the same or increase therefore maintaining or increasing trading volumes. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 Under cross-examination, the evidence of Daniel Corrigan was not seriously challenged by counsel for BGC. This reinforced my view that BGC was seeking to resort to various alternative methodologies to quantify the alleged loss at the maximum possible amount of projected profits, premised on various assumptions which may not hold true and which called for considerable speculation. In addition, it was not helpful that different methodologies had been raised at different junctures, even as late as in the midst of trial itself. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 I was also not persuaded that BGC had acted reasonably in mitigation to source for replacement brokers. Their new hires, Mr Richard Ong and Ms Sun Moon Hwa, who were brought in ostensibly to fill the gap caused by Yap and Sun’s failure to join BGC, were not even exclusively working on Peso NDF trades.
