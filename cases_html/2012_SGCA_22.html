<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was an appeal against the decision of the
                    High Court in <em>ATS v ATT</em> [2011] SGHC 213
                    (“the GD”) on the issues of division of matrimonial assets and
                    maintenance of the respondent (“the Wife”) and their children. The
                    Judge ordered a “property swap” between the appellant (“the
                    Husband”) and the respondent, <em>viz</em>, for each
                    party to take one of the properties in Singapore, as an expedient means of
                    achieving categorical equivalence between the parties (see [37] of the GD).
                    The Husband was also ordered to pay a monthly maintenance of $8400 (<em>ie</em>, a global sum for the maintenance of the Wife and
                    their children) to the Wife (see [48] of the GD). At the conclusion of the
                    hearing, we partially allowed the Husband’s appeal by awarding him 55% of
                    the matrimonial assets in question, with no change to the maintenance sum
                    awarded to the Wife and the children. We now give the reasons for our
                    decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The couple were married on 19 January 1994
                    and had three children (presently 17, 13 and 9 years old) before the Wife filed
                    for divorce on 16 July 2009, on the ground of irretrievable breakdown due to the
                    fact that the Husband had behaved in such a way that the Wife could not
                    reasonably be expected to live with him under s 95(3)<em>(b)</em> of the Women’s Charter ((Cap 353, 1997 Rev
                    Ed) as amended by S 42/2005) (“Women’s
                        Charter”)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>. We pause to note that the
                    wording of the relevant provisions of the governing statute of the present
                    appeal and that of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed)
                    are the same. The Wife had worked as a quantity surveyor and building manager
                    until 1999 when she became a full-time homemaker.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>
                    She was thereafter financially dependent on the Husband, who was the Managing
                    Director of his family owned company, [OO] Pte Ltd
                        (“OO”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Over the course of their marriage, the couple
                    held three immovable properties as joint tenants,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> the
                    distribution of which constituted the crux of this appeal. These consisted of
                    the [DDD] property, a semi-detached house worth about $2.85m
                    (“DDD”); the [MMM] property, an apartment which was valued at
                    approximately $1.85m (“MMM”); and a Malaysian property in Port
                    Dickson (“the Malaysian property”) with an agreed value of
                    $32,866.46 (collectively “the three immovable properties”). The
                    Husband also made two other real estate investments under his own name –
                    the first was at Queen Astrid Park (“the Queen Astrid Park
                    property”), which he bought with two friends and subsequently sold at a
                    profit. His share of the proceeds thereof was then used to fund, <em>inter alia</em>, his purchase of a 20% share in a property at
                    One Jervois (“the One Jervois property”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The interim judgment for divorce was granted by
                    the Family Court on 6 October 2009. Following this, as the value of the
                    matrimonial assets clearly exceeded $1.5 million, the hearing of ancillary
                    matters was transferred to the High Court which stretched over 5 separate
                    days.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The Wife’s position on the division of
                    matrimonial assets underwent a process of piecemeal refinement. Initially, she
                    asked broadly for a just and equitable share of the matrimonial
                        assets.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>
                    During the second hearing on 16 September 2010, she mooted a
                    “property swap” proposal in which MMM would go to her and DDD to
                    the Husband. At this stage, the Wife contended that the Malaysian property
                    should be sold and the proceeds evenly divided. She also staked a claim of 30%
                    over the Husband’s profits from his investment in the Queen Astrid Park
                    property and 30% over the One Jervois property (based on 100% ownership by the
                    Husband absent any documentary evidence to support his claim that he holds only
                    20% thereunder).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> On 30 November
                    2010, she clarified her position in relation to MMM, offering to take over its
                    outstanding mortgage loan so long as the Husband’s Central Provident Fund
                    (“CPF”) contributions (and any accrued interest thereon) need not
                    be refunded by her. In return, she was prepared to give up her claims to DDD,
                    the investment proceeds of the Queen Astrid Park property, the sale proceeds of
                    the One Jervois property, but still wanted 30% of the moneys in the
                    Husband’s bank accounts.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> Her final proposal,
                    confirmed on 22 February 2011, was that she would forego her claims to DDD
                    and all of the Husband’s ancillary assets in exchange for MMM. The
                    outstanding mortgage on MMM would also be borne by her, but the Husband would
                    have to rely on his own resources to refund into his CPF account any moneys
                    (including accrued interest thereon) taken out from that account to pay for the
                    purchase of MMM. Beyond this, each party was to retain all assets and CPF moneys
                    held in their sole names.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The Husband’s position throughout was that
                    MMM should be sold, with the balance of proceeds divided 70:30 in his favour.
                    All the other assets were to be divided 80:20, also in his favour.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> It
                    was agreed that they should have joint custody of the three children, with care
                    and control to the Wife and reasonable access by the Husband.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The Judge was of the view that the Wife’s
                    proposal for a “property swap” (see <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a> above) constituted a just and equitable distribution of the
                    matrimonial assets, and ordered the titles of DDD and MMM, along with any
                    existing liabilities, to be transferred to the Husband and Wife respectively
                    (see at [37] – [38] of the GD). Both parties were also to close all
                    joint investment and bank accounts, with no distribution of moneys left in those
                    accounts, if any. We pause here to observe that the wording of the order
                    relating to the joint investment and bank accounts just mentioned may appear
                    strange – why should there be no division of whatever remained? This was
                    because the net balance of these accounts was in the negative
                        (see [7] of the GD). Apart from
                    this, each party was to retain assets held in his or her respective sole names
                        (see [2] of the
                GD).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       In reaching this conclusion, the learned Judge
                    made the following significant findings of fact and rulings:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Husband failed to make full and
                        frank disclosure of his income (see [9] of the GD);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Husband’s losses in foreign exchange trading
                        (“Forex trading”) were his alone to bear, and no part of the
                        $700,000 loan (which was secured against DDD) taken out to indemnify those
                        Forex losses should be borne by the Wife (see [23] of the GD); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_c"></a>(c)     The Wife’s contributions to the
                        Husband’s business [PP] (“PP”), could be traced into
                        capital repayments on the outstanding loan which was taken out to acquire
                        MMM (see [31] of the GD).</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The principles governing appellate intervention
                    of the decision of the High Court on the question of division of matrimonial
                    assets were restated in <em>Yeo Chong Lin v Tay Ang Choo Nancy
                        </em><em>and another appeal</em> [2011]
                    2 SLR 1157 (“<em>Yeo Chong
                    Lin</em>”) at [80] as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In order for this court to disturb the division ordered by the Judge of
                        35:65 in favour of the Husband, it must be shown that the Judge had erred in
                        law or had clearly exercised her discretion wrongly or had taken into
                        account irrelevant considerations or had failed to take into account
                        relevant considerations: see <em>Koh Bee Choo v Choo Chai
                            Huah</em> [2007] SGCA 21 at [46].</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether the Judge below had taken into account irrelevant
                considerations or had failed to take into account relevant considerations in
                determining the division of matrimonial assets</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     As stated in <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> above, the Judge held that the Husband’s Forex trading
                    losses or outstanding liabilities under the $700,000 loan (secured against DDD)
                    should not be borne by the Wife and thus taken into account for the purposes of
                    determining the pool of matrimonial assets. She reasoned at [23] of the GD:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Wife was a homemaker since 1999 and was financially dependent on the
                        Husband. As the Husband was the sole breadwinner, it fell on the Husband to
                        take on the financial responsibility of taking care of the needs of the
                        family and household as well as to finance the purchases that now represent
                        the bulk of the assets. I did not think that upon termination of the
                        marriage, the family arrangement that had prevailed over the last 15 years
                        should suddenly change in such a way as to make the Wife pay for her share
                        of the investment losses sustained during the marriage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     With respect, we were of the view that the
                    Judge had erred on this point. While it was true that during the currency of the
                    marriage, the Husband bore the financial burden of the family, we were unable to
                    see why that fact should mean that losses suffered by the Husband in his
                    business venture should be disregarded (and his alone to bear) in determining
                    the pool of matrimonial assets to be divided between the parties. The approach
                    taken by the Judge did not seem to accord with fairness or justice. A marriage
                    is in part an economic union in which each spouse’s financial well-being
                    is entwined with the other. Just as gains are shared, so should the losses. It
                    cannot be the case that appreciating assets fall to be divided as part of the
                    common pool whilst depreciating assets or liabilities incurred in seeking to
                    enhance the wealth of the family are attributed entirely to the investing
                    spouse. Adopting such a stance would unfairly penalize the breadwinning party
                    for every financial loss incurred. The present case illustrated
                this.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     For example, in relation to the
                    Husband’s investment in the Queen Astrid Park property, it was not
                    disputed that part of the investment profits was ploughed back into capital
                    repayments on MMM.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> This was a gain which the Wife benefited
                    from even though it came from the Husband’s investment venture. Further,
                    it was not really in dispute that the $700,000 loan taken out on the security of
                    DDD was to meet the Husband’s Forex losses and that the Wife had also
                    signed the relevant loan documentation.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> There
                    was no basis to treat the mortgage loan taken out to meet the Husband’s
                    investment losses differently from a mortgage repayment made by the Husband
                    which was derived from his other investment gains. This was not only wrong in
                    principle but also internally inconsistent and incongruous with the practical
                    realities of marriage. It also detracted from the notion of marriage as a
                    “partnership” wherein the differing contributions of each party
                    are counted to their common credit. The passive spouse must take the good as
                    well as the bad, unless that spouse can show that the losses were not incurred
                        <em>bona fide</em> or for some other good reasons
                    should not be treated as a loss of the family. Had the Husband’s Forex
                    trading activities yielded a profit, we had no doubt that the Wife would be
                    claiming her share and, of course, rightly so. As such, we held that the Judge
                    was mistaken in holding that the $700,000 loan on DDD was to be borne solely by
                    the Husband.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     There was another factual point which seemed
                    to have impacted upon the Judge’s decision and on which we had some
                    reservations. This concerned the Wife’s role in the two businesses of the
                    family, PP and [QQ] (“QQ”). The Judge seemed to hold that the Wife
                    had contributed significantly to these two businesses, such that her interest
                    could be traced into profits made by these businesses, which in turn were
                    channeled into capital repayments on MMM (see [31] of the GD). In this way,
                    the Wife had further contributed to the assets of the family. It is well
                    established, following <em>Koh Kim Lan Angela v Choong
                        </em><em>Kian Haw and another appeal</em> [1993]
                        3 SLR(R) 491,(“<em>Koh Kim Lan
                        Angela”</em>), that business assets of the family or of either
                    spouse could constitute matrimonial assets which are liable to be divided
                        (see [6] –
                    [7], [24] and [29] of
                        <em>Koh Kim Lan Angela</em>). However, it was the
                    Wife’s own admission that the Husband “called the shots”,
                    and her role was restricted primarily to issuing cheques and cash upon his
                        instructions.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> She went so far as to say that she was
                    “merely a puppet to him”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> In other words, PP
                    and QQ were substantively managed and operated by the Husband, in contrast with
                    the Wife’s nominal participation. The Wife’s contributions to the
                    companies’ businesses were therefore much more limited. As such, although
                    some funds of the businesses, which no longer existed at the time of the hearing
                    of ancillary matters, were channelled towards the repayment of MMM, those funds
                    were essentially generated from the efforts of the Husband with only minor
                    contributions from the Wife. Thus, her contributions to the acquisition of MMM
                    were really confined to the approximately $110,326.35<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> taken out from her CPF as
                    well as her role as the homemaker.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The lack of an express ratio for the division of matrimonial assets
                between the Husband and the Wife</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     It is almost hackneyed to say that the
                    division of matrimonial assets following a failed marriage under s 112 of
                    the Women’s Charter is not an exact science. While s 112(2) of the
                    Women’s Charter sets out a list of factors which the court must take into
                    account in making the division, and here we would note that there is some
                    overlap as well as possible conflict in those factors, a wide discretion still
                    remains with the court in determining what is just and equitable in the
                    circumstances of each case. A broad-brush is the appropriate approach and is
                    typically adopted (see <em>Lim Choon Lai v Chew Kim
                        Heng</em> [2001] 2 SLR(R) 260 at [14] and <em>Yeo Chong
                        Lin</em> at [78]). However, such an approach cannot be so
                    heuristic as to become indeterminate, leaving lawyers without any meaningful
                    guidelines with which to advise their clients.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Ordinarily, in this exercise, the first step
                    is to delineate what exactly constitutes the pool of matrimonial assets. This is
                    a necessary preliminary to the exercise of the court's matrimonial jurisdiction:
                    the court should know what are to be divided. Once this is done, the value of
                    the pool should then be assessed so that the court’s deliberations can be
                    made with reference to a working quantum. The court will then consider all the
                    circumstances of the case, including but not limited to the factors listed in
                    s 112(2) of the Women’s Charter, particularly the direct financial
                    contributions as well as the indirect non-financial contributions of each party,
                    and thereby determine what is the just and equitable proportion. Having gone
                    through this exercise, it may then proceed to ascertain the most expedient means
                    of physically executing the division in that proportion. It should be emphasized
                    that this does not represent a hard and fast procedure which the court must
                    adhere to in every case involving the division of matrimonial assets, even where
                    it would be manifestly iniquitous or inconvenient to do so. However, it would be
                    desirable for the court to bear these steps in mind as it goes through the
                    exercise of making a just and equitable division.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The present appeal centered on the
                    distribution of the couple’s three immovable properties. The crux of the
                    Husband’s appeal against the High Court’s division of assets was
                    that it left him with a disproportionately small share of the matrimonial
                    property. He contended that a more just and equitable order would be for all
                    three immovable properties to be transferred to him, while the Wife should
                    receive only $400,000 from the MMM sale proceeds.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> As mentioned in <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a> –
                    <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a> above, the Husband’s position
                    before the High Court was wider in scope as compared to the Wife’s,
                    encompassing all of the couple’s joint and personal assets. However,
                    having regard to the stand of the parties, the Judge felt that effectively only
                    the three immovable properties were the bone of contention. The Judge did not
                    say, bearing in mind the financial and non-financial contributions of the
                    parties towards the acquisition of these assets, what would be the proper
                    division of those assets. Neither did she indicate in value terms how much each
                    party would obtain from such a division in the form of a “property
                    swap”. Of course, the Judge also allowed each party to retain the money
                    which was then in his or her CPF account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     On the basis of the Judge’s division of
                    the three immovable properties, the Husband was given (in value terms) only
                    approximately 42% and the Wife 58%.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> It would be recalled that in purchasing
                    MMM, both parties withdrew moneys from their respective CPF accounts to pay for
                    the same and that the Judge had, in allowing the Wife to retain MMM, also
                    ordered the Husband to reimburse his CPF account in respect of the moneys taken
                    therefrom to pay for the same (amounting to approximately $429,500,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> inclusive of accrued interest). If this were
                    taken into account, it would mean (in percentage terms) that the Husband only
                    obtained 28 % of the total value of the three immovable properties. We found
                    that this demonstrated the inequity of the division, bearing in mind that most
                    of the direct financial contributions came from the Husband, although a sum of
                    about $110,326.35 was taken from the Wife’s CPF to pay for MMM and the
                    Wife did help the Husband in attending to some simple administration of the two
                    businesses, PP and QQ.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The precedents in similar cases involving
                    moderately lengthy marriages reveal that – save in exceptional cases
                    – the homemaker wife usually receives between 35 – 40% of the
                    matrimonial assets. For example, in <em>ZD v ZE &amp;
                        another</em> [2008] SGHC 225, the wife in a 17 year marriage
                    was awarded 35% of the matrimonial assets. There were also certain prominent
                    similarities between that case and the present, <em>viz</em>, there were three children over whom the wife was granted
                    care and control; she had worked in the husband’s companies doing
                    accounts; and her direct contributions were low (<em>ie</em>, 6%). The husband was often absent from home. On appeal, the
                    wife was awarded 40% of the matrimonial assets.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p>

                    year marriage 45% of the common assets. She had care and control of the two
                    children, helped her husband with administrative aspects of his work, and
                    directly contributed towards 10% of the family home. Further, as with the
                    present appeal, the husband had travelled frequently due to work commitments.
                    The District Court’s decision was subsequently upheld by the High Court
                    (see <em>MZ v NA</em>

                    award of 50% of the matrimonial assets to the homemaker wife of a 20 year
                    marriage, stressing that she had sufficiently demonstrated that her
                    contributions as a homemaker warranted an equal division:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">51    In the present appeal, we are fully aware that the
                            Wife has made an important contribution to the family in her role as a
                            homemaker over a long period of time. The record, in fact, shows that
                            the parties’ children excelled in their academic and
                            extra-curricular activities. Thus, even if she was unemployed for most
                            of the marriage, did not assist in the Husband’s business and made
                            no financial contribution to the purchase of the various matrimonial
                            assets, she is clearly entitled to a significant share of the
                            assets.</p>

                        Hock Chye</em> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 520 (“<em>Lock Yeng Fun”</em>), the Court of Appeal ordered an
                    equal division in recognition of the extraordinary contributions of the
                    homemaker wife, who had also amassed more matrimonial assets than the husband
                    through her investments (see [38] and [41] of <em>Lock Yeng
                        Fun</em>). The parties had been married for almost 30 years and had
                    two adult children. We would emphasize that this was a much longer marriage than
                    that of the present appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     In the recent decision of <em>Yeo Chong Lin</em> which involved a 49 year marriage, where the
                    wife’s contributions were entirely in the domestic sphere and where the
                    pool of matrimonial assets was large, the High Court’s award of only 35%
                    to the wife was upheld on appeal by this court (at [83] of <em>Yeo Chong Lin</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Viewing the decision of the Judge in the light
                    of these precedents, which are no doubt only guides, it appeared to us that the
                    “property swap” order made by the Judge which allowed the Wife to
                    retain MMM and required the Husband to reimburse his CPF account in the sum of
                    approximately $429,500 (inclusive of interest) was too generous in favour of the
                    Wife. We have (at <a href="#p1_17">[17]</a> above) set out
                    what the Judge’s order amounted to in percentage terms. This was only a 15
                    year marriage. Moreover, we could not see any basis to say that the Wife’s
                    indirect contributions to the home and family exceeded the Husband’s input
                    as the sole breadwinner. There was no evidence to suggest that the Wife had gone
                    beyond what would normally be expected of her in maintaining the home and caring
                    for the children. Moreover, the Wife had only been an exclusive homemaker for
                    the past 10 years (reckoning up to interim judgment), and did not deny that the
                    Husband shared in some of the parenting duties. Finally, she contributed to only
                    11.7% of the purchase price of MMM.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> Other
                    than the moneys in each party’s CPF account, the three immovable
                    properties were really the bulk of their assets. On the back of these
                    considerations, we were of the view that the Wife’s share of the three
                    immovable properties as ordered by the Judge was excessive and should be
                    reduced. In the result, we reassessed the parties’ contributions in order
                    to determine the just and equitable division.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether an adverse inference should be drawn against the
                Husband</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In this regard, we noted and agreed with the
                    Judge’s observation that the documentary inconsistencies in relation to
                    the Husband’s sources of income pointed towards a failure to make full and
                    frank disclosure (see [9] of the
                    GD). It is now a matter of trite law, following the decision in <em>Wee Ah Lian v Teo Siak Weng</em> [1992]
                    1 SLR(R) 347 (at [55]), that a party’s failure to fulfil
                    the duty of full and fair disclosure may lead the court to draw adverse
                    inferences against him. In <em>NK v NL</em> [2007]
                    3 SLR(R) 743, the Court of Appeal held (at [59], [61] –
                    [62]) that in drawing such an inference, the presiding court may elect to either
                    add a specific sum of the undeclared asset to the matrimonial pool for division
                    or order a higher proportion of the known assets to the other party. This
                    approach was subsequently reiterated in <em>Yeo Chong
                        Lin</em> (at [65]). We agreed with the Judge that an adverse
                    inference should be drawn against the Husband in this instance, and it should
                    reduce the proportion of the assets he would otherwise be entitled to. Taking
                    into account this factor, as well as the considerations set out
                        in <a href="#p1_23">[23]</a> above, we were of the view
                    that a just and equitable division of the three immovable properties, excluding
                    the refunds to be made to each parties’ CPF account, would be 55:45 in
                    favour of the Husband. We were comforted that the result of this division would
                    not be significantly different (in terms of ratio) had the other assets under
                    their separate names (including funds in their respective CPF accounts) been
                    added to what each party would receive under the present 55:45
                division.</p>

                    was a twist in the development of this case after the Husband had filed his
                    Notice of Appeal on 18 April 2011. On 4 August 2011, an Order for

                    MMM at the time of the hearing of ancillary matters was estimated
                    at $1.74m. This begged the question as to whether such a subsequent change
                    in the value of a matrimonial asset could <em>ipso
                        facto</em> constitute a ground for a successful appeal. It should be
                    emphasized, however, that the determination of this issue was not strictly
                    necessary for the resolution of the present appeal as we did not think that the
                    “property swap” order of the Judge was just and equitable. We
                    noted that counsel for both parties agreed that if in fact the division below
                    was correct, then the <em>en bloc</em> sale should not have
                    any sway on this court. In our opinion, there was patently good sense in this.
                    If the “property swap” order made by the Judge in this case were
                    held to be just and equitable and had been affirmed by us, we do not see any
                    basis to review the division on account of subsequent changes in the valuation
                    of the asset in question. Especially in a volatile market where prices do move
                    up and down fairly rapidly, there should be certainty and finality. The party
                    who, under the order on division of matrimonial assets, is given an immovable
                    property would have to take it subject to all risks or vagaries of the market.
                    Otherwise, it would only encourage re-litigation at the appeal stage. Thus,
                    unless there are special circumstances or compelling reasons, the mere change in
                    value of an asset between the date of the ancillary orders and that of the
                    hearing of the appeal <em>per se</em> should not be a
                    ground to revisit the division made by the court below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Our decision on the division of the matrimonial assets</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In the light of our decision that the three
                    immovable properties should be divided in the ratio of 55:45 in favour of the
                    Husband, the order of the Judge awarding MMM to the Wife had to be set aside. As
                    MMM was part of the matrimonial assets, <em>a
                    fortiori</em>, the proceeds accruing from the <em>en
                        bloc</em> sale of MMM should similarly be part of the matrimonial
                    assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Maintenance of the Wife and their children</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The Husband had been ordered to pay
                    maintenance to the Wife in respect of herself and the three children in the sum
                    of $8,400 each month, with $2,500 being for her personal expenses, $900 for the
                    expenses of the children, and $5,000 for household expenses (see [48] of
                    the GD). The Wife had sought a monthly sum of $10,300 as maintenance for herself
                    and the children (see [39] of the GD), but this <em>was
                        deemed</em> excessive by the Judge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     It was the Husband’s contention that the
                    Judge had failed to take into account the Wife’s earning capacity. Indeed,
                    no mention of the Wife’s future earning capacity was alluded to in the GD.
                    It was clearly set out in <em>Quek Lee Tiam v Ho Kim Swee (alias
                        Ho Kian Guan)</em> [1995] SGHC 23 (at [22]) and reiterated in <em>NI
                        v NJ</em> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 75 (at [11]) that the Wife should “exert
                    herself, [to] secure a gainful employment, and earn as much as reasonably
                    possible.” However, it seemed to us that even if considerations were
                    given by the Judge as to the Wife’s potential future earnings, it would
                    probably have made an insignificant difference in the maintenance sum ordered,
                    at least for the near to middle term. While the Wife is a diploma-holder in her
                    40’s, she has care and control of three school-going children, especially
                    the two younger ones who are aged 13 and 9. Moreover, the Wife has been out of
                    the job market for some 13 years, making it unrealistic or impractical to expect
                    her to immediately pick up from where she left off before she became a
                    homemaker, even with the assistance of a maid. In any event, the Husband’s
                    submission on the issue of maintenance was also hampered by the adverse
                    inference which had been drawn against him due to <em>his</em> failure to fully disclose his true earning capacity
                        (see <a href="#p1_24">[24]</a> above). All matters
                    considered, including the needs of the Wife and the children and the capacity of
                    the Husband to pay, we were not minded to disturb the sum awarded by the Judge
                    as maintenance.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     For the reasons above, the appeal of the
                    Husband was partly allowed in so far as it concerned the division of the three
                    immovable assets. We directed that the three immovable properties were to be
                    valued as of 6 February 2012, after deducting any outstanding loans as well
                    as the parties’ original CPF contributions (plus accrued interest) which
                    would have to be refunded to their respective CPF accounts. We nevertheless left
                    the parties free to agree as to how the three immovable properties were to be
                    allocated or sold, subject to the caveat that the CPF moneys taken by the
                    parties from their respective accounts to pay for the three immovable properties
                    (plus accrued interest) shall be excluded in determining their respective
                    entitlements under the 55:45 division.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     We ordered each party to bear its own
                    costs.</p>
