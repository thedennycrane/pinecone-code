        Tan Lee Meng J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The appellant, Mr Agus Anwar
                    (“AA”), applied to set aside or stay the bankruptcy application
                    instituted against him by the respondent, Orion Oil Limited
                    (“Orion”), a British Virgin Islands company that had previously
                    served a statutory demand on him. AA’s application was dismissed by
                    Assistant Registrar Then Ling (“AR Then”) on 11 October 2010.
                    I dismissed the appeal against AR Then’s decision on 4 November 2010
                    and now give my reasons for having done so.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Orion lent AA $10 million (“the
                    loan”) pursuant to a loan agreement dated 22 September 2008 and a
                    supplemental agreement dated 24 September 2008. Under the agreement, the loan
                    amount and interest were to be repaid on 18 December 2008. AA acknowledged the
                    loan in his correspondence with Orion and promised to repay. However, he failed
                    to do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       On 18 April 2009, Orion served a statutory
                    demand on AA for the sum of $10.5 million. This amount included interest on the
                    loan furnished to AA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       On 7 July 2009, AA applied to set aside
                    Orion’s statutory demand. He argued that by furnishing him the loan, Orion
                    acted as a moneylender and as the latter did not have a moneylender’s
                    license, the contract to lend him money was not enforceable by virtue of the
                    Moneylenders Act (Cap 188, 1985 Rev Ed). The Assistant Registrar who
                    heard AA’s application took the view that the debt was disputed on
                    substantial grounds and that there was a triable issue as to whether the
                    defendant was a moneylender under the Moneylenders Act. The statutory demand was
                    thus set aside.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Orion appealed against the Assistant
                    Registrar’s decision. On 25 August 2009, Lee Seiu Kin J
                    overruled the Assistant Registrar’s decision and upheld the statutory
                    demand: see <em>Agus Anwar v Orion Oil Ltd</em>
                    [2010] SGHC 6. He pointed out (at [12]) that AA had a totally
                    unmeritorious case and had “tried to take advantage of the presumption in
                    s 3 of the [Moneylenders Act] to escape his obligations, willingly
                    undertaken at the time when he was desperate for cash, but which he did not want
                    to repay for reasons best known to himself”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       AA’s appeal against Lee J’s
                    decision was dismissed by the Court of Appeal on 9 July 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       As AA did not pay the amount claimed in the
                    statutory demand, Orion filed the bankruptcy application on 15 May 2009. AA
                    responded by trying to have the application set aside or stayed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       At the hearing before AR Then, AA relied on two
                    grounds. First, he contended that the debt to Orion is a disputed debt.
                    Secondly, he asserted that the bankruptcy petition should be set aside or stayed
                    because Orion already had security by way of a charge on a property at 39A
                    Ridout Road, Singapore 248438 (the “Ridout property”), which had
                    been sold and part of the proceeds of which would be paid into court when the
                    sale was completed. AA’s application was dismissed by AR Then Ling. It is
                    noteworthy that she stated in her notes of evidence as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Separately, I am mindful of [AA’s] conduct throughout the entire
                        proceedings. In my view, [AA] is simply trying to delay the proceedings and
                        deny [Orion] the money owed. The court will not condone such conduct.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       At the hearing of this appeal, AA abandoned his
                    argument that the debt was disputed. He was right to do so, since this issue had
                    already been raised and decided in the proceedings before Lee J and the Court of
                    Appeal when he unsuccessfully sought to set aside the statutory demand. His
                    counsel thus focussed his attention on the charge on the Ridout
                property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The Ridout property is owned not by AA but by
                    a company, Ridout Residences Pte Ltd (“RRPL”), of which he is the
                    sole shareholder and director. AA claims that the property is held on trust for
                    him. However, AA’s reliance on the charge on the Ridout property as a
                    ground for setting aside or staying the bankruptcy application is fraught with
                    difficulties. To begin with - and as AR Then rightly pointed out - AA is
                    prevented from raising the issue of the charge on the Ridout property because
                    this issue had been canvassed by him in earlier proceedings in the High Court
                    and the Court of Appeal with respect to his application to set aside
                    Orion’s statutory demand against him. In any case, even if the charge on
                    the Ridout property had not been raised in previous proceedings, AA knew about
                    this charge when he applied to set aside the statutory demand. As such, he was
                    prevented by issue estoppel from raising this issue as well as other issues
                    which he could have raised with reasonable diligence in the earlier proceedings
                    to set aside the statutory demand. In <em>Henderson v
                        Henderson</em> (1843-60) All ER Rep 378 (“<em>Henderson”</em>), Wigram VC explained at pp
                    381-382:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The plea of <em>res judicata</em> applies, except in
                        special case[s], not only to points upon which the court was actually
                        required by the parties to form an opinion and pronounce a judgment, but
                            <em>to every point which properly belonged to the subject
                            of litigation and which the parties, exercising reasonable diligence,
                            might have brought forward at the time</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The wider ambit of the plea of <em>res judicata</em> enunciated in <em>Henderson</em> has been followed on numerous occasions by our courts:
                    see the decision of the Court of Appeal in <em>Ng Chee Chong and
                        another v Toh Kouw and another</em> [1999]
                    2 SLR(R) 909.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Even if the issue of <em>res
                        judicata</em> is left aside for the moment, AA took inconsistent
                    positions on the enforceability of the charge on the Ridout property. While he
                    argued in these proceedings that Orion had a charge on the Ridout property, his
                    position in other proceedings before the High Court was that Orion’s
                    charge on the Ridout property could not be enforced because it is connected to
                    another transaction involving Gainsford Capital Ltd (the “Gainsford
                    transaction”) that rendered the charge ineffective. In Originating
                    Summons No 1357 of 2009 (“OS No 1357”), which concerned a claim by
                    an option holder for specific performance of his contract to purchase the Ridout
                    property from RRPL, AA made it quite clear in his Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief
                    filed on 25 June 2010 that he would oppose any attempt by Orion to enforce the
                    charge and claim any part of the balance of the sale proceeds of the Ridout
                    property. AA’s attempt to have the bankruptcy application set aside or
                    stayed while insisting that this charge is unenforceable cannot be countenanced.
                    He cannot blow hot and cold.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     A petitioning creditor is, as was made clear
                    by Harman J in <em>In Re Gilmartin (a bankrupt)</em> [1989]
                    1 WLR 513, 516, “entitled to be paid his debt in full on the
                    hearing of a petition unless it is adjourned on the ground that there is a
                    reasonable prospect of him being paid within a reasonable time”. It
                    cannot be said at the present moment that there is a reasonable prospect of
                    Orion being paid within a reasonable time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     As there was insufficient reason for me to set
                    aside or stay the bankruptcy application. I dismissed AA’s appeal with
                    costs.</p>
