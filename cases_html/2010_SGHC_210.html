<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This appeal raised the perennial question as to
                    the appropriate sentence to be imposed on a young offender. Should
                    rehabilitation <em>always</em> be the paramount
                    consideration? Clearly multiple interests are involved in the consideration of
                    this question which the court must carefully weigh and balance. As a general
                    proposition, based on precedents, it would not be wrong to say that the court
                    would be inclined, when sentencing a young offender, to seek his or her
                    rehabilitation. In some cases however, the court has been confronted with a
                    conflict between a sentencing consideration and the general policy enunciated by
                    Parliament. Specifically, in the present case, should the fact that the young
                    offender was engaged in a particular form of social mischief (<em>ie</em> harassment of debtors by runners of illegal moneylenders)
                    which Parliament has clearly evinced an intention to stamp out mean that the
                    court is precluded from appraising rehabilitation as the predominant
                    consideration? At the very heart of this appeal, this court had to decide
                    whether the rehabilitation of the young offender should still remain the
                    pre-dominant sentencing consideration for youths who commit offences that have
                    been woven in the tapestry of unlicensed moneylending activities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       On the facts of this case, while I agreed with
                    the court below that probation would be inappropriate given the offender’s
                    home environment and the nature of the offence, I was of the view that the court
                    below should not have ruled out reformative training for the offender. While I
                    recognised that Parliament had taken a serious view of the activities of
                    unlicensed moneylenders and their related acts of harassment of debtors when
                    Parliament enhanced the sentences for such offences (although the enhanced
                    sentences were not applicable to the offender in the present case as the
                    offences were committed before Parliament enhanced the sentences), I did not
                    think that Parliament had wholly ruled out rehabilitation as a sentencing
                    consideration when dealing with young offenders. I accordingly substituted the
                    sentence of 48 months’ imprisonment with an order that the offender be
                    sent for reformative training. I now set out my detailed reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The offender in this case was Nur Azilah Binte
                    Ithnin (the “Appellant”). At all material times of the offences
                    she was charged with, she was 16 years of age. She came from a family of five
                    and was the youngest amongst them. The Appellant did not come from a privileged
                    background and her circumstances were quite unfortunate. She was physically
                    abused by her father when she was young and her family’s financial
                    position was a constant struggle. Her parents were unemployed. Only her siblings
                    held stable jobs and supported the family. The Appellant received a daily
                    allowance of $2.00. During her school holidays, she had to take on various jobs
                    to support both her family and her herself.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The Appellant’s involvement with
                    unlicensed moneylenders began in around April 2009 when she was forced to leave
                    home after her parents discovered that she was suspended from school for poor
                    attendance. Thereafter, the Appellant supported herself by working as a runner
                    for two unlicensed moneylenders. After some time, she was allowed to return
                    home. However, because of her family’s precarious financial position and
                    of her desire to contribute to the family, she decided to continue working for
                    the unlicensed moneylenders. The two unlicensed moneylenders with whom the
                    Appellant was in contact with were known as “Storm” and
                    “Steven”. On their instructions, the Appellant would commit acts
                    of annoyance or harassment on designated debtors. In return, she was usually
                    paid $40–$50 (depending on the unlicensed moneylender) for harassing each
                    debtor, and would be paid much more (about $200) if the harassment included the
                    setting of fire. Altogether, seven such acts were committed by the
                    Appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       On three separate occasions in the month of June
                    2009, the Appellant committed acts of harassment on three housing units located
                    in Ang Mo Kio, Compassvale Crescent and Yishun Ring Road. On each occasion, the
                    Appellant and/or other accomplices would receive instructions from the
                    unlicensed moneylenders to write statements on the staircase landings leading up
                    to the targeted housing unit asking for money to be repaid and to splash paint
                    on the doors of those units. These acts formed the basis of DACs 36173/2009,
                    36176/2009 and 36181/2009, where the Appellant was charged with harassing
                    debtors on behalf of unlicensed moneylenders by defacing and causing damage to
                    properties, offences punishable under section 28(2)(a) read with section
                    28(1)(b) and section 28(3)(a)(i) of the Moneylenders Act (Cap 188, 2010 Rev Ed))
                    (“Moneylenders Act”), read (where relevant) with either sections
                    34 or 109 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“Penal Code”)
                    .</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       In the same month of June 2009, the Appellant
                    also committed acts of harassment on another group of housing units where she,
                    together with other accomplices, set fire to those units. On three such
                    occasions, the Appellant and the accomplices splashed thinner on the doors of
                    targeted units and set it alight. In one of those instances, the shoe rack
                    beside the unit was also set on fire. These acts formed the basis of DACs
                    41437/2009, 41438/2009 and 41439/2009, where the Appellant was charged for
                    committing mischief by fire with the intention to cause damage to properties, an
                    offence punishable under section 435, read with section 34 (where relevant) of
                    the Penal Code.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The seventh charge related to an act which
                    occurred on 22 June 2009, where the Appellant and an accomplice splashed thinner
                    at the clothing hung along the corridor and the shoe rack placed outside the
                    targeted unit in Ang Mo Kio. It would appear that they were spotted before they
                    could light those objects on fire. This act formed the basis of DAC 41436/2009,
                    where the Appellant was charged for attempting to commit mischief by fire,
                    intending to cause damage to property, punishable under section 435 and read
                    with sections 511 and 34 of the Penal Code.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">District Court Proceedings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Before the District Court below, the Appellant
                    (unrepresented at that time) pleaded guilty to all seven charges. In addition,
                    the Appellant consented to having six additional charges of harassing debtors on
                    behalf of unlicensed moneylenders by defacing and causing damage to properties
                    taken into consideration (DACs 36171/2009, 36172/2009, 36178/2009, 36179/2009,
                    36180/2009 and 36182/2009). The acts which were the bases for the six charges
                    taken into consideration involved the same <em>modus
                        operandi</em> of writing declaratory statements of money owed on the
                    walls of the staircase landings leading up to the targeted housing unit and
                    splashing paint on the doors of those units.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       After considering the mitigation plea of the
                    Appellant and the submissions on sentence by the Prosecution, the District Judge
                    (“DJ”) sentenced the Appellant to a total of 48 months’
                    imprisonment. For each of the three charges of harassment of debtors, the
                    Appellant was sentenced to 9 months’ imprisonment, and for each of the
                    three charges of committing mischief by fire, the Appellant was sentenced to 26
                    months’ imprisonment. As for the charge of attempted mischief by fire, the
                    Appellant was sentenced to 13 months’ imprisonment. The DJ ordered the
                    sentences for every charge under each category of charge to run consecutively
                    and the rest to run concurrently. The effective sentence was therefore 48
                    months’ imprisonment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The DJ took into account several
                    considerations in determining the appropriate sentence Firstly, as the offences
                    committed by the Appellant were sufficiently heinous to warrant a tough stance
                    by the courts, the court’s general approach of rehabilitating young
                    offenders must be superseded by deterrence. Secondly, the DJ found that the
                    Appellant had minimal rehabilitative prospects. The Appellant lacked familial
                    support, had a history of physical abuse by her father and had also taken to
                    substance abuse. Thirdly, the DJ found that the option of sending the Appellant
                    to a Reformative Training Centre was inappropriate since the Appellant had a
                    history of an inability to get along with her peers. Fourthly, the DJ placed
                    significant emphasis on the determination by the Government to reduce incidents
                    of unlicensed moneylending and the related harassment, see the DJ’s
                    Grounds of Decision reported at [2009] SGDC 404 at [12], [19] and
                    [20]. In view of this public interest, the DJ inferred that deterrence must
                    therefore be the dominant and primary consideration for such offences
                    notwithstanding the relatively young age of the offender.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Present Appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     In her submissions before this Court, the
                    Appellant’s broad substantive grounds of appeal were that the sentence
                    meted out by the DJ was manifestly excessive and that the DJ had erred in
                    appreciating the materials before him. In reply, the Prosecution substantively
                    repeated their arguments which were raised in their submissions on sentence to
                    the court below, <em>ie</em> the need for a deterrent
                    sentence in view of the rising trend of youths being recruited by unlicensed
                    moneylending syndicates and the related use of more dangerous acts of annoyance
                    involving fire.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     It has been well established as a matter of
                    general principle that the dominant consideration in sentencing young offenders
                    has been rehabilitation. In <em>PP v Mok Ping Wuen
                        Maurice</em> [1998] 3 SLR(R) 439 (“<em>Mok Ping Wuen Maurice</em>”) at [21], Yong Pung How CJ
                    succinctly summarised this general principle and rationalised the basis behind
                    it as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Rehabilitation is the dominant consideration where the offender is 21
                        years and below. Young offenders are in their formative years and chances of
                        reforming them into law-abiding adults are better. The corrupt influence of
                        a prison environment and the bad effects of labelling and stigmatisation may
                        not be desirable for young offenders. Compassion is often shown to young
                        offenders on the assumption that the young "don't know any better" and they
                        may not have had enough experience to realise the full consequences of their
                        actions on themselves and on others. Teens may also be slightly less
                        responsible than older offenders, being more impressionable, more easily led
                        and less controlled in their behaviour. However, there is no doubt that some
                        young people can be calculating in their offences. Hence the court will need
                        to assess the facts in every case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     However, this general principle of regarding
                    rehabilitation as the main consideration for the treatment of young offenders is
                    not absolute. Yong Pung How CJ had this clearly in mind when he pointed out
                    in <em>Mok Ping Wuen Maurice</em>, that the court had to
                    “assess the facts in every case”. If the crime is serious or
                    heinous enough, the courts have held that deterrence will supersede
                    rehabilitation as the sentencing consideration. In <em>PP v
                        Mohammad Al-Ansari bin Basri</em> [2008] 1 SLR(R) 449
                        (“<em>Mohammad Al-Ansari</em>”), V K
                    Rajah JA outlined, at [77]-[78], the following framework for courts to
                    consider when deciding on the appropriate sentence for a young offender who has
                    been convicted of a serious crime:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">77    ...<em>First, the court must ask
                                itself whether rehabilitation can remain a predominant
                                consideration. If the offence was particularly heinous or the
                                offender has a long history of offending, then reform and
                                rehabilitation may not even be possible or relevant, notwithstanding
                                the youth of the offender</em>. In this case, the statutorily
                            prescribed punishment (in most cases a term of imprisonment) will be
                            appropriate.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">78    However, if the principle of rehabilitation is
                            considered to be relevant as a dominant consideration, the next question
                            is how to give effect to this. In this respect, with young offenders,
                            the courts may generally choose between probation and reformative
                            training. The courts have to realise that each represents a different
                            fulcrum in the balance between rehabilitation and deterrence. In seeking
                            to achieve the proper balance, the courts could consider the factors I
                            enumerated above, but must, above all, pay heed to the conceptual basis
                            for rehabilitation and deterrence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     From <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a>–<a href="#p1_7">[7]</a> above, it would
                    be noted that this court was concerned with two types of offences, namely,
                    harassment of debtors and mischief by fire. As I will show below, the courts
                    have generally been reluctant to sentence youths below the age of 21 to a term
                    of imprisonment for both types of offences when considered individually. In
                    those cases, courts have instead been generally inclined to sentence these
                    youths to either probation or reformative training since the courts did not view
                    such offences, individually, as serious enough to warrant replacing
                    rehabilitation with deterrence as the pre-dominant sentencing consideration. In
                    this appeal, this court also had to consider both offences and whether
                    collectively, bearing in mind the greater public interest in curbing unlicensed
                    moneylending activities, this court ought to impose a deterrent sentence and
                    consequently disregard the age of the offender.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Harassment of Debtors</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Hitherto the courts have consistently
                    sentenced young offenders, below the age of 21, to either probation or
                    reformative training after they have been convicted of committing similar acts
                    of harassment as those committed by the Appellant. I summarise the cases arising
                    from the Moneylenders Act below:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">In DAC 15545/2009, the 17-year-old offender was

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In view of these precedents alone, it seemed
                    clear to me that the sentence meted out by the DJ for the harassment of debtors
                    charges was not in line with the precedents and manifestly excessive. In the
                    proceedings below, although the Prosecution’s submission on sentence made
                    reference to all the above cases, the DJ nevertheless sentenced the Appellant to
                    9 months’ imprisonment for each charge notwithstanding the similarities in
                    the <em>modus operandi</em>, <em>ie</em> the splashing of paint and using indelible ink to write on
                    the walls. The DJ based this sentence mainly on the culpability (<em>ie</em> greed) of the Appellant and the need for general
                    deterrence. Putting aside the question of endangerment of lives (which was only
                    relevant to the mischief by fire charges), I could not see any discernable
                    factor that would justify such a departure from the sentencing precedents. In
                    almost all the cases, the offenders were motivated by monetary rewards.
                    Otherwise there would have been no reason for the offender to be involved in
                    such loan shark activities. And in all cases, there existed the same public
                    interest in curbing such activities.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Mischief by Fire</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     What was particularly germane in this appeal,
                    and what distinguished this appeal from previous cases of unlicensed
                    moneylending harassment involving youths, was that the Prosecution had preferred
                    against the Appellant the additional charges of mischief by fire, an offence
                    which attracted a higher statutory sentence. This court had to evaluate,
                    apparently for the first time, whether where a young offender was guilty of both
                    harassment of debtors and the corollary use of fire as a harassment technique,
                    the consequent combined effect would be so serious or heinous that the
                    pre-dominant consideration of rehabilitation when sentencing a young offender in
                    those circumstances should be replaced by general deterrence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     As an observation, it would seem that courts
                    have not usually sentenced young offenders to terms of imprisonment. In the case
                    of <em>PP v Teo Sew Eng</em> [2008] SGDC 295, the
                    offender had a family spat with another relative over some inheritance money.
                    Believing that the relative was withholding money from her, the offender
                    instigated her 17-year-old son (who then subsequently sought the assistance of
                    his classmate, also 17 years old at the time of the offence) to set fire to that
                    relative’s car. After pleading guilty to the committing mischief by fire
                    charges, both youths were sentenced to probation. The District Judge sentenced
                    the offender to 6 months’ imprisonment. The offender appealed against her
                    imprisonment sentence and submitted that probation or alternatively a shorter
                    jail sentence was more appropriate. On appeal, Justice Choo Han Teck observed
                    that probation was not appropriate for the offender and had the offender’s
                    son not been young and labouring under a psychiatric disorder, he too was likely
                    to be jailed, see <em>Teo Sew Eng v PP</em> [2009]
                    3 SLR(R) 324 at [3]. In the case of <em>PP v Yunani bin
                        Abdul Hamid</em> [2007] SGDC 345 (where one charge involved
                    drug trafficking) the judge noted, at [22], that the offender was previously
                    sentenced to 18 months’ probation when he was 16 years old for a series of
                    offences including that of committing mischief by fire (other charges related to
                    housebreaking and theft). It has to be noted that although that accused had
                    faced offences involving greater gravity and had been charged with a greater
                    number of offences as compared to the Appellant, that accused had only been
                    placed on probation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The DJ and the Prosecution had rightly noted
                    that the government has stepped up its efforts in curbing the wrongful acts of
                    unlicensed moneylending syndicates. Parliament has enhanced the sentences for
                    such violations in the Moneylenders Act especially in view of the growing
                    audacity of these moneylenders adopting harassment techniques that could
                    endanger their victims’ lives. The Senior Minister of State for Home
                    Affairs, Associate Professor Ho Peng Kee, had stated in Parliament, in oral
                    answers to questions on illegal moneylenders and runners, that he endorsed the
                    practice of charging offenders with offences that have prescribed sentences, as
                    then was the case, to send a deterrent signal to the public (<em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</em> (18 August
                    2009) vol 86). What was equally of grave concern was the trend of youths being
                    lured and used as syndicate runners. It was in light of the foregoing and in the
                    public interest, that the DJ held that the dominant sentencing consideration in
                    this case was deterrence, despite his acknowledgement that rehabilitation was
                    usually the dominant consideration when sentencing youths below 21 years of
                    age.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     I would agree with the DJ that, <em>prima facie</em>, the pre-dominant sentencing consideration
                    in all cases of loan shark harassment, <em>a fortiori</em>
                    acts of harassment where there was mischief by fire, must be deterrence. The
                    Court must, however, especially where young offenders were involved, carefully
                    assess the facts in each case (see <em>Mok Ping Wuen
                        Maurice</em> at [21]) and not apply the general rule of deterrence as
                    a matter of course. There are many facets to public interest. It cannot be in
                    the public interest that every such young offender be incarcerated and be
                    exposed to the negative influences of hardened criminals in the prison
                    environment. The rehabilitation of the young, who have gone astray, is a
                    fundamental tenet of our society. If it is Parliament’s intention to take
                    away this option in relation to a particular offence or a category of offences,
                    then, this intention must be made clear. Considering all the facts and
                    circumstances in this case, including the nature and seriousness of the offence
                    and the Appellant’s potential for reform, it was my view that
                    rehabilitation still remained as the pre-dominant sentencing
                    consideration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     It seemed to me that in ruling out
                    rehabilitation for the Appellant, the DJ had not fully appreciated several
                    facets of the case. Firstly, while for the reasons alluded to in <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a> above, the DJ was correct to hold that the
                    offences committed by the Appellant were heinous, he had not given sufficient
                    consideration to the circumstances under which she became a runner for loan
                    sharks and why on being allowed to return home, she continued to be associated
                    with such criminals. Importantly, her degree of culpability must be acutely
                    assessed in the light of her surrounding circumstances. As stated in the
                    probationary and reformative training reports, the Appellant did not come from a
                    privileged background and her family was struggling to make ends meet. On the
                    evidence, it was my view that the Appellant started to work for the unlicensed
                    moneylenders out of desperation, rather than greed, in order to support herself.
                    In that frame of mind, she carried out what was <em>instructed</em> by the unlicensed moneylenders. As stated in
                        <em>Mok Ping Wuen Maurice</em> at [21], the courts
                    should presume that youths are impressionable and are unlikely to know the full
                    consequences of their actions. It seemed to me all the more so in this case. I
                    further venture to think that her family environment and violence could very
                    well have affected her value judgments on the propriety of her actions, and thus
                    contributed to her inability to fathom the full consequences of her actions. It
                    was not unlikely that the Appellant’s actions were acts of mischief
                    committed by an immature youth from a troubled home. These were circumstances
                    which were highly germane to determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed
                    on the Appellant. Here I would reiterate what V K Rajah J stated in <em>Tan Kay Beng v PP</em> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 10 at
                    [31]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">31    Deterrence must always be tempered by <em>proportionality</em> in relation to the <em>severity of the offence committed as well as by the moral
                                and legal culpability of the offender</em>. It is axiomatic
                            that a court must abstain from gratuitous loading in sentences.
                            …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Secondly, there was insufficient basis for the
                    DJ to come to the finding that the Appellant had minimal rehabilitative
                    prospects. The DJ held this view on the basis that the Appellant had lacked
                    familial support, had a history of substance abuse, and that she was physically
                    abused by her father, as set out in the Probation Report. In my view, the DJ
                    should have taken greater precautions in using the findings in a probation
                    report to justify his grounds for not sentencing the Appellant to reformative
                    training. In the Probation Report, it was understandable that probation was
                    found to be unsuitable since she lacked the familial support. Moreover, if she
                    were put on probation, it would also mean that the Appellant could continue
                    associating with negative peers, as she had done in the past. Unfortunately, the
                    DJ did not consider the Appellant’s rehabilitative prospects in the
                    context of reformative training. In sentencing the Appellant to imprisonment,
                    the DJ considered that rehabilitation was also possible in prison. With respect,
                    perhaps, the DJ did not wholly appreciate the corruptive environment and
                    stigmatisation that imprisonment would bring. More importantly, even if there
                    are rehabilitative elements or programmes in prison, they are clearly not
                    tailor-made for young offenders. In contrast to the DJ’s views, the
                    counsellor who prepared the Reformative Training Suitability Report did in fact
                    acknowledge that the Appellant could be reformed if she was put through
                    tailor-made programmes in reformative training. This was further corroborated in
                    the Probation Report where it was noted that the Appellant was amenable to
                    change, provided that she had close guidance and support and a firm and
                    structured environment to support her rehabilitation. Indeed, after her arrest,
                    the Appellant had expressed both remorse as well as the motivation to continue
                    studying to secure a well-paying job and to improve the circumstances of her
                    family. Having considered all these factors, it did not appear to me that there
                    was a sufficient basis for the DJ to hold that the Appellant had such minimal
                    rehabilitative prospects to preclude reformative training.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Therefore, while the offences committed by the
                    Appellant were serious, bearing in mind the circumstances of the case and the
                    reformative prospects of the Appellant, I came to the conclusion that this would
                    not be an appropriate case to depart from the norm of regarding rehabilitation
                    as the primary objective in the treatment of young offenders. I need hardly
                    state that there are various aspects to society’s interests. In my view,
                    it is certainly not in society’s interest to see that young offenders
                    become hardened criminals. On the contrary, society would want to see young
                    offenders turning over a new leaf to become law abiding citizens who will make
                    positive contributions to its development. See Stephen Billick &amp; Avram Mack,
                    “The Utility of Residential Treatment Programs in the Prevention and
                    Management of Juvenile Delinquency” in Adolescent Psychiatry, Vol 28
                    (The Analytic Press, 2004) p 95 at 96:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The modern juvenile justice system differs from the adult justice system
                        in three fundamental ways: (1) the importance of rehabilitation, (2) a focus
                        on the best interests of the juvenile, and (3) the degree of judicial
                        latitude. Rehabilitation is the ideal goal of the juvenile justice system.
                        ... there is an attention to the best interests of the adolescent because
                        society benefits when youths cease criminal behaviour and become productive
                        adults.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The future of a young offender, who is not shown to be a recalcitrant
                    offender, would be put at risk by the courts if he is not given a chance to
                    rehabilitate and is made to serve a prison term like a common criminal. While I
                    would not belittle the seriousness of the offences which the Appellant
                    committed, the interests of society would be better served if she was given the
                    chance to rehabilitate. I would reiterate that reformative training is not a
                    soft option. The young offender subject to that sentence, like a prison term,
                    would lose his or her freedom of movement. The period of institutional training
                    which the young offender would have to undergo is substantial, a minimum of 18
                    months and a maximum of 36 months. Reformative training provides the court with
                    a middle-ground that broadly encapsulates the twin principles of rehabilitation
                    and deterrence in relation to the young offender (see <em>Mohammad Al-Ansari</em> at [47], [57] and [58]). I therefore, with
                    respect, could not accept the Prosecution’s submission that an
                    imprisonment sentence is necessary in this case to reflect the greater
                    deterrence needed. I would reiterate the point I made above (at <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a>) that although Parliament had enacted tougher
                    measures for the offences relating to loan shark activities, it had not
                    expressed the view that probation or reformative training should be excluded for
                    young offenders for the same offences.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     It was for these reasons that I allowed the
                    appeal and substituted the prison term with reformative training. A question
                    arose as to whether I should backdate the reformative training to the date the
                    Appellant was first remanded. I did not think I should do so as that would not
                    be in line with the object of the statutory scheme of reformative training.
                    There is a minimum period of training which an offender subject to that regime
                    must undergo. Backdating would in effect be shortening the period of training
                    and would undermine or hinder the effectiveness of such a programme. I therefore
                    ordered the sentence to commence forthwith.</p>
