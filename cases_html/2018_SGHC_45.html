</div>
</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Under s 3 of the Trustees Act, the terms “trust” and “trustee” extend to constructive trusts.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Therefore, s 20(2) applies to constructive trustees.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Following the Administrators’ breaches of their duties as trustees, they held the Trust Monies on a constructive trust. Upon the Administrators’ death and/or retirement, the defendant took over as trustee of the Trust Monies that were held under a constructive trust.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 It was not clear why s 20(2) was relevant to the plaintiffs’ case. First, as stated earlier, Syed Mohamed died in 1971 leaving Syed Husain as the last surviving trustee under Shaik Abdulla’s will. Section 20(1) empowered Syed Hussain to perform the trust as sole trustee. Upon Syed Husain’s subsequent death in 1976, s 20(2) empowered the personal representatives of <span class="font-italic">Syed Husain</span> to exercise the powers given to or exercisable by Syed Husain, until new trustees were appointed. Section 20(2) would not apply to the defendant since Syed Mohamed was not the last surviving trustee. It was not alleged, and there was no evidence, that the defendant was the personal representative of Syed Husain.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Second, even if the defendant was a personal representative of the last surviving trustee, s 20(2) of the Trustees Act could not possibly make him a trustee of the Trust Monies by reason of this fact alone. In such a scenario, s 20(2) merely empowered the defendant to exercise or perform any power or trust given to, or capable of being exercised by the last surviving trustee in respect of the Trust Monies. If the defendant did not in fact exercise the powers of a trustee of the Trust Monies, s 20(2) would not make him a trustee. On the other hand, if the defendant did in fact take over as trustee of the Trust Monies (as the plaintiffs alleged), he would be liable as trustee because he did so; there would have been no need to rely on s 20(2).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 The plaintiffs referred me to <span class="font-italic">In re </span><span class="font-italic">Benett </span>[1906] Ch 216. In that case, Benett was the last surviving trustee under the will of Elizabeth Horne. Benett died intestate and insolvent. As he had previously committed a breach of trust, Benett’s estate became indebted to the trust under the will. Benett’s widow took out administration to his estate and became his personal representative. Under the will, the trustee’s personal representative could take over as trustee of the will. However, the court found that Benett’s widow had not accepted the office of trustee of the will. Consequently, the court held that she could not be compelled to exercise the right of retainer in favour of the beneficiaries under Elizabeth Horne’s will. The right of retainer (since abolished in England) was a right vested in Benett’s widow (as administrator of his estate) to retain assets out of Benett’s estate sufficient to pay any debt due from the estate to her in priority to other creditors of the estate. The plaintiffs sought to rely on the judgment of Cozens-Hardy LJ who said (at 233) that if the legal personal representative <span class="font-italic">fills the position of trustee</span> then he is compellable to exercise the right. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 <span class="font-italic">In re Benett</span> did not advance the plaintiffs’ case any further. The key question in the present case was whether the defendant did take over as (or fill the position of) trustee of the Trust Monies. The answer to this question depended on the evidence in this case. In my view, the plaintiff’s reliance on s 20(2) of the Trustees Act was neither here nor there.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Other miscellaneous issues</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The plaintiffs’ standing</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 The defendant’s main submission was that the Beneficiaries’ estates were the proper parties to bring this action and that the plaintiffs were not authorised to act for the Beneficiaries’ estates.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 I disagreed with the defendant. A beneficiary is entitled to claim reliefs on behalf of the estate: <span class="font-italic">Ching</span><span class="font-italic"> Chew Weng Paul v Ching Pui Sim and others</span> [2010] 2 SLR 76 at [58]. In this case, whether the plaintiffs were descendants of Shaik Abdulla and consequently beneficiaries under Shaik Abdulla’s will (albeit through the Beneficiaries) were issues that were more appropriate for trial. Further, any pleading inadequacies in this respect may be addressed through appropriate amendments to the statement of claim. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Limitation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 I disagreed with the defendant’s submission that the present action was time-barred under s 22(2) of the Limitation Act (Cap 163, 1996 Rev Ed). Under s 22(2), no action by a beneficiary to recover trust property or in respect of any breach of trust shall be brought after the expiration of six years from the date on which the right of action accrued. However, s 22(2) is expressly stated to be subject to s 22(1) which provides that no period of limitation prescribed by the Limitation Act applies to an action by a beneficiary under a trust (a) in respect of any fraud or fraudulent breach of trust to which the trustee was a party or privy or (b) to recover from the trustee trust property or the proceeds thereof in the possession of the trustee, or previously received by the trustee and converted to his use. In my view, the plaintiffs’ reliance on s 22(1) could not be said to be plainly unsustainable.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The plaintiffs’ reliance on the discovery process</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 The plaintiffs relied on “<span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Bunga Melati 5</span>” [2012] 4 SLR 546 in which the Court of Appeal cautioned<span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [75]) against speculating at an interlocutory stage on the evidence that might or might not surface during trial where the parties have had the benefit of discovery, interrogatory and cross-examination processes. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 In my view, <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Bunga Melati </span>did not assist the plaintiffs. In the present case, the plaintiffs did not have a single iota of evidence in support of their allegations that the Administrators failed to pay the rental incomes and/or the sale proceeds in respect of the Properties. They were not even the persons it was alleged that the Administrators had failed to make payment to and there was neither explanation nor evidence as to how they had any knowledge of such failure to make payment. All that the plaintiffs had were their bald assertions. Further, as shown earlier, their claims in respect of 58 and 61 Queen Street were entirely without substance in the light of the unrefuted documentary evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Under these circumstances, in my view, it would be an abuse of the process of the court to permit the plaintiffs to pursue these otherwise obviously unsustainable claims with nothing more than the hope that the discovery process might produce some evidence that might help their case. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the statement of claim disclosed a reasonable cause of action</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 It is trite that so long as the statement of claim or the particulars disclose some cause of action, or raise some question fit to be decided by a judge, the mere fact that the case is weak and not likely to succeed is no ground for striking it out under O 18 r 19(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 Although the plaintiffs’ claims could have been better pleaded in the statement of claim, in my view, this was not a case where it could be said that the statement of claim disclosed no reasonable cause of action. The statement of claim did plead that the defendant took over as trustee of the Trust Monies, that the defendant was aware that the Administrators held the Trust Monies on trust for the Beneficiaries and consequently the plaintiffs, and that the defendant dishonestly assisted the Administrators in attempting to conceal the Trust Monies from the Beneficiaries and plaintiffs in order to benefit themselves and the defendant.

</div> However, as discussed earlier, the plaintiffs’ claims ought to be struck out under O 18 r 19(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and/or (<span class="font-italic">d</span>), as they were plainly unsustainable and bound to fail.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 In my view, this was just an opportunistic action by the plaintiffs based on speculation and with no evidence to support their claims. I was satisfied that the plaintiffs’ claims were plainly unsustainable and ought to be struck out under O 18 r 19(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and/or (<span class="font-italic">d</span>). It would be unfair to the defendant to put him through a trial. Accordingly, I dismissed the appeal and ordered the plaintiffs to pay costs of the appeal fixed at $7,500 inclusive of disbursements.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Chua Lee Ming<br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Wong Hin Pkin Wendell, Priscylia Wu Baoyi, Wong Zi Qiang, Bryan (Drew &amp; Napier LLC) for the plaintiffs;<br/>Mohamed Ibrahim s/o Mohamed Yakub (Achievers LLC) for the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
