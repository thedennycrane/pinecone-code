Indeed, there is no indication that the drafters of the IRDA intended otherwise (see <span class="font-italic">Report of the Insolvency Law Review Committee: Final Report</span> (Chair: Lee Eng Beng SC) (2013)). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 Turning to the applicable principles, there are two distinct stages for a court to consider in determining whether to make a winding up order under s 125(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) of the IRDA. First, the applicant must establish that it is “just and equitable that the company be wound up”, which is the basis for invoking the court’s power to make a winding up order. Second, at the relief stage, supposing this ground is established, the court retains a residual discretion to consider whether, in the light of all relevant factors, including the utility and effect of a winding up order and the overall fairness and justice of the case, the company concerned should be wound up (see the Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Perennial (Capitol) Pte Ltd and another v Capitol Investment Holdings Pte Ltd and other appeals </span>[2018] 1 SLR 763 (“<span class="font-italic">Perennial</span>”) at [82]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The applicable law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 In relation to the first stage, it is trite that the foundation of the court’s power to order a winding up on the just and equitable ground is the notion of unfairness. However, while the words “just and equitable” are “words of the widest significance”, this broad phraseology does not give the court free rein to simply exercise its power in an unprincipled manner (see <span class="font-italic">Perennial </span>at [40]). It is therefore important to pay heed to the specific<span class="font-italic"> </span>kind of unfairness that the just and equitable ground is meant to address.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Three points underlie how unfairness operates in the context of s 125(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) of the IRDA. The first, as Lord Wilberforce recognised in the House of Lords decision of <span class="font-italic">Ebrahimi</span><span class="font-italic"> v Westbourne Galleries Ltd </span>[1973] AC 360 (“<span class="font-italic">Ebrahimi</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at 379, is that individuals in a company may have legitimate expectations as between themselves that are not necessarily submerged within the company structure. These legitimate expectations arise from the circumstances of the parties’ relationship and any understanding or expectations between them, and it is important to determine the true extent and content of the commercial agreement between the parties (see the High Court decisions of <span class="font-italic">Deniyal bin Kamis v Mapo Engineering Pte Ltd and others</span> [2023] SGHC 183 (“<span class="font-italic">Deniyal</span>”) at [90]; and <span class="font-italic">Lian Hwee Choo Phebe and another v Maxz Universal Development Group Pte Ltd and others and another suit</span> [2010] SGHC 268 at [61]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Second, the departure from such legitimate expectations may<span class="font-italic">, </span>in some circumstances, warrant the intervention of equitable considerations to suspend the usual operation of legal rights. In the words of Lord Wilberforce, these are considerations “of a personal character arising between one individual and another, which may make it unjust, or inequitable, to insist on legal rights, or to exercise them in a particular way” (see <span class="font-italic">Ebrahimi </span>at 379). Whether a case falls into such circumstances depends on various non-exhaustive factors, including whether there was: (a) an association formed or continued on the basis of a personal relationship, involving mutual confidence; (b) an agreement, or understanding, that all, or some (for there may be "sleeping" members), of the shareholders shall participate in the conduct of the business; and (c) a restriction upon the transfer of the members' interest in the company – so that if confidence is lost, or one member is removed from management, he cannot take out his stake and go elsewhere. Again, it is important to emphasise that these are non-exhaustive<span class="font-italic"> </span>factors that are not intended to constrain the analysis or delimit the circumstances in which equitable considerations may intervene (see the Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Chow Kwok Chuen</span><span class="font-italic"> v Chow Kwok Chi and another </span>[2008] 4 SLR(R) 362 (“<span class="font-italic">Chow Kwok Chuen</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [17]; and <span class="font-italic">Deniyal </span>at [90]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 Third, it is the breach of such legitimate expectations, alongside the inability of the applicant to exit the company despite the breach, that grounds a finding of unfairness. As the Court of Appeal observed in <span class="font-italic">Sim Yong Kim v Evenstar Investments Pte Ltd </span>[2006] 3 SLR(R) 827, the unfairness which justified the making of a winding up order on the just and equitable ground arose because the appellant’s legitimate expectation that his shares would be bought out was breached, and that the effect of the breach was to <span class="font-italic">trap the appellant in the </span><span class="font-italic">company</span> (at [42]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 It follows therefore that, even where the applicant belongs to a faction of the company which owns, or has control of, a majority of the shareholding, unfairness may still be established if the applicant is not able to the exit the company without the court’s intervention. On this point, the Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Chow Kwok Chuen</span>, where the court ordered a winding up of the family companies involved, is instructive. In that case, there was actual deadlock because the relationship of the three brothers who managed the companies as directors had deteriorated to the point where no two of them would be in agreement about the companies’ operations. While the odd number of three directors might suggest that the board should in theory be able to arrive at decisions by majority, this was a case of a three-way impasse in the companies’ management, and the management of the companies was at a stalemate. In view of the brothers’ equal contributions to the impasse, the court held that it would be unfair in the circumstances to allow the appellant, who held at least 25% of the issued shares in three companies and who was able to block any proposal for the voluntary winding up of the companies, to effectively freeze the assets of his other siblings who were in the majority. Therefore, the court held that winding up was the only solution. This decision shows that even if the applicant for the winding up order belongs to a faction of the company which constitutes the majority in the company, he may still be prevented from exiting the company, resulting in unfairness that would justify the making of a winding up order.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Conversely, having a mechanism for exit generally negates the unfairness required to justify winding up on the just and equitable ground (see <span class="font-italic">Perennial </span>at [49]–[51]), unless the exit mechanism in question is arbitrary, artificial, or contrary to the legitimate expectations of the parties (see <span class="font-italic">Perennial </span>at [67]). For instance, if the applicant is able to avail himself of a voluntary winding up of the company in question, this may negate the unfairness required for the purposes of s 125(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>). This point was alluded to by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Chow Kwok Chuen</span>, where the court made repeated references to the fact that the majority shareholders were not able to effect a voluntary winding up as they did not command at least 75% of the total shares of each company (at [2], [45], [47] and [48]). This suggests that if it is shown that the applicant could have put the company into a voluntary winding up, the court would generally require her to do so instead of seeking a winding up order under s 125(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 For completeness, I did not find TYH’s reliance on the Court of Appeal’s statements in <span class="font-italic">Ting Shwu Ping </span>to be relevant in the present case. The Court of Appeal noted:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">51     <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">If a shareholder has recourse to a share buy-out remedy under s 216 of the Act, should the decision to present a winding-up petition instead (for the purpose of obtaining a s 254(2A) remedy) be considered an abuse of process?</span> <span class="font-italic">Prima facie</span>, based on existing authorities, the answer should be “no”.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">52 … a court hearing a s 254(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) application would not be precluded from ordering winding up simply because a s 216 remedy would otherwise be available because there is no statutory requirement that a petitioner must first have pursued available alternative remedies. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">56  <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The question that arises is whether, in view of that concern, the court should hold that s 254(2A) is available only in the situation where the shareholder has no other recourse to a buy-out remedy.</span> To so hold contemplates finding an abuse of process where a shareholder brings a winding-up petition for the purpose of obtaining a s 254(2A) remedy even though he has alternative statutory recourse under s 216. However, this court in <span class="font-italic">Evenstar</span> ([36] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) and the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Tang</span><span class="font-italic"> Choon Keng</span> have held that the availability of alternative remedies does not preclude the possibility of a successful winding up petition; from this, it must follow that the mere fact of available alternative remedies does not render a winding up petition an abuse of process. It is possible to argue, however, that the introduction of s 254(2A) changes the analysis somewhat.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original omitted; emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Relying on these statements, TYH submitted that the availability of alternative remedies did not preclude the possibility of a successful winding up application, as there is no statutory requirement that an applicant must have first pursued alternative remedies. As such, it was said that the availability of alternative mechanisms such as a voluntary winding up did not prevent the court from ordering the winding up of the Company where the test for the grant of such an order was met.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 However, TYH’s reliance on <span class="font-italic">Ting Shwu Ping </span>was misconceived. Read in context, the Court of Appeal was addressing the issue of whether it is an abuse of process for a shareholder to present a winding up application for the purposes of obtaining a share buy-out remedy under s 254(2A) of the Companies Act 2006 (presently s 125(3) of the IRDA) when he already has recourse to a share buy-out remedy under s 216 of the same Act (see <span class="font-italic">Ting Shwu Ping </span>at [51]). This was completely different from the issue engaged in the present application, which concerned whether TYH could demonstrate unfairness justifying the winding up of the company under s 125(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) of the IRDA if he was able to exit the company without the court’s intervention.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">TYH did not face unfairness as he could have availed himself of a voluntary winding up to exit the Company</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 I found therefore that there was no unfairness to TYH that would justify a winding up order under s 125(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) as he could have put the Company in voluntary winding up. He, acting with the other siblings, are majority shareholders who could have put the Company into voluntary winding up. There was therefore nothing preventing TYH and his two other sisters from exiting the Company. In this regard, TYH broadly raised two objections, to which I now turn.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 First, TYH argued that a voluntary winding up would not be practical or viable because the Company was unable to sell the Property and the Other Property held on trust for the Company without TJS’s agreement or cooperation as TJS was the registered legal co-owner of the properties (see [6] above).
                   <sup><button class="btn btn-link superscript-btn" data-target="#fn-71375fde-3b23-4df8-adce-af12e372f03a" data-toggle="modal" type="button">37</button></sup>

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> However, it was incumbent on the Company, as the beneficial owner of the properties, to pursue legal recourse against TJS. Such legal recourse might be to compel TJS to sell the properties in her capacity as a trustee, or for the properties to be absolutely vested in the Company pursuant to the rule in <span class="font-italic">Saunders v Vautier </span>(1841) 4 Beav 115. Indeed, if TYH sought the winding up of the Company, it was unclear why it would be unfair to require TYH and the Company to avail themselves of the legal rights and mechanisms which are available to them, instead of attempting to circumvent the whole process by relying on the court’s just and equitable jurisdiction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 As Lord Wilberforce stressed in <span class="font-italic">Ebrahimi</span> at 379, “the ‘just and equitable’ provision does not … entitle one party to disregard the obligation he assumes by entering a company, nor the court to dispense him from it”. In other words, the court’s power to make a winding up order under s 125(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) is one which is only appropriately exercised in situations where it would be unfair to insist on the strict exercise of legal rights and mechanisms. It follows that, if there is no unfairness occasioned to the applicant, equitable considerations should not supersede the ordinary application of those legal rights and mechanisms. In the present case, TYH had not shown how requiring him to cause the Company to pursue legal recourse against TJS with the aim of selling the properties before a voluntary winding up would be unfair to him. Accordingly, it was inappropriate to exercise the just and equitable jurisdiction of the court to make a winding up order. It was not even evident why a compulsory winding up by the court, as opposed to a voluntary winding up, would better achieve the goal of selling the properties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Second, TYH also contended that the passing of a special resolution for the voluntary winding up of the Company was not the end of the matter.

</div> Given that the issue of a settlement agreement was a key focus of the solicitors’ correspondence, one would have expected TYH’s solicitors to raise objections in the 19 February 2016 letter if there was no binding agreement concluded by then. That they did not protest against the assertion that the Alleged Settlement Agreement had been concluded was strongly probative of its truth.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Lastly, by the admission of TYH’s own solicitors in its letter dated 16 July 2019, there was no doubt that the Alleged Settlement Agreement had been concluded.

This statement was made by TYH’s solicitors, who represented TYH in the negotiation process between TYH and TJS and who would be best apprised of the state of negotiations. Furthermore, there could be no doubt that TYH’s solicitors appreciated the legal significance of their words, and indeed the references to a binding agreement concluded between TYH and TJS were unequivocal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 While TYH rightly pointed out there were remaining issues to be resolved, I did not think that this detracted from the finding that the Alleged Settlement Agreement had been concluded. As the Court of Appeal observed in <span class="font-italic">R1 International Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Lonstroff AG </span>[2015] 1 SLR 521 at [52], it is not uncommon for parties to first agree on a set of essential terms which they may be bound by as a matter of law and on the basis of which they may act, even while there may be ongoing discussions on the incorporation of other detailed terms. I found this to be the case here. There might have been remaining issues relating to the valuation of properties

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 In the premises, I found, as a starting point, that TYH made an offer with the terms contained in the December 2014 Letter, which was accepted by TJS in August 2015. This made it unnecessary to decide whether any part performance by TYH and TJS evidenced the existence of the Alleged Settlement Agreement. However, the question remained whether the Alleged Settlement was validly concluded. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">However, the Alleged Settlement Agreement was void for common mistake at common law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 In the circumstances, I declared the Alleged Settlement Agreement to be void on the basis of common mistake at common law. This was because the agreement rested on an incorrect premise that both parties shared when entering into the agreement. Of importance to this finding was cl 1 of the Alleged Settlement Agreement, which provided that TYH would transfer his “entire legal and beneficial interest” in the Property to TJS. It further provided that TJS would be “released [from] any duties and obligations arising out of and in respect of any Trusts previously declared by [TJS] … with respect to [the Property]”.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 While cl 1 provided that TYH would transfer his “entire legal and beneficial<span class="font-italic"> </span>interest” in the Property, TYH did not have any beneficial interest in the Property. Indeed, it will be recalled that TYH and TJS were the legal co-owners of the Property, and they held the Property on trust for the Company (see [6] above). The beneficial interest of the Property thus resided solely with the Company. Put simply, this term was incapable of being performed by TYH from the outset.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 I now turn to the question of what the legal effect of such misapprehension was. In my judgment, the doctrine of common mistake at common law would apply here to render the Alleged Settlement Agreement void. The five elements that must be satisfied for this vitiating factor to apply are summarised in the Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Olivine Capital Pte Ltd and another </span><span class="font-italic">v Chia Chin Yan and another matter </span>[2014] 2 SLR 1371 (“<span class="font-italic">Olivine Capital</span>”) at [66], citing the English Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Great Peace Shipping Ltd v Tsavliris Salvage (International) Ltd </span>[2003] QB 679 at [76]:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) there must be a common assumption as to the existence of a state of affairs;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) there must be no warranty by either party that that state of affairs exists;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) the non-existence of the state of affairs must not be attributable to the fault of either party;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(d) the non-existence of the state of affairs must render performance of the contract impossible; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(e) the state of affairs may be the existence, or a vital attribute, of the consideration to be provided or circumstances which must subsist if performance of the contractual adventure is to be possible.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Applying these principles, I found that the Alleged Settlement Agreement was void for common mistake at common law. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 First, I was satisfied that cl 1 of the December 2014 Letter, which formed part of TYH’s offer, reflected a mistaken assumption on TYH’s part that he owned both the legal and beneficial interest of the Property. This mistaken assumption was shared by TJS when she accepted the offer as contained in the December 2014 Letter without qualification. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Second, I found that there was no warranty by either party that this state of affairs existed. While the December 2014 Letter originated from TYH’s solicitors, I did not think that this should not be taken as a warranty from TYH that he owned any beneficial interest in the Property. Both TYH and TJS were co-owners of the Company holding the Property on trust for it, and being legally advised, they were both in as good a position to know that TYH did not own the beneficial interest of the Property. Therefore, it could not be said that TYH warranted to TJS that he owned any beneficial interest in the Property as TJS would have already known beforehand that this was not the case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Third, it could not be said that it was the fault of either party that TYH was not a beneficial owner of the Property. The trusteeship arrangement came about as a result of the late Mr Tan’s instructions, which TYH and TJS merely followed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 As regards the fourth and fifth elements, it was clear that TYH could not perform the Alleged Settlement Agreement as he had no beneficial interest to transfer: <span class="font-italic">nemo dat quod non habet</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(that is, no one can give what they do not have). It was also apparent that the purported outcome of the Alleged Settlement Agreement, which was for TJS to be the absolute owner of the Property and, in the words of cl 1, “released from any duties and obligations arising out of and in respect of any Trusts previously declared”, was dependent on the mistaken assumption that TYH owned some beneficial interest in the Property that he could transfer to TJS. In other words, this assumption was vital to the performance of the Alleged Settlement Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 As the five elements in <span class="font-italic">Olivine Capital </span>were made out, I found that the Alleged Settlement Agreement was void. It followed that specific performance of cl 1 could not be granted, and accordingly I dismissed OA 74 in its entirety. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Neither side of this dispute succeeded in their applications before me. Indeed, this was an unfortunate dispute involving members of a family, who have been unable to reconcile their differences for a long time. Normally, in such situations, I would have preferred to allow parties to have a clean break, but I am duty bound to apply the law in accordance with its intended purposes. I fear, however, with the dismissal of the applications, that the parties will continue to expend time and cost in pursuing their respective claims. It might be better for them to consider a resolution out of court, which would entail compromise on both sides.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Aedit Abdullah<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Kang Kok Boon, Favian (Jiang Guowen) (Adelphi Law Chambers LLC) for the plaintiff in HC/CWU 50/2022 and the defendant in HC/OA 74/2022;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Tan Bar Tien (B T Tan &amp; Co) for the non-party in HC/CWU 50/2022 and the claimant in HC/OA 74/2022.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
