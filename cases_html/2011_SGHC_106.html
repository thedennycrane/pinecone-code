<p class="Judg-Author">
        Lai Siu Chiu J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       It has been two years since Wang Zeng Ming
                    (“the deceased”) at 21 years of age passed away on 18 April 2009.
                    The deceased, a national of the People’s Republic of China, was the son of
                    Ma Shoudong and Wang Jijin (“the respondents”). The respondents
                    did not have the closure they probably expected when the Assistant Commissioner
                    for Labour (“the Commissioner”) awarded them $140,000 (“the
                    Award”) on 28 October 2010 under the Work Injury Compensation Act (Cap
                    354, 2009 Rev Ed) (“the Act”) for their son’s untimely
                    demise. That was because the deceased’s employer Singapore Airport
                    Terminal Services Limited (“SATS”) and its co-insurers Allianz
                    Insurance Co (Singapore) Pte Ltd and Singapore Aviation and General Insurance Co
                    Pte Ltd (who are the first and second appellants respectively), chose to appeal
                    against the Award, thereby prolonging the respondents’ grief. Given
                    China’s one child policy, it was highly unlikely that the deceased had any
                    siblings. No amount of compensation let alone the Award, would have consoled the
                    respondents in their irreplaceable loss if the deceased had been their only
                    child.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Since about July 2007, the deceased had worked
                    as a cabin service assistant for SATS (which is the third appellant in this
                    action). His job was to deliver food and beverages from the SATS catering
                    building to aeroplanes. On the day of his death, the deceased was working with a
                    colleague Lee Keok Chuan (“Lee”). The pair made deliveries to two
                    aeroplanes. For the third delivery which was to a bigger aeroplane than to the
                    first two aeroplanes, the pair loaded about 3 – 4 containers and 8 –
                    10 oven racks onto trolleys. Each container and oven rack weighed up to 25
                    kilograms. The trolleys were then wheeled to, and loaded onto a nearby delivery
                    truck. The pair subsequently accompanied the delivery truck to the aeroplane and
                    assisted in the unloading of the trolleys. The entire delivery took around
                    1½ hours. After completing the delivery, the deceased went to the
                    designated resting area for a short break. At around 7.45pm he vomited and
                    collapsed. An ambulance promptly arrived to take him to the hospital but he was
                    pronounced dead at 8.50pm.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The issue before the Commissioner was whether
                    the death had been caused by an accident that arose out of and in the course of
                    the deceased’s employment pursuant to s 3(1) of the Act; the Commissioner
                    held that it was and accordingly made the Award.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       It was common ground between the parties that
                    the deceased had the congenital condition of Myocardial Bridging, where the
                    coronary arteries tunnel into the muscle of the heart instead of resting on top
                    of it at the endocardium. The respondents’ expert witness was Associate
                    Professor Gilbert Lau (“Professor Lau”), a senior consultant
                    forensic pathologist at the Health Sciences Authority. He gave evidence that it
                    was likely that the physical strain of the deceased’s work exacerbated his
                    heart condition which then caused him to suffer cardiac arrest or a lethal
                    episode of cardiac arrhythmia. The appellants disputed Professor Lau’s
                    evidence. Their own expert witness Dr Baldev Singh (“Dr Singh”), a
                    cardiologist in private practice, testified that the deceased’s heart
                    condition was generally benign. Given the amount of time the deceased had to
                    rest after the third delivery and the non-strenuous nature of the job, Dr Singh
                    opined that it was more likely than not that the deceased had suffered from an
                    unpredictable and random attack of “sudden death
                syndrome”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The Commissioner preferred Professor Lau’s
                    evidence. Accordingly, he found that the <em>appellants</em> had failed to discharge their burden of proof to show
                    that the death had <em>not</em> arisen out of the
                    deceased’s employment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The appellants filed Originating Summons No 1158
                    of 2010 (“the OS”) on 11 November 2010 appealing against the Award
                    and prayed for it to be set aside and for the Commissioner’s decision to
                    be reversed. Two grounds for the appeal were set out in the OS. First, it was
                    said that the Commissioner was wrong to have reversed the burden of proof. This
                    ground required an analysis of s 3 of the Act. Second, it was alleged that the
                    Commissioner reached the wrong finding of fact. This ground concerned the
                    application of s 29(2A) of the Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">First ground of appeal: reversal of the burden of proof</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       An employer’s liability for compensation
                    is imposed by s 3(1) of the Act which reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Employer’s liability for
                        compensation</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>3</b>. – (1) If in any employment personal
                        injury by accident arising out of <em>and</em> in the
                        course of employment is caused to an employee, his employer shall be liable
                        to pay compensation in accordance with the provisions of this Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Section 3(1) must be read with s 3(6) which states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(6) For the purposes of this Act, an <em>accident</em> arising <em>in the course</em>
                        of an employee’s employment shall be deemed, in the absence of
                        evidence to the contrary, to have arisen <em>out
                            of</em> that employment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Section 3(6) is very much a local innovation. It
                    was not present in the Act’s predecessor the Workmen’s Compensation
                    Ordinance (9 of 1932) and was added only in the Workmen’s Compensation
                    Ordinance (31 of 1954) as s 4(5). The presumption was described by the Acting
                    Commissioner for Labour (<em>Proceedings of the Second
                        Legislative Council of the Colony of Singapore</em>,
                        4<sup>th</sup> Session 1954/1955, (15 June 1954) at B142)
                    as:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Perhaps the most important change proposed is in the law itself. Under the
                        existing legislation a workman, to obtain compensation, has to prove that
                        the accident arose both out of and in the course of his employment. Under
                        the present proposals the workman must still prove that the accident arose
                        in the course of his employment, but the onus of proving that it did not
                        arise out of his employment will rest on the employer if he holds that the
                        claimant is not entitled to benefit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Section 4(5) (as it was) did more than simply
                    create a rebuttable presumption for the employee’s benefit. It also
                    unintentionally clarified the local position on two issues of interpretation
                    arising from what is now s 3(1). First, it was now clear that “arising
                    out of” and “arising in the course of” are two separate and
                    distinct concepts. This pertinent distinction stands in contrast to a line of
                    cases which suggested that “arising out of and in the course of”
                    could be regarded as a <em>single</em> term of art. In
                        <em>McLauchlan v Anderson</em> [1911] SC 529, a man
                    stumbled and fell as he climbed down from his wagon to retrieve a pipe which he
                    had dropped. The wagon ran over and killed him. The Lord President conceded the
                    theoretical distinction between “arising out of” and
                    “arising in the course of” but said (at 532) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In a great many cases, however, the two phrases do not admit of separate
                        consideration; and the present is one of those cases. If this accident took
                        place in the course of the workman’s employment, it also indubitably
                        arose out of that employment; if not, not.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Second, it was also clear from the wording of
                    s 4(5) (as it was) that it is the <em>accident</em> alone
                    that has to arise out of and in the course of the employment. This is in
                    contrast to the House of Lords decision in <em>Fenton v J Thorley
                        &amp; Co., Limited</em> [1903] AC 443 where Lord Macnaghten held that
                    (in relation to the Workmen’s Compensation Act 1897) the phrase
                    “injury by accident” was intended to be a compound phrase (at
                    448):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Then comes the question, Do the words “arising out of and in the
                        course of the employment” qualify the word “accident”
                        or the word “injury” or the compound expression “injury
                        by accident”? I rather think the latter view is the correct
                        one.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The consequence of s 3(6) is that, as the
                    judge in <em>NTUC Income Insurance Co-operative Ltd and another v
                        Next of kin of Narayasamy s/o Ramasamy, deceased</em> [2006] SGHC 162
                    (at [20]) (“the <em>NTUC Income</em> case”) observed, s 3(1) requires the
                    employee to prove three conditions:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_a"></a>(a)     he has suffered a personal
                        injury;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_b"></a>(b)     the
                        injury was caused by an accident; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_c"></a>(c)     the <em>accident</em> arose out of
                            <em>and</em> in the course of his
                        employment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The first condition was not disputed by the
                    appellants: the personal injury suffered by the deceased was his death. The
                    second condition was also <em>not</em> in dispute. The
                    appellants conceded that the cardiac arrest/lethal arrhythmia which caused the
                    death was an “accident” within the meaning of s 3(1). In other
                    words, the parties were in agreement that the respondents had shown that the
                    personal injury (death) was caused by an accident (cardiac arrest/lethal
                    arrhythmia). The only point of contention was whether the third condition had
                    been satisfied – the appellants argued that the respondents had not proven
                    that the cardiac arrest/lethal arrhythmia arose out of <em>and</em> in the course of the deceased’s employment. This is
                    where s 3(6) of the Act comes into play. Once it is proven that the accident
                    arose <em>in the course</em> of employment, it will be
                    presumed that the accident also arose <em>out of</em> his
                    employment. The operation of s 3(6) effects a limited shift of the burden of
                    proof from the respondents to the appellants by requiring the employer to show
                    that although the accident arose <em>in the course</em> of
                    employment, it nonetheless did not arise <em>out of</em>
                    the employment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     It was the appellants’ case that since
                    the respondents had not proven that the accident arose <em>in the
                        course</em> of employment, the Commissioner was wrong to <em>apply</em> the presumption under s 3(6) and, if the
                    presumption did not apply, the Commissioner should not have shifted the burden
                    of proof onto the appellants. The success of this appeal hinged entirely on the
                    question of law: what does “arising in the course of employment”
                    mean?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Courts have, over the decades, grappled with
                    the meaning of the phrase “arising out of and in the course of
                    employment”. The relationship between the two arms of the phrase was well
                    described by Lord Finlay LC in the House of Lords’ case of <em>Charles R Davidson and Company v M’Robb or Officer</em>
                    [1918] AC 304 where he said (at 314 – 315):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“Arising out of the employment” obviously means arising out
                        of the work which the man is employed to do and what is incident to it
                        – in other words, out of his service. “In the course of
                        employment” must mean, similarly, in the course of the work which the
                        man is employed to do, and what is incident to it – in other words, in
                        the course of his service...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The words “and in the course of” were probably added for
                        this reason. If the nerve or agility of a workman were impaired by the
                        conditions of his work and in consequence he met with an accident in the
                        street which he would have avoided but for the impairment of his health
                        occasioned by his work, the accident might be said to arise “out of
                        the employment”. The same thing might be said in the case of an
                        accident which he would have escaped but for fatigue induced by working
                        overtime. The introduction of such claims is prevented by the words
                        “in the course of the employment.” Such an accident as above
                        suggested, though it may arise out of the work, would not be in the course
                        of the work.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     On the authorities, it is clear that an
                    accident arising <em>out of</em> the employment requires a
                    causal connection between (i) the employment (and its incidents) and (ii) the
                    accident. A direct or physical causation is not necessary: <em>Smith v The Australian Woollen Mills Limited</em> (1933) 50 CLR 504
                    per Starke J at 517-518. But the causative standard is higher than the
                    “but for” test. The accident must have arisen because of some
                    intrinsic risk in the nature of the employment. As Lord Sumner put it in
                        <em>Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway v Highley</em>
                    [1917] AC 352 (at 372):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Was it part of the injured person’s employment to hazard, to suffer,
                        or to do that which caused his injury?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In contrast, an accident arises in the course
                    of the employment if it bears a temporal relationship with the employment. A
                    simple test would be whether the accident occurs, as a matter of common sense,
                    while the employee is at work. An elaboration of this test was provided by Lord
                    Wright in <em>Weaver v Tredegar Iron and Coal Company,
                        Limited</em> [1940] AC 955 (at 973):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It has long been held that the course of the employment is not determined
                        by the time at which a man is actually occupied on his work. There may be
                        intermissions during the working hours when he is not actually working as,
                        for instance, times for meals or refreshments, or absences for personal
                        necessities. And the course of the employment may begin or end some little
                        time before or after he has downed tools or ceased actual work.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Keeping in mind the reasoning of the
                    abovementioned authorities, the appellants’ contention that an accident
                    only arises <em>in the course</em> of employment if there
                    is a causative link between the two is clearly misconceived. Further, the two
                    authorities relied upon by the appellants did not assist them. The first was
                        <em>Ormond v C D Holmes &amp; Co Ltd</em> [1937] 2 All
                    ER 795. The case was irrelevant as it turned <em>solely</em> on whether the second attack was an
                    “accident” under the Workmen’s Compensation Act 1925 (at 800
                    and 807). The second was an English Court of Appeal decision in <em>Hawkins v Powells Tillery Steam Coal Company, Limited</em>
                    [1911] 1 KB 988 (“<em>Hawkins</em>”). The
                    critical issue there was whether the heart attack that killed the employee had
                    been <em>caused</em> by his employment <em>or</em> other factors. The Court of Appeal held it was not caused by
                    the employee’s work in a colliery but by his own diseased heart condition.
                    Consequently, <em>Hawkins</em> does not support the
                    appellants’ contention. If it does, it should be taken to have been
                    overruled by the subsequent two House of Lords cases cited above at <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a> and <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     In the present case, it was undisputed that
                    the cardiac arrest/lethal arrhythmia that killed the deceased occurred while he
                    was at work. It follows that the accident arose <em>in the
                        course</em> of his employment. Hence the Commissioner was entitled to
                    find that pursuant to s 3(6) of the Act, the burden of proof shifted to the
                    appellants to prove that the accident had <em>not</em>
                    arisen <em>out of</em> the deceased’s employment.
                    Consequently, I dismiss the first ground of appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Second ground of appeal: the Commissioner’s finding of
                fact</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The Commissioner, after weighing the competing
                    evidence had concluded as a fact that the appellants had failed to rebut the
                    presumption under s 3(6) of the Act. The appellants contended that the
                    Commissioner’s finding of fact was wrong. The appellants are faced with s
                    29(2A) of the Act which reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Appeal from decision of Commissioner</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2A) No appeal shall lie against any order unless a substantial question
                        of law is involved in the appeal and the amount in dispute is not less than
                        $1,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     As Kan Ting Chiu J observed in <em>Karuppiah Ravichandran v GDS Engineering Pte Ltd and
                        another</em> [2009] 3 SLR(R) 1028, s 29(2A) reflects the policy that
                    decisions of the Commissioner are not to be examined as though they are
                    decisions of a court of law. The purpose of the Act must be kept in mind. As the
                    Minister said (<em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates</em>,
                        <em>Official Report</em> (22 January 2008) volume 84 at
                    column 259):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Workmen’s Compensation Act or WCA provides a simpler and quicker way
                        to settle compensation claims by avoiding protracted legal
                        proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Kan Ting Chiu J was therefore correct in
                    emphasising (at [16]) that findings of
                    fact fall within s 29(2) only if they are findings that <em>no</em> person would have come to if he had applied the law properly.
                    The standard is higher than a manifestly wrong finding of fact. So the question
                    that arises is whether the Commissioner’s finding that the presumption
                    under s 3(6) was not rebutted was one that <em>no</em>
                    person would have come to if he had properly applied the relevant
                law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The evidence before the Commissioner may be
                    summarised as follows: There was some dispute over how strenuous the
                    deceased’s work was. On one side was the evidence of Lee that the work he
                    and the deceased were engaged in was strenuous. It was Professor Lau’s
                    opinion that strenuous work coupled with the deceased’s heart condition
                    was the reason for the cardiac arrest/lethal arrhythmia. That was so even though
                    the deceased collapsed only some time after he had begun his break. On the other
                    side was the arm-chair evidence of the deceased’s supervisors and managers
                    that the work the deceased did was not strenuous. It was Dr Singh’s
                    opinion that the deceased’s heart condition was generally benign, and that
                    his collapse was best explained by an inexplicable and random occurrence of
                    “sudden death syndrome”. The Commissioner preferred the evidence
                    of Lee and Professor Lau because Lee being a co-worker had personal experience
                    of the nature of the deceased’s duties and because Professor Lau appeared
                    to be the more reliable witness. This was clearly not a decision which no person
                    would have come to had he properly applied the relevant law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The appellants in their closing submissions
                    before the Commissioner (at [59]) had argued that “a litigation
                    lawyer’s work entails far greater challenges physically (not to mention
                    mentally) given their need to carry heavy voluminous documents to court”.
                    This flippant and insensitive submission should never have been made; it was a
                    mockery of the sanctity of life and would have greatly upset the respondents had
                    they come to know of it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In light of the observations in [22], it follows that the appellants’
                    second ground of appeal was outside the ambit of s 29(2A) of the Act and must
                    also be dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Before I conclude this judgment, I should
                    address one final issue. Counsel for the appellants had raised a preliminary
                    issue at the commencement of the hearing. He submitted that the Commissioner had
                    written his grounds of decision (dated 21 February 2011) with one eye on the
                    grounds of appeal as was evident where he said (at [35]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the preparation of my Grounds of Decision, I have had the opportunity
                        to peruse OS 1158/2010 by filed the Respondents containing the grounds of
                        their appeal. In summary, the Respondents assert that the decision in favour
                        of the claimants is wrong for the following broad reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">a</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">I had failed to appreciate that the burden in
                            proving each and every ingredient of this claim under Section 3(1) of
                            the Work Injury Compensation Act lies with the Claimants and not the
                            Respondents;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">b</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">I had erred in law and in fact by preferring the
                            evidence of Dr Lau over Dr Singh and thereby finding that the death
                            arose out of and in the course of employment.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Commissioner then proceeded to deal with the issues listed at
                    (a) and (b). Counsel for the appellants complained that the Commissioner’s
                    grounds of decision had wrongly embarked on an <em>ex post
                        facto</em> analysis to refute the appellants’ grounds of appeal.
                    He submitted that the right course of action should have been for the grounds of
                    decision to simply expand on the Commissioner’s brief oral grounds.
                    Consequently, he requested the court to disregard the Commissioner’s
                    “irregular” grounds of decision in its entirety as it amounted to
                    a justification of the Commissioner’s decision – the court should
                    only refer to the notes of evidence and submissions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Whilst it was indeed unfortunate that the
                    Commissioner referred to the OS in his grounds of decision, that by itself was
                    no reason for the court to disregard the document altogether. All that was
                    required was for the court to ignore the offending paragraph. Without that, the
                    decision could still stand on its own. In this regard, the old case of <em>Loh Kwang Seang v Public Prosecutor</em> [1960] MLJ 271cited
                    by the appellants has no relevance. This can be seen from holding no. 4 in that
                    case which reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is not permissible for a trial court having signed and delivered its
                        grounds of decision to the appellants to supplement the grounds of decision
                        or amplifying them in any way. The conduct of the learned President in
                        amplifying his grounds by adding a further 27 lines of typewritten material
                        to it was both irregular and improper but it was not such conduct as can be
                        said to have occasioned a miscarriage of justice or such as could be said to
                        warrant or require or even justify the trial being regarded a nullity and
                        the conviction being quashed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In our case, the Commissioner did not issue his grounds of decision
                    before 21 February 2011. By definition, he could not be accused of supplementing
                    any <em>previous</em> grounds of decision. More
                    importantly, the issues in the grounds of decision substantively reflected his
                    oral grounds. The Commissioner only said (see N/E 99):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I rule in favour of the [respondents]. Brief oral grounds. The burden of
                        proof was mainly on the [appellants] as the deceased passed away in the
                        course of employment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Ultimately, the physical efforts of the deceased too proximate to the time
                        of death. On the issue of medical evidence, I prefer to the evidence of Dr
                        Lau. His position takes into account the fact that physical condition differ
                        from person to person. This is as opposed to Dr Singh who categorically
                        insists on this 10 minute timeframe. Even on this 10 minute timeframe, he
                        departs and cannot hold the position.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Ultimately, the level of proof required is on a balance of probabilities
                        and not beyond a reasonable doubt and I find that the [respondents] have
                        proved their case so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Contrary to the appellants’ submission, the Commissioner’s
                    grounds of decision did amplify his brief oral grounds. He did not as they
                    complained, make “a <em>de facto</em>
                    Respondents’ Case in answer to the Grounds of
                Appeal”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Consequently, I dismiss the OS with costs to
                    the respondents to be taxed unless otherwise agreed.</p>
