<strong>Judgment</strong>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">1. At the conclusion of this trial, I awarded judgment to the plaintiff on her

claim against her brother and niece, the first and second defendants respectively. The first

defendant has now appealed against my decision (in Civil Appeal No. 600077 of 2001). He has also

filed a separate appeal (in Civil Appeal No. 600078 of 2001) against my dismissal of his application

(in summons in chambers no. 1120 of 2001/T) for:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(i) stay of these proceedings on the ground of <i>forum non conveniens</i>

  based on the fact that the plaintiff's/first defendant's sister [Indiana Lumban Gaol] has

  proceedings pending in the District Court of Central Jakarta, for determination of inter alia all

  issues in this suit;</p>
<p align="justify">(ii) alternatively, that the action be dismissed on the ground that the

  plaintiff has no <i>locus standi</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

The facts</p>
<p></p></i>2.    The plaintiff and the defendants are members of the Batak ethnic group

of Tapanuli in Indonesia and are Christians. Their father Mangara Tua Lumban Gaol died on 8

September 1986 while their mother Dumatiar Sitompul (Sitompul) died on 19 July 1999. The plaintiff

is the youngest of the 3 siblings; all the siblings are married, with the plaintiffs sister

marrying outside the Batak clan.<i xmlns="">
<p></p></i>3.    The plaintiffs parents set up a pharmaceutical business PT Gandha

(the business) in Jakarta in 1954. The business grew over the years and expanded to include several

outlets as well as a factory which manufactures medicines for sale. Another company PT Indonesian

Drug House (the company) was set up in Jakarta in 1955 to distribute the medicines manufactured by

the business. After the death of the plaintiffs father, Sitompul headed the business and became

the matriarch of the family. She obtained a declaration from the Indonesian courts on 5 November

1986 (see AB14-19) that she and her three (3) children were the heirs of his estate. I will return

to this document and its significance later.

<p xmlns="">4.    The plaintiff was appointed a Komisaris of the company in 1987 and of the

business in 1995, a position akin to that of a controller; Sitompul was the companys President

Director (Direktor Utama). The plaintiffs sister Indiana, a trained pharmacist, is in charge of

the production of medicines in the business. The first defendant is also a Komisaris but, according

to the plaintiff, he does not do any work for the business nor does he go to the office. The

plaintiffs function of Komisaris is that of general manager; she runs the business and the

company including managing the staff, supervising the financial and accounting aspects, negotiating

business contracts and taking care of administrative work. When Sitompul was about 70 years of age,

she stopped going to the factory and the shop outlets although she continued to make important

decisions for the business/company and to give directions. She left the day to day operations to the

plaintiff.</p>
<p xmlns="">5.    Upon her death, Sitompul left a large estate which consisted of various

landed properties in Indonesia, shares in Indonesian companies, cash in bank accounts maintained

with banks in Indonesia and Singapore and of course the business and the company. It was the

plaintiffs contention that Sitompul died intestate whereas the first defendant contended she left

a will.</p>
<p xmlns="">6.    The subject of these proceedings are three (3) Asian Currency unit accounts

which Sitompul had opened with banks in Singapore; these are:-

</p><ol type="i" xmlns="">
<li>a joint account in her and the first defendants name with Bank of America no. 30292-01 (the

    first BOA account) containing about US$400,000;</li>
<li>a joint account in her and the plaintiffs name with Bank of America no. 30293-01 (the

    second BOA account) which contained about US$200,000;</li>
<li>a joint account in her name and the names of the plaintiff and the second defendant with

    Citibank (the Citibank account) which account contained about US$1m at the material time and now

    has a balance of about US$300,000.</li>
</ol>
<p xmlns="">7.    According to the plaintiff, the Citibank account was opened on 30 December

1997 initially in the names of Sitompul and herself only. The mandate required for withdrawal was

either partys signature. Although Sitompul had informed the plaintiff that upon her death, the

plaintiff could withdraw the money in the Citibank account, the latter considered the money to be

the mothers as Sitompul had put in all the monies; hence the plaintiff regarded the monies in the

Citibank account as belonging to the estate of Sitompul.</p>
<p xmlns="">8.    The second defendant was added as a signatory to the Citibank account only

in May 1999 when the plaintiff visited Singapore with Sitompul, Indiana and her daughter and, the

second defendant with her brother. The purpose of the visit was for Sitompul to have a health

check-up and, because of the political upheaval in connection with the then elections in Indonesia,

the family decided to stay in Singapore for a month until the violence in Indonesia subsided. The

plaintiff was not told why Sitompul wanted to add the second defendants name to the Citibank

account. Neither did Sitompul inform the plaintiff how the monies in the accounts should be

distributed after her death.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9.    In August 1999, after Sitompuls demise, the first

defendant requested the plaintiff to add his name to the Citibank account. This was after the

funeral rites according to Batak customs, had been performed for Sitompul. The first defendant

claimed that if his name was not added to the Citibank account, the bank would freeze the account

once it found out about Sitompuls death. The plaintiff then telephoned the bank but was told that

the Citibank account would not be frozen because there were surviving joint account holders namely

the plaintiff and the second defendant. The plaintiff accordingly informed the first defendant.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10. Later that same evening, the plaintiff received a call from an officer of

Citibank informing her that the second defendant had applied to the bank to withdraw US$600,000 from

the Citibank account. The plaintiff requested the officer to stop the withdrawal but was advised it

was not possible because the second defendant was an authorised signatory but, the officer agreed to

hold back the withdrawal for two (2) days to give the plaintiff time to discuss the matter with the

first defendant. At Citibanks request, the plaintiff sent a letter to the bank to confirm her

instructions.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">11. The plaintiff visited the first defendant (with a trusted family staff James

Panggabean); when she asked, the first defendant gave the excuse that he requested his daughter to

withdraw monies from the Citibank account because he wanted to distribute the same to the 3 siblings

as beneficiaries of Sitompuls estate; pending such distribution, he wanted to deposit the monies

with the Standard Chartered Bank (SCB) as it paid a higher interest than Citibank and with a Jakarta

bank. To allay her fears, the first defendant promised the plaintiff that he would add her name to

the SCB and Jakarta bank, accounts. With the persuasion of James Panggabean, the plaintiff signed

documents to allow the monies in the Citibank account to be transferred out. The first defendant

also procured her signature to a form to add him as a signatory to the Citibank account.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">12. However, the first defendant did not add the plaintiff as a signatory to the

SCB or Jakarta bank, accounts - whenever she inquired, the first defendant would ask her to wait.

Between February and March 2000, the plaintiff met the first defendant several times. She questioned

him repeatedly on the distribution of Sitompuls monies. It was only then that he told her that he

would not be distributing the monies claiming that, by a Power of Attorney dated 21 August 1997 (the

PA) from Sitompul, he was the sole beneficiary to her estate. However, Indonesian lawyers consulted

by the plaintiff advised her that the PA had no effect upon Sitompuls demise. The plaintiff was

not aware of the existence of the PA during her mothers lifetime, Sitompul never told her there

was such a PA. The plaintiff opined that as Sitompul opened the three (3) bank accounts in Singapore

after the PA was prepared, it showed that her mother intended that the surviving account holders

should manage the respective accounts after her death, albeit for the benefit of the estate. Even if

the PA was valid, the plaintiff argued that it would not apply to Sitompuls joint bank accounts

but only to those accounts which were in her sole name. When she was shown the PA, the plaintiff

visited the office of the notary public (Soekaimi) who had witnessed the signing by Sitompul; she

could not verify the document as she was told he had passed away.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">13. In May 2000, the plaintiff visited Singapore intending to withdraw the monies

in the second BOA account, with a view to distribution after returning to Jakarta and discussing

with the first defendant. She was told by an officer of BOA that, Indiana had objected to her

withdrawal and she was not allowed to do so. Subsequently, the plaintiff received a call from BOA

(in June 2000) advising she could proceed to make the withdrawal. Accordingly, on 19 June 2000, the

plaintiff flew to Singapore. However, when she visited BOA to make the withdrawal, the plaintiff was

told that the first defendant had objected to her making the withdrawal and had produced the PA to

BOA.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">14. After leaving BOA, the plaintiff visited Citibank and instructed them to

freeze the Citibank account and not to allow any withdrawal therefrom without joint instructions

from her and the first/second defendants. She confirmed her instructions with a letter handed to

Citibank that day itself.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">15. In September 2000, BOAs solicitors advised her that the bank was taking

out interpleader proceedings. The plaintiff was advised to and did, appoint Singapore solicitors to

act for her in the interpleader summons OS 1400 of 2000 (BOAs interpleader). The three (3)

claimants named in BOA's interpleader were Indiana, the first defendant and the plaintiff

respectively. On 12 February 2001, I ordered that hearing of BOA's interpleader should only involve

the three (3) claimants. They were directed to state the nature and particulars of their claims to

the monies in the first and second BOA accounts and their claims were to be determined by the same

trial judge who hears this claim.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">16. The plaintiff subsequently discovered that the first defendant had

transferred monies from the Citibank account to SCB and Citibank Jakarta in the sums of

US$425,568.10 and US$256,168.85 respectively. Apparently, the Citibank Jakarta account was

originally in the names of the first and second defendants but later, the first defendant became the

sole account holder.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

The claim</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">17. In her Statement of Claim, the plaintiff averred that as the monies in the

SCB and Jakarta Citibank accounts came from monies in the Citibank account, the same were held on

trust by the first and second defendants as to her share as one of the beneficiaries of the estate.

She alleged that the defendants had breached their fiduciary duties and that the first defendant had

failed to account to her for her share of the trust monies. Accordingly, the plaintiff prayed inter

alia, for a declaration that the monies in the aforementioned two (2) accounts belong to the estate.

She also prayed for a declaration that the defendants hold the remaining monies in the Citibank

account on trust for her as one of the beneficiaries of the estate, to the extent of her share

namely one-third ( ).</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">18. In the common Defence which they filed, the defendants contended that by the

PA and under the applicable law, Sitompul had, upon her demise, given all and any of her monies in

any bank accounts to the first defendant for his management and use as he deemed necessary - making

him the sole beneficiary of her bank accounts anywhere. The defendants admitted that the monies in

the Citibank account were contributed entirely by Sitompul and upon her death, the first defendant

was to be solely entitled to all the monies in the account; the surviving joint account holders were

to operate the Citibank account according to his instructions and or surrender/utilise the monies in

accordance with his instructions.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">19. The second defendant admitted that she had applied to withdraw monies from

the Citibank account on or about 11 August 1999 but, both defendants denied that the plaintiff is a

beneficiary to the estate or, that the first defendant had promised to distribute monies to the

plaintiff or, that he had made any representations or given any assurances to her as the plaintiff

alleged.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">20. In her Reply, the plaintiff contended that the PA in the Indonesian language

was not a Will of Sitompul and did not have the effect of making the first defendant the sole

beneficiary of any or all of her accounts in Singapore or elsewhere. The PA was merely a power of

attorney and the power of management given thereunder to the first defendant lapsed upon the death

of Sitompul and, did not extend to any or all of the joint bank accounts she maintained in Singapore

and, which are governed by the laws of Singapore.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">21. Even if the applicable law is Indonesian law, the plaintiff averred that the

first defendant is not the sole beneficiary of the estate under Indonesian law but only one of the

beneficiaries.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

The evidence</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">22. Both parties called expert witnesses on Indonesian law, touching on the first

defendants claim that he was the sole beneficiary of Sitompuls estate. Both experts were also

from the Batak clan. The plaintiffs expert was Thomas Edison Tampubolon (Tampubolon) who has been

in legal practice since 1981 and is familiar with cases involving inheritance law as well as probate

and administration. Tampubolons opinion was sought and he gave his views, on the following

issues:-</p>
<ol type="i" xmlns="">
<li>whether the surviving joint account holders rights to the funds remaining in the Singapore

    bank accounts of Sitompul should be decided by the laws of Singapore or the laws of Indonesia;</li>
<li>if the above issue is to be decided by Indonesian law, what would be the effect on the

    surviving joint account holders right to deal with the funds remaining in the joint accounts;</li>
<li>whether under the laws of Indonesia, the first defendant would be regarded as the sole heir to

    the estate of Sitompul, to the exclusion of his two sisters, on the ground that he is the only

    male in the family;</li>
<li>whether the PA is valid and enforceable as a will and/or as a power of attorney;</li>
<li>would the plaintiff be entitled to at least one third share ( ) in the estate of Sitompul

    and consequently, to the funds in the Singapore bank accounts.</li>
</ol>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">23. Tampubolon answered the above issues as follows:-</p>
<ol type="i" xmlns="">
<li>since the joint accounts were opened in Singapore, under Indonesians Private International

    Law, the laws of Singapore would be the applicable law to decide on he question of the continued

    operation of the joint accounts;</li>
<li>even if Indonesian law applied, since the accounts were in the joint names of Sitompul and her

    children or grandchildren, under the laws of Indonesia, upon her death, the surviving joint

    account holders would be entitled to the balance monies in the joint accounts. If the monies

    therein were contributed solely by Sitompul, then the surviving joint account holder, although

    entitled to withdraw the balance, would later have to account to the beneficiaries of the estate

    for such sums withdrawn when the estate is distributed;</li>
<li>under the traditional laws of the Batak community, it is no longer the custom that the first

    defendant as the only male child, would be the sole beneficiary of his mother's estate. Only in

    the case of inherited wealth such as family heirlooms would the son of a Batak family be

    entitled to inherit the same. The funds in the Singapore accounts did not fall within the scope

    of inherited wealth;</li>
<li>under the laws of Indonesia the PA is invalid and does not operate as a power of attorney or

    as a will of Sitompul, and</li>
<li>since Sitompul died without leaving a will, her estate would then have to be divided amongst

    her three (3) children. As such the plaintiff would be entitled to a one-third ( ) share.</li>
</ol>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">24. I should point out in a previous similar case which I heard (Originating

Summons No. 811 of 1994), I had held that, the law applicable to joint bank accounts opened with

banks in Singapore by Indonesian nationals, is Singapore law. The Court of Appeal (in Civil Appeal

No. 28 of 1998) agreed with my views and dismissed the appeal filed by Credit Agricole Indosuez

(formerly known as Banque Indosuez) against my decision.</p>
<p xmlns="">25.    Tampubolon set out the reasons for his opinion in considerable detail in

his affidavit, referring to Indonesian law and judicial pronouncements where appropriate/necessary

(see exhibit <b>T-4 </b>as well as the plaintiffs bundle of documents PB1-57). He further

explained the development of customary law and the development of inheritance law in the Batak

ethnic group having the patrilineal system. On issues of customary law, Tampubolon affirmed that it

was left to the parties concerned to seek settlement by submitting the issue to the traditional

chief/leader. Even so, he said it was not an infrequent occurrence that the customary law applied

keeps up with the times notwithstanding that it is different from that applied by the judge if

the dispute is brought to the courts. Tampubolon pointed out in the application of the customary

law, the traditional chief/leader stresses heavily on the efforts to reconcile the parties based on

brotherhood and peaceful principles, with the result that the settlement reached is not by law and

not based on legal certainty or principles. Such decisions or settlement are not binding and has no

legal force if either party does not comply.</p>
<p xmlns="">26.    If an amicable resolution or settlement by customary law is not reached,

the parties may request a judge to determine the dispute by submitting the same to the district

court. The judge in arriving at his decision may determine what law is applicable to the dispute,

hence determining the applicable law and at the same time ensuring that the decision is enforceable.

The customary law which is developed through judicial decisions/rulings particularly on inheritance

becomes jurisprudence. Jurisprudence has become the modernised customary law and has

developed to become the national law. He opined that the role of judges and jurisprudence as

sources and makers of customary/unwritten law has increasingly become important. Since the 1961

landmark ruling (no. 179), it has been held that a female child has an equal right to inheritance;

this is not only applicable to Bataks but to all ethnic groups. The ruling was also applicable to

widows as before the ruling, they were not heirs of their late husbands. He said that logically, the

same ruling should apply when the mother dies  her children should be her heirs regardless of

gender.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">27.    Tampubolon explained that Indonesians in general live in a

kinship tiein which a family consists of the father, mother and their child or children, who

are no longer bound to the alliance and circle of relations under the customary law, in the

geographical or sociological area where they came from. This particularly applied to families who

had left the circle of the community subject to the customary law and moved to live in major and

metropolitan cities where the effectiveness of the customary law is no longer felt in daily lives.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">28. The inherited wealth which comprises of lands, houses and other heirlooms

left behind in the native village would therefore be far removed from the reach of the kinship

tie. The inherited wealth/hereditary property is subject to the rules of customary (adat/local)

law whereas, the family property which is formed from a new way of life based on the kinship tie,

has a new social unit which is parental in nature.</p>
<p xmlns="">29.    Where marriage is concerned, the national law of Indonesia recognises that

men and women are equal in their rights and obligations having regard to the marital properties.

Jurisprudence as an important source of customary law in the matters of the Family Law and Customary

Inheritance law recognises the same status between men and women as marriage law does. Hence, if an

issue of inheritance arises which is submitted to a court, for the sake of legal certainty,

the judge must decide the case based on jurisprudence disregarding the local customary law,

essentially recognising equal rights between men and women.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">30. On the PA (see DB1-4), Tampubolon elaborated on why he considered the

document invalid after Sitompuls demise. The document (as translated by the defendants) reads as

follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The undersigned [Madam Sitompul] hereby states that:</p>

<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Upon my demise, I authorise my biological child [Mindo Lumban Gaol] to manage,

<p align="justify">Thus this Power of Attorney is truthfully made.</p>

<p align="justify" xmlns="">Tampubolon pointed out that in Indonesia, powers of attorney and Wills come under

the Indonesian Civil Code. Articles 1792, 1793 and 1781 apply to powers of attorney. The provisions

as per his translations read as follows:</p>

  power of attorney, due to the notice by the principal of the discontinuance of the power of

  attorney, or due to the death, put under legal control, or bankruptcy of the principal or the

  attorney in fact, due to the marriage of the female principal or female attorney in fact.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Consequently, when Sitompul passed away, the power of attorney to the first

defendant ceased to have any effect.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">31. Tampubolon tendered to court Articles 931, 932 and 944 of the Civil Code (see

<b>P1</b>) and said there are three (3) types of Wills therein stipulated:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(i) made by and before a notary public and witnessed by two (2) persons;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(ii) made by the deceased in his own handwriting with two (2) witnesses which

  is then surrendered to a notary who retains it; and</p>
<p align="justify">(iii) a secret deed made by the deceased with 4 witnesses, then sealed in an

  envelope and later given to a notary.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">However, Batak customary law does not recognise these 3 types of Wills. The first

defendant on the other hand had referred to Articles 875 and 1792 of the Civil Code (see exhibit <b>D5</b>);

the translations read as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Article 875:</p>
<p align="justify">A Will or Testament is a deed in which stipulates a statement of a person

  concerning with what his/her wishes would be after he/she died, and it could be revoked by

  him/her.</p>
<p align="justify">Article 1792:</p>
<p align="justify">A delegation of power is an agreement by which a person delegates a power to

  other person who is authorised to execute on behalf of the donor for a certain matter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Based on the provisions of the Civil Code referred to earlier, Tampubolon was of

the view that the wording of the PA was consistent with it being a power of attorney and not a Will;

one looks at the contents of a document in order to determine its nature. The words in the PA <i>'saya

memberi kuasa'</i> means 'I authorise' whereas if it was a Will, the word used would be '<i>wasiat</i>'

meaning testament. Further, the title itself <i>'Surat Kuasa'</i> means a power of attorney or a

proxy. In any case, under Indonesian law, a notary has to authenticate a document to say whether it

is or is not, a Will. In the PA, the notary Soekaimi merely signed as a witness. Further, if it was

indeed a secret Will made by Sitompul, the notary should have opened the document and notified the

heirs upon her death but it was not done. Had Sitompul made a Will of the other two (2) types, the

notary would or should have informed Sitompul he was authorised to make a Will and advise her on it.

Tampubolon pointed out that if the PA was indeed a Will, it should have been witnessed by two not

one person, executors should have been appointed and it would have elaborated on how Sitompul's

assets were to be divided.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">32. A Will under Indonesian Civil Law has also to be contrasted with a 'tona'

under Batak customary law. By definition, according to the Inheritance Law of Batak Toba (exhibit <b>D4</b>),

a 'tona' under Batak custom is similar to a testament, in fact it is akin to an oral Will; it states

who shall own/is entitled to the testator's estate. To be valid a 'tona' must be made by an adult;</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">a. who is mentally sound;<br/>

b. who is able to speak clearly;<br/>

c. made in the presence of close family members or 'Dalihan Natolu'.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">It would also be preferable if the testator made the 'tona' in the presence of

his heirs.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">33. Tampubolon was cross-examined at length, in the course of which he refuted

the testimony of the first defendant's expert witness (Sori Tua Hutagulung) that under Batak custom,

a female who marries outside the clan (as in the case of Indiana) would be considered an outcaste

and would belong to her husband's clan. Neither does a married woman lose her surname or her

inheritance from her parents by reason of marriage. In Sitompul's case, she remained a member of her

own clan (known as 'marga') and was also a member of her husband's clan (Lumban Gaol).</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">34. Counsel for the defendants had referred Tampubolon to extracts from research

material (exhibit <b>D1</b>) on customary Batak law arising from a project undertaken by the High

Court of Medan in 1975, on the instructions of the then Chief Justice. It is noted that the survey

was conducted on Bataks living in the Lake Toba area. The following extracts (see <b>D4</b>) came

from the research findings:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">

<blockquote xmlns="">
<p>3. In Batak community, the paternal system is always used to determine the hereditary lines.</p>
<p>4. The Batak Customary Law does not have an appropriate term for the inheritance law. Although,

  in the Batak language has a term known as manean or reanteanan. But this term is only used or

  applied if the person who inherits has no son.</p>

</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">35. The first defendant relied on the above extract for his case, as well as on

extracts from textbooks <b>Inheritance Law in Indonesia</b> (see <b>D6</b>) and <b>Principles and

Structure of Customary Law</b> (<b>D7</b>) which gave the same view -- that a married female (of

Toba and Lampang) Batak clan would not be an heir of her parents' estate. Tampubolon however,

disagreed with the survey findings as well as with the authorities cited in support thereof.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">36. A factor which Tampubolon relied on for his differing view was the

certificate obtained by Sitompul on 5 November 1996 from the district court of Jakarta (para 3 <i>supra</i>)

declaring herself and her three (3) children as the heirs of Lumban Gaol. Following upon that, the

children on 1 December 1996 (see <b>D1</b>) relinquished to Sitompul their entire rights of

inheritance. He opined that the two (2) certificates indicated Sitompul's wish from the outset, not

to come under Batak customary law since the latter recognises neither instrument. It indicated that

Sitompul preferred to come under Civil Law as, she would have had no status or claim to her late

husband's estate, had Batak customary law applied. The first defendant also implicitly accepted that

Batak customary law did not apply as, if it did, his two (2) sisters would have had no share to

Lumban Gaol's estate.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">37. As for the practice of 'pauseang' or making gifts in Batak custom, Tampubolon

explained this had existed for a long time (before World War II), where women who had no rights of

inheritance, would ask from her parents for a rice field or such like for herself and her husband.

However, since 1950-60s, the practice did not exist in Jakarta for the reason that the capital has

no rice fields, although the practice could still continue in Sumatra. In place of 'pauseang' Batak

parents nowadays would give their daughters a house.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">38. Questioned on the concept of 'jurisprudensi tetap' and 'jurisprudensi',

Tampubolon explained that the former referred to decided cases of the Supreme Court which lower

court judges would follow. Where the decisions are only jurisprudensi, lower courts do not have to

follow the decisions but can come to a different conclusion. He felt that the precedent most

applicable to this case was Ruling No. 179/K/Sip/1961 of the Indonesian Supreme Court, dated 23

October 1961. The case concerned a dispute between members of the Karo tribe (the tribe). One Rolak

Sitepu (the deceased) had died leaving a piece of land but he had no sons. In accordance with the

tribe's customary law, the nephews of the deceased (his brother's sons) claimed the land as his

heirs. Their claim was contested by the daughters of the deceased. The piece of land had originally

been inherited by the deceased from his own father. The nephews of the deceased contended that his

daughters only had a right to use the piece of land during their lifetime but not to inherit it. The

Supreme Court held that the law applicable to the whole of Indonesia (including Karo) is that sons

and daughters shall be jointly entitled to the inherited assets/properties meaning that the portion

of the sons is equal to the portion of the daughter. Ruling No. 179/K/Sip/1961 had become 'jurisprudensi

tetap' because there were other similar rulings (which Tampubolon referred to in his affidavit).</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">39. As earlier mentioned (para 32), the first defendant's expert witness was Sori

Tua Hutagulung (Hutagulung). Under cross-examination (N/E 117), Hutagulung revealed he was told to

give an affidavit by the first defendant. His affidavit was based on information given to him by the

first defendant (see para 3) and he was asked in general on:</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">a. the prevailing Inheritance Law in Indonesia;</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">b. who are the legal heirs of Sitompul;</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">c. what is the status of the law and the right of the first defendant to the

monies in the Singapore bank accounts (in which reference was made to the PA).</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">However, Hutagulung was not told there were court proceedings in Singapore or,

the facts of this case.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">40. Hutagulung's answers to the first question was as follows:</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">a. Inheritance law is included in the Civil Law but there is no inheritance law

which applies equally to all races in Indonesia;</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">b. the law recognises three (3) groups of people namely: (i) European; (ii)

Indigenous and (iii) Eastern (Timur Asing) each of which practise different inheritance law.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">c. the inheritance law applicable to group (i) is the Civil law while the other

two groups apply their traditional inheritance law. Further, the different ethnic groups (exceeding

25) in group (iii) have their own traditional inheritance law, including the Bataks.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Consequently, the extracts of the Civil Code (<b>P1</b> and <b>P2</b>) referred

to by Tampubolon would not be the applicable law for Sitompul's estate.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">41. On the second question as to who are the heirs of Sitompul, Hutagulung

stated:</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">a. the inheritance law applicable to her estate is Batak traditional inheritance

law derived from the patrilineal system whereby the name of a certain male becomes the name of the

clan or 'marga';</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">b. marriage between males and females within the same clan are strictly forbidden

as they are still from one family, they have to marry other clans;</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">c. a female who marries is admitted to her husband's clan and her children would

belong to her husband's clan;</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">d. married women have no right of inheritance to their parents' estates; however

they have a right to ask the heirs of their parents for a part of the legacy and if the heirs grant

their request, what is given to the married daughters is called 'pauseang' or 'holong ate' usually

in the form of houses;</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">e. as both the plaintiff and Indiana are married, the first defendant is the sole

heir of Sitompul's estate.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">42. As for the PA, Hutagulung opined that it was actually a last Will and

Testament although titled a power of attorney because:</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">a. it had never been handed over by Sitompul to the first defendant as her

attorney; and</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">b. the first defendant became aware of its existence only after her demise when,

by coincidence he checked her personal belongings;</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Unless Sitompul's signature was challenged, Hutagulung stated that the document

was perfect evidence of power and the first defendant, based either on Batak traditional law or

'agreement law' or 'evidence law', had the right to withdraw monies from the Singapore bank

accounts.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">43. Hutagulung disagreed with Tampubolon's views that court rulings pertaining to

disputes from the Batak community had become jurisprudensi tetap and hence applicable to Bataks. He

said that the judgements had to be fair and just before they can be deemed jurisprudensi tetap. As

far as he was aware, the Batak community does not follow the court rulings including Ruling No. 179

and since 1976, there had been no court rulings which pertain to Batak customary law.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">44. I had noted that the language in Hutagulung's affidavit was not what one

would expect from any expert witness. I had also inquired why he did not mention any of the

rulings/cases referred to by Tampubolon in particular Ruling No. 284 K/Sip/1975 [see P4] (which was

a dispute involving the Simalungun clan [another group of Bataks]) wherein the Supreme Court decided

that wives and daughters are heirs under customary law; Hutagulung's cavalier response was, that he

was not asked nor was he obliged, to do so  he had given answers to questions put to him by the

first defendant and in any case, the rulings did not apply to Bataks. Hutagulung repeated this

stance more than once, even in re-examination. All I need to say is, that his attitude did not help

to improve his credibility as an expert witness.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">45. In cross-examination, Hutagulung revealed he had been advising the first

defendant on Batak customary law before these proceedings and, had represented the first defendant

in resisting Indiana's proceedings in the Jakarta courts, including applying to strike out her

claim. He defended his role in the Indonesian proceedings by saying that he was the first

defendant's consultant in those proceedings, not his lawyer but did not elaborate on the differences

if any, between the two roles (N/E 118). Apparently, his affidavit was also adapted from an opinion

he had filed on the first defendant's behalf for Indiana's claim. It was equally apparent from his

cross-examination that Hutagulung was unaware of the fact that the plaintiff and Indiana worked in

and ran the company/business. He agreed it would be fair if the plaintiff and her sister each had a

share ( ) of Sitompul's estate in that case. When he was recalled to the witness stand after

Hutagulung had testified, Tampubolon disagreed with the former's view that Batak customary law

prevailed over Supreme Court Rulings such that the latter did not apply to the community; I shall

return to this portion of his testimony later.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">46. In the course of their testimony, both Tampubolon and Hutagulung had touched

on the system of 'Dalihan Natolu'. This referred to a Batak tradition of having members of a clan or

marga come together for a family council. In this regard, the first defendant had called as his

witness one Maruli Tua Lumban Gaol (Maruli), who claimed to be a close relative of the late parents

of the plaintiff/first defendant and, an elder of the clan. Maruli (DW2) asserted that during their

lifetime, Sitompul and her husband used to take his advice and he represented them on many matters,

especially those touching on Batak customary law. Maruli referred to his position as chairman of the

Batak Descendants Association (PARI for short) for the period 1997-2000 as another credential for

giving evidence. He claimed that PARI is the correct body with the authority and knowledge to make

pronouncements on the applicable Batak customary law. Maruli had testified that on 23 and 28

February 2000, at the request of the plaintiff and Indiana, a family council was held at the

residence of Sitompul at 58, Cokroaminoto Jakarta, for the council's decision on matters relating to

the division of her assets and property. Present were the three (3) siblings, the sisters and

brother of Sitompul, Maruli and his wife and another couple form the Lumban Gaol clan. Maruli

claimed that at this family council which was properly constituted according to Batak customary law,

it was unanimously agreed that:</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">a. the first defendant was the head of the family in place of his late parents;</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">b. the PA found amongst the possessions of Sitompul was consistent with Batak

customary law, represented her last Will and Testament and should be given due respect, recognition

and effect;</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">c. as the head of the family, the first defendant should exercise compassion

towards his sisters and exercise his discretion in granting some part of his inheritance to them.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">47. However, both the plaintiff and Tampubolon refuted Maruli's claims.

Tampubolon pointed out that PARI is only a clan association which renders advice or makes

recommendations where there are quarrels amongst members. The role of the association is to advice

on Batak traditions such as wedding and funeral ceremonies. When PARI makes recommendations on

matters of inheritance or divorce, the same are not binding on the parties in dispute and cannot be

enforced. If the recommendations are not accepted, the parties involved would still have to go to

court.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">48. The plaintiff on her part disputed Maruli's claim to be a close relative of

her late parents, he was only from the same clan and distantly related. She further disagreed with

Maruli's version of what transpired at the council meeting to which he asked to be invited, not that

he was invited by her. She pointed out (contrary to Maruli's claim) that she had not agreed that the

PA was the Last Will and Testament of Sitompul; she merely agreed that it was signed by Sitompul and

she was not given the same although she and Indiana had requested the first defendant for copies of

the document. This aspect of the plaintiff's testimony was confirmed by Maruli who said he had also

asked for a copy of the document but was not given one by the first defendant.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">49. As for the first defendant (DW3), his testimony was a re-affirmation of his

affidavit, that he was the sole beneficiary to Sitompul's estate, being her only son. He testified

(N/E 222) that the certificates of inheritance and renunciation referred to earlier (para 36) were

needed by Sitompul to change the bank accounts from his late father's name to her name, including

the Singapore and Jakarta bank accounts. This testimony was not in his affidavit evidence and not

unexpectedly was objected to by counsel for the plaintiff, particularly when it had been put to her

client that the reason for the certificate of inheritance was to enable the mother to realise the

father's other assets.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">50. Cross-examined on the reason behind his application in summons in chambers

(no. 1120 of 2001/T), the first defendant said he felt the Jakarta courts was the more appropriate

forum to determine the plaintiff's claim. When it was pointed out to him that his stand was

inconsistent with his conduct in contesting Indiana's claim in Jakarta, the first defendant offered

no convincing explanation. In fact, he had applied (with Hutagulung's assistance) in April 2001 to

strike out Indiana's claim on the basis that the court lacked jurisdiction. Indiana's proceedings

(see exhibit <b>DS-2 </b>in Dara Singh's affidavit) filed in the South Jakarta courts included a

claim for a share of the monies in the BOA and Citibank accounts. Notwithstanding that his own

expert Hutagulung had agreed that the plaintiff and Indiana were entitled to a share of Sitompul's

estate in view of their contributions to the family businesses, the first defendant would not admit

(NE 229) that Hutagulung had agreed. He gave no credit to either sister for their work. The first

defendant went further to assert that Hutagulung's view did not reflect the law, contradicting his

own expert's testimony. Questioned why he had not instructed Hutagulung to address the issues in

this case in Hutagulungs testimony, the first defendant said it was not necessary; his brief to

Hutagulung was merely to answer the questions he posed.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">51. Not unexpectedly, the first defendant corroborated Maruli's testimony on the

PA being a valid last Will and Testament of Sitompul and on what transpired at the family council

meetings on 23 and 28 February 2000. Indeed, the first defendant went further to say that when he

instructed his daughter (the second defendant) to withdraw US$600,000 from the Citibank account on

11 August 1999, he was carrying out Sitompul's wishes. He had intended (N/E 249) to use the

withdrawal to pay land taxes, buy land from others (including the plaintiff's present residence at

Jalan Suwiryo, Jakarta) and educate Indiana's children; this was in accordance with Sitompul's plans

made at the time the account was opened. This portion of the first defendant's testimony only

emerged under cross-examination  in his affidavit he had only asserted that Sitompul had intended

that part of the monies would remain in Singapore for the education of his children. At other times

during his cross-examination (N/E 248 and 259), the first defendant had claimed that the withdrawal

was to enable him to settle his late mother's outstanding medical fees, pointing out that the

plaintiff herself had withdrawn a sum of US$100,000 for that purpose from the first BOA account.

This explanation is patently untrue; the second defendant withdrew the sum of US$600,000 almost a

month after Sitompul's demise; I find it incredible that Mount Elizabeth Hospital where she was

warded, would allow her to be discharged without full payment of their fees, particularly when she

was not a resident of Singapore. The first defendant shifted his stance yet again when, at another

stage of his cross-examination (N/E 259), he admitted that the withdrawal from the Citibank account

was not to pay for Sitompul's expenses.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">52. As for the failure of the second defendant to appear to defend these

proceedings, the first defendant explained away her absence by the fact that she could not leave her

studies (N/E 257).</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

The decision</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">53. On the written and oral evidence adduced before me, I had no hesitation in

deciding the plaintiff's claim in her favour. I found no merits in either the defence put up by the

first defendant or in his summons-in-chambers application; I shall now set out my reasons.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">54. I shall first deal with the first defendant's application to stay these

proceedings on the ground of <i>forum non conveniens</i> in the alternative, that the plaintiff has

no <i>locus standi</i>. In opposing the application on the first ground, counsel for the plaintiff

pointed out the following:-</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(a) the plaintiff had filed these proceedings on 27 September 2000, yet the first

defendant only made the application on the first day of trial when it should have been made at the

earliest opportunity. His previous application for a stay unless security for costs was provided did

not succeed;</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(b) the application was supported not by the first defendant's affidavit but by

his counsel's; indeed, the first defendant had never filed any affidavit for his previous numerous

(7) applications, nor did he pay costs previously awarded to the plaintiff;</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(c) the application was not bona fide as the first defendant was also attempting

to strike out Indiana's claim in the District Court of Central Jakarta (this was subsequently

confirmed by the first defendant's testimony under cross-examination).</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">55. On the alternative ground for the application, counsel for the first

defendant argued that unless and until a grant of probate or letters of administration is/are

extracted/obtained for Sitompul's estate, no one let alone the plaintiff had the requisite status

quo to commence this suit. He said that at the highest, the plaintiff had a right to bring an action

on her own behalf, as a beneficiary of the estate. Counsel for the plaintiff on the other hand

argued that her client was only claiming the monies in the Singapore bank accounts as a surviving

joint account-holder, and not claiming on behalf of Sitompul's estate. Further, it lay ill in the

mouth of the first defendant to say the monies in the Singapore bank accounts are estate monies when

his own daughter (the second defendant) had wrongfully withdrawn monies from the Citibank account on

his instructions. Yet in the same breath, he asserted that the monies in the BOA account should be

paid to him as the beneficiary of Sitompul's estate. This submission was confirmed by the first

defendant's counsel.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">56. I accepted the plaintiff's arguments and dismissed the application

accordingly. Even without the benefit of listening to the first defendant's oral testimony, the

application was without merit. I disagreed with the submission that a question of law was involved

and as such, the application could be made at any time. An application based on the first ground

should have been made from the outset, not on the first day of trial. Moreover, the history of this

litigation showed that the first defendant's previous conduct was inconsistent with his stand that

Indonesia was a more appropriate forum. He had (through his previous solicitors) on 28 December 2000

applied for security for costs against the plaintiff in the sum of $200,000; the application was

dismissed on 15 January 2001. On 22 March 2001, the first defendant made a similar application this

time in the amount of $100,000; the application was also dismissed, on 16 April 2001. He should not

be allowed to blow hot and cold at one and the same time.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">57. The submission on the alternative ground was misconceived as the plaintiff's

claim was not premised on her being a personal representative of the estate. In this regard the case

of <i>Wong Moy </i>(<i>administratrix of the estate of Theng Chee Khim deceased</i>)<i> v Soo Ah

Choy</i> <nobr>[1996] 1 SLR 586</nobr> cited by counsel for the first defendant was factually dissimilar. There,

the court held that the plaintiff who had applied for (and was granted) letters of administration to

her late husband's estate, did not have the status to bring proceedings on behalf of his estate as

the grant had not yet been extracted, at the time proceedings were filed. In this case, the

plaintiff did not make a claim on behalf of Sitompul's estate; she claimed as a beneficiary to the

extent of her share, of the monies in the Singapore bank accounts and against the two defendants for

breach of their fiduciary duties in refusing to distribute her share of the monies therefrom. It was

the defendants who pleaded in their defence that the first defendant was the sole beneficiary of the

estate.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">58. I turn now to the other cases cited by counsel for the first defendant. He

had relied on my decision in <i>PT Jaya Putra Kundur Indah and Ang &amp; Sons</i> <i>Investments Pte

Ltd v Guthrie Overseas Investments Pte Ltd </i>(unreported). I would first of all point out that in

that case the application for a stay of proceedings by the defendants was filed on 22 March 1996, 21

days after the plaintiffs had commenced proceedings in Suit No. 395 of 1996 on 1 March 1996.

Secondly, the dispute concerned the Indah Puri Resort (the project) in Batam Island, which was a

joint-venture undertaken by the plaintiffs and the defendants. The first plaintiff is/was an

Indonesian company while the second plaintiff and the defendants are Singapore companies.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">59. The above case contained a factual matrix which was very different and

distinguishable from, this case. The project was sited in Indonesia and was governed by/subject to

Indonesian law. Indeed, the joint venture itself required approval from the President and various

other Indonesian authorities. Under such circumstances, I granted the defendants application for

a stay against which decision the plaintiffs filed their notice of but did not proceed with their,

appeal.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">60. The other case cited by counsel for the defendants was <i>Oriental Insurance

Co Ltd v Bhavani Stores Pte Ltd </i><nobr>[1998] 1 SLR 253</nobr>. There, the appellants/defendants had applied

for a stay of Singapore proceedings when the Singapore plaintiffs sued under various insurance

policies for losses arising out of short-delivery of a shipment of cashew nuts from Guinea Bissau to

Tuticorin, India. The assistant registrar had dismissed the appellants application which a judge

had affirmed on appeal. The Court of Appeal reversed the decision below and in allowing the appeal

held inter alia:-</p>
<ol type="i" xmlns="">
<li>The respondents were a Singapore incorporated company. The appellants were incorporated in

    India. Although the appellants had a registered office in Singapore, this office had not been

    operative since 1988. These considerations favoured neither forum as solicitors would still have

    had to be instructed from overseas and representatives from either side would still have to had

    to travel no matter where the litigation took place.</li>
<li>Many factors relating to the underlying contract pointed to India. The policy insured goods

    delivered to India and offloaded in India by Indian stevedores. The goods were surveyed on ship

    in India by Indian surveyors. The goods were thereafter delivered to Indian consignees. Payment

    for the shipment was made by letter of credit in India issued by an Indian bank. The witnesses

    to the offloading, spillage, recovery and delivery of the nuts were also located in India. The

    location of the witnesses was an important factor because the dispute concerned questions of

    fact.</li>
</ol>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">On the facts, the Court of Appeal quite rightly reached an opposite conclusion

from my decision in <i>PT Jaya Putra Kundur Indah's</i> case. Like the Court of Appeal, I had

applied the principles/tests in <i>The Spiliada</i> [1987] 1 AC 460 and which were followed in <i>Brinkerhoff

Maritime Drilling Corp v PT Airfast Services</i> [1992] and <i>Eng Liat Kiang v Eng Bak Hern</i>
<nobr>[1995] 3 SLR 97</nobr> namely:</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">a. a stay will only be granted where the court is satisfied that there is some

other available forum, having jurisdiction, which is the appropriate forum for trial of the action

i.e. in which the case may be tried more suitably for the interests of all the parties and the ends

of justice (per Lord Goff at p 476 in <i>The Spiliada</i>);</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">b. where the plaintiffs have commenced an action in Singapore and the court's

jurisdiction is founded as of right, the legal burden rests on the defendant to persuade the court

to exercise its discretion to grant a stay. It is for the defendant to show not only that Singapore

is not the appropriate or natural forum, but that there is another available forum which is clearly

or distinctly more appropriate than the Singapore forum.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">61. The burden was on the first defendant to show that Indonesia was the more

appropriate forum to determine the plaintiff's claim in terms of having the most real and

substantial connection. He failed to discharge the burden; hence I refused a stay.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">62. Contractually, the two (2) banks were obliged to pay the plaintiff the monies

in the Citibank and second BOA account(s). They did not do so because of objections raised by the

first defendant on the basis that he was entitled to those monies as Sitompul's sole

heir/beneficiary. Counsel for the first defendant had cited Rule 132 from the textbook <i>Dicey

&amp; Morris </i>on<i> The Conflict of Laws </i>(13 ed vol 2 p 1026) to the effect that the

succession to the movables of an intestate is governed by the law of his/her domicile at the time of

death. That submission has no relevance to the plaintiff's claim as it was not premised on her being

the personal representative of her mother's estate; she was suing based on her legal title to the

monies. Hence, my decision in OS 811 of 1994 (<i>Banque Indosuez v Sumilan Awal &amp; 2 others</i>)

that the law applicable to joint bank accounts opened with banks in Singapore by Indonesian

nationals is Singapore law (see para 24 <i>infra</i>). Hutagulung had admitted (N/E 178) that he had

been asked by the first defendant how Batak customary law applied to the first defendant vis-a vis

the Singapore bank accounts. Consequently, the first defendant cannot thereafter adopt a stand

inconsistent with his pleaded case, and say that a Singapore court cannot decide the dispute based

on Indonesian laws of succession for the Batak community. In any case, that determination is not

within the purview of Hutagulung's brief, it is to be decided by the courts of Singapore.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">63. As to the right of survivorship of such joint accounts, there is textbook

authority for this proposition; I refer to <i>Ellinger and Lomnicka's</i> <i>Modern Banking Law</i>

(2 ed [1994]) at p 228 where the learned authors state:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">It is well established that the legal title in the deceased's moiety in the

  joint account vests in the survivor.An equitable or beneficial title, which is quite separate

  from the legal one, may nevertheless vest in the estate. The position depends on the facts.The

  position differs if the amounts were paid in entirety or predominating by the deceased. In such a

  case the rights of the estate depend on the deceased's intention in maintaining the funds in a

  joint account..</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">The following extract appears in another textbook namely, <i>Poh Chu Chai's Law

of Banker and Customer</i> (4 ed p 248):</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">As between persons who stand in a special relationship, like a husband and wife

  or a person <i>in loco parentis</i>, there is normally a <i>prima facie</i> presumption that the

  husband or person in loco parentis intends to benefit the other person by opening a joint account.

  This presumption however, may be rebutted if the person who deposits the funds in the account can

  show that he did not intend to benefit the other person.</p>
</blockquote>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

The decision</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">64. Before I give the reasons for my decision, it would be useful to look at the

orders I made on 25 June 2001 when I awarded judgment to the plaintiff; the relevant orders are as

follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">a. upon the death of Madam Dumatiar Sitompul (Mdm DS) on 11 July 1999, the

  legal title to the monies remaining in her Citibank Singapore Account as at the date of her death

  (the Trust Monies) had vested in the plaintiff and/or the second defendant as the surviving joint

  account holders;</p>
<p align="justify">b. the beneficial interest in the Trust Monies belong to the estate of Mdm DS

  and that the plaintiff, the first defendant and Indiana Lumban Gaol (Indiana) being the children

  of Mdm DS are the three beneficiaries of her estate and each is entitled to a one third ( )

  share of the Trust Monies;</p>
<p align="justify">c. the plaintiff and/or the second defendant hold the Trust Monies on trust for

  the estate of Mdm DS and for the plaintiff to the extent of her one third ( ) share therein;</p>
<p align="justify">d. the second defendant had acted wrongfully and in breach of the trust when

  she transferred part of the Trust Monies in the sums of USD$425,568.10 AND US$256,168.85 on or

  about 11 August 1999 to the first defendant's and her joint accounts with Standard Chartered Bank,

  Singapore and Citibank NA, Jakarta respectively;</p>
<p align="justify">e. the first and second defendants hold the respective sums transferred to

  their accounts with Standard Chartered Bank Singapore and Citibank NA, Jakarta on trust for the

  estate of Mdm DS and for the plaintiff to the extent of her one third ( ) share;</p>
<p align="justify">f. the first and second defendant are in breach of their fiduciary duties owed

  to the plaintiff in refusing to distribute to the plaintiff her one third ( ) share of the

  monies in the first and second defendants' accounts with Standard Chartered Bank, Singapore and

  Citibank Jakarta.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">It is to be noted that the plaintiff only obtained declaratory relief in relation

to Sitompul's estate as regards her one third ( ) share.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">65. I turn now to the testimony of the two (2) experts. One reason for my ruling

in favour of the plaintiff was the evidence of her expert Tampubolon. He had taken great pains in

his affidavit to establish that Batak traditional law had, over the years been modified, if not

totally changed, by case-law which had become jurisprudensi tetap or what we would describe as

jurisprudence. Tampubolon's testimony withstood lengthy and vigorous cross-examination by counsel

for the defendants. He had obviously done considerable research on the opinions sought from him by

his instructing counsel.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">66. Tampubolon's testimony is to be contrasted with that of the first defendant's

expert Hutagulung, whose opinion was superficial, lacked research, was often unfounded and hence was

unreliable; far worst, it could not be considered as coming from an unbiased and independent witness

as he/his partner had acted (and was still acting) for the first defendant in Indiana's Jakarta

proceedings. In addition, his affidavit opinion was based on what the first defendant told or rather

chose to tell, him; he did not make an objective assessment based on the relevant documents of this

case, which apparently he did not even sight, nor was he told about this case (N/E117) even when he

affirmed his affidavit of evidence (26 April 2001) in Jakarta. Unlike Tampubolon, Hutagulungs

views were based on what he heard, not what was decided by the highest judicial authority in

Indonesia, namely the Supreme Court. Hutagulung's knowledge of Indonesian judicial rulings was at

best vague/cursory and at worst, out-dated and inaccurate. Hutagulung had opined that the first

defendant was entitled to Sitompul's entire estate notwithstanding he was aware of the 1975 Supreme

Court decision concerning Batak inheritance law which ruled that males and females are equal

(N/E115). Consequently, I rejected Hutagulung's testimony.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">67. The first defendants testimony equally left much to be desired; he

prevaricated, changed his stance and departed from his written testimony when it suited his case to

do so; he took liberties with the truth. In addition to what I have pointed out earlier (para 51),

one other instance I can cite in this respect was his claim (N/E 253) that the monies in the

Citibank account was meant for family members. This was to overcome the omission of his name from

that account. Yet, when it came to the first BOA account (of which he was a joint account-holder),

the first defendant's stance was that the monies should all go to him as the only son. He did not

impress me as a capable person either. His taking 7-10 years to rebuild an office block in Jakarta

belonging to Sitompul would be a reflection of his poor calibre; I disbelieved his explanation that

bureaucracy, not him, was the cause of the delay; he was certainly far less capable than the

plaintiff.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">68. The first defendant was also a devious character. As was put to him during

cross-examination, he was prompted to request his daughter/the second defendant to withdraw

US$600,000 from the Citibank account after he was informed by the plaintiff (upon checking with

Citibank), that the account would not be frozen as he thought it would be, upon Sitompul's demise.

The withdrawal was to pre-empt the plaintiff herself from taking out the monies. He then tricked the

plaintiff into signing the forms which enabled him to become a joint-holder of that account and then

to transfer out the balance therefrom to SCB and Citibank, Jakarta.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">69. Whether it was greed (which I believe is the more likely) that prompted him

to deny his two (2) sisters any share to his mothers estate or, it was his stubborn belief that

his position as Sitompuls only son and heir under Batak customary law was unassailable, the first

defendant struck me as a totally unreasonable person. I say this because of his reliance on the PA

as Sitompuls Will.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">70. In order to rely on the PA as his late mothers Will, the first defendant

would have to accept that the Civil Code/law applied to her estate, not Batak customary law, which

only recognised a tona or oral Will, not the 3 types of Wills which exist under Indonesian

civil law. Even if the PA could be said to be a written 'tona', it was Tampubolon's testimony, when

recalled to the witness stand (N/E 192), that it was still not a valid tona under Batak customary

law. This was because the Dalihan Natolu should be present to witness the making of the written tona

to ensure it was indeed made by Sitompul prior to her death. The purpose of a Dalihan Natolu is not

to approve or validate a written tona as Maruli and Hutagulung both tried to suggest was what was

done (for the PA), at the meeting on 23 February 2000. It was claimed by the first defendant that he

found the document sometime after 19 July 1999, amongst the possessions of Sitompul in her room. As

the PA was found well after her demise, how can it be considered a valid written tona when the

Dalihan Natolu was not present to witness its signing by her?</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">71. The second difficulty the first defendant faced was, the alleged Will was

incomplete as it did not spell out the disposition of Sitompuls entire estate, only the

management and utilisation of her (unidentified) bank accounts, by the first defendant. That being

the case, there was a partial intestacy of her estate if indeed the document was her Will; how were

her remaining assets to be disposed off? In this regard, I need to digress and refer to the

testimony of Hutagulung (N/E 164) when he was cross-examined on this issue. He had opined that

Sitompul's remaining assets were to be distributed in accordance with traditional Batak customary

law which in effect, meant that they would all go to the first defendant, according to his

interpretation. However, an analysis of his opinion would show it would give rise to a ridiculous

situation. I have no reason to doubt Tampubolon's opinion that the PA does not qualify as a valid

written tona. That being the case, the only way to give validity to the document would be to fall

back on the provisions of the Indonesian Civil Code to say it is a Will. If so, how can the first

defendant maintain that Batak customary law would apply to the distribution of the remainder of the

estate? Just the language of the PA itself (original and translated) makes it clear that it could

not be anything else other than a power of attorney, which under the Indonesian Civil Code (Article

1813) ceased to have any effect upon Sitompul's demise.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">72. It cannot be disputed that Sitompul in her lifetime was an exceptionally

capable woman, a far cry from the traditional Batak woman. She had built up into a multi-million

dollar operation, the business as well as the company and in the process had attained considerable

wealth. This, coupled with the fact that she applied to the Indonesian courts for a certificate of

inheritance (of her husbands estate) in her as well as her children's, favour, showed that she

was not someone who believed in/relied on traditional Batak law to decide inheritance matters. My

view is reinforced by the fact that she went further to obtain a certificate from her children

relinquishing their rights of inheritance to her. Consequently, her own estate should be dealt with

under the provisions of the Indonesian Civil Code.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">73. In contrast to the first defendant, I found the plaintiff to be forthright

and candid in her testimony. There was no change in her position, either in her own oral testimony

or in her cross-examination. Her version of events was more consistent with documents produced in

court and hence, more credible.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

Conclusion</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">74. This claim could and should have been tried based purely on Singapore law, in

accordance with the contractual relationship/obligations between the two (2) Singapore banks

involved and their customers who maintained joint accounts (with survivorship clauses), after the

demise of one of joint holders to such accounts. The first defendant chose to widen the dispute by

claiming that he was the sole beneficiary of his late mother's estate and therefore entitled to the

monies in her Singapore bank accounts and so pleaded in his Defence. Determination of the heirs of

Sitompul's estate should rightly have been decided by the Indonesian courts. The proper course of

action should have been for the monies in the joint accounts to be paid out to the surviving

account-holders be it the plaintiff, the first and or second defendants. Thereafter the recipient(s)

of the monies would have to hold the monies as trustee(s) until such time as the Indonesian courts

decide on who constituted the beneficiary or beneficiaries of Sitompul's estate and determine the

division of the estate.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">75. The first defendant however chose to confuse matters by bringing the issue of

distribution of her estate before our courts, apart from his last minute volte face to stay the

proceedings. Having so widen the dispute, the first defendant failed to convince me through

Hutagulung's testimony, that he was the only rightful heir to his late mother's estate. The rulings

of the Indonesian Supreme Court on the issue made it clear that sons and daughters (married or

single) of Batak parents enjoy equal rights of inheritance to their parents' estates.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">76. In accordance with the order of court made on 12 February 2001, I dealt with

BOA's interpleader immediately after making the orders in this suit. The orders made were as

follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Upon the death of Sitompul on 11 July 1999:</p>
</blockquote>
<ol type="a" xmlns="">
<li>the legal title to the monies remaining in her first BOA account now held by [the first

    defendants solicitors] had vested in the first defendant as the surviving joint account

    holder;</li>
<li>the legal title to the monies remaining in her second BOA account now held by the [plaintiffs

    solicitors] had vested in the plaintiff as the surviving joint account holder;</li>
<li>the beneficial interest in the monies held by both solicitors belong to the estate of Sitompul

    and [the plaintiff, the first defendant and Indiana] being the children of Sitompul are the

    three (3) beneficiaries of her estate and each is entitled to one third-share in the monies;</li>
<li>the distribution of the monies shall follow the terms of the order set out in Suit No. 780 of

    2000.</li>
</ol>
