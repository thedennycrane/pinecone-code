<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">The charge</p></b></i><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">         This was an appeal

from the judgment of district judge Wong Pui Kay. The appellant claimed trial to 44

charges under s 411 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) for dishonestly retaining cheques which he

had reason to believe were stolen from Welgoal Singapore Pte Ltd (‘Welgoal’).

The offence is punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to five years, or

with fine, or with both. </p>
<p align="justify">2        Section 411 of the Penal

Code reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote></blockquote></font><font size="3" xmlns=""><p align="justify">Whoever dishonestly receives or retains any

    stolen property, knowing or having reason to believe the same to be stolen property, shall

    be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 5 years, or with fine, or

    with both; and if the stolen property is a motor vehicle or any component part of a motor

    vehicle as defined in section 379A shall be punished with imprisonment for a term of not

    less than 6 months and not more than 5 years and shall also be liable to fine. </p>
</font>
<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">3        The appellant was convicted

on 22 December 2001 on the first 40 charges and sentenced to a total of 44 months

imprisonment. He was acquitted of the remaining four charges on the ground that the

prosecution had failed to adduce sufficient evidence to prove its case against him beyond

a reasonable doubt. The appellant appealed against both conviction and sentence. </p>
</font><i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Undisputed facts</p></i><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">4        The appellant’s wife,

Ms Tho Bee Choo (‘DW 2’) worked as an Assistant Sales Manager at Welgoal.

Welgoal’s director, Chen Tsu Wang (‘PW 2’) testified that the nature of his

job required him to travel overseas on a frequent basis. For business efficiency, he would

pre-sign some ‘blank’ cheques before his overseas trips and entrust them to DW 2

so that she could make payments on Welgoal’s behalf.</p>
<p align="justify">5        DW 2 however used these

pre-signed cheques to issue cash cheques as well as cheques payable to herself and to the

appellant, using some of the proceeds for her own purposes and also to repay the

appellant’s debts. Her wrongdoings were subsequently discovered and she was sentenced

to a six-year imprisonment term upon conviction on three charges of criminal breach of

trust as a servant under s 408 of the Penal Code for an aggregate sum exceeding $ 1

million. She was still serving the sentence at the time of hearing of the present appeal.</p>
<p align="justify">6        The charges in the present

appeal concerned 40 such pre-signed cheques which DW 2 had instructed the appellant to

cash over a 16-month period from June 1998 to October 1999. Twenty-seven of these were

cash cheques, 12 were made out to the appellant and one was made out to DW 2 or to

‘bearer’. Some of these cheques were in US dollars while the rest were in

Singapore dollars. When converted to Singapore dollars, the cheques made out to the

appellant were worth around $ 78,431 while the value of all the cheques which the

appellant cashed was around $ 270,000. It was not disputed that the appellant had no

business dealings with Welgoal that might have justified Welgoal in making such payments

to the appellant.</p>
<p align="justify">7        The appellant conceded in

the court below that the physical elements of the offence were present, namely that he, by

accepting the cheques from DW 2 and cashing them, had retained stolen property in the form

of those cheques and their proceeds. However, the appellant argued that the mental

elements of the offence were absent in that he was, firstly, not dishonest and secondly,

had no reason to believe that the cheques were stolen from Welgoal. The judge held however

that the requisite mental elements were present and convicted him. </p></font><i xmlns=""><b>
</b>
<p align="justify">Issues arising on appeal</p></i><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">8        The appellant relied on

several grounds in his appeal. Some of them overlapped and could be summarised into three

broad grounds, namely, </p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a)    The judge had erred in rejecting the defence

    submission of no case to answer at the close of the prosecution’s case and calling

    for the defence. </p>
<p align="justify">(b)    The judge had erred in holding that on the

    totality of the evidence the prosecution had established its case beyond a reasonable

    doubt.</p>
<p align="justify">(c)    The sentences imposed were manifestly excessive. </p></blockquote></blockquote></font>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Was there a case to answer at the end of the prosecution’s case?</p></i><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">9        Since the presence of the

physical elements of the offence was not disputed, the issue here was whether there was <i>prima

facie</i> evidence that the appellant had been dishonest and had reason to believe that

those cheques were stolen property: <i>Haw Tua Tau v PP</i> [1980-1981] SLR 73</p></font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="3" xmlns="">
</font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">10        ‘Reason to

believe’ was defined in <i>Koh Hak Boon &amp; Ors v PP</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=7567&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1993] 3 SLR 427</a> as

involving a lesser degree of conviction than certainty but a higher one than speculation.

The test is whether a reasonable person, in the position of the appellant (i.e. including

his knowledge and experience), would have thought it <i>probable</i> that the property he

retains is stolen property. It is irrelevant whether the appellant himself actually

thought it probable: his state of mind is only relevant to the ‘knowing’ limb

(which the present charges did not rely on) and not to the ‘reason to believe’

limb in s 411. The test of ‘reason to believe’ is hence objective but conducted

from the vantage point of someone with the appellant’s knowledge and experience. </p>
</font>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">11        ‘Dishonestly’ is

defined in s 24 of the Penal code as: </p>
<font size="3" xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Whoever does anything with the intention of causing wrongful gain to

    one person, or wrongful loss to another person, is said to do that thing dishonestly.</p>
</blockquote></blockquote></font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Section 411, read with s 24, clearly envisages that an individual can

be dishonest, ie having an intention to cause wrongful gain or loss even though he has no

actual knowledge, but only reason to believe that the property was stolen. It can hence be

inferred that ‘dishonesty’ in the context of s 411 is not restricted to mean an

intention to cause gain or loss which the appellant <i>knows</i> to be wrongful.

Otherwise, dishonesty could never be found if an accused merely has reason to believe, but

not knowledge, that the property was stolen since, without such knowledge, he could not

have known that the gain or loss was wrongful. Logically, dishonestly under s 411 would

have to bear the broader meaning of an intention to cause gain or loss which the accused <i>either

knows or has reason to believe</i> was wrongful. </p>
<p align="justify">12        Ordinarily, the two mental

elements of ‘dishonesty’ and ‘knowing or having reason to believe that the

property was stolen’ go together. A person who retains property knowing it to be

stolen would naturally possess an intention to cause gain or loss which he knows to be

wrongful. Similarly, a person who retains property which he has reason to believe is

stolen would normally also have an intention to cause gain or loss which he has reason to

believe is wrongful. There may however be some situations when these mental elements are

not co-extensive. For instance, if a person’s purpose of retention is to hand the

property (which he knows or has reason to believe is stolen) to the police for

investigations, then he is not dishonest since he has no intention to cause any wrongful

loss or gain to anyone at all. On the present facts, however, it was not disputed that the

appellant handed the cash not to the police but to his wife (who used them for her own

purposes and to repay the appellant’s debts). This appeal therefore fell under the

majority of cases where ‘dishonesty’ and ‘reason to believe’ go

together. There was therefore no need to discuss the two mental elements separately. If it

was found that the appellant had reason to believe that the cheques were stolen, a finding

of dishonesty would follow.</p>
<p align="justify">13        Hence the main issue in

this appeal was only whether the appellant had reason to believe that the cheques were

stolen; and for the purpose of this particular ground of appeal, whether there was <i>prima

facie</i> evidence to that effect. <i>Haw Tua Tau &amp; Anor v PP</i> [1980-1981] SLR 73

established the proposition that at the end of the prosecution’s case, the court

assumes that (i) all evidence of primary facts is true unless it is inherently incredible;

and (ii) there will be nothing to displace inferences as to further facts or the state of

mind of the accused which can reasonably be drawn from the primary facts in the absence of

any further explanation. Taking the primary facts together with any inferences that could

reasonably be drawn, the court then considers whether a case has been made out against the

accused, which if unrebutted would warrant his conviction.</p>
<p align="justify">14        In my opinion, the test

was amply satisfied in this case. The primary facts adduced by the prosecution at the end

of its case were as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(i) The appellant knew that the Director of Welgoal had entrusted DW 2

    with pre-signed cheques; </p>
<p align="justify">(ii) Over a 16-month period, the appellant had, on DW 2’s

    instructions, cashed 40 such cheques worth about $ 270,000. Most of them were cash cheques

    but a significant proportion was made out to the appellant. The cash were then handed over

    by him to DW 2;</p>
<p align="justify">(iii) DW 2 was only earning $1,990 a month as an employee of Welgoal at

    the relevant time. She managed however to lend money to the appellant well beyond what her

    salary allowed;</p>
<p align="justify">(iv) According to PW 2’s evidence, the appellant had no business

    dealings with Welgoal that would have justified Welgoal in issuing cheques of such amounts

    in favour of the appellant.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">15        It was clear that the

‘reason to believe’ element under s 411 was <i>prima facie</i> established in

this case. Simply by putting (ii), (iii) and (iv) together, any reasonable person in

A’s position would think it probable that the cheques were stolen taking into account

that (a) the cheques were made out in favour of the appellant when he had no dealings with

Welgoal to warrant such payment; and (b) DW 2’s sudden ability to lend the appellant

substantial sums of money at the same time that the proceeds from the cheques were handed

over to her. The appellant did attempt to provide explanations to displace such an

inference but it is trite law that the court does not consider such evidence at the close

of the prosecution’s case. This falls to be considered only at the end of the trial.

There was hence no merit in this ground of appeal. </p>
</font><i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Did the prosecution establish its case beyond a reasonable doubt?</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">16        In his defence, the

appellant put forward several explanations as to why he would have no reason to believe

that the cheques were stolen. The main ones were summarised as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(i) Initially the appellant did sense something amiss and asked DW 2

    why she wanted him to cash all those cheques. DW 2 replied that she needed to pay cash for

    Welgoal’s expenses such as employees’ salaries and petty cash. After a while, he

    thought that this was Welgoal’s company practice and did not enquire further. </p>
<p align="justify">(ii) He was also afraid of DW 2 as she had always been an independent

    woman and she was also the one calling the shots because she earned more than him. Hence

    he did not dare to enquire further as to the purpose of those cheques or defy her

    instructions to cash those cheques. </p>
<p align="justify">(iii) Some of the cheques were issued in the appellant’s name

    because they were supposedly meant to reimburse him for money he had lent to Welgoal.

    Although there was no evidence on how much he had actually lent to Welgoal, the appellant

    admitted that the money he had lent was only a small portion of the amounts paid out in

    his favour. He explained that the excess cash were either reimbursed to DW 2 (in cases

    where DW 2 had used her own money first to make payments on behalf of Welgoal) or were

    used to pay directly to Welgoal’s creditors.</p>
<p align="justify">(iv) According to the appellant, he did not use a single cent which did

    not belong to him. All the proceeds from the cash cheques were returned to DW 2; while the

    proceeds from the cheques issued in his favour were also returned to DW 2, after deducting

    the amount he had lent to Welgoal. </p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">17        These explanations taken

on their own might perhaps raise a reasonable doubt as to whether the appellant had reason

to believe that the cheques were stolen. However, further evidence emerged in the course

of the defence that should also be taken into account, namely,</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(i)    The appellant was aware that DW 2 was spending

    extravagantly during that period. She bought, amongst other things, an expensive Rolex

    watch and an executive condominium worth around $600,000, with an up-front payment of more

    than $200,000. Her salary of $1,990 a month would not have enabled her to live such a

    lifestyle. Nevertheless the appellant purportedly found nothing amiss as she told him that

    she had won top ‘4 D’ prizes several times during the 16- month period and that

    she had borrowed money from her family and friends. The appellant however was unable to

    tell the court the winning numbers, the number of times or the amounts that DW 2 had won. </p>
<p align="justify">(ii)    The appellant also owed debts of between $10,000

    and $20,000 during that period. He further admitted to borrowing about the same amount of

    money from DW 2 during that period. He again felt nothing amiss as to how DW 2 managed to

    find such money as he claimed that he believed her explanation that she had got loans from

    her relatives and friends. </p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman"><p>(iii)    The circumstances in

    which the cheques were issued contained several oddities. Many of the cheques were issued

    at dates close to one another. Sometimes, two cheques would be issued, one a cash cheque

    and another a cheque payable in the appellant’s name; but both bearing the same date.

    If the latter cheque was indeed meant to reimburse the appellant (as the appellant

    claimed), then logically DW 2 should simply have stated only the amount due to the

    appellant as reimbursement in that cheque and put the remaining sum in the cash cheque.

    Instead, the cheques payable to his name would invariably be worth far more than what he

    lent to Welgoal. </p>
</font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">18        Clearly, the court would

take into account all the facts that the appellant was confronted with during the period

in applying the test of whether a reasonable person in his position would have thought it

probable that the cheques were stolen. In my opinion, the test was satisfied here. DW

2’s explanation that the cash was meant for company expenses and for reimbursements

to herself might have sounded believable when taken on its own. However, against the whole

backdrop of facts, particularly the peculiar methods by which the cheques were issued and

the large amounts of money that DW 2 suddenly possessed during the period, it became quite

incredible that a reasonable person could not place the facts together and reason that the

cheques were stolen. Further, the explanation supposedly given by DW 2 for her sudden

wealth, namely that she had won the <u><i>top three</i></u> 4-D prizes <u><i>several times</i></u>

within a 16-month period, while not inherently impossible, was certainly improbable enough

to further alert the appellant to the fact that the cheques were stolen. It was this

entire mosaic of odd coincidences and occurrences that would have led a reasonable man to

think that the cheques were probably stolen. It should again be reiterated in applying the

<i>Koh Hak Boon</i> test that the court assumes the <i>position</i> of the individual

(including his knowledge and experience), but <i>reasons</i> from that position like an

objective reasonable man: <i>Koh Hak Boon v PP</i> at p 430G.</p>
</font>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">19        The appellant however

argued that the <i>position</i> he was found in, namely a family setting in which he

trusted his wife, DW 2, and in which she had the final say in matters, should displace the

finding that he had reason to believe that the cheques were stolen. This was however

unconvincing. First, there did not appear to be much trust between the parties. The

evidence was that the relationship was one in which DW 2 did not seem to tell the

appellant anything of any importance. She did not even reveal to him how much money she

supposedly won from ‘4D’ and the appellant admitted that ‘even when she

[was] overseas with her friends, [he happened] to be the last one to know’. It was

incredible that such a marital relationship could be characterised as one of trust before

the court. Secondly, the appellant’s supposed fear of DW 2 was irrelevant. Fear might

have discouraged him from acting against DW 2’s instructions to avoid being scolded

by her, but I did not think that his thinking skills were thereby paralysed - and it is

how a reasonable person would think when faced with a certain set of facts that lies at

the crux of the <i>Koh Hak Boon</i> test.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">20        For the foregoing reasons,

the appellant’s appeal against conviction was dismissed. </p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Appeal against sentence</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">21        The judge sentenced the

appellant to a total of 42 months imprisonment with four charges running consecutively and

the aggregate sentence for these four charges to run concurrently with the rest. In

sentencing the appellant, the judge took into account the following aggravating factors:

(a) the appellant was not a passive bystander but actively participated in the scheme by

helping his wife cash 40 cheques on numerous occasions; (b) the substantial sums of money

involved in the offence; and (c) the evidence that part of the money was used to repay the

appellant’s debts. The prosecution further submitted that no restitution of the sums

had been made to Welgoal. In mitigation, the judge considered the appellant’s

previous clean record. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">22        In my opinion, the

sentences imposed were not manifestly excessive. The key consideration here was the

application of the ‘totality principle’, i.e. whether the overall punishment

meted out for the multiple charges was proportional<i><b> </b></i>to the overall gravity

of his conduct, taking into account the circumstances in which he committed the offence

and his previous records: <i>Maideen Pillay v PP</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=9784&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1996] 1 SLR 161</a>. In view of the

aggravating factors mentioned by the judge and the prosecution, especially the fact that

more than 40 offences were committed over a 16-month period when the appellant had ample

opportunities to pull himself out of this mess, the sentences imposed were certainly

proportional to the gravity of his crime. For the foregoing reasons, the appellant’s

appeal against sentence was dismissed. </p>
<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">23        Counsel for the appellant

applied to the court during the hearing to defer the commencement of the sentence for a

few days on the ground that the appellant was the sole breadwinner for his aged mother and

two-year old son. His wife was still serving a six-year term and might be released on 11

November 2002 on the work release prison scheme. He would therefore require more time to

arrange alternative sources of income for his family. I was not convinced by his reasons.

The appellant certainly had more than sufficient time to make arrangements for his family

considering that more than ten months had intervened between his conviction in the court

below and the present hearing. No reason was tendered as to why he had been unable to make

suitable arrangements during that period. Accordingly the appellant’s application to

defer commencement of sentence was also dismissed. </p>
