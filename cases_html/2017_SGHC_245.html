After hearing the parties and considering their respective cases and submissions, I affirmed the trial judge’s decision and dismissed the appeal with costs. The appellant has appealed against my decision, and I therefore set out the full grounds for my decision. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The respondent is the owner of premises situated at Peninsula Plaza (“the Premises”). The appellant was interested in running a business at the Premises and approached the respondent. Around 20 June 2014, one of the appellant’s directors, Jimina Jacee (“Jimina”) signed a Letter of Intent (“LOI”) to rent the Premises from the respondent for three years.

</div> On the same day, Jimina and Bhamah also executed a personal guarantee (“the Guarantee”) in the respondent’s favour. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 As the appellant allegedly failed to pay the monthly rent in full and/or promptly throughout most of the tenancy, the respondent terminated the tenancy and exercised its right of re-entry by turning off the electricity supply to the Premises on 6 April 2015 and then physically re-entering the Premises on 9 April 2015. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Proceedings below</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The appellant commenced an action against the respondent for breaches of the TA by cutting off electricity supply to the Premises at peak periods and wrongful termination of the TA without notice. The respondent denied that there was any breach or wrongful termination of the TA, arguing that it was entitled to terminate the TA as the appellant had failed to pay the rent in full and/or on time. The respondent asserted that the tenancy was to commence on 3 July 2014, with a monthly rent of $17,655 (inclusive of GST) in the first year, payable in advance for July 2014, and on the first day of each month for the subsequent months. The respondent’s case was that there would be a rental rebate of $1,500 per month applicable in the first year, if the appellant paid rent promptly. In its Defence and Counterclaim, the respondent pleaded that the following amounts were made by the appellant on the following dates, and so there was a shortfall in payment (reproduced from [17] of the GD):</div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><table class="table table-sm table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"><span class="font-weight-bold">Date of payment</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"><span class="font-weight-bold">Amount paid</span></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">1.</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">21 July 2014</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">$16,050</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">2.</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">18 August 2014</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">$16,050</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">3.</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">20 September 2014</div><div class="txt-body text-left">2 October 2014</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">$10,050</div><div class="txt-body text-left">$6,050</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">4.</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">7 November 2014</div><div class="txt-body text-left">12 November 2014</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">$11,000</div><div class="txt-body text-left">$5,050</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">5.</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">28 November 2014</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">$16,050</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">6.</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">1 January 2015</div><div class="txt-body text-left">6 January 2015</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">$3,000</div><div class="txt-body text-left">$13,050</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">7.</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">13 February 2015</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">$12,000</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">8. </div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">2 March 2015</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">$12,000</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">9</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">3 March 2015</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">$12,000</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Total amount paid </div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">$132,300 (Note: this should be $132,350 instead)</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The respondent therefore counterclaimed for damages arising from the appellant’s failure to pay the rent in full as well as interest arising from the appellant’s late payment of the monthly rent. The appellant’s response was that it was not late with payment of the monthly rent nor did the payments fall short of the rent sum. Further, the appellant claimed that the tenancy was to commence on 14 July 2014, with a monthly rent of $16,050 (inclusive of GST) in the first year, because there was a rent-free period from 20 June 2014 to 13 July 2014. Rent was payable only from 14 July 2014 and on the 14th day of each subsequent month. The respondent’s position regarding the purported rent-free period was that the appellant was given vacant possession of the premises on 20 June 2014 rent-free until the commencement of the TA on 3 July 2014. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 The action below was bifurcated and the trial focused only on the issue of liability. At the beginning of the trial,  the parties agreed that the issues were as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) what was the quantum of the monthly rent payable, on a construction of the terms of the LOI, the TA and the Guarantee;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) when were the monthly rent and service charge payable, on a construction of the terms of the LOI, the TA and the Guarantee;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) whether the appellant or the respondent was in breach of the TA; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) whether the respondent had lawfully terminated the lease. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 The trial judge noted (at [29] of the GD) that the appellant spent some time cross-examining the witnesses regarding the validity of the TA, raised the possibility that there were three versions of the TA, and appeared to be trying to show that none of the TAs were valid and that the TAs were materially different. The trial judge did not accept the appellant’s argument in this regard, and noted that the versions of the TA were identical, and in particular the versions on 14 July 2014 had the signatures of the appellant’s representatives so it was not open for the appellant to argue that it was not bound by the TA (at [30] of the GD). The trial judge found in favour of the respondent on all the issues and dismissed the appellant’s claim while allowing the respondent’s counterclaim with damages to be assessed. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issues on appeal </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 The appellant appealed against the entire decision of the trial judge.

</div> In effect, these concessions put paid to the appellant’s argument that the trial judge had somehow erred in her conclusion regarding the copies of the TA. Mr Retnam also accepted that where the two TAs of 14 July 2014 were exhibited with schedules, someone from the appellant had signed on each and every page including on the schedules. Therefore, it seemed to me that the discussion on multiple TAs was really much ado about nothing. In any event, I noted that Lim Sian Leong (“Lim”), a director of the respondent, explained that the two TAs of 14 July 2014 were signed because Vinod’s signature as witness in the first copy covered the portion where Lim was meant to sign as the respondent’s representative, and so Lim asked Tjie Minn and Jesline to obtain another copy of the TA signed by the appellant. The second copy of the TA was signed by Bhamah, instead of by both Bhamah and Jimina for the first copy. Lim was firm in his testimony that the TA of 14 July 2014 that was exhibited with three schedules was because of printing errors made by his solicitors who prepared the documents, and Lim’s claim in this regard was not challenged.

The documentary evidence clearly supported the trial judge’s conclusion.  The LOI, stated that the “Commencement of Lease” was 3 July 2014. Clause 1 of the TA did not state the date of commencement of the tenancy, but stated that this was to be found in Part B of Schedule 1 of the TA, which in turn stated that “the [t]erm of [the] lease is three (3) years commencing from 3rd July 2014”. This point was repeated at Part E of the same schedule, which stated that the period of rental rebate was from 3 July 2014 to 2 July 2015. As noted earlier, there was no dispute as to the validity of the signatures on the TA and its schedules. The Guarantee, signed by Jimina and Bhamah, also stated that the tenancy commenced on 3 July 2014.

Instead, Bhamah merely responded that “what I’m thinking is, what [the respondent] should have done is … [the appellant] definitely wanted [the respondent] to shift [the date of commencement] to 14th [of July] or whatever”.

There was no evidence that the agreement between the parties was for commencement of the tenancy to be 14 July 2014, or of any agreement to vary the commencement date of the tenancy (stated as 3 July 2014 in all the documents) to 14 July 2014.  Jimina admitted that she did not read the TA (either the one in exhibit JJ-4 or JJ-6 of her AEIC). Even if that were so, this did not affect what was stated in the TA. The appellant was not disputing the validity of the TA and had also relied on it to support its case.

</div> this did not mean that the tenancy could not have commenced on an earlier date.

The respondent denied any such agreement, but averred that the appellant was given vacant possession of the premises on 20 June 2014, rent-free, until the commencement of the TA on 3 July 2014.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 I agreed with the trial judge’s finding (at [16] of the GD) that there was no suggestion in the TA that there would be a rent-free renovation period up till 14 July 2014. The only basis for the appellant’s claim appeared to be the sentence in the LOI which stated “Renovation Period: 15 days or start of operations, whichever earlier”.  However, nowhere in the LOI was it stated that there was to be a <span class="font-italic">rent-free period</span>, and all three of the key documents (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the LOI, TA and Guarantee) stated that the tenancy was to commence on 3 July 2014. Quite simply, the appellant’s claim in this regard was only a bare assertion. Furthermore, if the parties had really agreed to a rent-free period up to 14 July 2014, it was surprising that such an agreement had not been recorded in the TA, since the rent-free period would have reduced a substantial part of the rental payable for July 2014.  Hence, I was satisfied that the trial judge had not erred in this regard. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether rent was payable in advance</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 The appellant maintained its position that the rent was payable only from 14 July 2014, and was thereafter due on the 14th of successive months. I agreed with the trial judge (at [16] of the GD) that the rent for each successive month from August 2014 would have been payable on the first day of that month. There was nothing contradicting the documentary evidence as such. Clause 1 of the TA provided that the first of the rental payments was to be paid “on or before signing of this agreement and the subsequent payments shall be made on the 1st of every succeeding calendar month payable in advance (whether formally demanded or not)”. As the trial judge found, the LOI also expressly provided for “rental in advance”. Hence, even if the tenancy was only to commence on 14 July 2014 (a claim which I had earlier rejected), the rent for the months from August 2014 had to be paid on the first day of those months, pursuant to the TA. There was also nothing to suggest that the parties had agreed to vary the date of payment under clause 1 of the TA. Indeed, Bhamah agreed in cross-examination that the “normal common practice” was to pay rent in advance.

The appellant argued that the trial judge erred in not applying the <span class="font-italic">contra proferentum</span> rule to construe the ambiguity in the TA against the respondent, since the respondent prepared the LOI, the TA and the Guarantee.

It was not disputed that the monthly rent for the second and third years of the tenancy was $16,500 (or $17,655 inclusive of GST). The trial judge based her decision on the documentary evidence, namely the LOI, the TA and the Guarantee. Although the trial judge did not appear to deal with the parties’ testimonies in the GD, I saw no reason to disturb her finding that the monthly rent payable for the first year was $16,500 (or $17,655 inclusive of GST) when considered against the entirety of the evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 The LOI expressly stated that the rent for the first year was $15,000 (excluding GST), while the rent for the second and third years would be $16,500 (excluding GST).

The LOI expressly stated that the appellant had to enter into a formal lease agreement with the respondent on the appellant’s acceptance of the offer in the LOI. In other words, the LOI did not represent the final version of the parties’ agreement.

</div> The trial judge found that the rental rebate, when applied to the monthly rent of $16,500 (including service charge but excluding GST payable), would result in the first year’s monthly rent of $15,000 (excluding GST payable) and would be consistent with the intention of the parties as described in the LOI.

</div>
</div>  If the appellant’s position in this regard were true, it was difficult to understand why the respondent would have given the appellant a lower monthly rental rate (of $15,000) in the first year, and also give a rental rebate of $1,500 if the appellant paid rent promptly. This potentially amounted to a total reduction of $3,000 per month for the first year. Hence if the appellant had paid rent promptly, it would effectively only have had to pay $13,500 per month (excluding GST), which did not appear to have been the parties’ intention at any point in time. Crucially, the appellant’s actions were not consistent with its case in this regard. If it were the case that the payable sum per month was $15,000 (excluding GST) and the appellant had (as it claimed) paid rent promptly, then it was strange that it made the payments it did to the respondent but never raised the issue of the rental rebate with the respondent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Moreover, the Guarantee dated 14 July 2014, signed by Jimina and Bhamah to guarantee the appellant’s monthly payment of rent, clearly stated that the TA was for a term of three years “at a monthly rent of $16,500”. The sum of $16,500 was not stated to be inclusive of GST. The Guarantee embodied the personality liability of the appellant’s directors for the terms under the TA, and was more consistent with the respondent’s case. Jimina and Bhamah claimed that they did not read through the Guarantee and were not given a copy of it after it was signed.

Even if I believed them, this would not have changed the legal effect of what was stated in the Guarantee. Jimina and Bhamah have also not claimed that some form of coercion or fraud occurred in the process of signing the Guarantee.  Hence, I accepted that since the Guarantee was executed contemporaneously with the TA, this showed that the parties intended the monthly rent to be $16,500 (excluding GST payable), and that any concession given by the respondent in the first year’s rent was in the form of a rebate upon prompt payment (as explained by Ang).

This knowledge was clearly alluded to in Jimina’s and Bhamah’s AEICs. If Jimina had called the respondent to dispute the actual rental amount, and the respondent nevertheless continued to send monthly invoices for rent at $17,655 and even legal demands for rental arrears, it was improbable that the appellant would not write to the respondent to register its protest or to dispute the rental arrears. The respondent’s representative(s) whom the appellant purportedly called were also not identified.

This was despite the appellant mentioning the renovations in its pleadings. Second, the first time the alleged oral agreement was mentioned was in the appellant’s former solicitor’s letter to the respondent’s former solicitors on 27 April 2015,

</div> after the respondent had terminated the tenancy. Third, the appellant’s witnesses had never raised the alleged oral agreement in their AEICs, but instead maintained throughout that the monthly rent payable was $16,050 (including GST). Fourth, Jimina conceded in cross-examination that after the appellant spoke to the respondent about reducing the rent, the respondent’s representative (Jesline) did not revert on this and hence Jimina assumed that the respondent did not agree to this.

</div> which was identical to the Table. Mr Retnam, however, stated before me that based on the appellant’s schedule, the payments were to start from 14 July 2014. In my view, even going by the appellant’s own case and schedule, that rent was payable only from 14 July 2014 and on the 14th day of every month, it was clearly late in paying rent almost every month. The trial judge made the same observation (at [19] of the GD).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Given my agreement with the trial judge’s finding that rent was supposed to be paid on the first day of every month (with the exception of July 2014), and the monthly rent was $17,655, the appellant was clearly late in its payment of rent and in arrears. As I noted above at [35], the appellant should have paid 10 months of rent. It was clear from the Table that the appellant had not made any payment for April 2015, which was due on 1 April 2015. Therefore, even based on the month of April 2015 alone, the appellant was in breach of the TA.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the respondent lawfully terminated the TA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 I agreed with the trial judge that since the appellant had not paid rent in full and on time, the respondent was entitled to terminate the lease and had lawfully done so, and exercised its right of re-entry under cl 6.1 of the TA. The respondent had given various notices and made numerous demands in writing to the appellant, the last being on 7 April 2015

</div>. Specifically, the letter of 7 April 2015 had stated that as a consequence of the appellant’s failure to pay rent in full or promptly, it had breached the TA and the respondent had exercised its right in turning off the electricity on 6 April 2015. The letter further stated that if the arrears were not settled promptly, the respondent would exercise its rights under the TA to re-enter and re-possess the premises without further notice, which it did on 9 April 2015.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 As cl 6.1 of the TA reserved the right to forfeit the lease, s 18(9) of the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act (Cap 61, 1994 Rev Ed) (“CLPA”) applied in that s 18 of the CLPA did not affect the law relating to re-entry or forfeiture in case of non-payment of rent. A lessor thus has a right to forfeit a lease for non-payment of rent if this is expressly reserved by the lease (<span class="font-italic">Alwee Alkaff v Syed Jafaralsadeg and others and another action</span> [1997] 3 SLR(R) 419). The forfeiture can be done by way of physical and peaceable re-entry without a court order if the conditions contained in the forfeiture clause in the lease are satisfied and the right has not in the meantime been waived by the lessor (<span class="font-italic">Protax Co-operative Society Ltd v Toh Teng Seng and another</span> [2001] SGHC 84 at [18] and<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Kataria v Safeland plc</span> [1998] 1 EGLR 39 at 41). In this case, cl 6.1 dispensed with the requirement of a formal demand of unpaid rent and did not expressly state any period of time which had to elapse before the right of re-entry could be exercised. Despite cl 6.1, the respondent nevertheless gave the appellant numerous notices, the last being on 7 April 2015. Therefore, the respondent’s actions in terminating the lease were lawful.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 I also agreed with the trial judge that there had been no waiver by the respondent of the appellant’s breach, and the trial judge’s reasoning in this regard could not be faulted (see [31] of the GD). I add also, that even if the respondent, by agreeing to the appellant’s renovations and accepting the lower rent for that period, could be said to have waived its right to terminate the tenancy (which I rejected), there was no evidence that the waiver would apply to prospective or further breaches by the appellant after the renovations were completed. According to Jimina, the renovations were completed by the end of March 2015.

Bhamah and Rajesh, the appellant’s directors, admitted in cross-examination that they had no proof and were merely speculating that the respondent had cut off the supply of electricity.

</div> The appellant could not show that the respondent “unjustifiably” failed to contact Jesline. In any event, the appellant would have known, by the time the parties’ AEICs were exchanged, that the respondent would not be calling Jesline and the appellant could have made arrangements to call her if it thought necessary. There is no property in a witness. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 More importantly, the appellant did not show that Jesline’s evidence had potential significance to the entire matter and which could not be resolved by considering the other evidence (see [21] to [29] above). I considered that her evidence could shed some light on the negotiations leading up to the signing of the LOI and the multiple TAs. However, the effect of the LOI alone was limited because it was expressly stated to be subject to a formal lease agreement. As for the circumstances of the signing of the TAs, it became evident at the hearing before me that it was inconsequential as to why there were three copies of the TA signed on two different dates; the parties did not dispute that the material contents were the same. Since I found that it was not appropriate to draw an adverse inference against the respondent for failing to call Jesline as a witness, I also failed to see how adverse inferences should be drawn for the respondent’s failure to call Geraldine, Chua Peng Hong and Pei Wen, mentioned in the Appellant’s Case,
