The respondents then sought the setting aside of the recognition order. Some time was taken to confirm the state of proceedings in Indonesia. These grounds will focus on the respondents’ application for setting aside.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 These proceedings demonstrated that there may be some room for a regional recognition regime or common approach as not all issues may be resolved by the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency (“the Model Law”), even if it were extended in Singapore to include personal bankruptcy orders.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The present proceedings were commenced arising out of bankruptcy and insolvency orders made in Indonesia against the Respondents, as well as a company with which they were connected, PT Megalestari Unggul.

In doing so, the court, citing <span class="font-italic">Giant Light Metal Technology (</span><span class="font-italic">Kunshan) Co Ltd v Aksa Far East Pte Ltd </span>[2014] 2 SLR 545 (“<span class="font-italic">Giant Light</span>”) at [67], reiterated the criteria for recognition, namely that that the decision was the final and conclusive judgment of a court which, according to Singapore private international law rules, had jurisdiction, and no defence to recognition applied. The court there emphasised the need for finality and conclusiveness, without going into the question of the availability of any appeal, as it was primarily concerned with the operation of the <span class="font-italic">res judicata </span>doctrine. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) As to when a judgment would be final and conclusive, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">The “</span><span class="font-italic">Bunga Melati 5” </span>[2012] 4 SLR 546 stated (at [81]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… A judgment is <span class="font-italic">final and conclusive on the merits </span>if it is one which cannot be varied, re-opened or set aside by the court that delivered it ...

The clearest distinction, though, is in their effects: recognition provides a basis for various consequences, including, in the context of insolvency and bankruptcy proceedings, the rendering of assistance to the foreign insolvency practitioners appointed by the foreign court. In comparison, <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span>, which comprises three distinct but interrelated principles, namely, cause of action estoppel; issue estoppel; and the “extended” doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata </span>as set out in <span class="font-italic">Henderson v Henderson </span>(1843) 3 Hare 100, is essentially a passive doctrine: see <span class="font-italic">The Royal Bank of Scotland NV (formerly known as ABN </span><span class="font-italic">Amro Bank NV) and others v TT International Ltd (nTan Corporate Advisory Pte Ltd and others, other parties) and another appeal </span>[2015] 5 SLR 1104 at [98]. Under the doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span>, there is no scope for the granting of assistance or other similar consequential reliefs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 A similar position is stated in <span class="font-italic">Dicey, Morris and Collins on </span><span class="font-italic">the Conflict of Laws </span>vol 1 (Lawrence Collins gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 15th Ed, 2012) at para 14-026:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">.... At common law, a foreign judgment may be final and conclusive even though an appeal is actually pending in the foreign country where it was given. “In order to its receiving effect here, a foreign decree need not be final in the sense that it cannot be made the subject of appeal to a higher court; but it must be final and unalterable in the court which pronounced it; and if appealable the … court will only enforce it, subject to conditions which will save the interests of those who have the right of appeal.” So in a proper case a stay of execution would no doubt be ordered pending a possible appeal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">This makes clear that a foreign judgment may be final and conclusive, though it is subject to appeal. Recognition will not be denied, but a stay or other order may be made to preserve the position pending appeal.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 I was of the view that recognition should be granted to a foreign bankruptcy order if the following requirements are met:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the foreign bankruptcy order is made by a court of competent jurisdiction.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, that court must have jurisdiction on the basis of:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) the debtor’s domicile or residence; or</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) submission by the debtor to the jurisdiction of the court.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, the foreign bankruptcy order must be final and conclusive.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Fourth, no defences to recognition apply.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 I noted the concern expressed in <span class="font-italic">Cross-Border Insolvency</span> (Richard Sheldon gen ed) (Bloomsbury, 4th ed, 2015) at para 9.3, citing <span class="font-italic">Ex parte </span><span class="font-italic">Stegmann</span> 1902 TS 40,<span class="font-italic"> </span>against the use of the recognition doctrine in respect of bankruptcy orders, as such orders are not judgments but bind the whole world. A similar argument was made by the respondents, citing <span class="font-italic">Law</span><span class="font-italic"> and Practice of Bankruptcy in Singapore and Malaysia</span> (Kala Anandarajah <span class="font-italic">et </span><span class="font-italic">al</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>(Butterworths Asia, 1999) at p 472:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">To argue that a foreign bankruptcy is like a foreign judgment and so should be recognised on the same basis is not strictly accurate. This is because, unlike in the case of a judgment which impacts only upon the parties thereto, a foreign bankruptcy has a much wider impact.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 I was, with respect, not convinced that that was a valid distinction to draw in order to deny the use of the foreign judgment doctrine in this area. I was not persuaded that the fact that a bankruptcy order affects the whole world renders it different from other judgments or orders: corporate insolvency orders have the same effect after all. The effect of a bankruptcy order should be taken into account in considering the scope of recognition and assistance. But given the modified universalist approach modified endorsed in <span class="font-italic">Beluga</span>, which applies just as much to bankruptcies as to corporate insolvencies as a matter of principle, cooperation should be extended. Some of the authorities invoked were much older, and came from an era in which there was less international cooperation and a different view was taken not just of foreign bankruptcies but also insolvencies.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 There have been a number of Singaporean decisions in which recognition was given to foreign insolvencies, restructurings and receiverships, as noted above. Recognition of the foreign appointment of insolvency practitioners does, however, throw up a number of issues in comparison to recognition and enforcement of foreign money judgments. The assistance of the court would be required, particularly in dealings with assets, monies and information. These go beyond what is entailed in the enforcement of foreign judgments, for instance. The effects on third parties may also be more extensive. For that reason, it may be appropriate for the court to impose restrictions or requirements, for example, on the expatriation or taking possession of certain assets. In this regard, the requirements of the Model law may provide some suitable guidance.    </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Jurisdiction</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 The applicants argued that the jurisdiction of the Indonesian Court was established on the basis that the respondents: (i) were Indonesian citizens; and (ii) had voluntarily submitted to its jurisdiction. The applicants pointed to the fact that the respondents had not challenged the jurisdiction of the Indonesian Court; their complaint on notice was about their inability to attend the PKPU hearing and raise the issue of the alleged fraud being committed. It was argued that the respondents had participated in the Indonesian proceedings culminating in the Indonesian Bankruptcy Orders through their lawyers; it was not necessary for them to have attended or participated in each and every meeting.

</div> The Depok District Court also made a finding that the receivers were not entitled under Indonesian law to exercise the voting rights of a bankrupt person’s shares.

Thus, limitations may be placed on the repatriation of funds out of Singapore, and orders for possession and sale may be required if other interests in Singapore are affected. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 In the circumstances, full recognition was granted to the Indonesian Bankruptcy Orders. The applicants were empowered to administer the respondents’ property in Singapore, save that leave of court should be obtained in respect of transfers of real or immovable property and for the repatriation of any assets out of Singapore. While the applicants were authorised to seek and receive information on the respondents’ finances from various banks, any moneys were to remain in the existing accounts. The order on information from banks was stayed pending the resolution of the appeal following the Respondents’ application in Summons No 2381 of 2019.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Change in receivers</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 There was a change in receivers, but I did not consider that this affected the recognition and assistance. Such changes are not uncommon for various reasons. There was no necessity to start <span class="font-italic">de novo</span>, unless the basis of the receiver’s authority was some different order of the foreign court.

The indications were that an Indonesian court would not in any situation recognise a Singapore insolvency or restructuring decision, or the appointment of Singapore receivers and managers. The common law has not imposed such a requirement, though it is a feature of a number of civilian systems. The 1st Respondent suggested mirroring the position of the Indonesian courts, which would not seem to recognise Singaporean bankruptcy orders.

The argument in respect of (a) was essentially the same as that for the breach of natural justice which I rejected (see [38]–[40] above). Taking (b) and (c) together, these could not constitute a failure to make full and frank disclosure as I found that there were no appeals underway against the Indonesian Bankruptcy Orders (see [26]–[36] above). Finally, for (d), I accepted the applicants’ explanation that the Indonesian judgments relied upon by the Respondent had actually been overturned by the Supreme Court of Indonesia.

</div> I was not persuaded as the applicants brought in sufficient evidence to show that there was a difference in position as to the amounts owed by the respondents. As argued by the applicants, this would be an issue for the Indonesian Court, and would be dealt with by the applicants in the discharge of their duties as receivers, with the final tallying of the amounts to be done subsequently.
