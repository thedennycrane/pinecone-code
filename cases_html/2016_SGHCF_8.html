The parties were married in the UK on 30 May 1998. The Wife was 24 years old at the time of marriage and the Husband, 32. Now aged 42 and 50 years old respectively, the Wife and the Husband have four children presently aged 16, 14, 12 and 9 years old. Throughout the marriage, the Wife was a home-maker while the Husband worked was an engineer at a global energy company based in the UK (“the Company”). In the course of the parties’ marriage, they relocated seven times to diverse places such as Beijing, southern China, Spain and Malaysia. Such were the demands of the Husband’s job, which kept him very busy throughout the marriage. The four children were born during these relocations in a period of seven years. In 2008, parties relocated to Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The Husband commenced divorce proceedings on 27 November 2012 alleging that the Wife had behaved in such a way that he could not reasonably be expected to live with her. On her part, the Wife counterclaimed on a similar basis. The Wife left the matrimonial home on 1 November 2013 and has since late November 2013 shuttled between Singapore and Thailand. Interim Judgment (“IJ”) was granted on 24 February 2014 on both the Claim and Counterclaim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The District Judge (“DJ”) made orders in relation to the ancillary matters on 14 August 2015.

This amounted to S$135,554.10. As the Wife had obtained the benefit of the sale proceeds of a matrimonial property the parties owned in Thailand (“the Thai Property”), the DJ ordered her to retain the same and her own assets, leaving a balance of about S$50,000, which the Husband was ordered to pay her, while he retained all the other matrimonial assets. Using a multiplier of ten years and a multiplicand of S$1,262 as a monthly figure, the DJ awarded the Wife lump sum maintenance of S$145,000 (rounded down from S$151,440).

A statement of entitlement provided by the Husband furnished the broad details of the Pension.

</div>
</div> In this regard, while the Husband joined the pension scheme one year before parties married, this asset was acquired throughout the duration of the marriage and “‘acquisition’ continues until the asset is fully acquired” (see <span class="font-italic">BHN v BHO</span> [2013] SGHC 91 at [36], citing <span class="font-italic">C</span><span class="font-italic">hee Kok Choon v Sern Kuang Eng</span> [2005] 4 MLJ 461 at [9]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 The query which followed from the inclusion of the asset was its valuation for the purposes of inclusion. Here, the acquisition of the Pension started on 1 May 1997, one year prior to the marriage. The date furnished for the guaranteed price was 16 June 2014, about four months after the date of the IJ. The document also showed that the Husband had left the fund by the time of the IJ, as the fund was part of his expatriate package based on UK terms and benefits and he started employment on local terms with the Singapore subsidiary in May 2013. With his retrenchment in 2016 from the local subsidiary, at the minimum, it appeared open to him to exit the scheme or to transfer the minimum guaranteed sum into another scheme. In view of the uncertainties attached to its value, I find it equitable to use a conservative approach. Applying the ratio of 15:16; that is, the ratio of the length of marriage relative to the period over which the guaranteed sum of the Pension was accumulated, I derive a figure of S$248,912. The sum within the matrimonial pool of assets and available for division is therefore S$791,128.39 (S$542,216.39 + S$248,912).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">(ii) Issue of an adverse inference against the Wife</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 At the hearing below, the DJ rejected the Husband’s contention that an adverse inference should be drawn against the Wife regarding her alleged retention of amounts disbursed by the Husband for the purchase of and subsequent proceeds of sale of the Thai Property (“the Thai Property Transactions”). The DJ was of the view that “[t]he explanations and tables provided by the Husband were mere assertions and self-serving, with no supporting documents to show the alleged purposes for which the monies were used” (DJ’s GD at [50]).

To this end, the Husband alleges that THB 4,979,433 had been transferred to the Wife during this period.

</div>
</div> It was undisputed that the purchase price of the Thai Property was THB 1,300,000. The Husband’s first allegation is that the Wife had siphoned THB 3,679,433. He arrives at this figure by deducting the amounts transferred to the Wife from the purchase price of the Thai Property. He also adduces the Wife’s bank statement/book that shows withdrawals of THB 2,610,000 on 18 September 2011 and THB 100,000 at or about that time.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 The Wife states that the monies in excess of the purchase price of the Thai Property were spent on holidays and other expenses in relation the Thai Property. The Husband’s retort to this is that the Wife has not adduced evidence to show that this is the case. He also argues that any expenditure by the family while on holiday in Thailand would be minimal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 In my judgment, this allegation of siphoning is completely at odds with the factual matrix at the relevant time. The transfers to the Wife and the withdrawals by the Wife should be, in all likelihood, matters wholly known to the Husband, as all these events occurred <span class="font-italic">when the parties were still on good terms</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>and<span class="font-italic">, </span>perhaps, even more importantly,<span class="font-italic"> the Husband managed the money in the family</span>. The Husband must therefore have known how these monies were expended at the relevant time. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 The second allegation of siphoning is in relation to the sale proceeds of the Thai Property. The Wife sold the Thai Property in December 2013. According to the receipt by the Department of Lands, Thailand, the sale price was THB 2,000,000.

The certificate from the Department of Lands would thus be conclusive evidence that the sale proceeds of THB 2,000,000 were received and retained by the Wife from the sale of the Thai Property.

Analysing the arguments in totality, I find that the Husband’s position that I should draw an adverse inference of S$17,000 against the Wife is simply not borne out by the evidence.

She found that the Wife’s indirect contributions were lessened in the last five years of the marriage. The DJ found (at [41]) that the Husband also made substantial indirect contributions in the management of the family’s dealings with third parties for financial, medical and school matters and noted his increased involvement with the children’s matters after the Wife left the matrimonial home in November 2013. She therefore decided that the parties’ indirect contributions were in equal proportions for the duration of the marriage. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Turning back to the division, the DJ determined that the Wife’s 25% share of the pool of matrimonial assets amounted to S$135,554.10. As the Wife had obtained the benefit of the sale proceeds of the Thai Property, the DJ ordered her to retain the same and her own assets, leaving a balance of about S$50,000, which the Husband was ordered to pay her. The Husband was to retain all the other matrimonial assets. To this end, the Husband was to solely enjoy the benefit of all assets held in the parties’ joint names by way of a transfer from the Wife of her share, title and interest in a property in the UK and a closure of the parties’ bank account, with the balance amounts retained by the Husband. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 During the Appeals, there was agreement on the direct contribution ratio (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Step 1 ratio) used below.

</div>
</div> Mr Koh submits that there was no legal obligation on the part of the Husband to disclose his intention to remarry. He argues that it is “merely a moral obligation” and a fact that was “good [for the court] to know”. He points out that, in any case, the Husband’s remarriage does not impinge on the welfare of the children as the children live with him. Mr Campos argues that the Husband’s intention to remarry is a material fact that ought to have been disclosed. In his view, it would colour the Husband’s whole version of the Wife’s lifestyle being the reason for the breakdown of the marriage. He argues that this non-disclosure by the Husband should operate in favour of the Wife such that a lot more credit be given to her version of events.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 As noted by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">BG v BF</span> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 233 (“<span class="font-italic">BG v BF</span>”), at [52], the general duty owed by parties to the court to “make full and frank disclosure of all relevant information within his or her knowledge[,] is particularly relevant in the context of the division of matrimonial assets.” The absence of full and frank disclosure would entitle the court to draw a suitable adverse inference. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 In the context of matrimonial proceedings, the lack of full and frank disclosure is normally argued in the context of one party not disclosing his or her assets (see, for example, <span class="font-italic">Koh Kim Lan Angela v Choong Kian Haw </span>[1993] 3 SLR(R) 491 at [31]). Nevertheless, in keeping with the observations of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">BG v BF</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>that the duty of full and frank disclosure is one that is derived from general law, the duty of full and frank disclosure must extend with equal force to material facts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 In <span class="font-italic">Tay Long Kee Impex Pte Ltd v Tan Beng Huwah (trading as Sin Kwang Wah)</span> [2000] 1 SLR(R) 786, the Court of Appeal gave guidance on what “material facts” are (at [21]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The difficulty here is in determining what facts are material. Any definition of “materiality” has to be, by its very nature, general. In the words of Ralph Gibson LJ in <span class="font-italic">Brink’s-Mat Ltd v Elcombe</span> [1988] 3 All ER 188 “<span class="font-italic">material facts are those which it is material for the judge to know in dealing with the application</span>.” It need not be “decisive or conclusive” — <span class="font-italic">per</span> Warren L H Khoo J in <span class="font-italic">Poon Kng Siang v Tan Ah Keng</span> [1991] 2 SLR(R) 621. We would add that the duty to disclose applies not only to material facts known to the applicant but also such additional facts which he would have known if he had made proper inquiries. The extent of the inquiries which an applicant should make would have to depend on the facts and circumstances prevailing in the case.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Seen from this perspective, the fact that the Husband was planning to remarry is without a doubt material to the Court’s analysis when dealing with parties’ ancillary matters. Generally, it is central to the issue of the children’s well-being. Even if, as in the present case, the issue of their care and control was largely uncontested arising from the circumstances, it was relevant to the Court’s wider role in ensuring that arrangements have been made in the children’s best interests. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 In the case at hand, the remarriage was relevant as to whether lump sum maintenance should be ordered for the Wife. Indeed, Mr Campos’ submission was that this non-disclosure lent great credence to the Wife’s version of events in relation to her contributions to the family, the Husband’s behaviour in taking over the management of the home, and his role in alienating the children against her. I agree with this to some degree. It explained why, for example, he would padlock the gates in late November 2013 after the Wife left the matrimonial home, or omit to update the Wife on the family’s new address after they moved out themselves. The Husband’s conduct also indicated that he knew the importance of his remarriage in context. The children were under strict instructions from the Husband not to disclose the relationship, and later, the remarriage, to their mother. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">My conclusion on the indirect contribution ratio</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Viewing the parties’ indirect contributions in the round, the 50:50 allocation made by the DJ in relation to the Step 2 ratio was too low. From 1998 to 2009, for the first 11 years of the marriage, it was not disputed that the Wife was the sole anchor in the home. During this time, the couple relocated seven times and had four children closely spaced together, in the span of seven years. The youngest child was only two when they made their final move to Singapore in 2008. The care of four babies and young children born in quick succession in unfamiliar surroundings would have been extremely demanding. Even if, as the Husband contended, the Wife had help from a grandmother and uncle at various points, this does not detract from her substantial role for these first 11 years.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 In 2009, the Wife’s household burden was lightened with, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, a maid, but she still had charge of all household matters. The Husband participated in the couple’s active social life and thus could scarcely complain now about that. While the Husband took over household matters in 2012, this too, was with the help of a maid; and this was already the 14th year of the marriage, when the youngest was about 5 years old, past the most punishing babysitting years. His failure to inform the Court of his remarriage plans and his decisions which sought to marginalise the Wife from the lives of the children were not made in the children’s best interests, and may be taken into consideration in context. On the whole, the Step 2 ratio should be 35:65 in favour of the Wife. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Weightage and overall ratio</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 The Wife suggested that the weightage in Step 3 of <span class="font-italic">ANJ v ANK</span> of the Step 1 and Step 2 ratios should be 40:60 in favour of indirect contributions. She argues that this is necessary in “recognition of the length of [the] marriage, the size of the matrimonial assets and the extent and nature of indirect contributions made by both parties throughout the marriage”.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Viewing the whole marriage in its context, I was of the view that the weightage in Step 3 should be equal. While the Wife’s contributions to the home were substantial, this was so for a period of just under a dozen years, and the Husband has been in charge of the home since sometime in 2012. At the same time, while the Husband was solely responsible for the accumulation of the family wealth, the total asset pool, despite his 15 years on a UK expatriate pay package, was surprisingly modest. Deducting the property in the UK, which mortgage was largely funded by rental save for £200 a month, the sum remaining is small in the light of his career trajectory which, for example, on his Singapore assignment from 2008–2013, included monthly pay of S$43,000 a month and benefits

</div> He seems to be arguing that he could ill afford to pay. Four months after the Husband filed for divorce, his terms of employment changed from expatriate status with allowances to a local package. At the time of the Appeals, as adduced through his affidavit filed after the hearing of the ancillary matters, he had been retrenched because the oil and gas sector was in a downturn. He had also suffered a relapse of Bell’s Palsy.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The Wife, on her part, argues that the sum of S$1,263 per month used to compute the lump sum maintenance by the DJ should be raised to S$2,700 per month to take into account that she was spending S$3,500 per month up to the time of the divorce.

</div> She argues that a multiplier of 16 years should be applied instead of the ten years applied by the DJ. She submits that the lump sum maintenance should amount to S$518,400.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 There is no merit to the Husband’s contention that the Wife’s standard of living should be pegged to the Thai rate. The Wife has to substantially spend her time in Singapore so that she can be near the children. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 As noted in <span class="font-italic">ANJ v ANK</span> (at [42]), “an appellate court will seldom interfere in the orders made by the court below unless it can be demonstrated that it has committed an error of law or principle, or has failed to appreciate certain material facts”. The appellate court will also be slow to make minor adjustments for idiosyncratic reasons (see <span class="font-italic">Koh Bee Choo v Choo Chai Huah</span> at [46], citing <span class="font-italic">MZ v NA </span>[2006] SGHC 95 at [5]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 A <span class="font-italic">clean break</span> is desirable whenever feasible (see <span class="font-italic">AYM v AYL and another appeal </span>[2014] 4 SLR 559 (at [18])). This was especially so in this case where the Husband has remarried.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Coming to the sum set by the DJ, the monthly figure was a conservative one, and made with a thorough analysis of each expense item of the Wife (see DJ’s GD at [61]). While ten years could be generous, this balanced out the modest monthly sum. The same lump sum could have been attained with fewer years and a monthly sum on the more generous side of the scale. In this case, it would also be reasonable to allocate some sum for training. The Wife married the Husband at 24 and has spent most of the marriage on the children and home. Her command of English remains poor and she will have to take time to equip herself with skills in order to rejoin the workforce. Therefore, I find myself in broad agreement with the DJ.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 One issue is whether I ought to change the order in light of the Husband’s evidence as to his retrenchment from 15 January 2016 and his Bell’s Palsy relapse. His emails and letters in his own affidavit, however, indicate that he was ready to commence work as at the date of retrenchment. It is also clear that the Bell’s Palsy was a pre-existing condition for the Husband. The relapse and its management was part of a condition that he has managed over the course of his career. What is important is that the evidence indicates that he is <span class="font-italic">able to pay</span> the lump sum ordered. His testimonials and recommendations also indicate that he is likely to be able to gain employment again in due course.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 There is thus no reason to make any kind of adjustment as to the award of S$145,000. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Wife’s responsibility for child maintenance</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 In light of the uncertainty surrounding the Wife’s earning capacity, the DJ ordered that the Husband maintain the children solely.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The Husband submits that since he has care and control of the children and the Wife has the potential to earn up to S$2,500 as a makeup artist in the future, the Wife should pay a cumulative maintenance of S$200 per month for the four children. He appears to be suggesting that the law <span class="font-italic">categorically</span> <span class="font-italic">demands</span> that both parents should contribute to the maintenance of the child. The Wife on the other hand argues that her income capacity remains uncertain, as there is no guarantee that she will get a job although she had completed the makeup artist course. It is “purely unreasonable” for the Husband to ask her to contribute towards the maintenance of the children at his point.

</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The Husband’s appeal may find support in two High Court cases where husband and wife were ordered to bear their children’s maintenance equally.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 In<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">BNH v BNI </span>[2013] SGHC 283 (“<span class="font-italic">BNH v BNI</span>”), the parties were undergoing a divorce and the wife there earned less than the husband. The husband earned an average monthly income of $36,214.55. The wife’s monthly income was $19,162.42. The court ordered maintenance for both children at $9,500 a month, to be split equally between the parties, with comment (at [37]) as follows: “[a]lthough the [h]usband earns more than the [w]ife, given my comments that marriage is really an equal partnership between the parties, I am of the view that the cost of maintenance should be equally borne by both parties”.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 In <span class="font-italic">TBC v TBD</span> [2015] 4 SLR 59 (“<span class="font-italic">TBC v TBD</span>”), the High Court decided that s 68 of the Charter imposed an obligation on both parents a duty to maintain their child, whether they were legitimate or illegitimate, and also reviewed various cases in relation to the apportionment of maintenance of a child. It held (at [27]) that the relevant legal position should be stated as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In the absence of any statutory provisions which regulate the apportionment of the maintenance to be paid by parents to their children, it is left to the courts to lay down the proper approach to be followed. The primary concern of s 68 is that parents discharge their duties to maintain their child or children. Each parent stands in the same parent-child relationship with the child or children and each parent has the duty to maintain the child or children. Against that backdrop, the starting point should be that the parents bear the financial burden equally. One parent’s burden should not be decreased just because the other parent is wealthier, and one parent’s burden should not be increased just because the other parent is less well off. However, this should not be an inflexible rule<span class="font-italic">; if one parent is unable to contribute equally with the other parent, then that parent should contribute what he or she can, and the other parent should make up the shortfall, so that the child will receive the full measure of maintenance. The norm should not be that parents contribute in proportion to their means because that will place unequal burdens on them for no good reason</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 In that case, while the complainant drew a lesser salary as compared to the respondent, who was the father of the illegitimate child, the court ordered that the parties contribute equally to the maintenance of the child. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The statutory directive to parents as regards the maintenance of their children is found in s 68 of the Charter. It provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Duty of parents to maintain children</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">68. Except where an agreement or order of court otherwise provides, it shall be the duty of a parent to maintain or contribute to the maintenance of his or her children, whether they are in his or her custody or the custody of any other person, and whether they are legitimate or illegitimate, either by providing them with such accommodation, clothing, food and education as may be reasonable having regard to his or her means and station in life or by paying the cost thereof.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Also set out in s 69(4) of the Charter are the factors that the court would consider in ordering maintenance for the wife or child. Those factors are:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) the financial needs of the wife or child;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) the income, earning capacity (if any), property and other financial resources of the wife or child;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) any physical or mental disability of the wife or child;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) the age of each party to the marriage and the duration of the marriage;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(e) the contributions made by each of the parties to the marriage to the welfare of the family, including any contribution made by looking after the home or caring for the family;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(f) the standard of living enjoyed by the wife or child before the husband or parent, as the case may be, neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for the wife or child;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(g) in the case of a child, the manner in which he was being, and in which the parties to the marriage expected him to be, educated or trained; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(h) the conduct of each of the parties to the marriage, if the conduct is such that it would in the opinion of the court be inequitable to disregard it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 In this context, while the law regards both parents as equally responsible, it does not regard all parents as equally able or capable. As noted by the district judge in <span class="font-italic">XB v XC</span> [2008] SGDC 144 (at [34]), “equality in responsibility does not necessarily suggest equality in financial contribution regardless of each parent’s financial means.” Equality in responsibility holds <span class="font-italic">each</span> parent responsible for the care of their children. It does not translate into exactly the <span class="font-italic">same </span><span class="font-italic">duties</span>, as the tasks they allocate between themselves must be a function of their talents and abilities. Where circumstances are such that capabilities differ, parents have a <span class="font-italic">duty to cooperate</span> so that their children are fully looked after. In making various child orders post-divorce, Courts have long recognised the different roles each parent may play. For example, while joint custody may be the norm, exceptions apply if the situation so demands (see <span class="font-italic">CX v CY (minor: custody and access)</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[2005] 3 SLR 690<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [24]). Different orders are made as to care and control or access for each parent as the specific needs of each child requires. When the Court’s intervention is required to support parents in their co-parenting, the paramount interest of the child would mean that the Court does so with regard to the circumstances of the family and <span class="font-italic">how </span><span class="font-italic">each parent’s distinct capabilities may best be directed in the best interests of their children</span>. The issue of child maintenance should be treated in like manner. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Of interest is the approach of the High Court and Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">ANJ v ANK</span>. In that case, the High Court ordered that the apportionment of the children’s expenses between the Husband and the Wife be in the proportion 65:35. On appeal, the Court of Appeal held (at [43]) that although the ratio of the Husband’s monthly income to the Wife’s monthly income was 62:38, there were no grounds for appellate intervention. The important point to note is the Court of Appeal’s acceptance of the principle that maintenance of the children should be apportioned in accordance with, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the financial capabilities of the parents. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The prevailing standard of s 68 (and s 69) of the Charter must be reasonableness having regard to all the circumstances of the case, and the best interests of the children. In accordance with the Court of Appeal’s approach in <span class="font-italic">ANJ v ANK</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the financial capabilities of the parents must be <span class="font-italic">a valid consideration</span>. In this context, both the parties in <span class="font-italic">TBC v TBD</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>and<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">BNH v BNI</span> were well able to afford the orders for equal contribution. In the present case where the Wife has no income, her lack of financial means is <span class="font-italic">a relevant factor</span> that suggests that she is not in a position to contribute to the maintenance of the children. She married young, without any qualifications, and was far too busy with the house and home for most of the marriage to acquire skills or training. For the last 18 years, the Husband has maintained the family solely. With the transition, it is reasonable to allow the status quo <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> the children’s maintenance to continue and to give the Wife some time to acquire skills and training in order to re-position herself in the job market, at the age of 42. In contrast, the Husband is well educated, has been – and, in my opinion, remains – a man of means. It is reasonable for the Husband to continue to maintain the children solely at this point in time, while the Wife is finding her feet. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 That said, a mother’s financial responsibility to her children is a continuing one, for so long as the circumstances mandated under the Charter prevail. If circumstances for the Wife improve, the Husband is always able, under the law, to apply for a variation in the child maintenance order upon a material change in circumstances.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 In the result, I dismiss the Husband’s appeal in DCA 140/2015 <span class="font-italic">in</span> <span class="font-italic">toto</span>.
