<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was an appeal against the decision of the

                    he:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_a"></a>(a)     struck out, pursuant to O 18
                        r 19 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed)
                        (“the Rules”) and the inherent jurisdiction of the court, the
                        claim of the appellant, Her Majesty’s Revenue &amp; Customs
                        (“the Appellant”), against the respondents, Hashu Dhalomal
                        Shahdadpuri and Notandas s/o Premchand Jamnadas Udasi @ Nari Premchand
                        (referred to hereafter as, respectively, “the First
                        Respondent” and “the Second Respondent”, and
                        collectively as “the Respondents”); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_b"></a>(b)     discharged the Mareva injunction which
                        the Appellant had obtained against the Respondents on 18 May 2010
                        (“the Singapore Mareva Injunction”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1">At the
                    conclusion of the hearing, we allowed the appeal. We now give our
                    reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The parties to the dispute</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The Appellant is an entity of the UK government
                    and is responsible for, <em>inter alia</em>, collecting,
                    accounting for and otherwise managing customs and excise revenue, as well as
                    collecting and managing value added tax (“VAT”) in the UK. The
                    Respondents, who are Singapore residents, are the alleged officers and agents of
                    PT Naina Exim Indo (“PT Naina”), a company incorporated
                    in Indonesia.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Background to the dispute</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The Appellant’s claim is in respect of
                    conspiracy by unlawful means (“unlawful means conspiracy”) by the
                    Respondents (acting in concert with other parties) to defraud the Appellant
                    through a form of fraud known as missing trader intra-community
                    (“MTIC”) fraud, and to conceal such fraud and the proceeds of such
                    fraud from the Appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The Appellant commenced an action in England
                    against the Respondents for unlawful means conspiracy to commit MTIC fraud
                    (“the English Action”) and obtained a worldwide Mareva injunction
                    against them in that action. Thereafter, the Appellant commenced simultaneous
                    actions in Singapore against the Respondents (“the Present
                    Action”) and in Hong Kong against, among others, the First Respondent
                    (“the Hong Kong Action”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The conspiracy pleaded by the Appellant in the
                    Present Action arose in the following manner:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_a"></a>(a)     A Danish company
                        (“Sunico”) was alleged to have been the chief perpetrator of a
                        series of MTIC frauds committed against the Appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_b"></a>(b)     Sunico had supplied goods to several
                        suppliers in member states of the European Union (“EU
                        Suppliers”). The EU Suppliers had in turn sold the goods to a trader
                        registered in the UK for VAT (a “UK Importer”). Under
                        Art 28c(A)(a) of the Sixth Council Directive of 17 May 1977 on the
                        harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to turnover taxes
                        (EEC Council Directive 77/388/EEC) and s 30 of the Value Added Tax
                        Act 1994 (c 23) (UK) (“the UK VAT Act”), the UK Importer
                        was not required to pay VAT on the goods imported from the EU Suppliers as
                        such imports were zero-rated.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_c"></a>(c)     The UK Importer then sold the goods to another party
                        registered for VAT in the UK (a “Buffer”). The UK Importer
                        charged VAT on the goods sold (“output tax”), but directed the
                        Buffer to pay the purchase price of the goods, together with the output tax
                        payable thereon, to a third party outside the UK’s jurisdiction (a
                        “Third-Party Recipient”). In the present action, the
                        Third-Party Recipient is Sunico, which is situated in
                    Denmark.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_d"></a>(d)     The UK
                        Importer deliberately failed to account to the Appellant for the output tax
                        on the goods sold to the Buffer and subsequently “went
                        missing” (so to speak).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_e"></a>(e)     The Buffer sold the goods directly or via a chain of
                        traders to an exporter (an “Exporter”), who paid VAT thereon
                        (“input tax”) and exported the goods out of the
                    UK.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_f"></a>(f)     The Exporter
                        claimed reimbursement from the Appellant of the input tax which he paid on
                        the exported goods.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_g"></a>(g)     PT Naina allegedly introduced some of the EU Suppliers to Sunico
                        and was paid a percentage of Sunico’s profits as commission pursuant
                        to a commission agreement. Specifically, Sunico was alleged to have paid
                        some US$14,764,612 as commission to PT Naina between October 2002 and
                        July 2006.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_h"></a>(h)     The
                        Appellant claimed that the commission agreement and the commission payments
                        to PT Naina were “not genuine commercial transactions, but
                        instead a mechanism for the division of the proceeds of MTIC fraud amongst
                            co-conspirators”,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> and that the effect of the
                        conspiracy was to “unlawfully divert monies properly payable to the
                        [Appellant] principally to Sunico and thereafter … to its
                            co-conspirators”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_i"></a>(i)     The Respondents were alleged to be the representatives of
                        PT Naina, which had concealed the proceeds of the conspiracy. On this
                        basis, the Respondents were said to be jointly and severally liable to the
                        Appellant for damages for conspiracy. The Exporter, however, was not alleged
                        to be a party to the conspiracy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       On 18 May 2010, the Appellant obtained the
                    Singapore Mareva Injunction against the Respondents. In June 2010, the
                    Respondents applied to discharge the Singapore Mareva Injunction; they also
                    applied to strike out the Appellant’s claim under O 18 r 19 of
                    the Rules as well as pursuant to the inherent jurisdiction of the
                court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       On 23 September 2010, the Appellant filed
                    its amended statement of claim (“the Appellant’s amended
                    SOC”). On 28 September 2010, the Judge allowed the
                    Respondents’ striking-out applications and struck out the
                    Appellant’s amended SOC on the ground that the Appellant’s claim
                    offended what he termed “the revenue rule” (<em>ie</em>, the rule that “[the] courts will not collect the
                    taxes of foreign states for the benefit of the sovereigns of those foreign
                    states” (see <em>Dicey, Morris and Collins on The Conflict
                        of Laws</em> (Sir Lawrence Collins gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell,
                    14th Ed, 2006) at vol 1, para 5-029)) as it was, in substance, a
                    claim to recover uncollected output tax. Subsequently, the Appellant requested a
                    further hearing before the Judge. After hearing the Appellant’s further
                    arguments on 3 November 2010 and 2 December 2010 (in the latter
                    instance, consequent upon the decision of the Hong Kong Court of First Instance
                    (“the Hong Kong CFI”) in <em>Her Majesty’s
                        Revenue &amp; Customs v Shahdadpuri</em> [2010] 5 HKLRD 690
                        (“<em>Shahdadpuri (HK)</em>”)
                        <em>vis-à-vis</em> the Hong Kong Action, where the
                    Appellant had made a similar claim based on similar allegations against the
                    First Respondent as the allegations made in the Present Action), the Judge
                    affirmed his decision of 28 September 2010 to strike out the
                    Appellant’s claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The Judge held that it was plain and obvious
                    that the Appellant’s claim in the Present Action was “in substance
                    and in effect an attempt to recover the uncollected VAT (output tax) …
                    extra-territorially” (see the GD at [30]). As such a claim was contrary to considerations of public
                    policy, the Judge struck out the Appellant’s amended SOC pursuant to
                    O 18 r 19 of the Rules (with emphasis on O 18
                        r 19(1)(<em>d</em>)) and the inherent jurisdiction
                    of the court (see the GD at [30] and
                        [41]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The Judge also discharged the Singapore Mareva
                    Injunction on the ground that it was not for the purpose of rendering any
                    assistance to the English Action, and regarded the Appellant’s argument to
                    the contrary as “a mere attempt to delay the application of the revenue
                    rule at the expense of the [Respondents]” [emphasis in original omitted]
                    (see the GD at [32]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The parties’ arguments on appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Appellant’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The Appellant’s contentions on appeal
                    may be summarised as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_a"></a>(a)     A conspiracy claim for MTIC fraud
                        was not a prerogative claim for tax (which would offend the revenue rule),
                        but a private law claim (in tort) for damages for conspiracy. In this
                        regard, the Appellant advanced the following arguments:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_10-p2_a-p3_i"></a>(i)       The majority of the House
                            of Lords decided in <em>Revenue and Customs Commissioners
                                v Total Network SL</em> [2008] 1 AC 1174
                                (“<em>Total Network</em>”) that
                            the Appellant’s conspiracy claim in that case for what was termed
                            “carousel fraud” (a form of fraud similar to MTIC fraud)
                            was not a prerogative claim for tax, but a claim for damages for
                            conspiracy.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_10-p2_a-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       As between the Appellant and the First
                            Respondent, the Hong Kong CFI decided in <em>Shahdadpuri (HK)</em> that the Appellant’s claim
                            in the Hong Kong Action was not a claim for tax and, consequently, did
                            not offend the revenue rule.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_10-p2_a-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       The Appellant’s claims in <em>Total Network</em> and <em>Shahdadpuri (HK)</em> could not be distinguished from
                            the Appellant’s claim in the Present Action.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_10-p2_a-p3_iv"></a>(iv)       The Appellant’s claim
                            against the conspirators (including the Respondents) remained a private
                            law claim for damages in respect of out-of-pocket losses sustained by
                            the Appellant. It was not a claim for tax, irrespective of whether the
                            Exporter was innocent of or party to the conspiracy.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_10-p2_a-p3_v"></a>(v)       Although the
                            Appellant’s losses were measured with reference to payments and/or
                            claims purportedly made in relation to tax, that did not make the
                            Appellant’s claim a claim for tax.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_10-p2_a-p3_vi"></a>(vi)       With the Appellant’s claim
                            properly characterised as a private law claim for damages for
                            conspiracy, the claim did not offend the revenue
                    rule.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_b"></a>(b)     Granting the Singapore Mareva Injunction to aid or assist the English
                        Action would not offend the revenue rule because substantive determination
                        of the Appellant’s claim in the English Action would take place only
                        in the UK.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The First Respondent’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The First Respondent’s arguments before
                    this court may be summarised as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_a"></a>(a)     The law on the revenue rule was
                        clear: the Singapore courts would not enforce the revenue law of a foreign
                        state. In this respect, it was for the Singapore courts to decide whether
                        the Appellant’s claim in the Present Action infringed the revenue
                        rule, without having regard to how UK law (the UK being the foreign state
                        concerned in this case) viewed the claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Appellant’s claim as pleaded in the
                        Appellant’s amended SOC was a claim for unpaid output tax, which the
                        Singapore courts would not enforce, and was thus bound to fail. Hence, this
                        was a plain and obvious case for striking out.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_c"></a>(c)     The majority decision in <em>Total Network</em>, which the Appellant relied so heavily upon,
                        was not applicable to the Present Action. It also did not support the
                        Appellant’s position.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_d"></a>(d)     
            <em>Shahdadpuri (HK)</em>,
                        which the Appellant also sought to rely on, was wrongly
                    decided.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_e"></a>(e)     The Judge
                        was correct to hold that the Appellant’s claim was a plain and obvious
                        attempt to enforce UK revenue law extra-territorially (by recovering, via
                        the Singapore courts, unpaid output tax) and, hence, had to be struck
                        out.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_f"></a>(f)     Since the
                        Present Action was geared towards assisting the enforcement of any UK
                        judgment obtained in respect of a revenue claim, this court should not aid
                        such a cause by reinstating the Singapore Mareva Injunction in favour of the
                        Appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Second Respondent’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The Second Respondent’s case was that
                    neither the Judge nor the Appellant had fully addressed the issue of
                    characterisation of the Appellant’s claim. The issue, it was submitted,
                    was not whether the Appellant was bringing a private law action or seeking
                    damages for conspiracy, as opposed to recovering unpaid tax. Rather, what
                    mattered was the central interest of the Appellant in bringing the Present
                    Action, <em>ie</em>, the substance of the interest which
                    the Appellant sought to enforce (in this regard, the Second Respondent cited, in
                    particular, the Australian High Court case of <em>Her
                        Majesty’s Attorney-General in and for the United Kingdom v Heinemann
                        Publishers Australia Proprietary Limited and another</em> (1988)
                    165 CLR 30 (“the <em>Spycatcher</em>
                    case”) at 46). The Second Respondent argued that the central interest of
                    the Appellant in bringing the Present Action was governmental in nature because
                    the action focused on the recovery of compensation for losses that the
                    Appellant, in its capacity as the UK’s tax authority, had suffered in the
                    course of collecting tax payable under the UK’s revenue laws and
                    administering those laws. In short, the Second Respondent submitted that the
                    Appellant’s claim was one that had its roots in the operation of a UK tax
                    statute, <em>ie</em>, the UK VAT Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The Second Respondent further submitted that
                    the revenue rule rendered the Present Action non-justiciable in Singapore. This
                    was because the Appellant’s claim was: (a) peculiar to the Appellant
                    as the UK’s tax authority; (b) based on UK revenue law; and,
                    therefore, (c) not maintainable by a private person. The Appellant’s
                    claim, it was argued, should properly be characterised as a claim based on or
                    arising out of acts <em>jure imperii</em>, and/or as a
                    claim involving the enforcement of a foreign governmental interest (<em>ie</em>, the governmental interest of a foreign state). It
                    followed that the Appellant’s claim infringed the revenue rule and was not
                    justiciable in Singapore. In the circumstances, it was plain and obvious that
                    the Appellant’s claim should be struck out.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Finally, the Second Respondent submitted that
                    should the Appellant’s claim indeed be found to be non-justiciable in
                    Singapore, it would be impossible for the Singapore courts to reinstate the
                    Singapore Mareva Injunction since the purpose of the injunction was to aid the
                    English Action; therefore, to reinstate that injunction would be to indirectly
                    enforce UK revenue law in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issue before this court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Since this was an appeal against the decision
                    of the Judge to strike out the Appellant’s claim pursuant to O 18
                    r 19 of the Rules and the inherent jurisdiction of the court, the sole
                    issue before us was whether it was plain and obvious that the Appellant’s
                    claim was a claim for unpaid output tax (according to the First Respondent),
                    and/or a claim arising out of acts <em>jure imperii</em>
                    and/or involving the enforcement of a foreign governmental interest (according
                    to the Second Respondent) so as to be unenforceable in the Singapore
                    courts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In the present case, the Respondents
                    invoked:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_a"></a>(a)     O 18 r 19 of the Rules,
                        which provides that the court may at any stage of the proceedings strike out
                        any pleading on the basis (<em>inter alia</em>) that it
                        “discloses no reasonable cause of action or defence, as the case may
                        be” (see O 18 r 19(1)(<em>a</em>)) or
                        “is otherwise an abuse of the process of the [c]ourt” (see
                        O 18 r 19(1)(<em>d</em>));
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_b"></a>(b)     the inherent
                        jurisdiction of the court to “make any order as may be necessary to
                        prevent injustice or to prevent an abuse of the process of the
                        [c]ourt” (see O 92 r 4 of the Rules).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The law on striking out a claim based on the
                    above two grounds is well established. In the case of striking out under
                    O 18 r 19 of the Rules, it is done only in a plain and obvious case
                    for striking out (see the GD at [36]–[38] and
                        <em>Wing Joo Loong Ginseng Hong (Singapore) Co Pte Ltd v
                        Qinghai Xinyuan Foreign Trade Co Ltd and another and another
                        appeal</em> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 814 at [171]–[173]). In
                    the case of striking out pursuant to the inherent jurisdiction of the court,
                    this court said in <em>Gabriel Peter &amp; Partners (suing as a
                        firm) v Wee Chong Jin and others</em> [1997] 3 SLR(R) 649 at
                        [22]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The term, “abuse of the process of the Court”, in O 18
                            r 19(1)(<em>d</em>), has been given a wide
                        interpretation by the courts. It includes considerations of public policy
                        and the interests of justice. This term signifies that <em>the process of the court must be used</em> bona fide <em>and properly and must not be abused</em>. The court will
                        prevent the improper use of its machinery. It will prevent the judicial
                        process from being used as a means of vexation and oppression in the process
                        of litigation. The categories of conduct rendering a claim frivolous,
                        vexatious or an abuse of process are not closed and will depend on all the
                        relevant circumstances of the case. A type of conduct which has been
                        judicially acknowledged as an abuse of process is the bringing of an action
                        for a collateral purpose … In <em>Lonrho plc v Fayed
                            (No 5)</em> [1993] 1 WLR 1489, Stuart-Smith LJ
                        stated that, if an action was not brought <em>bona
                            fide</em> for the purpose of obtaining relief but for some other
                        ulterior or collateral purpose, it might be struck out as an abuse of the
                        process of the court. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">This court’s decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     As mentioned at <a href="#p1_1">[1]</a> above, we allowed the present appeal at the conclusion of
                    the hearing. This was because, as we shall explain below, we did not think it
                    was plain and obvious that the Appellant’s claim in the Present Action was
                    a claim for unpaid output tax and/or a claim arising out of acts <em>jure imperii</em> and/or involving the enforcement of a
                    foreign governmental interest.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The argument that the Appellant’s claim was a claim for unpaid
                output tax</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Judge’s view</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The Judge held that the present case was a
                    clear case for striking out under O 18 r 19 of the Rules as the
                    Appellant had pleaded its claim as one to enforce in Singapore VAT
                    (specifically, output tax) payable pursuant to UK revenue law, which claim was
                    contrary to the public policy of Singapore. The Judge pointed out that the
                    Appellant had not alleged that the claims by the Exporter for reimbursement of
                    input tax were fake or illegitimate; further, the Exporter was not alleged to be
                    or sued as a party to the conspiracy. Accordingly, the Judge reasoned, the
                    Appellant’s claim for damages for conspiracy was in substance and in
                    effect an attempt to recover extra-territorially the uncollected output tax
                    properly payable to the Appellant. As such a claim was plainly unsustainable
                    under Singapore law, the Judge struck out the Appellant’s claim pursuant
                    to O 18 r 19 of the Rules (with emphasis on O 18
                        r 19(1)(<em>d</em>)) and the inherent jurisdiction
                    of the court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Although the Judge characterised the
                    Appellant’s claim as “essentially one for [the] recovery of
                        <em>output</em> [tax] which the UK [I]mporter defaulted
                    in paying” [emphasis added] (see the GD at [24]), in analysing the nature of the Appellant’s claim,
                    he also accepted, as a matter of law, that if the Appellant’s claim had
                    been for the recovery of <em>input</em> tax, it would have
                    been arguable that the claim might not be regarded as a sovereign claim for the
                    recovery of a revenue debt. In this regard, he said (at [22] of the GD):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If the claim was indeed against the Exporter, or had at least implicated
                        the Exporter, it might have been arguable that [the Appellant] was in
                        essence making a civil claim for [the] recovery of <em>input
                            tax</em> which it had previously collected but had been deceived
                        into reimbursing to the Exporter. <b><em>Unlike a claim for

                        in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Our assessment of the Judge’s view</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     In our view, given the Judge’s
                    concession on the law as set out in the preceding paragraph, this was not a
                    plain and obvious case for striking out under O 18 r 19 of the Rules
                    as, based on the Appellant’s amended SOC, the Appellant’s claim
                    could arguably be characterised as, in substance, a claim for the recovery of
                        <em>input</em> tax which the Appellant had been
                    deceived into reimbursing the Exporter in the context of the overall scheme of
                    the MTIC fraud allegedly perpetrated by the Respondents. In other words, the
                    Appellant’s claim could arguably be characterised as a claim which,
                    according to the Judge himself, might not offend the revenue rule, and which
                    might thus be justiciable by a Singapore court. Our conclusion to this effect
                    should not, however, be regarded as an endorsement on our part of the
                    Judge’s proposition that a claim by the Appellant for the recovery of
                    input tax might not, under Singapore law, be a sovereign claim for the recovery
                    of a revenue debt. For the purposes of this appeal, it was not necessary for us
                    to decide whether we agreed with that proposition, and we express no opinion on
                    it in these grounds of decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   The Judge’s emphasis on the Appellant’s omission
                to plead that the Exporter was a party to the conspiracy</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     An important factor which influenced the
                    Judge’s finding that the Appellant’s claim was in substance and in
                    effect an attempt to recover uncollected output tax extra-territorially was the
                    fact that the alleged conspiracy between the Respondents, as pleaded by the
                    Appellant, did not involve the Exporter. The Judge said at [22] of the GD:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [B]ased on the [Appellant]’s claim, the only party that
                        could have wrongfully obtained reimbursements of input tax from [the
                        Appellant] in the whole factual matrix of MTIC fraud would have been the
                        Exporter. If the claim was indeed against the Exporter, or had at least
                        implicated the Exporter, it might have been arguable that [the Appellant]
                        was in essence making a civil claim for [the] recovery of <em>input</em> tax which it had previously collected but had been
                        deceived into reimbursing to the Exporter. Unlike a claim for [the] recovery
                        of unpaid <em>output</em> [tax], such a civil claim
                        might arguably be distinguishable from a sovereign claim for [the] recovery
                        of a revenue debt. In the present case however, <em>by
                            omitting the Exporter from the alleged conspiracy (“the material
                            omission”), the [Appellant]’s claim is not in respect of
                            the reimbursements paid out by [the Appellant]</em>. It was common
                        ground before me that in the absence of conspiracy involving the Exporter as
                        co-conspirator, the UK [I]mporter’s failure or default in payment of
                        VAT [<em>ie</em>, output tax] does not affect the
                        eligibility of the Exporter to make a <em>bona
                            fide</em> reimbursement claim from [the Appellant]. Equally, the
                        failure (intentional or otherwise) on the part of the Exporter to make a
                        claim for reimbursement does not absolve the UK [I]mporter from liability to
                        pay any outstanding output [tax]. <em>It follows from the
                            material omission that the losses were suffered by [the Appellant]
                            because of the UK [I]mporter’s failure to pay output tax,
                            regardless of whether the reimbursements of input tax were wrongly paid
                            out</em>. The present claim is therefore essentially for the
                        recovery of output tax properly payable (but not paid) by the UK [I]mporter
                        to [the Appellant]. [original emphasis omitted; emphasis added in
                        italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In essence, the Judge’s reasoning was
                    that since the Appellant’s claim was not for the recovery of input tax
                    from the Exporter (which claim would arguably <em>not</em>
                    be in breach of the revenue rule), it must perforce be a claim for uncollected
                    output tax which one of the conspirators in the chain of transactions had failed
                    to pay to the Appellant. For this reason, the Judge was of the view that the
                    majority decision in <em>Total Network</em> was
                    distinguishable as the Exporter in that case was alleged to be a conspirator in
                    the carousel frauds perpetrated against the Appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Apropos this point, it was our view that the
                    Judge (with respect) placed excessive weight on the fact that the Appellant did
                    not allege that the Exporter in the Present Action had conspired with the
                    Respondents to cheat the Appellant. In our view, it was not plainly unarguable
                    that an MTIC fraud must involve every dealer in the chain of transactions,
                    whether an Exporter or a UK Importer, before it could form the basis of a claim
                    for damages for conspiracy. As Blackburne J noted in the English High Court
                    case of <em>Regalway Care Limited (in liquidation) v Abdul Malik
                        Shillingford (also known as Abdul Malik), AVAH Trading Limited,
                        Victoria Clarke, EBST Limited and Imad Yacoub Shoubaki (First Touch
                        Communications Limited, Direct Communication UK Limited and Vita Moderna
                        Limited, interveners)</em> [2005] EWHC 261 at [7], “[i]t can happen that one or more
                    of the ‘[B]uffers’ is innocent of any involvement in the fraud: he
                    just happens to have purchased the goods and sold them on”. In a similar
                    vein, the Hong Kong CFI held in <em>Shahdadpuri (HK)</em> at [24]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The fact that potentially innocent [Exporters] might have been involved,
                        presumably to give the scheme some resemblance of legitimacy, does not
                        convert a fraudulent scheme into a legal one, even partially. The plain fact
                        as raised by [the Appellant] in its pleaded case is that it has suffered
                        monetary loss by having paid out on VAT refund claims which are not genuine
                        and which are presented to it fraudulently pursuant to the
                        conspiracy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In the Present Action, the Appellant’s
                    case, as pleaded, was that the Exporter was but the last Buffer in the chain of
                    transactions that led the Appellant to reimburse the Exporter for input tax.
                    Regardless of whether the Exporter was innocent of or party to the conspiracy,
                    he would pay the purchase price of the goods concerned plus the applicable VAT
                        (<em>ie</em>, input tax) thereon to either the
                    Third-Party Recipient or a Buffer earlier in the chain. The Exporter would then
                    make a claim for reimbursement of the input tax paid, which claim the Appellant
                    would be obliged to pay. The mechanism by which monies were extracted from the
                    Appellant would be exactly the same, regardless of whether the Exporter was
                    innocent of or party to the conspiracy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Of course, in a case where the Exporter was
                    also a conspirator, there would be the additional element of the Exporter making
                    a fraudulent representation to the Appellant in presenting his claim for
                    reimbursement of the input tax paid. But, even if the Exporter were an innocent
                    party, we did not think that it was plain and obvious that the Appellant’s
                    conspiracy claim for damages would inevitably fail. In such a scenario, the
                    conspirators would in effect have practised deceit on the innocent Exporter by
                    leading him to believe that the preceding transactions were legitimate and that
                    it was therefore legitimate for the Buffer to include input tax on his (the
                    Exporter’s) purchase. The Exporter would then present a claim (which he
                    believed to be genuine) to the Appellant for reimbursement of the amount which
                    he had paid as input tax. But, since the preceding transactions were a sham and
                    were dishonestly initiated in order to extract monies from the Appellant, the
                    Appellant, in making payment on the Exporter’s reimbursement claim, would
                    be deceived into reimbursing the Exporter. Hence, whether or not the Exporter
                    was a party to the conspiracy, the Appellant would be out of pocket with respect
                    to the input tax that it reimbursed the Exporter and would, arguably, be
                    entitled to recover those out-of-pocket losses from the
                conspirators.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In our view, the Judge also adopted too narrow
                    an interpretation of the Appellant’s pleaded case. As mentioned at
                        <a href="#p1_21">[21]</a> above, it was arguable that, in
                    substance, the Appellant’s pleaded case was for the recovery of input tax
                    which the Appellant had been deceived into reimbursing the innocent Exporter in
                    the context of the alleged conspiracy by the Respondents (acting in concert with
                    other parties) to defraud the Appellant. The Appellant specifically asserted
                    that its loss crystallised on reimbursement of input tax being made to the
                    Exporter, as can be seen from para 4(n) of the Appellant’s amended
                    SOC:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [T]he net effect of MTIC fraud transactions is
                        that:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">i.    No amount … is received by the
                                [Appellant] from the [UK] [I]mporter … in payment of

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">ii.    
                <em>the [Appellant]
                                    nevertheless makes a payment on a VAT repayment claim to the

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">iii.   
                <em>the [Appellant]

                                not have sustained in a lawful chain of supply.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[underlining in original omitted; emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Similarly, para 5 of the Appellant’s amended SOC
                    stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The [Appellant] has identified 719 MTIC fraud transaction chains
                        (“the Relevant Transaction Chains”) … By reason of the
                        Relevant Transaction Chains, the [Appellant] has suffered loss in the sum of
                        £40,391,100.01, being <em>the … amount that the
                            [Appellant] has … paid on VAT repayment claims to the [Exporters]
                            in respect of the Relevant Transaction Chains</em>, without having
                        received any amount in … payment of VAT from the [UK Importers].
                        [underlining in original omitted; emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In short, what the Appellant pleaded was
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_a"></a>(a)     it had suffered loss and damage
                        because it had not received the amount of output tax which the UK Importer
                        should have paid to it, and, yet, the chain of transactions had resulted
                        into its being obliged to reimburse the Exporter for input tax paid by the
                        latter; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_b"></a>(b)     but
                        for the conspiracy, the aforesaid loss and damage would not have
                        occurred.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In this regard, we should point out that the
                    Appellant’s pleaded case excluded those transaction chains in which the
                    Appellant had been successful in rejecting the Exporter’s reimbursement
                    claims (and thus had not paid out any monies to the Exporter)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> as, in those instances, the Appellant
                    did not suffer any loss. This is consistent with Ward LJ’s
                    observation in <em>Revenue and Customs Commissioners v Total
                        Network SL</em> [2007] 2 WLR 1156 (the English Court of Appeal
                    decision which gave rise to the appeal in <em>Total
                        Network</em>) at [3] that
                    “the loss crystallises when the trader who exports the goods from the
                    United Kingdom [<em>ie</em>, the Exporter] makes a
                    repayment claim”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     In the circumstances, we were of the view that
                    the Appellant’s claim in the Present Action could also be interpreted as a
                    claim for the recovery of input tax which the Appellant had been deceived into
                    reimbursing an Exporter who was an innocent actor in the chain of transactions
                    that was conceived as part of the conspiracy to defraud the Appellant. Such a
                    claim, according to the Judge himself, was arguably <em>not</em> contrary to the revenue rule. In other words, it was
                    arguable that the Appellant’s claim was not one which was barred by the
                    revenue rule. This was therefore not a plain and obvious case for striking
                    out.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   The decision in <em>Shahdadpuri (HK)</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In coming to the above conclusion, we took
                    into account the Hong Kong CFI’s decision in <em>Shahdadpuri (HK)</em> apropos the Hong Kong Action (which was
                    brought against (<em>inter alia</em>) the First Respondent,
                    but not the Second Respondent).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In the HK Action, the Appellant applied, by
                    way of a concurrent originating summons dated and issued on 18 May 2010
                    (“the COS”), for an interim injunction in aid of the English
                    Action. The Appellant succeeded in obtaining an <em>ex
                        parte</em> Mareva injunction against (<em>inter
                        alia</em>) the First Respondent restraining him from removing from
                    Hong Kong or disposing of any of his assets in Hong Kong up to the value of
                    £40m (“the Hong Kong Mareva Injunction”). The First
                    Respondent applied to strike out the COS and discharge the Hong Kong Mareva
                    Injunction, relying on the sole ground that the COS “disclose[d] no
                    reasonable cause of action” (see O 18 r 19(1)(a) of the Rules
                    of the High Court (Cap 4A, Sub Leg) (HK), which is the Hong Kong equivalent
                    of O 18 r 19(1)(<em>a</em>) of the
                Rules).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Recorder Jat Sew Tong SC
                    (“the Recorder”) rejected the First Respondent’s submission
                    that the Appellant’s claim was in substance one that sought to enforce the
                    UK’s revenue laws. He accepted the decision of the majority of the House
                    of Lords in <em>Total Network</em> that the
                    Appellant’s claim in that case was a private law claim, stating (at
                        [19] of <em>Shahdadpuri (HK)</em>):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Mr Pun [counsel for the First Respondent] seeks to distinguish
                            [<em>Total Network</em>] on the basis that the
                        majority’s view in that case was said in the context of the Bill of
                        Rights 1689 argument [as to which, see further sub-para (a) of
                            <a href="#p1_37">[37]</a> below]. That may have been so,
                        but <em>I fail to see why the majority’s analysis of
                            the nature of the claim in [</em>Total Network<em>]
                            (which is no different from that advanced in this case) does not apply
                            in this case</em>. Indeed, as Mr Ma [counsel for the
                        Appellant] points out, <em>the [F]irst [R]espondent’s
                            arguments on the nature of the claim are no different from those
                            advanced on behalf of [the defendant in</em> Total
                            Network<em>] and firmly rejected by the majority of the
                            House</em>: see [<em>Total Network</em>],
                        pp. 1211D–E, 1213H and 1214B–1215C. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Recorder held that the Appellant’s claim for “[the]
                    recovery by way of damages [of] the out-of-pocket losses which it ha[d] suffered
                    as a result of the alleged fraud perpetuated by the conspirators” (see
                        <em>Shahdadpuri (HK)</em> at [20]) was “capable of giving rise to a
                    judgment which [could] be enforced in Hong Kong under any Ordinance or at common
                    law” within the meaning of s 21M(1)(b) of the High Court Ordinance
                    (Cap 4) (HK). Accordingly, he dismissed the First Respondent’s
                    application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In the court below, the Judge held that the
                    decision in <em>Shahdadpuri (HK)</em> “offered
                    little assistance” (see the GD at [33]) to the Appellant because:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_a"></a>(a)     the Recorder appeared to have been
                        misled by the Appellant’s counsel in the Hong Kong Action;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_b"></a>(b)     the Appellant
                        had alleged in the Hong Kong Action that the Exporter was involved in the
                        conspiracy in question, which made that action “significantly
                        different” (see the GD at [35]) from the Present Action, where there was no such
                        allegation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     We do not propose to deal with the
                    Judge’s reasons for distinguishing the decision in <em>Shahdadpuri (HK)</em> as we do not wish to express any view on
                    the correctness or otherwise of the Recorder’s decision, which, in any
                    event, is not binding on the Singapore courts. Suffice it to say that <em>Shahdadpuri (HK)</em> was decided in favour of the
                    Appellant on what were essentially the same facts as those in the Present
                    Action, save that the Exporter in that case was alleged to have been involved in
                    the conspiracy, whereas no such allegation was made in the Present Action. The
                    Judge regarded this as a material fact. However, as we indicated earlier, the
                    element of the involvement of the Exporter as a party to the alleged conspiracy
                    might, arguably, not be material to the issue of whether the Appellant could
                    seek recovery from the Respondents as alleged conspirators in a scheme which
                    deceived the Appellant into paying the Exporter’s claims for reimbursement
                    of input tax when the Appellant had not received any corresponding output
                    tax.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The decision in Total Network</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Ultimately, whether or not the
                    Appellant’s claim in the Present Action would be contrary to the revenue
                    rule is an issue for our courts to decide at a trial, and not at this
                    interlocutory striking-out stage. This issue is not only a novel one under our
                    law, but also a complex one. In this regard, it is important to bear in mind the
                    context of the majority decision in <em>Total Network</em>,
                    which the Appellant relied heavily upon to support its contention that a
                    conspiracy claim for MTIC fraud was not a prerogative claim for tax, but a
                    private law claim for damages for conspiracy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     As alluded to earlier (at sub-para (a)(i)
                    of <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a> above), <em>Total
                        Network</em> involved the Appellant’s conspiracy claim in
                    respect of carousel frauds which were similar to the alleged MTIC frauds in the
                    present case. The defendant in <em>Total Network</em> was a
                    company incorporated in Spain (“Total Network”). It sold goods to
                    a UK Importer (“Redlaw”), which did not pay any input tax as the
                    goods were zero-rated for the purposes of import into the UK (Spain being part
                    of the European Union). In turn, Redlaw sold the goods to a Buffer and failed to
                    account for the output tax to the Appellant. The goods were sold down a chain of
                    traders in the UK to an Exporter (“Alldech”), which in turn sold
                    and exported the goods back to Total Network, thus completing one full circle.
                    Alldech obtained reimbursement of input tax from the Appellant. The Appellant
                    then brought a conspiracy claim against Total Network to recover a sum
                    equivalent to the amount of tax which the Appellant claimed it had lost as a
                    result of the carousel frauds.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Two main issues had to be decided in <em>Total Network</em>, namely:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether the Appellant’s claim
                        came within the scope of the prohibition contained in Art 4 of the Bill
                        of Rights 1689 (c 2) (UK) (“the Bill of Rights 1689”),
                        which states that “levying money for or to the use of the Crown by
                        pretence of prerogative, without grant of Parliament, for longer time, or in
                        other manner than the same is or shall be granted, is illegal”;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_b"></a>(b)     whether the
                        Appellant was empowered under the prevailing statutory regime in the UK VAT
                        Act to maintain a claim in private law in the form pleaded, <em>ie</em>, in the form of a conspiracy
                claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Four out of the five law lords held
                    (Lord Hope of Craighead dissenting) that the Appellant’s claim was
                    not a claim for tax or the levying of tax, but a claim for loss caused by
                    fraudulent conspiracy, and therefore did not offend the fundamental
                    constitutional principle enshrined in Art 4 of the Bill of Rights 1689 that
                    no money should be levied for or to the use of the Crown except by grant of
                    Parliament. Three out of the five law lords also held (Lord Hope and
                    Lord Neuberger of Abbotsbury dissenting) that no intention that the
                    Appellant should be barred from recovering damages for conspiracy was to be
                    attributed to the Legislature in the enactment of the statutory scheme set out
                    in the UK VAT Act, and, accordingly, the Appellant could pursue its claim
                    against Total Network.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     In our view, the majority decision in
                        <em>Total Network</em> was not a ruling that <em>as a general principle of law</em>, any conspiracy claim for
                    carousel fraud was not a prerogative claim for tax or the levying of tax.
                    Instead, the House of Lords examined the Appellant’s claim <em>in the specific context</em> of Art 4 of the Bill of
                    Rights 1689, and four of their Lordships held that the Appellant’s claim
                    was not a claim for tax or the levying of tax, but a claim for loss caused by
                    fraudulent conspiracy. The characteristics of MTIC fraud may vary depending on
                    the factual matrix of each case. Accordingly, the focus in each case should be
                    on the specific factual matrix of that particular case, and not on conspiracy
                    claims for MTIC fraud in general as though all MTIC frauds have the same legal
                    consequences.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     We should also emphasise that the majority
                    decision in <em>Total Network</em> was arrived at in the
                    context of a <em>purely domestic</em> dispute governed by
                    UK law (that case involved the House of Lords construing and applying UK law).
                    It does not necessarily follow that under Singapore law, the Appellant’s
                    claim in the Present Action (which is similar to the claim in <em>Total Network</em>) would not be regarded as an indirect revenue
                    claim or as a claim to enforce the interests of the UK government. This
                    particular issue, <em>as a conflict of laws issue</em>, has
                    not hitherto been considered by either our courts or, to the best of our
                    knowledge, any common law court. The decision in <em>Total
                        Network</em> is not binding on our courts, which, in deciding the
                    aforesaid issue, will have to consider the limits of the conflict of laws rule
                    that prohibits them from entertaining any action to enforce, either directly or
                    indirectly, a penal, revenue or other public law of a foreign state (see
                        <em>Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore</em>
                    vol 6(2) (LexisNexis, 2009) at para 75.231).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The argument that the Appellant’s claim arose out of acts jure
                imperii and/or involved the enforcement of a foreign governmental interest</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     We turn now to the Second Respondent’s
                    submission (as set out at <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a>–<a href="#p1_13">[13]</a> above) that
                    this was a plain and obvious case for striking out under O 18 r 19 of
                    the Rules because the Appellant’s claim should properly be characterised
                    as a claim based on or arising out of acts <em>jure
                        imperii</em> and/or as a claim involving the enforcement of a foreign
                    governmental interest, and was therefore contrary to the public policy of
                    Singapore. In this regard, counsel for the Second Respondent made particular
                    reference to the majority judgment of the High Court of Australia in the
                        <em>Spycatcher</em> case, and emphasised that this
                    court must have regard to the central interest of the Appellant in bringing the
                    Present Action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     In our view, there was no doubt that the
                    Appellant’s central interest in bringing the Present Action was to recover
                    the money which it had paid to the Exporter pursuant to the latter’s claim
                    for reimbursement of input tax. But, this still raised the question of whether
                    the Appellant’s claim could legitimately be characterised as an action to
                    enforce the sovereign rights or interests of a foreign state. To transpose the
                    words of the majority of the Australian High Court in the <em>Spycatcher</em> case (at 46) to the context of the present case, the
                    question was whether the Appellant’s claim for relief “[arose] out
                    of, and [was] secured by, an exercise of a prerogative of [a foreign
                    state]”. Factually, the Second Respondent was correct in submitting that
                    the Appellant’s claim arose in the context of the UK VAT Act, but our
                    courts would still have to decide whether the Appellant’s claim must
                        <em>for that reason alone</em> be held to have arisen
                    out of acts <em>jure imperii</em>, and/or to involve the
                    enforcement of a foreign governmental interest. This was a novel and complex
                    issue of law which, in our view, merited a fuller consideration of the revenue
                    rule and/or the rule against enforcing the sovereign rights of a foreign state
                    (given, especially, the evolving environment of increasing cooperation between
                    states to combat transnational crime). Furthermore, we did not have the benefit
                    of the Judge’s views on the Second Respondent’s arguments on the
                        <em>Spycatcher</em> case, except in so far as the Judge
                    decided that a governmental claim included a claim to recover, directly or
                    indirectly, the revenue of a state. For these reasons, we did not think that the
                    Second Respondent’s submissions showed that this was a plain and obvious
                    case for striking out under O 18 r 19 of the Rules.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     For the reasons set out above, we allowed the
                    appeal and set aside the Judge’s decision to strike out the
                    Appellant’s claim. We also: (a) reinstated the Singapore Mareva
                    Injunction against the Respondents; (b) ordered the costs of the appeal as
                    well as the costs of the proceedings below to be costs in the cause; and
                    (c) made the usual consequential orders.</p>
