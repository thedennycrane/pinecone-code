<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This case involves a litigant in person Linda
                    Lai Swee Lin (“the plaintiff”) who has waged a ten year battle
                    against the Singapore government represented by the Attorney-General
                    (“the defendant”) for her alleged wrongful dismissal by the Land
                    Office division (“the LO”) of the Ministry of Law
                    (“Minlaw”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The plaintiff sought <em>inter
                        alia</em> the following reliefs:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_a"></a>(a)     A ruling that her purported
                        termination on 21 December 1998 was, in fact, a dismissal which was illegal,
                        void, inoperative, in breach of the employment contract, the Constitution of
                        the Republic of Singapore, and the Public Service (Disciplinary Proceedings)
                        Regulations 1970, and in violation of the rules of natural justice;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_b"></a>(b)     Reinstatement into the Civil Service and consequentially that she be
                        entitled to her salary and all benefits (including annual increment, bonus
                        and allowance) from the date of the purported termination of her employment,
                        as if the breach had not occurred.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Previous Proceedings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The genesis of this suit can be traced to 20
                    January 2000 when the plaintiff commenced judicial review proceedings in
                    Originating Summons No 96 of 2000 to seek orders of <em>certiorari</em> and <em>mandamus</em> against
                    the Public Service Commission for terminating her employment. The Originating
                    Summons culminated in the Court of Appeal decision in Civil Appeal No 69 of 2000
                    (see <em>Public Service Commission v Lai Swee Lin
                        Linda</em> [2001] 1 SLR(R) 133) which held that the
                    plaintiff’s rights were governed by contract and involved private and not
                    public rights susceptible to judicial review.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The plaintiff then filed the present suit on 17
                    December 2004 against the government for the alleged wrongful termination of her
                    employment contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       From January 2005 onwards, the plaintiff and the
                    defendant were embroiled in a number of legal proceedings relating mostly to
                    procedural issues. Of particular significance was the automatic discontinuance
                    of the present suit due to a failure by the plaintiff to take steps in the
                    proceedings and Justice Belinda Ang’s subsequent decision to allow the
                    plaintiff to reinstate the same. The facts and events surrounding the legal
                    proceedings leading to the plaintiff’s reinstatement of the action are set
                    out in Justice Ang’s decision (see Lai Swee Lin Linda v Attorney-General
                    [2009] SGHC 38) and need not be repeated here. The previous proceedings are now
                    water under the bridge.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The plaintiff was originally from Malaysia. She
                    had outstanding academic achievements and was awarded a scholarship by the
                    Malaysian Public Service Commission to read law. She completed her law degree at
                    the University of Malaya in 1979 and subsequently obtained her Master of Laws
                    degree from the National University of Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The plaintiff was appointed a Senior Officer
                    Grade III of the LO at Minlaw by a letter of appointment dated 19 November 1996
                    (“the letter of appointment”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> The letter of appointment formed the
                    employment contract between the plaintiff and the LO.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The letter of appointment stated that her period
                    of probation was one year with effect from the date of assumption of duty. The
                    plaintiff assumed duty on 28 November 1996 which meant that her probation period
                    was supposed to end on 27 November 1997.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       It is not disputed that when the plaintiff first
                    commenced her appointment, she was designated Head (Legal) of the LO and
                    reported to the Deputy Commissioner of Lands, Liew Choon Boon
                    (“Liew”). On or about 30 June 1997, she was requested by Liew to
                    assist in the Alienation Division. It was during the plaintiff’s stint at
                    the Alienation Division that she claimed to come to know about some backlog
                    relating to the approval of the registration of land titles.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On 30 May 1998, the plaintiff sent an email to
                    Liew (“the May 1998 email”) informing him that two of the
                    Directors of the Alienation Division, Leong Foke Meng (“Leong”)
                    and Gaw Seng Suan (“Gaw”) had not informed him that there were
                    many more outstanding backlog cases. The plaintiff also copied this email to Low
                    Oon Song (“Low”) who was then the Commissioner of Lands. She
                    suggested that Liew ask Leong and Gaw to give him a list of all the outstanding
                    cases and to set a deadline to clear all the backlog. She also stated that she
                    had brought this up as a responsible Singaporean who could not just keep quiet
                    and be unconcerned with the situation.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     On the following day, ie, on 1 June 1998, the
                    plaintiff was verbally informed by Low that he would not be recommending her
                    confirmation. The plaintiff claimed that this was the first time she heard that
                    she would not be confirmed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Subsequently, the plaintiff received a letter
                    from the human resources division of the LO dated 19 August 1998 stating that
                    she would not be confirmed in her appointment based on recommendations in the
                    appraisal reports from 28 November 1996 to 27 November 1997, in respect of her
                    service. The letter informed the plaintiff that her probation would
                    retrospectively be extended for another year, viz from 28 November 1997 to 27
                    November 1998.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     On 17 December 1998, the plaintiff received
                    another letter stating that her employment would be terminated on 21 December
                        1998.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> The plaintiff was
                    given one month’s remuneration in lieu of one month’s notice. The
                    plaintiff left the LO on 21 December 1998. Since that date, the plaintiff has
                    not been gainfully employed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The plaintiff’s claim </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The reasons for the plaintiff’s
                    termination are in dispute. The plaintiff alleged that she had been terminated
                    because of the May 1998 email highlighting the backlog. In her words, she was
                    terminated because “she had the courage to bring up the delays with
                    respect to the issue of land titles and suggested that measures be taken to
                    clear the backlog”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The plaintiff claimed that she had never
                    received any adverse report<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> on her work performance. On the
                    contrary, the plaintiff claimed that she was doing well as she was given a room
                    for her office and was told by Liew sometime in November or December 1997 that
                    she had received a “generous” appraisal. She also claimed that all
                    her recommendations had been accepted by the LO.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The plaintiff claimed that she was confirmed
                    at the end of her probation period.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> The plaintiff asserted that
                    the events subsequent to the email of May 1998 were deliberately created to find
                    fault with her so that she could be terminated.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> The plaintiff also claimed that
                    her “generous” appraisal was replaced with an adverse one to
                    justify her alleged wrongful dismissal.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The plaintiff’s allegations were very
                    serious. If her allegations were true, it meant that the LO had not only acted
                    in bad faith in dismissing her for effectively being a whistleblower, but had
                    also acted dishonestly in orchestrating events to justify her wrongful
                    dismissal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The defendant’s defence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The defendant denied the plaintiff’s
                    allegations and submitted that the reason for the termination of the
                    plaintiff’s employment was her unsatisfactory performance and poor work
                    attitude. The defendant denied that the plaintiff received any favourable
                    appraisal as she claimed she did; on the contrary, she had received negative
                    appraisals from her colleagues and supervising officers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In view of the fact that the plaintiff was
                    unable to demonstrate satisfactory work performance at the end of her first
                    probation period on 27 November 1997, the defendant extended the period of
                    probation for another year until 27 November 1998. The plaintiff remained on
                    probation until her employment was terminated on 17 December 1998.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The defendant however conceded that the
                    plaintiff was never informed by the LO of its decision to extend her probation
                    period at the end of 27 November 1997 and it had thereby breached paragraph 66
                    of the Government Instruction Manuals (“Government IM”) Section
                    2B. The paragraph states that the authority must inform the officer on probation
                    whether or not he is confirmed on or before the date his probationary period
                        ends.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> The terms in the
                    Government IM were incorporated into the employment contract by reason of
                    condition 2 of the letter of appointment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The defendant also conceded that the LO was in
                    breach of paragraph 20 of the Government IM Section 2B, which states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If an officer receives an adverse report after 6 months’ service,
                        his Permanent Secretary has to inform him verbally of his shortcomings and,
                        where necessary, give him all possible help to overcome them. If the
                        shortcomings persist in the next 6 months, they have to be made known to the
                        officer, in writing. If the Permanent Secretary has doubts about the
                        suitability of the officer, or feels that the officer’s progress has
                        not been of a high enough standard for him to be confirmed, the Permanent
                        Secretary has to consider:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(c) extending his service for a further 6 months or a year; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(d) stopping or deferring his increment at the same time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The plaintiff never received any formal written reports on her
                        shortcomings.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Notwithstanding that the defendant admitted
                    that it had breached the above two paragraphs of the Government IM, the
                    defendant argued that pursuant to paragraph 86 of the Government IM Section
                        2B,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> an officer who was
                    confirmed would receive a certificate of confirmation. The defendant stated that
                    no such certificate was sent to the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In addition, the defendant also relied on
                    paragraph 25(1) of the Government IM Section 2P which states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The services of an officer on probation may be terminated without giving
                        him any reason, and by giving him one month’s notice in writing, or
                        paying him one month’s total emoluments instead of notice.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     As the defendant had paid the plaintiff one
                    month’s salary on the termination of her employment, the defendant argued
                    that the termination was valid.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     I had at the commencement of trial, on the
                    preliminary issue raised by the defendant under Order 33 rule 2 of the Rules of
                    Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) ruled that the plaintiff’s claim was not
                    time-barred under s 6(1)(a) of The Limitation Act (Cap 163, 2006 Rev Ed), as the
                    plaintiff had filed this suit on 17 December 2004 within six years of her
                    alleged wrongful termination on 21 December 1998. The only issue left for this
                    court to determine was whether the termination of the plaintiff’s services
                    by the LO was in accordance with the employment contract. If it was not, what
                    then were her remedies at law?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     There were also sub-issues relating to the
                    plaintiff’s allegations that her “generous” appraisal had
                    been replaced with an adverse one and that the defendant had dismissed her
                    because she had raised the issue of the backlog. I will deal with each of these
                    issues in turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Trial</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Before I proceed to consider the issues, I
                    should first point out that the plaintiff did not cross-examine the
                    defendant’s witnesses save for Liew. An account of what happened at the
                    hearing follows.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The trial was fixed for three days ie, 16 to
                    18 August 2010. Other than herself, the plaintiff did not call any witnesses.
                    The defendant on the other hand, called seven witnesses, six of which were
                    former employees of the LO.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The first day of trial commenced with the
                    examination of the plaintiff, and the defendants’ witnesses Bernadette
                    Sim, Tay Kee Koon, Cheng Su Cheng and Liew all of whom save for Liew the
                    plaintiff chose not to cross-examine. The day ended with the plaintiff’s
                    cross-examination of Liew (DW4), which she should have continued on the
                    following day.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     On 17 August 2010, the plaintiff called in
                    sick and tendered a medical certificate for 17 and 18 August 2010. Although the
                    medical certificate was not valid for purposes of being absent from court
                    attendance, the court accepted her absence. The hearing was vacated for both
                    days and resumed on 19 August 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     On 19 August 2010, the plaintiff should have
                    proceeded with her cross-examination of Liew. However, when invited to do so by
                    the court, the plaintiff refused. Instead, she read loudly from a document she
                    had prepared. She persisted in doing so despite advice by the court that it was
                    not the time for submissions and she should resume her cross-examination of Liew
                    and despite admonitions that the court could and would find her in contempt. In
                    view of the plaintiff’s obstinate refusal to resume her cross-examination
                    of Liew, the court released Liew.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The plaintiff persisted in her conduct for the
                    defendant’s five remaining witnesses. They were P Ramanathan, Leong, Low,
                    Gaw and Ng Ooi Gooi. These witnesses affirmed their affidavits on the stand.
                    When the plaintiff was invited to cross-examine each witness in turn, she
                    responded by reading the same document in <a href="#p1_31">[31]</a> and refused to answer the court on whether she wished to
                    cross-examine them. Consequently, all five witnesses were released without
                    cross-examination. Thereafter the court adjourned for submissions and closing
                    submissions were made by the plaintiff and counsel for the defendant on 20
                    August 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Was the plaintiff’s termination in accordance with the
                employment contract?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The defendant had already admitted that it had
                    breached para 66 of the Government IM Section 2B in not informing the plaintiff
                    of the decision not to confirm her at the end of her probation period on
                    27 November 1997.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In fact, although this was not admitted by the
                    defendant and not raised by the plaintiff, I note that the LO repeated the
                    breach in 1998 when it did not inform the plaintiff on or before
                    27 November 1998, of its decision not to confirm her, <em>viz</em>, by the end of her extended probation period. She was only
                    informed of her termination on 17 December 1998.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The question that arises is, what was the
                    implications of the defendant’s failure to inform the plaintiff that she
                    was not confirmed on or before the end of her probation period? The defendant
                    cited the case <em>K C Mathews v Kumpulan Guthrie Sdn
                        Bhd</em> [1981] 2 MLJ 320 (“<em>K C
                        Mathews</em>”) following the Indian case of <b><em>Express Newspapers Ltd</em></b><em>v</em><b><em> Labour Court &amp;
                        Anor</em></b> AIR 1964 SC 806 at <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a>
                    for the proposition that in law, if no action had been taken by way of
                    confirmation or by way of termination, the employee continued to be in service
                    as a probationer.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> The plaintiff argued to the
                    contrary, that because she was not informed that she was not confirmed at the
                    end of her probation, she should be deemed confirmed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     In my view, I do not think a general principle
                    should apply here. The fact that the plaintiff was not informed of her
                    non-confirmation does not necessarily mean that the plaintiff had been
                    confirmed. By the same token, her not being informed also does not necessarily
                    mean that she was not then confirmed. I note that <em>K C
                        Mathews</em> was decided on the facts. Similarly, the
                    plaintiff’s case here should be decided on the facts, based on the
                    employment contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     On the facts, I find the plaintiff has not
                    proven that she was a confirmed officer. According to para 86 of the Government
                    IM Section 2B,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> an
                    officer who was confirmed would receive a certificate of confirmation. It was
                    not disputed that the plaintiff had never received such a certificate. On the
                    other hand, nowhere in the employment contract did it say that the plaintiff
                    would be deemed confirmed at the end of her probation period if she was not
                    informed that she would not be confirmed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     It is unusual that the plaintiff remained on
                    probation for more than two years. However, given para 20(c) of the Government
                    IM Section 2B (see <a href="#p1_21">[21]</a> above), the
                    plaintiff’s two years probation was well within the authority of the LO to
                    impose.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     As the plaintiff was a probationary officer at
                    the time of termination, based on para 25(1) of the Government IM Section 2P (at
                        <a href="#p1_23">[23]</a> above), the defendant did not need
                    to give the plaintiff any reasons for termination. As long as proper notice had
                    been given, an employer did not have to provide reasons for terminating an
                    employee’s contract of services; <em>GYC Financial Planning
                        Pte Ltd and another v Prudential Assurance Company Singapore (Pte)
                        Ltd</em> [2006] 2 SLR(R) 865 at [28].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The plaintiff did not deny that she had been
                    served the termination letter dated 17 December 1998 and had been given one
                    month’s total emoluments. This was proper notice in accordance with the
                    employment contract and in accordance with para 25(1) of the Government IM
                    Section 2P.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The plaintiff complained that she had not been
                    heard on her termination and that was a breach of natural justice and her
                    employment contract.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> However, the plaintiff had not shown to the
                    court how her employment contract gave her a right to be heard and how or why
                    that right was applicable to her as a probationary officer. As was rightly
                    submitted by the defendant, at common law, the principle of the right to be
                    heard has no application on the dismissal of an employee in an employee-employer
                    relationship; <em>Vasudevan Pillai v The City Council of
                        Singapore</em> [1968] 2 MLJ 16<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> followed in <em>Arokiasamy

                    [2004] 2 SLR(R) 233.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     For the above reasons, I find that the
                    plaintiff’s termination had been in accordance with the terms of the
                    employment contract. On this basis alone, the plaintiff’s action should be
                    dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The grounds for the plaintiff’s termination</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Notwithstanding my finding that the
                    plaintiff’s termination was in accordance with the employment contract,
                    the plaintiff had made serious allegations against the defendant regarding the
                    grounds of her termination that necessitated the defendant defending her
                    termination. Although the LO was not required to give the plaintiff any reasons
                    for her termination, there were actually valid and cogent reasons for doing so.
                    I note that this was also an issue for the plaintiff who asserted that the
                    defendant had “failed to rebut the facts and circumstances outlined in
                    the plaintiff’s affidavits [and] the plaintiff did not know how she was
                    incompetent [as] the defendant had not adduced any evidence to show how the
                    plaintiff was incompetent in her duties”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     In the light of the gravity of the
                    plaintiff’s allegations and (hopefully) for closure of these proceedings,
                    I will go on to consider the defence in this regard and make my
                findings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The defendant’s case was that the
                    plaintiff’s employment with the LO was terminated due to her poor
                    performance and poor working relationship with her colleagues. In support
                    thereof, the defendant adduced evidence from the plaintiff’s former
                    supervisors and colleagues. They cited numerous examples of the
                    plaintiff’s inadequacies some of which will be considered
                below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The evidence of Tay Lee Koon</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Tay Lee Koon (“Tay”) was at the
                    material time the Director of the Land Acquisition Division in the LO and had
                    worked with the plaintiff when the plaintiff was asked to assist her division in
                    some matters. Tay gave evidence that she did not have a pleasant working
                    experience with the plaintiff. <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Tay (DW2) testified that the plaintiff was
                    asked for her legal input on a case involving the award of compensation for the
                    acquisition of land for the development of the train tracks on the North East
                    Line (“NEL”) of the Mass Rapid Transit subway system. However the
                    plaintiff did not provide any views on the matter despite repeated requests to
                    do so. Instead, she asked the case officer to seek advice directly from the
                    chambers of the defendant (“the AGC”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Tay highlighted that not only did the
                    plaintiff not do what she was tasked to do, the plaintiff raised some
                    unwarranted queries regarding the interpretation of some statutory provisions
                    but did not explain the reasons behind her queries.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> According to Tay,
                    this was an illustration of how the plaintiff seemed unwilling to give her views
                    on legal issues and this did not facilitate the work processes.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     On another occasion, the plaintiff was
                    requested for her clearance of the title deeds of two strips of land for their
                    acquisition. According to the title deeds, the land was held by one Johnson and
                    Bruce as trustees for the church owners who were the General Conference
                    Corporation of the 7th Day Adventists. Solicitors for the church confirmed that
                    Johnson and Bruce were trustees for the church. The plaintiff however was
                    dissatisfied and requested that confirmation be obtained from Johnson and Bruce
                    themselves. Tay telephoned the plaintiff to try to discuss the matter but the
                    plaintiff refused. Tay recorded this incident in an internal note dated 27
                    January 2000 to the Deputy Director of Human Resources.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> This note was
                    adduced before the court and read:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Pls see attached....Legal Officer did not give and get the correct advice.
                        I had to check up the info [with] SLR. When I asked her whether she wanted
                        to reconsider her opinion, she said “no” and banged down the
                            phone....<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Tay was particularly frustrated with the
                    plaintiff’s tendency of using pencils to mark her approvals on documents,
                    despite Tay having informed the plaintiff that as a legal officer clearing the
                    titles which involved significant sums of monies being paid out as compensation,
                    it was only proper for the recording of her legal input and clearances be done
                    by pen.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Tay testified that she felt that the plaintiff
                    was a source of delay and frustration to the officers in her division as the
                    plaintiff could not facilitate the work and did not give substantive legal input
                    expected of her.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span>
                    Finally, on the basis that her staff did not wish to go through the plaintiff,
                    she successfully requested for her division to direct legal queries to the
                        AGC.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     On 25 September 1998, the then Commissioner of
                    Lands, Ng Ooi Hooi (“Ng”) wrote to Tay informing her that the
                    plaintiff had put in an application for transfer. Ng (DW9) asked Tay for her
                    honest views on the transfer.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> Tay’s reply indicated her
                    dissatisfaction with the plaintiff’s work and that she would not want the
                    plaintiff to be transferred to her division. The email reply to Ng that was
                    adduced in court stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Linda Lai joined the department when we were in the thick of the NEL. She
                        had to clear title deeds. Also, there were a number of legal issues to be
                        sorted out. However she did not help me very much because she used to
                        indicate OK in pencil in the files and my officers were paying out millions
                        of dollars so I insisted she had to write in ink and indicate her
                        designation. Also when I asked her to help draft some legal documents, she
                        asked me to do them. I had to get my own contacts in ROTD to help me. I also
                        had to draft letters for her to send to AG but there was no value added from
                        her.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Finally [Liew] called Linda, Siok Hoon and myself for a discussion to sort
                        matters out. At the meeting she said that she had no problems working with

                        managed to get [Liew’s] agreement that Q Division can refer matters to
                        AG directly without going through her on the basis that the state counsel is
                        the one who represents us in court. After this, my staff and I have very
                        little dealings with her.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I do not think she will fit into Q Division. My staff generally do [sic]
                        not get on well with her.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Tay’s evidence was not challenged by the
                    plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The evidence of Cheng Su Cheng</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Cheng Su Cheng (Cheng) was at the material
                    time the Director of the State Lands Division in the LO. Cheng (DW3) also gave
                    evidence of her unpleasant working encounters with the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Sometime in August 1997, Cheng’s
                    division was examining some proposed amendments to the State Lands Encroachments
                    Act. One such proposed amendment was to increase the fine for unlawful entry
                    onto state land from $5,000 to $50,000. As there was a concern that the $50,000
                    fine was excessive, Cheng asked the plaintiff via email to make a comparison
                    with the penalties imposed for other regulatory offences. In her email, Cheng
                    highlighted several pieces of legislations such as the Environmental Health Act,
                    Public Utilities Act, Town Council Act etc for the plaintiff to take into
                    consideration. However, the plaintiff did not provide Cheng with the legal
                    advice requested and Cheng had to repeat her request via email. Three days
                    later, the plaintiff replied stating:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Please examine the Acts mentioned in your email &amp; see whether you
                        would like to incorporate other matters to strengthen your operations, not
                        only increasing the fines. After you have discussed with your officers, we
                        can have a meeting to finalise the amendments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The plaintiff’s reply completely evaded the real issue she had
                    to address.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Notwithstanding that the plaintiff seemed
                    unwilling and/or unable to do what was required of her, the plaintiff
                    subsequently accused Cheng of not contributing and of being “unduly
                    sensitive”:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If you do not wish to contribute, it is fine with me. I was only trying to
                        help you to strengthen your operations. I personally feel that you are
                        unduly sensitive.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     On 25 September 1998, Ng also wrote to Cheng
                    informing her that the plaintiff had put in an application for transfer.
                    Cheng’s response below was similar to Tay’s in [52]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I do not have a pleasant working relationship with her. Her attitude
                        towards work is very bad.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Last year, I have email war with her, where she refused to check the
                        penalty imposed in other Acts in terms of infringement. She simply refused
                        to check even at that point of time she was our legal officer.

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Like Tay, Cheng did not want the plaintiff in
                    her division. Cheng’s evidence was similarly not challenged by the
                    plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The evidence of Liew</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     As mentioned at <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a>, Liew was at the material time the Deputy Commissioner of
                    Lands. Liew interviewed the plaintiff for the position at the LO. He stated that
                    he was very impressed with the plaintiff’s academic qualifications and her
                    performance during the interview. When the plaintiff was employed by the LO,
                    Liew was tasked to be the plaintiff’s “mentor” on an
                    informal basis during her probationary period.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     According to Liew, the plaintiff’s
                    primary role as Head (Legal) was to provide basic legal advice to the various
                    departments in the LO to support the operations of the division. There was also
                    the intention for the various departments within the LO to route their requests
                    for legal advice to the AGC through the plaintiff so that the requests could be
                    better crafted.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     Liew testified that the general feedback on
                    the plaintiff’s work was negative – she took a long time to review
                    files and matters such as letters requesting advice from the AGC and she seemed
                    unable to understand and analyse the issues in depth so as to give meaningful
                    input. In addition, the plaintiff would raise unnecessary questions with the
                    officers and was viewed as a “bottleneck” impeding the work of the
                    LO. Consequently as Liew understood it, the officers in the LO chose to send
                    their legal queries directly to the AGC bypassing the plaintiff
                        altogether.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     As for her superficial input on the NEL
                    compensation matter (as highlighted by Tay and set out in <a href="#p1_47">[47]</a> to <a href="#p1_48">[48]</a>
                    above), Liew had to direct the plaintiff to give her legal input and remind her
                    of the proper way she should be approaching her work.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> A copy of the relevant
                    correspondence with Liew’s written comments dated 7 April 1997 was adduced
                    in court. It stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Head (Legal), I don’t think this is the way to conduct our business.
                        If you disagree with the interpretation (of a statutory provision), you
                        might wish to explain. See me to discuss, please.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     Apart from the comments in the above note,
                    Liew stated that he had verbally informed the plaintiff on several occasions of
                    the need for her to show improvement in her performance and work
                        relationships.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Given that a substantial portion of her work
                    was then being relieved as the officers would address their legal queries
                    directly to the AGC, the plaintiff was transferred to the Lease Administration
                    Section of the Alienation Division where her main job scope was to undertake the
                    operational work but with some limited legal work. She was then to report to
                    Leong, who was at that time the Director (A2) of the Alienation Division in her
                        capacity.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span> According to Liew, the intention was to give
                    the plaintiff another opportunity to prove herself in a different area of
                        work.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     As the plaintiff’s performance in the
                    Lease Administration Section continued to be poor, she was re-designated to be
                    the Head of the Remnant Land Section within the Alienation Division but still
                    reporting to Leong. According to Liew, as Head of the Remnant Land Section, the
                    plaintiff’s job would be less complex than that of Lease Administration
                    and the move was, yet again, to provide the plaintiff with another opportunity
                    to prove that she was suitable for confirmation, albeit in another
                        role.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     Throughout the re-deployments, the plaintiff
                    continued to retain the title of Head (Legal) because, as explained by Liew, she
                    was still supposed to carry out limited legal work of reviewing three pieces of
                    land legislation.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Sometime around 16 March 1998, Gaw (DW8)
                    joined the LO and was deployed to fill the then vacant post of Director (A1),
                    Alienation Division. With the appointment of Gaw, the plaintiff was to report to
                    Gaw directly.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span> This was reflected in the organisation chart of
                    the LO.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     However, the plaintiff did not accept that Gaw
                    was her supervising officer and claimed that she still reported to Liew. The
                    plaintiff also made several complaints about Gaw to Liew. For example, the
                    plaintiff sent an email on 6 April 1998 to Liew complaining how Gaw had
                    commented that she had gone home early while the rest of the LO officers had to
                    stay back in the office. The plaintiff then went on to make the following remark
                    at the end of her email:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I am not a hypocrite who while away time during office hours &amp;
                        purposely stay back late, to give the impression to the bosses that ...one
                        is extremely hardworking.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Liew testified that the remarks were “caustic and abrasive and
                    were typical of remarks made by the plaintiff”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Liew’s evidence also debunked the
                    plaintiff’s claim that she could not have been doing poorly at work as she
                    was given a room as her office. Liew stated that as far as he could recall, the
                    Commissioner of Land was the only officer in the LO who was allocated a room as
                    an office. However, for a short period of time, the plaintiff did use a closed
                    cubicle as an office as there was a shortage of cubicles. The closed cubicle was
                    originally used as an interview room. The arrangement was temporary and the
                    plaintiff moved out later to a normal, open-concept cubicle.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span> The plaintiff’s
                    usage of the room was therefore not an indication that she was performing well
                    at work.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The evidence of Gaw Seng Suan and Leong Foke Meng</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     As mentioned at <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a>, both Gaw and Leong were directors of the Alienation
                    Division at the material time. In the period of time where the plaintiff was
                    working under the Alienation Division, she was to report to Leong and
                    subsequently to Gaw.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     Both Leong and Gaw gave evidence that in their
                    capacity as supervisors of the plaintiff, they felt that the plaintiff often
                    relied completely on her subordinates to do the work and had no sense of urgency
                    regarding her own work. They made reference to specific incidents to support
                    their views.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     One such incident was that of the
                    “Nanyang Polytechnic Case” raised by Leong. He stated that in and
                    around July 1997, the plaintiff’s unit was supposed to put up a paper
                    regarding the viability of a request from Nanyang Polytechnic (the details of
                    the request are irrelevant and will not be set out). The plaintiff merely
                    initialled the submission, completely relying on a paper put up by her
                    subordinates without giving any of her own input. Leong subsequently highlighted
                    to the plaintiff several points worthy of consideration in the report and
                    requested the plaintiff to comment. The plaintiff did not respond.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     Subsequently, there was a further development
                    on the matter and the plaintiff’s subordinates put up another lengthy
                    submission. Once again, the plaintiff simply initialled on the submission and
                    chose not to provide any input. Frustrated, Leong pressed the plaintiff for her
                    views. Finally, the plaintiff gave a short comment which was in Leong’s
                    view, superficial. The plaintiff’s response to Leong dated 19 August 1997
                    concluded:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In view of your years of experience, what would you recommend?<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">The above remark was telling of the plaintiff’s poor performance
                    as a legal officer. Leong deposed in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief (para
                    16) that he did not bother to continue his exchange with her and proceeded to
                    make his own decision on the case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     Another incident highlighted by Gaw was that
                    which took place in early May 1998. The plaintiff was requested to follow up on
                    two cases under her charge on an urgent basis. The plaintiff ignored the various
                    emails on the issue and finally, another colleague, one Madam See, had to go
                    through the files herself to give the necessary response. Some days later, there
                    was a follow up query on the same matter and the plaintiff sent an email to
                    Madam See to ask if the latter had given the details of the two cases in
                    question. Madam See replied in an email copied to Gaw stating that her unit had
                    already provided details of the two cases which were within the
                    plaintiff’s purview. The plaintiff’s response to Madam See dated 15
                    May 1998 and copied to Gaw was as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Please do not be a hypocrite. Raj emailed all the details to me &amp; cc
                        to you.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">The plaintiff thereby implied that Madam See had not looked through
                    the files as she said she did. Gaw expressed shock at the plaintiff’s
                        remark.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The evidence of Low</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     As mentioned at <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a>, Low (DW7) was the Commissioner of Lands at the material
                    time. Low’s evidence in brief, stated that the plaintiff was performing
                    poorly. Low highlighted a few incidents as illustrations. One was the incident
                    involving Madam See highlighted by Gaw in <a href="#p1_74">[74]</a> above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     Regarding that incident, Low testified that
                    the plaintiff emailed him on 12 May 1998 to complain that Gaw had treated her
                    unfairly. Among other things, the plaintiff wrote in her email:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Gaw] supported [Mdm See], maybe because she professes to be a Christian,
                        like him.</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Gaw] cannot survive in the private sector, therefore he comes back [to
                        the public sector] &amp; throws his weight around, which he cannot do in the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     Low said he was very shocked by the
                    plaintiff’s remarks which were completely inappropriate and uncalled for
                    especially when it seemed to him that Gaw and Madam See were only trying to get
                    the plaintiff to do her job. He then asked the plaintiff not to pass such
                    unnecessary and insensitive remarks in the future.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_53" id="Ftn_53_1"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span> This was acknowledged by
                    the plaintiff in her reply email to him dated 16 May 1998 where she
                        said<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_54" id="Ftn_54_1"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I have noted your comments &amp; and will not pass such remarks in the
                        future.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">However she then went on in the email to complain about Madam See
                    being the cause of the problem, that it was Raj who did the work and Madam See
                    was trying to claim credit for it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The findings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     The above incidents were by no means
                    exhaustive of the negative image portrayed by the defendant’s witnesses of
                    the plaintiff which the plaintiff did not challenge in cross-examination. I find
                    that the defendant had indeed made out its case that the plaintiff’s work
                    performance was not up to expectations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     I should add that the other witnesses Ng Ooi
                    Hooi (who was the Commissioner of Lands from 1 July 1998, after Low) and P
                    Ramanathan (who was the Deputy Director of the Human Resource Department at
                    Minlaw at the material time) shared the common view of Tay, Cheng, Liew, Gaw,
                    Leong and Low that the plaintiff demonstrated poor performance in her work and
                    that she sorely lacked emotional quotient in her interaction with colleagues at
                    the LO. Their evidence was also not challenged by the plaintiff in
                    cross-examination.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     The above events occurred before the
                    plaintiff’s May 1998 email to Liew regarding the backlog of the Alienation
                    Division. There was therefore no basis for the plaintiff to say that the
                    defendant had orchestrated events to justify her dismissal, because she had been
                    a whistleblower. Moreover, I note that the defendant’s claim that the
                    plaintiff performed poorly at work was corroborated by the evidence of Cheng and
                    Tay who were not officers from the Alienation Division, viz, they were not
                    affected by the alleged “whistleblowing” of the
                plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     From Liew’s evidence, it was clear the
                    LO had given the plaintiff amble opportunities to improve her performance and
                    working relationship with colleagues by redefining her work scope and notifying
                    her of her shortcomings. Unfortunately, the plaintiff’s work performance
                    and working attitude did not improve.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     The evidence showed that the plaintiff could
                    not discharge her duties in a competent fashion ? she was
                    often unable to come up with her own views and ignored requests that matters
                    needed to be attended to with urgency. Her habitually abrasive and
                    confrontational remarks were unnecessary, provocative and affected her ability
                    to work as a team. Indeed, I find the plaintiff’s lack of interpersonal
                    skills appalling in someone with her educational background. In summary, her
                    working attitude left much to be desired. On those grounds alone, the defendant
                    was fully entitled to dismiss her under the employment contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     I do not say that the plaintiff made no
                    contribution to the LO when she was with the LO. Indeed, I accept her evidence
                    that some of her recommendations were accepted by the LO, such as her
                    recommendation to change the format of the LO offer for the alienation of State
                        Land.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_55" id="Ftn_55_1"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span> However, notwithstanding her contributions,
                    it was clear that she also had serious shortcomings which needed to be rectified
                    in order for her to be confirmed. Judging from the email correspondences adduced
                    in court, the plaintiff must have been aware that there was dissatisfaction with
                    both her work and attitude.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Staff Appraisal Reports (“SARs”)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     The defendant produced the plaintiff’s
                    appraisal reports to the court. As shown, the plaintiff had received a
                    “C” grading for her first appraisal report and an
                    “E” grading for her second and third appraisal reports. All
                    reports had details on why the respective grade was recommended and subsequently
                    given.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     The plaintiff’s three SARs were prepared
                    by the plaintiff’s supervising officers at the material time. The SAR for
                    the assessment of the first six months of the plaintiff’s service (28
                    November 1996 to 27 May 1997) was prepared by Liew and the SAR for the
                    assessment of the next six months of the plaintiff’s service (28 May 1997
                    to 27 November 1997) was prepared Leong. The first two SARs were prepared
                    sometime between September and November 1997. The third SAR for the assessment
                    of the next one year of the plaintiff’s service (28 November 1997 to 27
                    November 1998) was prepared by Gaw sometime in or around November
                1998.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     The plaintiff claimed that sometime in
                    November or December 1997, the plaintiff asked Liew about her appraisal and he
                    replied that he had requested Leong to appraise her and that the latter had
                    given her a “generous” appraisal.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_56" id="Ftn_56_1"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span> When she realised that her
                    appraisal was really an adverse one:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It then dawned on her that her generous appraisal was subsequently
                        replaced by an adverse one, to justify the recommended termination. That was
                        the only reasonable explanation how a generous appraisal could subsequently
                        become an adverse one...<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_57" id="Ftn_57_1"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">The plaintiff subsequently claimed that it was the second SAR which
                    Leong prepared which had been replaced.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_58" id="Ftn_58_1"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     I do not agree with the plaintiff that the
                    replacement of the SAR must be the only “reasonable” explanation.
                    Liew’s explanation was that the plaintiff had been mistaken. He had
                    informed the plaintiff at her first appraisal interview sometime between
                    September and November 1997 that the LO had been generous in giving her a
                    “C” grade in her SAR. Judged on the plaintiff’s performance,
                    she should have merited a “D” grade but he gave her a
                    “C” as he considered that the plaintiff was still new to the LO.
                    He had also told her about her shortcomings and asked her to
                        improve.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_59" id="Ftn_59_1"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span> The plaintiff however took the word
                    “generous” to mean that it must refer to a good report. Despite
                    Liew’s explanation, the plaintiff still insisted that she must have been
                    given a “generous report” in the sense that she had received a
                    good report.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_60" id="Ftn_60_1"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     The plaintiff adduced no evidence to support
                    her serious allegation that the second SAR had been replaced. She did not deny
                    that the first and second SARs contained her signature; the plaintiff was unable
                    to explain why an allegedly falsified SAR could have her signature. The third
                    SAR did not have her signature only because she had refused to sign on
                    it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     I note that Leong’s “E”
                    grading for the plaintiff’s second SAR took place in September 1997. This
                    is significant as it highlighted that the plaintiff was not performing
                    satisfactorily long before her alleged whistle-blowing email of May
                1998.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     On the evidence adduced in court, I find the
                    plaintiff’s allegation regarding the replacement of the second SAR
                    unfounded, speculative and without merit.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The backlog</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     Some comment must be made on the
                    plaintiff’s allegation that the LO had terminated her because of the May
                    1998 email.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     Both Low and Liew testified that even prior to
                    that email, they had been apprised by Gaw and Leong regarding the backlog issue.
                    In fact, both of them were already following up on the situation.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_61" id="Ftn_61_1"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     The plaintiff had therefore not raised any
                    issue or information which would classify as “whistle-blowing”. It
                    follows that there was no reason why the LO would terminate her due to the May
                    1998 email.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     The significance of this episode however, goes
                    to demonstrate the kind of working attitude the plaintiff possessed. Low gave
                    evidence that he was alarmed that the plaintiff would insinuate that Gaw and
                    Leong would try to hide the backlog of cases, and how the plaintiff would cast
                    aspersions on her superiors without basis. Low felt that the incident
                    demonstrated, once again, the plaintiff’s inability to work with her
                    colleagues or her supervising officers in a collegiate environment. Low viewed
                    the matter very seriously and hence on 1 June 1998, informed the plaintiff
                    orally, in the presence of Liew, that he would not recommend her confirmation in
                    view of her shortcomings in both her working attitude and
                        performance.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_62" id="Ftn_62_1"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     For the above reasons, I find that the
                    plaintiff had not been wrongfully terminated. Although the defendant had
                    admittedly breached paras 20 and 66 of the Government IM Section 2B, the
                    plaintiff had not proven that she suffered any loss or damage by reason of those
                    breaches. Ultimately, the plaintiff was terminated in accordance with the
                    employment contract, with the proper notice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     I should point out that even if she had
                    succeeded in her claim, the plaintiff could not be reinstated to her post in the
                    LO due to s 27(1)(a) of the Government Proceedings Act (Cap 121, 1985 Rev Ed)
                    which states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In any civil proceedings by or against the Government the court shall,
                        subject to the provisions of this Act, have power to make all such orders as
                        it has power to make in proceedings between private persons, and otherwise
                        to give such appropriate relief as the case may require:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Provided that —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    where in any proceedings against the Government
                            any such relief is sought as might in proceedings between private
                            persons be granted by way of injunction or specific performance, the
                            court shall not grant an injunction or make an order for specific
                            performance, but may in lieu thereof make an order declaratory of the
                            rights of the parties..</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Even at common law, an employee’s remedy for wrongful
                    dismissal lies in damages and there can be no specific performance of a contract
                    of service. The remedy of specific performance was not available to the
                    plaintiff as this court informed her at the trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     Even if the plaintiff had been wrongfully
                    dismissed, as was pointed out in the defendant’s closing submissions, the
                    plaintiff had failed to mitigate her loss as required by law. Earlier (at
                        <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a>), I had alluded to the fact that
                    the plaintiff has not been gainfully employed since 21 December 1998. Her
                    failure to find alternative employment to minimise her loss (of earnings) was
                    inexcusable. She is well qualified with both a bachelor’s and
                    master’s degree in law. Prior to her stint with the LO, the plaintiff had
                        <em>inter alia</em> worked as a legal officer for the
                    Malaysian government, in a Malaysian bank, with Credit POSB Pte Ltd and with a
                    Singapore developer. There was no reason why the plaintiff could not work while
                    pursuing her claim for wrongful dismissal against the government.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     The plaintiff’s claim is therefore
                    dismissed in its entirety with costs to the defendant to be taxed unless
                    otherwise agreed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     Notwithstanding that it considered the
                    plaintiff’s claim to have no merits, the defendant reiterated (in its
                    Supplemental Opening Statement) that it stood by its open offer first made on 19
                    March 2009, to pay the plaintiff six months’ salary amounting to $28,620.
                    Further, the defendant undertook to maintain its open offer for another two
                    months from the date of dismissal of the plaintiff’s claim, should that be
                    the case. I strongly urge the plaintiff to accept the defendant’s offer in
                    order to bring closure to this prolonged and unfortunate episode and to move on
                    with her life</p>
