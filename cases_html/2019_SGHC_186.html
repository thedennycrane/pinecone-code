The District Judge found the complainant’s evidence to be simple and truthful and corroborated by the evidence of SC Sgt Muhammad Muneer (“Sgt Muneer”), one of the responding officers. The appellant’s account that he mistakenly used vulgarities because he believed himself to be in his friend’s car instead was not credible, given that he stated in his long statement that he knew he had been in a taxi (GD at [26]–[32]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 The District Judge also believed Yussaini’s testimony to the effect that he had witnessed the appellant slapping the complainant. He determined that Yussaini was an independent witness with no motive to falsely implicate the appellant (GD at [43]). The District Judge found, however, that the appellant gave three versions of the alleged assault that were internally inconsistent, and that his credit was impeached (GD at [44]–[55], [58]–[60]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 The District Judge next found that the complainant’s account of the assault was corroborated by the medical evidence, which established that he was diagnosed with a “contusion of face” and “tenderness” over his left cheek (GD at [65]–[70]). He dismissed the Defence’s submissions that the inconsistencies in the complainant’s oral testimony (relating to the number of calls he made to the police and what he said during those calls) undermined his credibility, as the inconsistencies raised were not material (GD at [72]–[77]). The non-availability of recordings from the in-car camera of the complainant’s taxi was also not material, as there was insufficient proof that the evidence had been suppressed or that such evidence would contain relevant footage (GD at [78]–[81]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 The District Judge concluded that the Prosecution had proven its case against the appellant beyond a reasonable doubt, and convicted the appellant (GD at [82]). Balancing the relatively minor nature of the complainant’s injury against the aggravating factors that the appellant had been intoxicated and had been the source of the disagreement between himself and the complainant, the District Judge applied <span class="font-italic">Wong Hoi Len v Public Prosecutor </span>[2009] 1 SLR(R) 115 (“<span class="font-italic">Wong Hoi Len</span>”), which established at [20] a four-week sentencing benchmark for a simple assault against a public transport worker.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 Having considered parties’ submissions, I agreed with the Prosecution to the extent that the evidence from the scene reconstruction was not of a level of reliability that satisfied the requirement set out in <span class="font-italic">Ladd v Marshall </span>[1954] 1 WLR 1489 (affirmed in <span class="font-italic">Soh Meiyun v Public Prosecut</span><span class="font-italic">or </span>[2014] 3 SLR 299 at [14]) that the evidence to be adduced must be such as is presumably to be believed, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, apparently credible, although it need not be incontrovertible. The scene reconstruction involved opinion evidence about the angle or line of sight that Yussaini had: whether or not Yussaini could hypothetically have seen the offence take place would have been a point of “scientific, technical or other specialised knowledge” which would have required expert evidence on the basis of such specialised knowledge, using the language of ss 47(1) and 47(2) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed). The evidence to be adduced did not involve any such expert opinion. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 Furthermore, the strength and putative weight of the evidence in the form of the scene reconstruction would have been little, given that there was no clear evidence about exactly where Yussaini actually stood. While, from the record, one interpretation would be that he stood right next to his Fiat (see Exhibit A reproduced below at [24]), it was also possible, and perhaps probable, that he meant that he was not immediately next to the Fiat. But I allowed the evidence as to the height of Yussaini’s Fiat to be adduced, and proceeded to hear the parties’ submissions on the appeal on that basis.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The parties’ cases  </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The appellant’s case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 The appellant argued that the conviction should be overturned on the following bases:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, Yussaini’s evidence was at real risk of contamination as he conversed with the complainant immediately after the slap allegedly occurred. In the alternative, his evidence was not materially relevant as he would not have been able to see the slap take place as the Fiat would have blocked his view of the alleged offence.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, no other evidence corroborated the complainant’s account. The medical report was based on the complainant’s self-reporting. The evidence allegedly from Sgt Muneer was wrongly admitted as hearsay evidence.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, due to the lack of corroborative evidence, the complainant’s testimony had to be “unusually convincing”: see <span class="font-italic">XP v Public Prosecutor </span>[2008] 4 SLR(R) 686 at [27]–[34]. This was not the case, given the internal and external inconsistencies in his testimony and his failure to produce relevant in-car camera footage. His embellishment of evidence also displayed his motive to incriminate the appellant.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Fourth, the District Judge erred in finding that the appellant’s evidence was inconsistent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 The appellant also submitted that the District Judge had excessively interfered with the proceedings and had prejudged the case: <span class="font-italic">BOI v BOJ </span>[2018] 2 SLR 1156 (“<span class="font-italic">BOI</span>”) at [107]–[113]. The District Judge had excessively interrupted the Defence counsel’s cross-examination of Yussaini and the complainant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 In the alternative, the appellant submitted that the sentence was manifestly excessive. The District Judge should have departed from the <span class="font-italic">Wong Hoi Len </span>sentencing benchmark given the appellant’s lack of antecedents, good character and cooperation with the authorities; the appellant had also not provoked the complainant, and the offence consisted of a single slap. A fine or a short detention order was more appropriate in the circumstances. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Prosecution’s case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 The Prosecution responded that the District Judge’s findings were supported by the evidence:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The appellant’s failure to produce the in-car camera footage and the inconsistencies pertaining to his calls to the police were not material to the question of whether the slap had occurred. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Yussaini’s evidence was credible notwithstanding the fresh evidence relating to the height of his Fiat. His evidence at trial was that he had witnessed the slap from an angle over the complainant’s taxi, and the height of the Fiat did not affect the credibility of this account.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The fact that the medical evidence was based on the complainant’s self-reporting did not undermine the complainant’s evidence. His self-reporting was itself corroborative: <span class="font-italic">Haliffie bin Mamat v P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor </span>[2016] 5 SLR 636 (“<span class="font-italic">Haliffie</span>”) at [30] and [66]. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The appellant’s credibility had been rightly impeached. He had failed to explain why he claimed at trial that he accidentally knocked the complainant’s face, when he had earlier admitted in his police statement to having “push[ed]” the complainant’s cheek in self-defence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 As regards the allegation of excessive judicial interference, the Prosecution submitted that the District Judge had confined himself to intervening only to clarify certain matters.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Finally, the Prosecution submitted that the appeal against sentence should be dismissed as no mitigating factors warranted a downward adjustment of the indicative starting sentence set out in <span class="font-italic">Wong Hoi Len</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The threshold for appellate intervention</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Appellate intervention is called for only in limited circumstances. The appellate court is not to reassess the evidence as the trial judge would, but is restricted to considering: (a) whether the judge’s assessment of witness credibility is plainly wrong or against the weight of evidence; (b) whether the judge’s verdict is wrong in law and therefore unreasonable; and (c) whether the judge’s decision is inconsistent with the material objective evidence on record, bearing in mind that an appellate court is in as good a position to assess the internal and external consistency of the witnesses’ evidence, and to draw the necessary inferences of fact from the circumstances of the case (<span class="font-italic">Pram Nair v Public Prosecutor </span>[2017] 2 SLR 1015 at [55]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 As for appeals against sentence, an appellate court will be slow to disturb a sentence imposed except where it is satisfied that: (a) the trial judge erred with respect to the proper factual basis for sentencing; (b) the trial judge failed to appreciate the materials placed before the court; (c) the sentence was wrong in principle; or (d) the sentence was manifestly excessive or manifestly inadequate: <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v UI </span>[2008] 4 SLR(R) 500 at [12].   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">My decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 In my judgment, the appellant’s conviction under s 323 of the Penal Code should be upheld. I was satisfied that the District Judge’s conclusions were supported by the evidence on record. As there are no exceptional facts warranting departure from the benchmark sentence of four weeks’ imprisonment established in <span class="font-italic">Wong Hoi Len</span>, I also uphold the District Judge’s decision on sentence.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Appeal against conviction</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The effect of the fresh evidence on Yussaini’s credibility and evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 The appellant submitted that Yussaini could not possibly have seen the slap take place as his Fiat would have blocked his line of sight.

I also do not place much weight on the fact that Yussaini occasionally referred to his Fiat as a “car”. As seen from his testimony in its full context, he used the word “car” to refer to the complainant’s taxi and his own Fiat without distinction. While this was not the most precise usage, it is clear to me that his evidence was not that he viewed the slap from looking over and above his Fiat. Rather, he implied that he viewed the incident from an angle and from above the taxi:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[T]he taxi is not beyond my height.

</div> The appellant’s argument assumes without clear basis that Yussaini’s only vantage point of the slap was from above the Fiat, and does not account for the possible positioning of the parties that would have allowed Yussaini to witness the slap from above the taxi instead. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 In the alternative, the appellant argued that Yussaini’s evidence could have been contaminated: his memory of the event might have been “the subject of a transfer of recollection from the Complainant’s version of events” or he might have been motivated by a desire to help the complainant, whom he perceived to be the victim.

The High Court held that the court should remain sensitive to the possibility of contamination, and the veracity of the evidence and the strength of recollection of the witness must be subject to scrutiny. However, this does not require the Prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt that there was no risk of contamination (at [95]–[97]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Here, the likelihood that Yussaini’s recollection of the slap was transferred from the complainant’s is minimal. While the appellant correctly noted that Yussaini and the complainant spoke before the police arrived, the conversation between them lasted at most ten minutes, according to Yussaini.

</div> Both characterisations incriminated the appellant and would have made out the charge, namely, that the appellant had voluntarily caused hurt to the complainant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 In the circumstances, it was incriminating that the appellant acknowledged in Exhibit P4 that he had “used his right hand to push [or bump or knock the complainant’s] cheek away”. His account in Exhibit P4 implied that he acted intentionally “to fend [the complainant] off”, albeit because he was concerned that the complainant was “moving closer and closer … too close to [him]”. This account is inconsistent with his oral testimony that the contact made with the complainant’s cheek was unintentional and accidental. The District Judge was also entitled to draw an adverse inference against him (GD at [49]) for his failure to mention the exculpatory facts that it was the complainant was the physical aggressor at the time, and that the contact between them was merely accidental: see <span class="font-italic">Kwek Seow Hock v </span><span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor </span>[2011] 3 SLR 157 at [19].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 That said, some parts of Exhibit P4 were inconsistent with the appellant’s testimony, and it was on this basis that the District Judge found his credit to be impeached (see above at [40(b)]). The material inconsistencies that affected his credibility pertained to (a) whether he uttered vulgarities during the taxi journey; (b) the manner in which he contacted the complainant’s face; (c) whether he could recall that police officers brought him home; and (d) whether he asserted during the recording of the statement that the incident was a “misunderstanding” (see GD at [56]–[57]). Regardless, these discrepancies did not raise a reasonable doubt as to the reliability of the inculpatory portions of Exhibit P4 that made out the charge, especially when considered alongside the evidence as a whole.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Other aspects of the appellant’s case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 I now consider the remaining arguments raised by the appellant.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The District Judge’s reliance on hearsay evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 The appellant argued that the District Judge was wrong to have relied on hearsay evidence: at [27] of the GD, the District Judge held that Sgt Zamil’s evidence of what Sgt Muneer said corroborated the complainant’s account that the appellant had opened his taxi door in the middle of the taxi journey.
