<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This application to strike out an admiralty suit
                    raised a number of issues relating to the invocation of the admiralty
                    jurisdiction of the High Court, including the applicable standard of proof under
                    s 4(4) of the High Court (Admiralty Jurisdiction) Act (Cap 123,
                    2001 Rev Ed) and whether there is a threshold test of merits at the
                    jurisdictional stage. It entailed a consideration of some recent decisions by
                    our courts in this area, in particular the Court of Appeal decision in <em>The “Vasiliy Golovnin”</em> [2008]
                    4 SLR(R) 994 and the recent High Court case of <em>The
                        Eagle Prestige</em> [2010] SGHC 93. As there were
                    proceedings in the United States between the same parties preceding the present
                    suit, cross-jurisdictional questions also arose, namely how the well-known
                    “one claim, one ship” rule should apply when foreign proceedings
                    are involved, and when a foreign court ruling is to be considered final and
                    conclusive for the purpose of raising an issue estoppel. The way the substantive
                    claim was pleaded by the plaintiff further brought into play issues of agency
                    and the law on unjust enrichment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       I granted the defendant’s application, and
                    struck out the admiralty writ and statement of claim. The plaintiff has since
                    appealed against my decision. The defendant has also filed a cross-appeal
                    against my refusal to declare that the plaintiff is not entitled to invoke the
                    admiralty jurisdiction of the court by reason of the operation of the
                    “one claim, one ship” rule. The reasons for my decision are set
                    out below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The plaintiff, Equatorial Marine Fuel Management
                    Services Pte Ltd, brought the present action against the defendant, MISC Berhad,
                    to recover payments for bunkers supplied to the defendant’s vessels. The
                    admiralty writ was served on one of the defendant’s ship, the <em>“</em>Bunga Melati 5”, but the vessel was not
                    arrested. The “Bunga Melati 5” was not one of the vessels which
                    received the bunkers in question, and hence this is a “sister ship
                    action” under s 4(4) of the High Court (Admiralty Jurisdiction) Act
                    (Cap 123, 2001 Rev Ed) (“the Act”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       In the plaintiff’s statement of claim, it
                    was alleged that the parties had entered into two fixed price contracts whereby
                    the plaintiff agreed to supply bunkers for the months of August and September
                    2008, at a price of US$744 per metric ton and US$750 per metric ton
                    respectively, to vessels owned or operated by the defendant (“the Fixed
                    Price contracts”). In addition, the plaintiff had allegedly entered into
                    a further contract with the defendant on a “spot” basis for the
                    supply of bunkers to the defendant’s vessel the MT “Navig8
                    Faith” (“the Navig8 Faith contract”). An entity known as
                    Compass Marine Fuels Ltd (“Compass Marine”) was the broker acting
                    for the plaintiff for the Fixed Price contracts, while another entity
                    OceanConnect UK Ltd (“OceanConnect”) was its broker for the Navig8
                    Faith contract. According to the plaintiff, a Malaysian company, Market Asia
                    Link Sdn Bhd (“MAL”), had acted as the buying agent or broker of
                    the defendant at all material times, and had procured bunkers on behalf and in
                    the name of the defendant. The contracts for the supply of the bunkers were
                    purportedly evidenced by emails sent by Compass Marine and OceanConnect to MAL,
                    as well as other documents such as bunker confirmations and contract price
                    confirmations which named the defendant as the contractual buyer for the
                    bunkers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The plaintiff further pleaded that the defendant
                    had represented to the plaintiff and its brokers that MAL was acting on its
                    behalf and had routinely directed third parties to deal with MAL as the
                    defendant’s agent. In the circumstances, the plaintiff contended that the
                    defendant was estopped from denying that MAL was its agent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       In the alternative to its contractual claim, the
                    plaintiff’s case was that if there were no valid and binding contracts for
                    the sale and supply of the bunkers between the parties, the defendant had been
                    unjustly enriched by the plaintiff’s action in supplying bunkers to the
                    defendant’s vessels. The plaintiff further contended that the offer of a
                    corporate guarantee by the defendant, in the context of earlier US court
                    proceedings in respect of the same dispute, amounted to an admission of
                    liability by the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Prior to the start of this action, the plaintiff
                    had commenced another set of proceedings in the United States District Court for
                    the Central District of California, based on essentially the same claims as in
                    the present proceedings. The plaintiff filed what is known as a “Verified
                    Complaint” to obtain an attachment order under Rule B of the
                    “Supplemental Rules for Certain Admiralty and Maritime Claims and Asset
                    Forfeiture Actions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for the US District
                    Courts”. The Rule B attachment order was executed against one of the
                    defendant’s vessel, the “Bunga Kasturi Lima” in the port of
                    Long Beach, California.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Shortly after the attachment of the vessel in
                    the US, the defendant offered the plaintiff a corporate guarantee that the
                    defendant would pay to the plaintiff the sum of US$22.4 million (which is
                    equivalent to the plaintiff’s claim amount in the US proceedings), on
                    condition that the plaintiff would withdraw all suits against the defendant and
                    not commence any further actions against the defendant’s vessels. The
                    plaintiff refused to accept the offer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The defendant then filed a motion to vacate the
                    Rule B attachment order, and to dismiss the Verified Complaint for failure to
                    state a claim (which is akin to a striking out application). The California
                    District Court vacated the Rule B order, on the basis that the plaintiff had
                    failed to establish a valid <em>prima facie</em> case
                    against the defendant for breach of contract or unjust enrichment. The plaintiff
                    filed an appeal, which was dismissed by the United States Court of Appeals for
                    the Ninth Circuit. The motion to dismiss the Verified Complaint was however not
                    considered, and was scheduled for further hearing. That did not take place
                    eventually, because the plaintiff sought a voluntary dismissal of its
                    substantive action.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The defendant’s application</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The defendant denied that it had contracted
                    with the plaintiff, and averred that at all material times, it had procured the
                    sale and supply of bunkers for its vessels from MAL as its contractual sellers.
                    The defendant had made payment of the invoices issued by MAL, totalling more
                    than US$17 million, for the supplies which form the subject matter of the
                    plaintiff’s claims. The defendant also asserted that it had never
                    received, and had no knowledge at all of any of the emails or other
                    documentation which allegedly evidenced the contracts between the plaintiff and
                    defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     In the present application, the defendant
                    prayed for <em>inter alia</em> the following orders:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_c"></a>(c)     A declaration that the defendant is
                        not entitled to invoke the admiralty <em>in rem</em>
                        jurisdiction of the court against the defendant’s vessel the
                        “Bunga Melati 5” or any other vessel owned by the defendant in
                        relation to the plaintiff’s alleged claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Admiralty jurisdiction of the High Court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Section 4(4) of the Act states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the case of any such claim as is mentioned in section 3
                        (1) (<em>d</em>) to (<em>q</em>),
                        where —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(a) the claim arises in connection with a ship; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(b) the person who would be liable on the claim in an action <em>in personam</em> (referred to in this subsection as
                            the relevant person) was, when the cause of action arose, the owner or
                            charterer of, or in possession or in control of, the ship,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">an action <em>in rem</em> may (whether
                        or not the claim gives rise to a maritime lien on that ship) be brought in
                        the High Court against —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(i) that ship, if at the time when the action is brought the relevant
                            person is either the beneficial owner of that ship as respects all the
                            shares in it or the charterer of that ship under a charter by demise;
                            or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(ii) any other ship of which, at the time when the action is brought,
                            the relevant person is the beneficial owner as respects all the shares
                            in it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     It is well established, and was not in
                    dispute, that to invoke the High Court’s admiralty jurisdiction against a
                    sister ship, the following requirements must be satisfied:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_i"></a>(i)     the claim falls within one of the
                        limbs in s 3(1)(d) to (q) of the Act;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     the claim arises in connection with the
                        offending ship – s 4(4)(a);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_iii"></a>(iii)     the person who <em>would
                            be</em> liable on the claim in an action <em>in
                            personam</em> (“the relevant person”) was, when the
                        cause of action arose, the owner or charterer of, or in possession or in
                        control of, the ship – s 4(4)(b); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_iv"></a>(iv)     the relevant person is, at the time
                        the action is brought, the beneficial owner as respect all the shares in the
                        sister ship.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It was further common ground between parties
                    that the same principles apply whether the <em>in rem</em>
                    jurisdiction is established by an arrest of a vessel, or by service of the
                        <em>in rem</em> writ on a vessel: <em>The Fierbinti</em> [1994] 3 SLR(R) 574.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     To show that the cause of action falls within
                    one of the categories of s 3(1), the Court of Appeal in <em>The “Vasiliy Golovnin”</em> [2008]
                    4 SLR(R) 994 (“<em>The Vasiliy
                        Golovnin</em>”), adopting its earlier ruling in <em>The Jarguh Sawit</em> [1997] 3 SLR(R) 829, decided
                    that the burden on the plaintiff is one of showing a good arguable case. In
                    particular, the Court of Appeal (at [49]) endorsed the following description of
                    the state of Singapore law by Toh Kian Sing SC in <em>Admiralty
                        Law and Practice</em> (LexisNexis, 2nd ed., 2007) (“<em>Admiralty Law and Practice</em>”) at 46:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If the subject matter jurisdiction of the court is challenged, the
                        plaintiff under the law of Singapore only has to show that he has a good
                        arguable case that his claim comes within one of the limbs of section 3(1)
                        of the [HCAJA], as opposed to the more onerous test of a balance of
                        probabilities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     It should however be pointed out that the
                    footnote to the learned author’s commentary reproduced above goes on to
                    state the qualification that there are certain cases, such as <em>The Alexandrea</em> [2002] 1 SLR(R) 812 and <em>The Andres Bonifacio</em> [1991] 1 SLR(R) 523,
                    which held that the onus on the plaintiff is in fact to establish, on a balance
                    of probabilities, that one of the limbs of s 3(1) apply.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Indeed, there are very recent High Court
                    decisions which would appear to adopt a similar view that the threshold for
                    subject matter jurisdiction under s 3(1) is the more onerous one of a
                    balance of probabilities. In <em>The Eagle Prestige</em>
                    [2010] SGHC 93 (“<em>The Eagle
                        Prestige</em>”), although Belinda Ang J referred to the
                    Court of Appeal’s decision in <em>The Vasiliy
                        Golovnin</em> that the standard of proof in the context of s 3(1)
                    is the good arguable case yardstick, the learned judge however went on to make
                    the observation (at [49]) that “the proper standard of proof on
                    jurisdiction is on a balance of probabilities”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Ang J also referred to another recent
                    High Court decision by Steven Chong JC (as he then was) in <em>The “Catur Samudra”</em> [2010] SGHC 18
                        (“<em>The Catur Samudra</em>”), where one
                    of the issues was whether a claim under a guarantee for the liabilities of a
                    related company under a charterparty constituted a claim arising out of an
                    agreement relating to the use or hire of a vessel within the meaning of
                    s 3(1)(h). The learned judicial commissioner appears, and indeed was
                    interpreted by Ang J to have held that the plaintiff there failed to
                    establish on a balance of probabilities that s 3(1)(h) was applicable. In
                    addition, Ang J cited other cases such as <em>The Inai
                        Selasih (ex “Geopotes X”)</em> [2005]
                    4 SLR(R) 1, but these dealt with the standard of proof for
                    jurisdictional questions not under s 3(1) but rather s 4(4) of the
                    Act, an issue to be considered in more detail later in these grounds of
                    decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     With regard to the proper threshold that a
                    claimant has to discharge to establish the court’s subject matter
                    jurisdiction under s 3(1), there therefore seems to be some degree of
                    uncertainty. One possible rationalisation lies in the perhaps somewhat subtle
                    distinction between the existence of certain underlying facts or a particular
                    state of affairs which go towards establishing the jurisdictional connection in
                    one of the limbs of s 3(1) on the one hand, and the test of whether the
                    legal precondition under one of the limbs of s 3(1) is satisfied on the
                    other. The former needs to be proved on a balance of probabilities (following
                    cases such as <em>The Catur Samudra</em> and <em>The Eagle Prestige</em>), while the latter must be
                    established to the standard of a good arguable case (following the Court of
                    Appeal decision in <em>The Vasiliy
                Golovnin</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In considering the applicable standard of
                    proof under s 3(1), it may also be worthwhile to recall the requirements
                    that must be satisfied in order to effect service of an action out of
                    jurisdiction. Although obtaining leave to serve process out of jurisdiction of
                    course involves different considerations from invoking the admiralty
                    jurisdiction of the court, it may be argued that the heads of O 11 r 1 of the
                    Rules of Court serve a fairly similar purpose to the limbs under s 3(1) of
                    the Act. The various heads under O 11 r 1 represent various possible connecting
                    factors to Singapore before our courts are prepared to exercise long-arm
                    jurisdiction outside of Singapore, whereas the limbs of s 3(1) spell out
                    the various types of connection that a claim must have to a ship before the
                    admiralty jurisdiction of the High Court can be exercised. It is uncontroversial
                    that the standard to be discharged in relation to satisfying the heads of O 11 r
                    1 is that of a good arguable case: <em>Seaconsar Far East v Bank
                        Markazi Jomhouri Islami Iran</em> [1993] 3 WLR 756;
                        <em>Goodwill Enterprise (Malaysia) v CT Nominees (in
                        liquidation)</em> [1996] 1 SLR(R) 330. The rationale clearly
                    is that an O 11 application will be assessed at a very preliminary stage of the
                    proceedings and based only on affidavit evidence, such that it would be
                    premature and too onerous to require the plaintiff to show proof on a balance of
                    probabilities of the application of one of the limbs under O 11 r 1. Similar
                    considerations would probably apply at the stage of determining the
                    applicability of s 3(1). It should also be noted that our courts have taken
                    the view that the limbs of s 3(1) should be given a broad and liberal
                    reading: <em>The “Mara”</em> [2000]
                    3 SLR(R) 31; <em>The “Trade
                        Fair”</em> [1994] 3 SLR(R) 641.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     There was no need, however, to reach a
                    conclusive view as to whether the standard of proof under s 3(1) is that of
                    a good arguable case or a balance of probabilities, for the purpose of
                    determining the present application. This was because the defendant did not
                    challenge the applicability of s 3(1) in the present case. The real crux of
                    the dispute was as regards the application of s 4(4).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Jurisdictional requirements under s (4)(4)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The defendant’s primary basis for
                    contending that the plaintiff had invalidly invoked the admiralty jurisdiction
                    of the High Court was that the plaintiff had failed to discharge its burden of
                    establishing, <em>on a balance of probabilities</em>, that
                    the defendant is the person liable <em>in personam</em>
                    under s 4(4) of the Act. More specifically, the defendant contended that
                    the plaintiff failed to show on a balance of probabilities that the defendant
                    had contracted with the plaintiff, instead of MAL, for the supply of the bunkers
                    in question.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     In advancing the proposition that a party
                    invoking the admiralty jurisdiction of the High Court has to establish the
                        <em>in personam</em> liability of the defendant on a
                    balance of probabilities, counsel for the defendant, Mr Gurbani, relied on
                    the following paragraphs from the decision of Steven Chong JC (as he then was)
                    in <em>The Catur Samudra</em> (at [22] and [23]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is well settled and not in dispute that the burden of proof is on the
                        plaintiff to satisfy all the jurisdictional requirements laid down in
                        s 4(4) of the HCAJA [the Act] in order to successfully invoke the
                        admiralty jurisdiction against the <em>Catur
                            Samudra</em>…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is also trite that the plaintiff must satisfy the burden of proof on a
                        balance of probabilities…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     To buttress the defendant’s position,
                    Mr Gurbani cited the following passage from <em>Admiralty
                        Law and Practice</em> (at 107):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Questions relating to the existence of the court’s jurisdiction,
                        such as where it is alleged that one of the above requirements relating to
                        the arrest of the offending ship or sister ship may not have been satisfied,
                        have to be dealt with at the interlocutory stage, rather than at the
                        subsequent trial of the substantive issues since the action cannot be
                        allowed to proceed until jurisdictional disputes are resolved. It is
                        therefore not permissible that a mere arguable case on jurisdictional
                        requirements be raised, leaving the door open for the matter to be resolved.
                        The burden of proof on such jurisdictional matters lies with the plaintiff,
                        who has to discharge it on a balance of probabilities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Further, Mr Gurbani referred to Belinda
                    Ang J’s judgment in <em>The Eagle Prestige</em> at
                    [49]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I digress here a little for a brief reminder on the proper standard of
                        proof of jurisdictional questions under the HCAJA [the Act]. When
                        jurisdiction <em>in rem</em> is challenged … the
                        proper standard of proof on jurisdiction is on a balance of probabilities.
                        It is clear that where jurisdiction <em>in rem</em> is
                            <em>based on the existence of particular facts or a
                            particular state of affairs</em>, a challenge to jurisdiction can
                        only be resisted by establishing the facts on which it depends. In the
                        event, <em>the particular facts or state of affairs must be
                            established on the balance of probabilities</em> in the light of
                        all the affidavit evidence before the court to determine whether there is
                        jurisdiction <em>in rem</em> …A review of those
                        cases will show that where, for instance, the nature of the claim requires,
                        for example, the establishment of factual preconditions in s 3(1) or
                        contemplates <em>a s 4(4) ownership question</em>,
                        the <em>in rem</em> plaintiff was obliged to prove the
                        existence of the <em>particular jurisdictional
                            fact</em> and to show jurisdiction on a balance of probabilities.
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     With respect, the defendant’s argument
                    was misconceived. The starting point is to appreciate what the learned judges
                    and commentator were referring to which requires proof on a balance of
                    probabilities. As is clear, particularly from the above extract of Ang J’s
                    decision in <em>The Eagle Prestige</em>, what needs to be
                    proved on a balance of probabilities are the particular jurisdictional facts
                    stipulated under s 4(4), such as the ownership of the offending ship and of
                    the sister ship, as well as whether there was “possession or
                    control” of the offending ship at the material time. These factual
                    questions are obviously different from the issue of whether there is <em>in personam</em> liability, an issue pertaining to the merits
                    of the claim. As counsel for the plaintiff, Mr Leong, also pointed out, the
                    existence of such jurisdictional facts are required to be proved on a balance of
                    probabilities because the matter of jurisdiction has to be determined once and
                    for all at the interlocutory stage, but these requirements are clearly distinct
                    from the question of the merits of the case. In <em>The Catur
                        Samudra</em>, the court was concerned with the question of whether the
                    defendant was in possession or in control of the offending vessel at the time
                    when the cause of action arose (as it was clear that the defendant was not the
                    owner of the vessel at that material time). The court further considered whether
                    the corporate veil should be lifted so that the defendant was effectively the
                    charterer. The plaintiff in that case failed on both counts, and it was in that
                    context that Steven Chong JC (as he then was) held that the plaintiff had failed
                    to discharge its burden of establishing the jurisdictional requirements under
                    s 4(4). The learned judicial commissioner <em>did
                        not</em> hold that the plaintiff had to, for the purpose of crossing
                    the jurisdictional hurdle, also prove on a balance of probabilities that the
                    defendant is liable <em>in personam</em> to the
                    plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The above view is supported by a study of the
                    legislative purpose behind s 4(4), which is clearly to extend the
                    court’s exercise of <em>in rem</em> jurisdiction to
                    not only the offending ship but sister ships as well, and not to impose a new
                    requirement of showing merits in the claim. Section 4(4) of the Act can be
                    traced back to s 4(4) of the Courts (Admiralty Jurisdiction) Ordinance
                    1961. The Ordinance adopted the provisions of the UK Administration of Justice
                    Act, which <em>inter alia</em> implemented in the UK the
                    sister ship arrest rule to give effect to the International Convention Relating
                    to the Arrest of Seagoing Ships of 1952. In the second reading of the Courts
                    (Admiralty Jurisdiction) Bill, the Minister for Health and Law Mr K. M.
                    Byrne explained the background, the material parts of which are reproduced below
                    (Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (16 December 1961) vol 15 at
                    col 2377 to 2383 (Mr K. M. Byrne, Minister for Health and Law)):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In 1956 the Administration of Justice Act, 1956, was enacted in the United
                        Kingdom in order to enable ratification of three international Conventions
                        on maritime law signed at Brussels in 1952, to which the United Kingdom was
                        a party. These Conventions were:-</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1)…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3) The International Convention relating to the Arrest of Seagoing
                        ships.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The third Convention relating to the Arrest of Seagoing ships seeks to
                        produce international uniformity in the law relating to the arrest of a ship
                        to secure a claim. This Convention calls for amendment of English law to
                        permit not only the ship in respect of which the claims arose to be arrested
                        but also any other ship which was under the same ownership.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This Bill accordingly is designed to bring the law in Singapore into line
                        with the provisions of Part I of the United Kingdom Administration of
                        Justice Act, 1956, in order to enable the extension of these Conventions to
                        Singapore…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Clause 4 prescribes the manner in which Admiralty jurisdiction may be
                        exercised and limits the action <em>in rem</em> to
                        conform to the Arrest Convention. <em>Sub-clause (4) of this
                            clause provides that in certain cases claims are enforceable against
                            "sister ships", i.e., ships held under the same ownership as the ship in
                            connection with which the claim arose. The sister ship principle will
                            allow foreign "sister ships" to be arrested here in the same way as our
                            ships can now be arrested in foreign ports</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The phrase “the person who would be
                    liable on the claim in an action <em>in
                    personam</em>” under s 4(4) is therefore meant to identify the
                    person whose ships may be arrested. Section 4(4) is primarily a provision about
                    identifying the ships that may be arrested by reference to the person who would
                    be liable <em>in personam on the assumption that the action
                        succeeds</em>. It is not a provision that seeks to impose a more
                    stringent requirement of <em>merits</em> to be satisfied
                    before the admiralty jurisdiction of the court can be invoked, which is the
                    purport of the defendant’s submission that there is in effect a need to
                    establish <em>in personam liability</em> before s 4(4)
                    is satisfied. The flaw in the defendant’s reasoning is also evident from
                    the decision of Belinda Ang J in <em>The Eagle
                        Prestige</em> itself, wherein Ang J endorsed the following
                    principles enunciated by Willmer J in the leading case of <em>The St Elefterio</em> [1957] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 283
                        (“<em>The St Elefterio</em>”)(at
                    287-288):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The defendants’ argument is founded on the proposition that section
                        3(4) of the Act of 1956 [our s 4(4) of the HCAJA] introduces a new
                        restriction on the right to proceed <em>in rem</em>,
                        and that a plaintiff cannot arrest a ship under that subsection unless he
                        can prove – and prove at the outset – that he has a cause of
                        action sustainable in law. In my judgment that proposition rests upon a
                        misconception of the purpose and meaning of section 3(4). As it appears to
                        me, that subsection, so far from being a restrictive provision, is a
                        subsection introduced for the purpose of enlarging the Admiralty
                        jurisdiction of the court. As I view it, its purpose is to confer, and to
                        confer for the first time in England, the right to arrest either the ship in
                        respect of which the cause of action is alleged to have arisen or any other
                        ship in the same ownership. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In my judgment the purpose of the words relied on by Mr Roskill, that
                        is to say, the words “the person who would be liable on the claim in
                        an action <em>in personam</em>” is to identify
                        the person or persons whose ship or ships may be arrested in relation to
                        this new right (if I may so express it) of arresting a sister ship.
                            <em>The words used, it will be observed, are “the
                            person who would be liable” not “the person “who is
                            liable,”</em> and it seems to me, bearing in mind the
                        purpose of the Act, that <em>the natural construction of
                            those quite simple words is that they mean the person who would be
                            liable on the assumption that the actions
                        succeeds”</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In <em>Admiralty Law and
                        Practice</em>, the learned author expressed a similar view and
                    provided an excellent explanation for it (at 109 to 110):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The requirement of personal liability reflects the central tenet behind
                        the procedural theory, that the ship is arrested to induce her owners to
                        appear and answer for their personal liability. Accordingly, the purpose of
                        this requirement is to identify the person or persons whose ship or ships
                        may be arrested in connection with an offending or sister ship action and
                        such identification is often a question of fact. It will be noticed that the
                        reference is to a person who would be liable rather than who is liable. This
                        has been construed to mean the person who would be liable on the assumption
                        that the action succeeds. In the <em>The AA V</em>,
                        Judith Prakash J after reviewing the case law, opined that the approach
                        accepted by the Singapore decision of <em>The
                            Thorlina</em> appears to favour the ‘is’ test rather
                        than the “would be’ test and suggested clarification from the
                        Singapore Court of Appeal would be helpful as to whether the ‘would
                        be’ test should be adopted instead of the ‘is’ test. It is
                        submitted that if the opportunity arises for such a clarification, the
                        ‘would be’ test should be accepted by the Singapore Court of
                        Appeal. This test has received widespread endorsement in English,
                        Australian, Malaysian, Hong Kong as well as a couple of Singapore
                        first-instance decisions. <em>The ‘is’ test
                            connotes a finding of personal liability on a balance of probabilities
                            at an interlocutory stage of the proceedings, where the validity of the
                            arrest is challenged. This would be premature as parties would not have
                            had the benefit of discovery, interrogatories and
                            cross-examination</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Indeed, imposing a requirement on the
                    plaintiff in the present case to prove, on a balance of probabilities at this
                    jurisdictional stage, that the defendant is the party liable <em>in personam</em> in respect of the bunkers supplied, would lead to an
                    untenable result. The central dispute between parties was whether the contracts
                    for bunkers were in fact entered into between the plaintiff and the defendant
                    through the agency of MAL, or whether the defendant had contracted independently
                    with MAL which in turn entered into another contract with the plaintiff. There
                    was no question that the bunkers in issue were supplied to the defendant for its
                    use, and that the defendant had not made any payment to the plaintiff. That
                    being so, if the plaintiff manages to establish on a balance of probabilities
                    that the contract was between the plaintiff and defendant and hence
                    correspondingly that the defendant is the person liable <em>in
                        personam</em>, the plaintiff would in fact be entitled to judgment.
                    Effectively, the plaintiff would be required to show that he can obtain summary
                    judgment under O 14 of the Rules of Court before he is entitled to invoke this
                    court’s admiralty jurisdiction. That would certainly be a surprising
                    conclusion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Both parties referred to the oft-cited
                    distinction laid down in the High Court decision of <em>The
                        “Opal 3” ex “Kuchino”</em> [1992]
                    2 SLR(R) 231 between the <em>in rem</em> test and
                    the <em>in personam</em> test under s 4(4). However,
                    it is important to bear in mind that when reference is made to the <em>in personam</em> test, this does not mean a test on the
                    merits of the <em>in personam</em> claim. G P Selvam JC (as
                    he then was) stated (at [10]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A claimant invoking the admiralty jurisdiction of the High Court against a
                        ship must first establish that he has a maritime claim under s 3 of the
                        Act and that it arose in connection with a ship. Then if the maritime claim
                        does not carry a maritime lien he must satisfy a two-step test: (a) identify
                        the person who would be liable in an action <em>in
                            personam</em> (“the <em>in
                            personam</em> test”) and (b) identify the ship that is to
                        be proceeded against in the action <em>in rem</em>
                        (“the <em>in rem</em> test”). <em>In applying the in personam test, all that is needed is an
                            arguable case…The claimant must show that the in personam
                            defendant was, at the time the claim arose, the owner of or in
                            possession or control of the ship in connection with which the claim
                            arose</em>…To satisfy the <em>in
                            rem</em> test, the claimant must show that the ship in the
                            <em>in rem</em> action was, at the time the writ
                        was filed, beneficially owned by the <em>in
                            personam</em> defendant as respects all shares in it. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     It is clear that when the learned judicial
                    commissioner referred to the <em>in personam</em> test, he
                    was concerned with the <em>identification</em> of the
                        <em>in personam</em> defendant as the owner, or person
                    in possession or control of the vessel, at the time the claim arose. The test is
                    no different in nature from the <em>in rem</em> test, the
                    latter of which deals with the identification of the beneficial owner of the
                    ship at the time the action was started. Both tests therefore deal with the
                    existence of jurisdictional facts, and not the question of merits. As such, the
                    decision is consistent with the other cases analysed earlier (save that the
                    standard of proof for the jurisdictional facts was stated by Selvam JC to be
                    that of only an arguable case, as opposed to the more stringent standard of a
                    balance of probabilities laid down in the more recent cases like <em>The Eagle Prestige</em> and <em>The Catur
                        Samudra</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Belinda Ang J in <em>The
                        Eagle Prestige</em> explained the way that the issue of merits of the
                    case may become relevant in the context of the jurisdictional inquiry, as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a>
<b><em>Unmeritorious substantive
                        claim</em></b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_54"></a>54     I now come to the other part of <em>The Vasiliy
                            Golovnin (CA)</em> relating to the question of whether the
                        banks’ claims were unmeritorious or clearly unsustainable…On
                        the facts of that case, a good starting point is the test of jurisdiction
                        under s 4(4)(b) (<em>ie</em>, the <em>in personam</em> test). It is important to bear in mind
                        the <em>in personam</em> test in two contexts. The
                        first concerns what has been described as “the low threshold of the
                        merits enquiry” (“Situation 1”), and the second is
                        where the proceedings are frivolous or vexatious or otherwise an abuse of
                        process so as to warrant halting such proceedings <em>in
                            limine</em> by striking out the action under O 18 r 19 of ROC
                        [Rules of Court] or under the court’s inherent jurisdiction
                        (“Situation 2”). Under Situation 2, the merits of the claim
                        are examined as a summary disposal of the action is being
                        sought…</p>
<p class="Judg-2">…</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_57"></a>57     In short, it is open to a defendant to apply at an early
                        stage of the proceedings for the writ <em>in rem</em>
                        and action to be struck off on the ground that the action has no chance of
                        success and is, therefore, vexatious. It is at this stage of striking out
                        application that the court is asked to assess the sustainability of the
                        action. It is at this stage of the striking out application that the
                        validity or strength of the claim will be relevant, and the burden on the
                        issue of non-liability lies on the defendant to show that the case is wholly
                        and clearly unarguable. If there is any arguable basis put up by the
                        plaintiff that the action could succeed then the court should not order the
                        striking out of the action…</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_60"></a>60     The assumption under s 4(4)(<em>b</em>) of the HCAJA- that a party would be liable on the claim
                        in an action <em>in personam</em> on the assumption
                        that the action succeeded – is the default position so long as there
                        is no suggestion that the claim is frivolous or vexatious or otherwise an
                        abuse of process (<em>ie</em>, Situation 1 as in
                            <a href="#p1_54">[54]</a> above). <em>This
                            default position is reflected in O70 r 4(7)(a) of the ROC [Rules of
                            Court] which requires the affidavit leading the warrant of arrest to
                            state the name of the person who would be liable on the claim in an
                            action in personam</em>. Willmer J in <em>The
                            St Elefterio</em> left open the possibility of striking out the
                        action if the action on the evidence is frivolous or vexatious or otherwise
                        an abuse of process (<em>ie</em>, Situation 2 as
                        in <a href="#p1_54">[54]</a> above)…</p>
<p class="Judg-2">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     At first blush, it may appear that Ang J
                    took a different approach from what has been advocated in the preceding
                    paragraphs of these grounds of decision, since the learned judge dealt with the
                    question of merits of the case in the context of s 4(4) of the Act, and
                    appears to have treated what is known as the “<em>in
                        personam</em> test” as a test on the merits. On closer
                    examination though, it can be seen that the difference is more apparent than
                    real. In what Ang J described as “Situation 1”, it seems
                    clear that any consideration of merits generally entails merely <em>procedural compliance</em>, specifically with the requirement
                    under O70 r 4(7)(a) that the affidavit leading the warrant of arrest states the
                    name of the person who would be liable on the claim in an action <em>in personam</em>. At the risk of repetition, there is an
                        <em>assumption</em> that that person identified is the
                    person who would be liable <em>in personam</em> if the
                    claim succeeds. It is only in “Situation 2” that there is a real
                    inquiry into the substantive merits of the case, for the purpose of determining
                    whether the action should be struck out for being frivolous or vexatious or
                    otherwise an abuse of process. “Situation 2” is therefore no
                    different from any other non-admiralty action where an application is taken out
                    under O 18 r 19 or under the inherent jurisdiction of the court to strike out an
                    action or claim. In that sense, the approach taken by Ang J is hence in
                    line with the view advocated here, namely that s 4(4) imposes no separate
                    or additional requirement of showing merits in the case so as to establish the
                    admiralty jurisdiction of the court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     However, it is necessary to consider a
                    narrower argument raised by Mr Gurbani, which pertain to the specific
                    situation where there is a dispute as to who the proper defendant is, such as
                    when a defendant denies he is the contracting party. As the jurisdictional
                    requirement under s 4(4) looks to the party who would be liable <em>in personam</em>, the argument was that the substantive
                    merits of the underlying claim in such cases are so enmeshed or intertwined with
                    the basis of jurisdiction that an examination of the merits becomes inevitable
                    even in the context of a jurisdictional challenge. In this connection,
                    Mr Gurbani relied principally on Belinda Ang J’s decision in
                        <em>The Eagle Prestige</em>, particularly the following
                    passage (at [64]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As I mentioned earlier, <em>The St Elefterio</em> is
                        a case where the relevant agreement had in fact been made between the two
                        parties to the action. In other words, there was no dispute on the proper
                        defendant in an <em>in personam</em> action and there
                        was no question that the plaintiff should have sued someone else <em>in personam</em> in respect of the claim arising under
                        the bills of lading. There have been cases where the writ <em>in rem</em> is sought to be set aside under O 12 r 7 on
                        the ground that the claim did not fall within s 4(4) because the
                        plaintiff should have sued someone else <em>in
                            personam</em>. In other words, there was <em>no
                            subsisting</em> claim <em>in personam</em>
                        against the person who was at that time the owner of the vessel, and there
                        was no jurisdiction <em>in rem</em> because the basis
                        of an action <em>in rem</em> arose from the personal
                        liability of the owner of the vessel. The common argument in the decisions
                        of <em>The Thorlina</em>
                        [1985-1986] SLR(R) 258, <em>The Lok
                            Mashewari</em>, <em>The AA V</em> [1999]
                        3 SLR(R) 664 (“<em>The AA
                        V</em>”) and <em>The Rainbow Spring</em>
                        [2003] 2 SLR(R) 117 (“<em>The Rainbow Spring
                            (HC)</em>”) and <em>The Rainbow Spring
                            (CA</em>) reported in [2003] 3 SLR(R) 362 was that the
                        plaintiff should have sued someone else <em>in
                            personam</em>, and there was clear evidence of the absence of a
                        subsisting claim against the defendant shipowner at the time the writ
                            <em>in rem</em> was filed. There was want of
                        jurisdiction in rem. <em>The substance of the underlying
                            claim was factually inseparable from the basis of
                            jurisdiction</em>. The jurisdictional fact in dispute could on the
                        evidence be summarily disposed of. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     On behalf of the defendant, Mr Gurbani
                    contended that the facts of the present case precisely involved such a situation
                    where the basis for invoking the court’s jurisdiction was factually
                    inseparable from the substance of the underlying claim. As his argument went,
                    the central substantive dispute on the merits was whether the plaintiff did in
                    fact contract with the defendant through the agency of MAL, and this went
                    equally towards the jurisdictional question of whether the defendant was
                    properly the party who would be liable <em>in personam</em>
                    under s 4(4). That being the case, following <em>The Eagle
                        Prestige</em>, the plaintiff in this case would presumably have to
                    discharge a higher burden in order to stave off a jurisdictional challenge, as
                    compared to a claimant in a situation where there is no dispute that the
                    defendant is the proper party to be sued and the only dispute relates to whether
                    the defendant is in fact liable. Mr Gurbani’s argument went so far as
                    to say that the plaintiff in the present case therefore needs to prove the
                        <em>in personam</em> liability on a balance of
                    probabilities, a contention which for reasons already given earlier (principally
                    at [29]), I did not accept. It should be noted that in <em>The
                        Eagle Prestige</em> decision, Ang J said that the jurisdictional
                    facts in dispute in such cases can be summarily disposed of, but did not
                    expressly make clear what the standard of proof on the plaintiff is in a case
                    where the defendant denies it is the proper party to be sued.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     It is also not clear from the cases which
                    Ang J referred to what the standard of proof on the claimant should be
                    where there is a challenge as to the proper party to be sued. There is no clear
                    indication that the standard in such a scenario is necessarily higher. In
                        <em>The Thorlina</em> [1985-1986] SLR(R) 258,
                    the court found that the defendant was not a party to the contract for the
                    repair of the vessel in question and hence would not be liable <em>in personam</em>, but did not elaborate or make clear on what
                    standard of proof that finding was made. As for <em>The AA
                        V</em> [1999] 3 SLR(R) 664, that was a case where the
                    evidence was so clear that the defendants were not a party to the contracts,
                    such that Prakash J thought that it was unnecessary to determine what the
                    proper threshold test under s 4(4) should be. Finally, in <em>The Rainbow Spring</em> [2003] 2 SLR(R) 117,
                    Belinda Ang JC (as she then was) held, referring to <em>The St
                        Elefterio</em> and <em>The Wigwam</em>
                    [1981-1982] SLR(R) 689, that what a plaintiff needs to show is
                        <em>an arguable</em> case that the defendant is the
                    person likely to be liable <em>in personam</em>. It was
                    held that “[i]f the plaintiff's case on jurisdiction is <em>plainly unarguable</em> in that it is bound to fail, the
                        <em>in rem</em> writ would be set aside [emphasis
                    added]”. The test as enunciated resembles closely the usual principles of
                    striking out under O 18 r 19 or pursuant to the inherent jurisdiction of the
                    court. This, together with the reference to the decision in <em>The St Elefterio</em>, suggest that Ang JC in <em>The
                        Rainbow Spring</em> was essentially considering the merits of the case
                    in the same way as how a court would consider the merits in dealing with a
                    striking out application under what the learned judge subsequently termed as
                    “Situation 2” in <em>The Eagle
                    Prestige</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     In my view, the cases do not support the
                    narrower proposition advanced by Mr Gurbani. Indeed, one may query whether
                    there ought to be a higher standard imposed on the plaintiff to discharge its
                    jurisdictional burden simply because there is a dispute as to the identity of
                    the proper party to be sued. When a defendant denies that it was the party who
                    contracted with the plaintiff, it is possible to view the argument as just
                    another defence to a contractual claim. It may be contended that there is no
                    reason in principle why a plaintiff ought to be subject to a higher
                    jurisdictional burden merely because the defendant is alleging that the
                    plaintiff has sued the wrong party, as opposed to a case where the defendant
                    accepts that it is the contracting party but contends it is not liable for other
                    reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     For the foregoing reasons, my interpretation
                    of s 4(4), both from a consideration of its legislative purpose as well as
                    the associated case law and academic commentary, is that the provision is not
                    about imposing a threshold test of merits which a plaintiff has to discharge
                    before it is able to invoke the admiralty jurisdiction of the High Court.
                    Section 4(4) is merely a provision concerned with the identification of the
                    defendant as the owner, or person in possession or control of the vessel, at the
                    time the claim arose, <em>on the assumption that he would be
                        liable</em>. This is so even in the case where there is a dispute as
                    to whether the defendant is the proper party to sue. Any imposition of a burden
                    on the plaintiff to show merits cannot be justified based on
                s 4(4).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Requirement to show merits</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     However quite apart from s 4(4), the
                    question still arises as to whether the law should require some merits to be
                    shown by a claimant before the court’s admiralty jurisdiction can be
                    invoked, and if so, to what extent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     In <em>The Vasiliy
                        Golovnin</em>, V K Rajah JA on behalf of the Court of Appeal
                    stated the following (at [50]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Satisfying the requirements of s 3(1) of the HCAJA cannot be said to
                        be the end all and be all when assessing the sustainability of an admiralty
                        action. Invoking the admiralty jurisdiction may be in one sense a procedural
                        step but <em>it also plainly attracts substantive
                            considerations</em>. There are two requirements that claimants in
                        every admiralty action must satisfy: <em>first,
                            the</em> in rem <em>jurisdiction must be
                            established, through</em>, inter alia<em>, ss 3 and
                            4 of the HCAJA. Second, the claim must, if challenged, also meet the
                            requirement of being a good arguable case on the
                        merits</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The above pronouncement by the Court of Appeal
                    clearly indicates that there is <em>a separate</em>
                    requirement of merits that a claimant in an admiralty action has to satisfy in
                    addition to the requirements under ss 3(1) and 4(4) of the Act. A broadly
                    similar argument was made by counsel in the case of <em>The Eagle
                        Prestige</em>, but was rejected by Belinda Ang J. It is crucial to
                    appreciate the way the defendant’s counsel in <em>The Eagle
                        Prestige</em> had framed the argument, which Ang J recounted in
                    her grounds of decision as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[28]…Mr Tan argued that even though the plaintiff had
                        satisfied the requirements of s 3(1)(<em>h</em>)
                        and s 4(4)(<em>b</em>)(ii), the plaintiff must
                        still demonstrate that it had a good arguable case on the merits.
                        Mr Tan contended that the plaintiff’s claim was premature, and
                        went so far as to argue that <em>The Vasiliy Golovnin (CA) in
                            effect changed the</em> in personam <em>test in
                            s 4(4)(</em>b<em>) to a higher
                            threshold</em>, and in doing so, departed from the legal
                        principles enunciated in <em>The St Elefterio</em>
                        [1957] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 283 (“<em>The St
                            Elefterio</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[30] Mr Tan first raised two broad issues in his written
                        submissions. They are paraphrased as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(i) Whether the arresting party is required to show, at the stage when
                            the warrant of arrest is being challenged (“the challenge
                            stage”) that it has a “good arguable case” on the
                            merits of the claim; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(ii) Whether the duty of disclosure in applications for warrant of
                            arrest extends to cover plausible defences on the merits of the
                            claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the course of argument, Mr Tan raised a third issue which is
                        whether at the application for a warrant of arrest (“the application
                        stage”), the arresting party is required to show that it has a
                        “good arguable case” on the merits of the claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     It was therefore in the context of s 4(4)
                    that Belinda Ang J rejected the contention by the defendant’s counsel
                    in <em>The Eagle Prestige</em>. The learned judge was
                    especially influenced by her view that the Court of Appeal in <em>The Vasiliy Golovnin</em> could not have intended to depart from the
                    leading decision of <em>The St Eleftterio</em> (in relation
                    to the interpretation of the equivalent provision to s 4(4) of the Act)
                    without expressly saying so. Ang J said at [58]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">From the analysis of <em>The Vasiliy Golonvin
                            (CA)</em> and explanation above, there is no substance and merit
                        in Mr Tan’s contentions on issue (i) and issue (iii). There was
                        no basis or room for Mr Tan’s contention that <em>The Vasiliy Golovnin (CA)</em> changed the position at law
                        enunciated in <em>The St Elefterio</em> which was
                        followed in <em>The Wigwam</em>
                        [1981-1982] SLR(R) 689 (“<em>The
                            Wigwam</em>”). If <em>The St
                            Elefterio</em> is no longer good law in Singapore, the Court of
                        Appeal would have explicitly said so. <em>The St
                            Elefterio</em> was not even referred to by its case name in
                            <em>The Vasiliy Golovnin (CA</em>). In fact, the
                        Court of Appeal in [49] of the judgment quoted with approval <em>Admiralty Law and Practice</em> where the author had at
                        pp 45-46 of the text summarised the legal principles from <em>The St Elefterio</em> which were followed in <em>The Wigwam</em>. <em>The St
                            Elefterio</em> received approval for the propositions that</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">So long as the claim is not frivolous as to be dismissed <em>in limine</em>, the plaintiff does not have to
                            establish at the outset that he has a cause of action substantial at
                            law;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Neither would the existence of a good defence to a claim negate the
                            court’s admiralty jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     To the extent that Belinda Ang J in
                        <em>The Eagle Prestige</em> rejected the
                    counsel’s submission in that case on the basis that there is no
                    requirement to show a good arguable case on the merits <em>under
                        s 4(4)</em>, that is consistent with my interpretation that
                    s 4(4) itself does not impose any threshold condition of establishing the
                    merits of the case but is merely about identification of the defendant who would
                    be liable <em>in personam</em> as the owner, or as the
                    person in control or possession of the vessel, at the material
                time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     On the broader question of whether there is a
                    need to show merits <em>per se</em> however, the Court of
                    Appeal’s decision in <em>The Vasiliy Golovnin</em>,
                    and particularly the paragraph reproduced above at <a href="#p1_40">[40]</a>, would suggest an affirmative answer. This view is further
                    supported by Rajah JA’s comment which immediately follows that paragraph,
                    on specifically an arrest of a vessel (at [51]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The arrest of a vessel is never a trifling matter. Arrest is a very
                        powerful invasive remedy. An arrest of a ship can lead to tremendous
                        inconvenience, financial distress and severe commercial embarrassment
                        … Even the briefest of delays can sometimes cause significant losses.
                        It can also in certain instances prejudice the livelihood of the ship's crew
                        and the commercial fortunes of the shipowner. Maritime arrests can, when
                        improperly executed, sometimes be as destructive as Anton Piller orders and
                        even as potentially ruinous as Mareva injunctions, the two nuclear weapons
                        of civil litigation. As such, a plaintiff must always remain cautious and
                        rigorously ascertain the material facts before applying for a warrant of
                        arrest. <em>While there is no need to establish a conclusive
                            case at the outset, there is certainly a need to establish</em> a
                        good arguable case<em>, before an arrest warrant can be
                            issued. This determination plainly requires a preliminary assessment of
                            the merits of the claim</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     It therefore appears clear from the Court of
                    Appeal’s pronouncements that some preliminary assessment of the merits of
                    the case is required even at the jurisdictional stage, and that the standard to
                    which such merits are to be established is that of a good arguable case. Rajah
                    JA’s reference to Mareva injunctions and Anton Piller orders is
                    instructive. For both types of orders, an applicant is required to establish a
                    certain degree of merits to his case before he can obtain the relief, even
                    though the proceedings are only at an interlocutory stage. A good arguable case
                    on the merits must be shown in order to obtain a Mareva injunction (see
                        <em>Amixco Asia Pte Ltd v Bank Negara Indonesia</em>
                    1946 [1991] 2 SLR(R) 713), whereas an Anton Piller order will only be
                    granted if the applicant satisfies the court of an extremely strong <em>prima facie</em> case on the merits (see <em>Asian Corporate Services (SEA) Pte Ltd v Eastwest Management Ltd (Singapore
                        Branch)</em> [2006] 1 SLR(R) 901). The imposition of such
                    stringent conditions to show merits in the claim, at a usually early stage of
                    the proceedings, is justified based on the draconian nature of the remedy. Since
                    the arrest of a vessel is, as the Court of Appeal pointed out in <em>The Vasiliy Golovnin</em>, also a very powerful and invasive
                    remedy, it can be said that there ought likewise to be some test of merits which
                    must be satisfied. In this regard, a parallel can also be drawn where the court
                    is asked to exercise its “long-arm” jurisdiction by permitting
                    service of its process overseas. It is well established that a claimant who
                    wishes to effect service out of jurisdiction requires leave of court under O 11,
                    which would only be granted if the claimant can satisfy the court, <em>on the merits</em>, that there is a serious issue to be
                    tried: <em>Seaconsar Far East Ltd. V Bank Markazi Jomhouri Islami
                        Iran</em> [1994] 1 AC 438; <em>Goodwill Enterprise
                        (Malaysia) v CT Nominees (in liquidation)</em> [1996] 2 SLR 404. In
                    principle, there is much to be said for the view that if a claimant in an
                    admiralty action faces a challenge at the jurisdictional stage, he should have a
                    more onerous burden to discharge than a claimant in an ordinary non-admiralty
                    suit facing an application to strike out the action based on O 18 r 19 or the
                    inherent jurisdiction of the court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     It must however be acknowledged that the above
                    construction of the Court of Appeal’s decision in <em>The
                        Vasiliy Golovnin</em>, may not sit well with Belinda Ang J’s
                    ruling in <em>The Eagle Prestige</em> with regard to the
                    non-disclosure of material facts in the arrest process. In Ang J’s view,
                    for a plaintiff to discharge its obligation to make full and frank disclosure,
                    there is no need for the plaintiff to disclose substantive defences that the
                    defendant could raise at the trial, unless the matters underlying the defences
                    will show that the claim is obviously unsustainable such that the omission to
                    mention them effectively amounts to misleading the court. Ang J explained
                    (at [75]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In my view, the non-disclosure of defences that the defendant could raise
                        at the trial in answer to the plaintiff’s claim (as that pertains to
                        the ultimate merits of the action and the question of who is likely to win),
                        are <em>generally</em> not characterised as a failure
                        to give full and frank disclosure <em>unless</em> (and
                        this is the qualification (<em>ie</em>
                        Situation 2) mentioned in <em>The St
                            Elefterio</em> …) they <em>are matters that
                            show up the claim as an abuse of process, or one that it is so obviously
                            frivolous and vexatious as to be open to summary dismissal and, on any
                            reasonable view, their omission, at the application stage, is tantamount
                            to or constitutes an abuse of process</em>. From a broader
                        perspective, failure to disclose matters showing that the claim or arrest
                        should not have been brought at all, are material facts that constitute the
                        abuse of process. Simply put, <em>they constitute matters of
                            such weight that their omission is likely to or may mislead the court in
                            the exercise of its discretionary power of arrest</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Ang J’s reason for holding the above
                    view is that at the jurisdictional stage, there is no onus on the <em>in rem</em> plaintiff to show that the claim is likely to
                    succeed. It would suffice that the claim is not an abuse of process or so
                    obviously frivolous and vexatious as to be open to summary dismissal. In her
                    view, the plaintiff is generally not required to go into the merits of the claim
                    in “Situation 1” cases (or at any rate only to a very minimal
                    degree), and it is only where there is an application to strike out the action
                    under O 18 r 19 or pursuant to the inherent jurisdiction of the court (<em>ie</em> “Situation 2”) that the merits of the
                    case become relevant (see [74] of the learned judge’s grounds of
                    decision).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     My decision in the present case is therefore
                    justified on two separate bases. The defendant had applied for the following
                    orders in the alternative, namely (a) that the admiralty writ be struck out
                    and/or set aside on the basis that the admiralty jurisdiction of the court under
                    the Act was improperly and/or invalidly invoked by the plaintiff against the
                    vessel “Bunga Melati 5”; or (b) that the writ be struck out and/or
                    set aside pursuant to O 18 r 19 and/or the inherent jurisdiction of the court.
                    As will be elaborated below, the primary basis for my decision to strike out the
                    admiralty writ is that the plaintiff failed to establish its case on the merits
                    to the standard of a good arguable case. In particular, it failed to show a good
                    arguable case that it had contracted with the defendant for the supply of the
                    bunkers in question. Accordingly, the admiralty jurisdiction of the court was
                    not properly invoked and the writ should therefore be struck out. In the
                    alternative, if the true position is that there is no independent requirement on
                    the plaintiff to show merits to its claim in order to invoke the court’s
                    admiralty jurisdiction, the result will still be the same, because my view based
                    on the state of the evidence presented is that the defendant has successfully
                    shown that the plaintiff’s claim is plainly unsustainable and frivolous,
                    and ought therefore to be struck out pursuant to O 18 r 19 or the inherent
                    jurisdiction of the court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Application to the Present Case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     As already mentioned, the issue of whether the
                    plaintiff’s claim fell within s 3(1) of the Act did not arise. In
                    relation to s 4(4), it was not disputed that the defendant, the person who
                        <em>would be</em> liable in <em>personam</em> if the action succeeds, was the owner of the offending
                    ships at the time the cause of action arose. It was also common ground that the
                    defendant was the beneficial owner of the sister ship, <em>The
                        Bunga Melati 5</em>, at the time this action was brought. To
                    reiterate, the view taken here is that s 4(4) does not impose a threshold
                    condition of merits. It however remains necessary to go further to examine the
                    merits of the plaintiff’s claim, as following <em>The
                        Vasiliy Golovnin</em>, the plaintiff must establish its claim on the
                    merits to the standard of a good arguable case. Even if that is not the proper
                    interpretation of the Court of Appeal’s decision, and that there is no
                    additional requirement to show merits in the claim in order to establish
                    jurisdiction, the defendant’s alternative prayer to strike out the writ
                    and action under the usual principles of O 18 r 19, or the inherent jurisdiction
                    of the court, still necessitates an examination into the merits of the
                    case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The claim in contract</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The plaintiff’s claim was for payment of
                    certain bunkers supplied under the alleged Fixed Price contracts and the Navig8
                    Faith contract. According to the plaintiff, the alleged Fixed Price contracts
                    were evidenced by emails between MAL and the plaintiff’s broker Compass
                    Marine, while the Navig8 Faith contract was evidenced by emails between MAL and
                    the plaintiff’s other broker OceanConnect. In both instances, the
                    submission made was that MAL was acting as the agent of the defendant.
                    Mr Leong on behalf of the plaintiff also placed reliance on documents such
                    as bunker confirmations, some of which named the defendant as
                    “Buyers” and the plaintiff as “Sellers”. What is
                    critical to note is that none of these emails or documents originated from the
                    defendant, and nor is there any indication that these emails and documents were
                    sent to the defendant. The defendant denied any knowledge of these documents,
                    until they surfaced in the court proceedings. As Mr Gurbani pointed out, it
                    is difficult to see how such documents – which were essentially
                    correspondences between MAL and Compass Marine or OceanConnect, and between the
                    plaintiff and Compass Marine or OceanConnect – can be said to bind the
                    defendant to a contract with the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     In contrast to the paucity of documentary
                    support for the supply contracts as alleged by the plaintiff, the defendant
                    adduced concrete evidence showing that the defendant had in fact procured the
                    sale and supply of bunkers for its vessels from MAL directly as the contractual
                    seller. There were contractual documents evidencing an open tender process which
                    took place before the defendant awarded the fixed term 6-month contract to MAL.
                    It was further not in dispute that, in accordance with the contracts which the
                    defendant had with MAL, the defendant had paid a substantial sum of in excess of
                    US$17 million to MAL for the bunkers sold and supplied by MAL to the
                    defendant’s vessels, which form the subject matter of the
                    plaintiff’s claim. Mr Gurbani made the very forceful point that it
                    makes no logical sense for the defendant to first enter into a contract with MAL
                    (in March 2008) where the price of the bunkers was fixed at US$475 per metric
                    ton, and then to subsequently authorise MAL (in July 2008) to contract with the
                    plaintiff or its brokers on the defendant’s behalf for the same bunkers at
                    a price in excess of US$740 per metric ton. The same argument applies in
                    relation to the market price contracts concluded between the defendant and MAL,
                    for which the agreed prices ranged from US$525 to US$649.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     The plaintiff sought to cast doubts on whether
                    the defendant had in fact dealt with MAL as an independent seller for the
                    bunkers, and suggested that the alleged contracts between them may be in fact be
                    shams, or at the very least the surrounding circumstances justify further
                    investigation and examination through the trial process. The argument was
                    mounted on several fronts. Mr Leong contended that it was unlikely for a
                    substantial shipowner like the defendant to entrust almost all of its bunker
                    requirements worldwide to a company like MAL, which was a relatively small
                    set-up with no reputation in the bunker industry. In relation specifically to
                    the tender contract, Mr Leong highlighted that MAL was the only party in
                    the tendering process to accept the tender conditions without reservations and
                    to offer a substantially lower price than the other bidders, suggesting that the
                    contract was therefore not an arms-length transaction. In addition,
                    Mr Leong alluded to the fact that MAL was never involved in the physical
                    execution of the bunkering operations of the defendant’s vessels. Instead,
                    the plaintiff liaised directly with the defendant’s local agents in
                    Singapore to coordinate the bunkering operations. This, according to
                    Mr Leong, suggested that MAL was clearly not the actual seller of the
                    bunkers but merely a broker.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     In considering the plaintiff’s arguments
                    above, one must bear in mind the clear evidence presented before the court of a
                    transparent and rigorous tendering process conducted by the defendant. The
                    process attracted bids from a number of established bunker traders and suppliers
                    such as Petronas Dagangan Berhad, BP Singapore Pte Ltd, and Shell Malaysia
                    Trading Sdn Bhd, all of whom were registered bidders for the defendant’s
                    bunker supply contracts. The terms and conditions of the fixed price contract
                    with MAL were contained in a set of documents known as the “Bid
                    Documents”, which were circulated to the various registered bunker
                    suppliers that were invited to participate in the tender exercise. A total of
                    six bids were received, indicating that apart from MAL, there were other
                    established suppliers wiling to agree to a fixed price contract at that time
                    over the period in question. Against this backdrop, Mr Leong’s
                    suggestion that there may be something suspicious about the tender process was
                    unpersuasive. Leaving aside whether MAL was indeed a small-time player in the
                    industry (an issue which the defendant’s counsel argued not unconvincingly
                    to the contrary), the mere fact that MAL was able to offer more favourable terms
                    to the defendant than the other bidders should not, without more, raise
                    eyebrows. After all, that must be precisely the reason why the tender was
                    awarded to MAL eventually. While the price of US$475 per metric ton offered by
                    MAL was indeed lower than the other bidders, the defendant pointed out that MAL
                    itself managed to enter into a six month contract with another party OW Bunkers
                    at an even lower price of US$467 per metric ton. This indicates that MAL knew
                    how to hedge its position. In fact, MAL had been contracting with the defendant
                    for a number of years prior to 2008, and had no difficulty fulfilling its
                    contractual obligations until the present transactions which are before the
                    court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     To prove that there has been a sham
                    transaction, it is trite law that the parties must be shown to have entered into
                    the contract with the common intention “to give to third parties or to
                    the court the appearance of creating between the parties legal rights and
                    obligations different from the actual legal rights and obligations (if any)
                    which the parties intend to create”: <em>Snook v London
                        and West Riding Investments Ltd</em> [1967] 2 QB 786, accepted locally
                    in <em>Koon Seng Construction Pte Ltd v Chenab Contractor Pte
                        Ltd</em> [2008] 1 SLR(R) 375 and <em>The Inai
                        Selasih (ex Geopotes X)</em> [2006] 2 SLR(R) 181. In the
                    present case, after the supply contracts were entered into between the defendant
                    and MAL, it was undisputed that MAL supplied bunkers to the defendant’s
                    vessels pursuant to the terms of those contracts, with invoices being rendered
                    by MAL to the defendant following each supply. As already mentioned, it was also
                    common ground that the defendant then made payment for the bunkers supplied in
                    accordance with the supply contracts. In the circumstances, my view is that any
                    argument that the supply contracts between the defendant and MAL were sham
                    transactions is bound to fail. Evidence that the tender process was other than
                        <em>bona fide</em> were sorely lacking.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     It is moreover pertinent to note that the
                    documents, which were sent by MAL to the defendant in respect of the various
                    bunker supplies, typically state as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-1">MAL was clearly referred to as a bunker trader, and not a broker or
                    agent. Parties were in agreement that the term “bunker traders”
                    typically refers to parties who do not physically supply the bunkers, but
                    procure the bunkers from other suppliers. This would explain why the party which
                    the defendant liaised with in relation to the physical operations of the bunker
                    supply was the plaintiff and not MAL, since the latter did not have physical
                    possession of the bunkers. This is in no way inconsistent with the
                    defendant’s case that MAL was the actual contracting party with the
                    defendant and not a mere agent. Perhaps most detrimental to the
                    plaintiff’s case was its failure to explain why the defendant would make
                    payment for the bunkers to MAL if the latter was merely a broker. There was no
                    evidence of any brokerage commission being paid to MAL as remuneration, or any
                    indication of the existence of a brokerage agreement at all. This was despite
                    the fact that the managing director of MAL, Mr Yahya Bin Mohd Khalid
                    (“Mr Khalid”), gave evidence on behalf of the plaintiff. If
                    an agency relationship indeed existed, one would have expected Mr Khalid to
                    refer to some brokerage agreement and provide details of its terms. Noticeably
                    absent as well was any explanation by Mr Khalid for the payment of over
                    US$17 million from the defendant to MAL.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">
<u>Agency by estoppel</u>
</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Faced with a lack of documentary evidence
                    showing that MAL was appointed by the defendant as the agent to broker the
                    bunker transactions, the plaintiff sought to rely on the affidavit evidence of
                    various third parties to build up an argument based on agency by estoppel. The
                    plaintiff asserted that the defendant had held MAL out as its agent.
                    Alternatively, the defendant knew or ought to have known that MAL was holding
                    itself out as the defendant’s agent and that bunker suppliers like the
                    plaintiff would have supplied the bunkers only if they thought that the
                    defendant was the principal and MAL its agent. It was argued that
                    notwithstanding the above, the defendant did not take any steps to correct the
                    plaintiff’s erroneous belief, and the plaintiff had acted in reliance of
                    such express or implied representation of MAL’s authority to its detriment
                    by supplying the bunkers to the defendant’s vessels without obtaining
                    payment. In these circumstances, the plaintiff submitted that the defendant was
                    estopped from denying MAL’s authority to enter into the bunker
                    transactions on its behalf.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The plaintiff primarily relied on the
                    affidavit of Mr Khalid, who deposed to the fact that the defendant knew
                    that MAL was purchasing bunkers on behalf of the defendant. The plaintiff also
                    procured an affidavit from the managing director of Compass Marine,
                    Mr Darren Middleton. Mr Middleton gave evidence about how a
                    representative from the defendant’s bunker unit had informed him that MAL
                    was the defendant’s bunker broker, and provided him with MAL’s
                    contact details so that Compass Marine could liaise with MAL for the supply of
                    bunkers to the defendant. Finally, Mr Lars Nielsen, the managing director
                    from another firm in the bunker trade, Brilliant Maritime Services
                    (“BMS”), swore an affidavit stating that one of the employees at
                    the defendant’s bunker unit, by the name of Khairul, had directed his
                    staff in a phone conversation to contact MAL to discuss the defendant’s
                    bunker requirements. Mr Nielsen’ evidence was that he understood this
                    to mean that the defendant had appointed MAL as its broker to fix bunker
                    contracts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     The concept of agency by estoppel was
                    explained by the English court in <em>Freeman &amp; Lockyer v
                        Buckhurst Park Properties (Mangal) Ltd</em> [1964] 2 QB 480
                        (“<em>Freeman &amp; Lockyer</em>”) in the
                    following terms (at 503-504):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">An "apparent" or "ostensible" authority, on the other hand, is a legal
                        relationship between the principal and the contractor created by a
                        representation, made by the principal to the contractor, intended to be and
                        in fact acted upon by the contractor, that the agent has authority to enter
                        on behalf of the principal into a contract of a kind within the scope of the
                        "apparent" authority, so as to render the principal liable to perform any
                        obligations imposed upon him by such contract. To the relationship so
                        created the agent is a stranger. He need not be (although he generally is)
                        aware of the existence of the representation but he must not purport to make
                        the agreement as principal himself. The representation, when acted upon by
                        the contractor by entering into a contract with the agent, operates as an
                        estoppel, preventing the principal from asserting that he is not bound by
                        the contract. It is irrelevant whether the agent had actual authority to
                        enter into the contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     In the recent decision of <em>Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB (Publ), Singapore Branch v Asia Pacific
                        Breweries (Singapore) Pte Ltd</em> [2009] 4 SLR(R) 788, the
                    High Court accepted (at [80]) the applicable principles laid down in <em>Freeman &amp; Lockyer</em>. In particular, the following
                    three conditions must be satisfied before an agency by estoppel can
                    arise:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_59-p2_a"></a>(a)     there must be a representation that
                        the agent has authority to enter on behalf of the principal into a contract
                        of the kind sought to be enforced;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_59-p2_b"></a>(b)     such representation must be made by a person or persons
                        who had “actual” authority to manage the business of the
                        principal either generally or in respect of those matters to which the
                        contract relates; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_59-p2_c"></a>(c)     the contracting party must have been induced by such representation
                        to enter into the contract, that is, that he in fact relied upon
                    it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The High Court (at [80]) specifically referred to the
                    following passage by Diplock LJ in <em>Freeman &amp;
                        Lockyer</em> (at 505):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It follows that where the agent upon whose “apparent”
                        authority <em>the contractor relies has no
                            “actual” authority from the corporation to enter into a
                            particular kind of contract with the contractor on behalf of the
                            corporation, the contractor cannot rely upon the agent's own
                            representation as to his actual authority</em>. He can rely only
                        upon a representation by a person or persons who have actual authority to
                        manage or conduct that part of the business of the corporation to which the
                        contract relates. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Bearing in mind the above legal requirements
                    for establishing an agency by estoppel, the evidence produced by the plaintiff
                    fell far short. In relation to Mr Middleton’s evidence, the first
                    point to note is that the alleged representation made by the defendant’s
                    employee did not even relate to the transactions in question. The supposed
                    telephone conversation took place in May 2006, but the Fixed Price contracts
                    were concluded only more than two years later in July 2008. Second, the law is
                    clear that to form an estoppel, the representation must emanate from a person
                    with actual authority to manage the business of the principal. There was no
                    indication whatsoever that the alleged employee in the bunker unit was such a
                    person. Third, it was Mr Middleton’s employee, and not
                    Mr Middleton himself, who allegedly spoke to that employee of the
                    defendant. Fourth, and this is important, any alleged representation was made to
                    Compass Marine (of which Mr Middleton is the managing director), and not to
                    the plaintiff itself. The plaintiff has adduced no evidence to show that it was
                    induced by and had acted in reliance of that representation to its detriment.
                    Mr Gurbani also highlighted that Compass Marine could have a vested
                    interest in the outcome of these proceedings, even though it is not directly
                    involved. This is because if this court were to hold that there was no contract
                    between the defendant and the plaintiff, Compass Marine would potentially be
                    liable to the plaintiff for breach of warranty of authority in misrepresenting
                    that the plaintiff’s contractual buyer was the defendant when it was in
                    fact MAL.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     As for Mr Nielsen, it must be noted that
                    BMS was not even the broker of the plaintiff in respect of the material
                    transactions. His evidence was therefore even more remote and of peripheral
                    relevance. In any event, his evidence suffered from similar deficiencies as
                    Mr Middleton’s, in that there was no evidence at all that Khairul was
                    an employee with actual authority, and there was nothing to indicate that the
                    alleged representation was in fact conveyed to the plaintiff and relied upon.
                    With regard to the Navig8 Faith contract, no representative from the
                    plaintiff’s broker OceanConnect gave evidence. There was no evidence
                    whatsoever of any representation being made to either OceanConnect or to the
                    plaintiff directly of MAL’s authority to broker that particular
                    deal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Insofar as the plaintiff’s case on
                    agency by estoppel is based on express representations made by the defendant as
                    to MAL’s authority, my view based on the state of the evidence before me
                    is that it is bound to fail. It remains to address the plaintiff’s
                    alternative case based on implied representation, the contention being that the
                    defendant knew or ought to have known that MAL had been representing itself to
                    the bunker industry that it was the defendant’s agent, but took no steps
                    to correct that mistaken view. It should be clarified at the outset that any
                    representations that might have been made by MAL as to its own authority to
                    transact on behalf of the defendant, without more, would not suffice, as the law
                    is clear that the contracting party cannot rely on the agent's own
                    representation as to its actual authority (see above at <a href="#p1_59">[59]</a>). The key is therefore the defendant’s knowledge that
                    MAL was making such representations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     The plaintiff’s contention was that the
                    defendant had acquiesced in MAL’s conduct of holding itself out as the
                    defendant’s agent. In this connection, the plaintiff relied substantially
                    on the evidence of Mr Khalid, the managing director of MAL. Mr Khalid
                    said in his affidavit that the defendant was aware that MAL had sourced for and
                    purchased bunkers in the defendant’s name, and that the defendant had
                    authorised him to do so. He also said that “everyone in the bunker
                    industry knew that MAL was acting on behalf of MISC [the defendant]”.
                    However, there were serious doubts as to the credibility of
                    Mr Khalid’s affidavit evidence, not least because his contentions
                    were wholly inconsistent with a previous sworn Declaration which he had signed
                    on 5 December 2008 in support of the defendant’s motion to vacate the Rule
                    B order in the US proceedings. In the Declaration, Mr Khalid clearly
                    described the relationship between the defendant and MAL as that of contractual
                    buyer and seller. This inconsistency was conceded by counsel for the plaintiff,
                    Mr Leong (although he sought to persuade the court that Mr Khalid
                    ought to be given a chance to explain at trial). Furthermore, the assertions in
                    Mr Khalid’s affidavit completely contradicted the position taken by
                    MAL in legal proceedings which MAL had instituted against a Malaysian bank Affin
                    Bank Berhad in the High Court of Selangor. MAL stated in its statement of claim
                    in those proceedings in no uncertain terms that it “would enter into a
                    short term periodic contract for the sale of Bunkers to MISC at a certain and
                    fixed price, before sourcing and securing the required quantity of Bunkers at a
                    lower price from the open market in order to profit from the sale”.
                    Clearly, the position taken there was that MAL was purchasing bunkers in its own
                    name in order to fulfil its contractual obligations as seller to the
                    defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     In addition, Mr Khalid’s evidence
                    in the affidavit was at odds with the contemporaneous documentary evidence. A
                    letter dated 18 November 2008 from MAL to the defendant appealing for future
                    business deserves reproduction below:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_64-p2_1.1"></a>1.1     As you are well aware pursuant to
                        your Letter of Award dated 14th March 2008 and the Agreement for Supply of
                        Bunkers dated 24th March 2008, we have secured a six (6) months supply of
                        138,000 MT (MFO380CST) contract to you at a fixed price of USD475.00/MT at a
                        total award price of USD65,550,000.00 (“the
                    Contract”).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_64-p2_1.2"></a>1.2     The price was based at USD475.00/MT which was representative of the
                        then global bunker market price.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_64-p2_1.3"></a>1.3     Pursuant to this, we have secured the supply from OW
                        Bunker at USD467.00/MT for a period of six (6) months starting April 2008.
                        Unfortunately, at the end of June 2008, OW Bunker has to abort the contract
                        due to shortage of their own bunker fuel.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_64-p2_1.4"></a>1.4     Compass Marine, our London analyst advised and
                        sourced out bunker fuel from another physical supplier i.e. Equatorial
                        Marine Fuel for the remaining three (3) months starting July
                    2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_64-p2_1.5"></a>1.5     As you are
                        well aware of, there was a drastic upward movement of worldwide bunker price
                        since the months of July, August and September 2008 where the price ranges
                        from USD600.00/MT for the month of July 2008 to USD750.00/MT for the months
                        of August and September 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_64-p2_1.6"></a>1.6     It was impossible to lock the bunker price as there was
                        no supplier willing to do so. This matter is beyond our
                    control.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_64-p2_1.7"></a>1.7     
            <em>We nonetheless continued to honour the Contract. As
                            a result, the Company currently suffers approximately USD15 million
                            losses as a result of compliance to the fixed price mechanism under the
                            Contract</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-2">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This was clearly not a letter that would have been written by a party who took
                    the view that it was only acting as an agent and purchasing bunkers on behalf of
                    its principal. If MAL were indeed under the impression that it was merely the
                    defendant’s broker, it would not have said that it was suffering from
                    losses of “approximately US$15 million as a result of compliance to the
                    fixed price mechanism under the Contract”. MAL as a broker would be
                    expected to only be entitled to remuneration in the form of a brokerage
                    commission or agency fees. The letter clearly contradicted
                    Mr Khalid’s evidence and indicated quite unequivocally that this was
                    a case where MAL was being paid the bunker purchase price by the defendant.
                    Further, there was correspondence between the defendant and MAL in which MAL
                    apologised for the “hassle caused pertaining to the outstanding payment
                    notice from Equatorial Marine Fuel” and further assured the defendant
                    that it would “take full responsibility to settle all outstanding
                    payments to Equatorial”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     The court is not required to treat every
                    affidavit filed as true and at face value. The court may in appropriate
                    circumstances reject the evidence contained therein, even in the context of an
                    interlocutory application. In Paclantic v Moscow Narodny Bank [1983]
                    1 WLR 1063, the court considered when it would be appropriate to
                    reject affidavit evidence (at 1067):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I conclude, therefore, that I can reject Mr. Wong's affidavit, or any

                        irrelevant. I conclude that I could reject a defendant's evidence <em>where there is affirmative evidence which is either admitted by
                            the defendant or unchallengeable by him, and which is unequivocally
                            inconsistent with his own evidence; and where no, or no plausible,
                            explanation is given of the inconsistency</em>; because in such a
                        case I could, but would not necessarily, conclude that on the evidence not
                        even a faint possibility of a defence existed. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     Indeed, our court has accepted that just
                    because an allegation is contained in a sworn affidavit, that does not mean that
                    it should be accepted as true at the interlocutory stage. In the context of
                    considering an application for summary judgment, the High Court in <em>Lee Kuan Yew v Chee Soon Juan</em> [2003]
                    3 SLR(R) 8 endorsed (at [24]) the following principle from <em>Microsoft Corporation v Electro-Wide Limited</em> [1997] FSR
                    580 (at 594):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[T]he mere fact that the defendants support their defence by sworn
                        evidence does not mean that the court is obliged to suspend its critical
                        faculties and accept that evidence as if it was probably accurate. If,
                        having regard to inconsistency with contemporaneous documents, inherent
                        implausibility and other compelling evidence, the defence is not credible,
                        the court must say so. It should not let the filing of evidence which
                        surpasses belief deprive a plaintiff of its entitlement to relief.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     In the present case, in light of the obvious
                    inconsistencies with contemporaneous evidence as well as his own sworn
                    Declaration, Mr Khalid’s affidavit evidence should be rejected, or at
                    least be given very little weight as being highly unreliable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     Other than Mr Khalid’s assertion
                    that the defendant was aware that MAL was using the defendant’s name to
                    purchase bunkers on its behalf, all the plaintiff could rely on were the general
                    allegations made by Mr Middleton, Mr Nielsen, as well as by its own
                    director Mrs Chong, that MAL was a small setup with no reputation in the bunker
                    industry except that it was known to be the defendant’s bunker broker.
                    Again, the defendant refuted this and adduced contrary evidence of MAL’s
                    financial viability prior to its present troubles. More importantly however,
                    these assertions relied upon by the plaintiff, even if true, did not address
                    directly the issue of whether the defendant in fact knew about such a perception
                    among the industry players. It must be remembered that the defendant provided
                    documentary evidence of its practice of procuring bunkers directly through fixed
                    price contracts and inviting tenders from its registered bunker suppliers,
                    rather than arranging for such supplies through brokers. All the invoices which
                    the defendant received for the transactions in question were MAL’s
                    invoices, issued on MAL’s letterhead and based on the contract prices
                    between the defendant and MAL. There was no evidence of MAL presenting to the
                    defendant at any time any of the physical suppliers’ invoices or other
                    documentation which might have suggested that the contract for supply was in
                    fact not with MAL.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Mr Gurbani submitted that silence is
                    generally insufficient to constitute the kind of representation that is required
                    for a plea of estoppel to succeed. He referred to Prakash J’s decision in
                        <em>Everbright Commercial Enterprises Pte Ltd and another v
                        AXA Insurance Singapore Pte Ltd</em> [2000] 2 SLR(R) 287, in
                    particular the following (at [66]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The plaintiffs' difficulty is that silence is generally insufficient to
                        constitute the kind of representation that is necessary for a plea of
                        estoppel to succeed. <em>Silence only founds estoppel when
                            there is a duty to speak</em>. See <em>Greenwood v
                            Martins Bank</em> [1933] AC 51 and <em>Spiro v
                            Lintern</em> [1973] 3 All ER 319. In the latter case, the
                        defendant's wife purported to sell the defendant's house to the plaintiff.
                        The plaintiff sued the defendant for specific performance of the contract
                        and it was held that the defendant was estopped from proving that the
                        contract had been made without his authority because <em>he
                            had known that the plaintiff had effected repairs on the house in the
                            mistaken belief</em> that there was a legal obligation on the
                        defendant to sell the house to the plaintiff. In those circumstances, the
                        defendant had been under a duty to disclose to the plaintiff that his wife
                        had acted without his authority and his failure to do so amounted to a
                        representation by conduct that she had his authority. The principle to be
                        drawn from these cases is that a duty to speak will arise where silence
                        would create an erroneous impression which leads the prospective representee
                        to alter his position for the worse.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     There is a similar observation made by the
                    learned authors in <em>The Law Relating to Estoppel by

                        duty to the mistaken party to ascertain the truth and inform him…the
                        silent party need not speculate as to whether the alleged representee is
                        mistaken nor point the matter out to him, unless their circumstances and
                        relationship are such that the alleged representee is entitled to expect
                        this.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     In my view, plaintiff did not show any
                    credible evidence that the defendant knew or ought to have known that MAL was
                    representing to the bunker industry that it was acting as the agent of the
                    defendant. There was no evidence whatsoever in the various affidavits filed on
                    the plaintiff’s behalf of any attempts by the plaintiff or its brokers to
                    contact the defendant to verify the truth of any representations by MAL as to
                    its own authority. The plaintiff was clearly content to commit itself to the
                    transactions worth more than US$52 million without making any inquiries from a
                    sufficiently senior member of the defendant with actual authority to manage the
                    defendant’s bunker business. I agree with Mr Gurbani’s
                    submission that the defendant could not, in the circumstances, come under any
                    duty to correct any mistaken belief the bunker traders and suppliers (including
                    the plaintiff) might have had that MAL was authorised to act as the
                    defendant’s broker. As such, the plaintiff’s bid to establish an
                    agency by estoppel through implied representation is similarly
                    unsustainable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">
<u>Admission of liability</u>
</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     I shall now deal with the plaintiff’s
                    submission that the defendant has admitted its contractual liability to the
                    plaintiff by virtue of the corporate guarantee. The difficulty with such an
                    argument is that the very notion of a guarantee, as Mr Gurbani pointed out,
                    is that it is to guarantee <em>another party’s
                        liability</em>. Indeed, the corporate guarantee in question made it
                    clear expressly that it was to guarantee that the defendant would make full
                    payment of the outstanding sum due and owing to the plaintiff <em>from MAL</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“THIS CORPORATE GUARANTEE dated 2nd day of December, 2008 is made
                        by MISC BERHAD … to certify and guarantee that MISC shall make full
                        payment of the current outstanding sum of …
                        <em>due and owing</em>, inclusive of interest,
                            <em>to Equatorial Marine from MARKET ASIA LINK SDN
                            BHD</em>…”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     In fact, the wording of the guarantee
                    supported the defendant’s case that there were two separate contracts, one
                    between the defendant and MAL and another between MAL and the plaintiff.
                    Mr Gurbani also highlighted the context in which the corporate guarantee
                    was offered. The defendant’s vessel the “Bunga Kasturi
                    Lima”, worth far more than the $22 million claim by the plaintiff and
                    which was on charter and laden with cargo, had been attached by the plaintiff in
                    California. The defendant was facing tremendous commercial pressure not only
                    from the plaintiff but also other bunker suppliers, and its main objective was
                    to quickly secure the release of the vessel. In the circumstances, the corporate
                    guarantee could not constitute an admission of the defendant’s liability
                    to the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     Counsel for the plaintiff Mr Leong also
                    referred to the payments that the defendant made to other suppliers, whose
                    bunkers had been supplied to the defendant’s vessels. Presumably, this
                    constituted an acceptance by the defendant of its liability under similar
                    contracts for the sale of bunkers which it had directly entered into with these
                    suppliers, through the agency of MAL. However, the defendant has explained the
                    reasons behind such payments. The defendant paid not because it accepted that
                    these suppliers were the contractual sellers. Rather, the payments were made
                    because of the commercial pressure, and were necessary to avert arrests of the
                    defendant’s vessels and disruption to its business operations. This was
                    supported by evidence that the defendant had first obtained MAL’s consent
                    before making such payments. MAL in particular had agreed that in respect of the
                    supplies for which the defendant had already paid MAL, MAL would reimburse the
                    defendant for the sums which the defendant had to pay to the bunker suppliers.
                    In addition, the defendant produced letters sent to the suppliers wherein it was
                    made clear that the payments were made under protest and purely to avoid the
                    arrest of the defendant’s vessels. It is also pertinent that the defendant
                    has since commenced legal proceedings in Malaysia against MAL to recover the
                    sums which the defendant had paid to the bunker suppliers on behalf of MAL. More
                    fundamentally, the fact that the defendant made payment to other suppliers in
                    respect of other transactions was not directly relevant to the present
                    dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     Mr Leong also placed some emphasis on the
                    fact that the defendant did not expressly deny liability when the plaintiff had
                    sent demands for payment. He submitted that there was silence in the face of the
                    plaintiff’s demands, as apparently all that the defendant did was to
                    forward the plaintiff’s email (which demanded payment) to MAL, with a
                    one-liner “Plse check whether this is yr supplier??”. But one is
                    hard pressed to see how this could be interpreted as some sort of indication
                    that the defendant accepted its liability to the plaintiff. Albeit a one-liner,
                    what the defendant said was perfectly consistent with its present position that
                    the plaintiff was MAL’s contractual supplier, not the defendant’s.
                    If anything, the brevity of the defendant’s response was indicative of its
                    view that it clearly had nothing to do with the actual procurement of the bunker
                    supplies, a matter solely between MAL and its contractual suppliers.
                    Mr Leong further alluded to the defendant continuing to purchase bunkers
                    from MAL despite the demands for payment from the various bunker suppliers. But
                    there was again a perfectly sensible explanation. It obviously made commercial
                    sense for the defendant to continue to buy bunkers from MAL simply because the
                    US$475 million per metric ton price under the Fixed Term contract was far lower
                    than the market price at the material time. There was no reason for the
                    defendant to stop such purchases just because MAL appeared to have some
                    difficulties paying off its suppliers. This was especially so since, as already
                    mentioned above (at <a href="#p1_64">[64]</a>), MAL had
                    apologised and assured the defendant that it would take on the responsibility of
                    settling all the outstanding claims with the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">
<u>Conclusion on contractual
                claim</u>
</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     The state of the evidence points clearly to
                    the conclusion that MAL had, as the bunker trader, entered into a contract to
                    sell bunkers directly to the defendant. My view is that the plaintiff failed to
                    establish a good arguable case that there was a contractual relationship between
                    the plaintiff and the defendant (established through the agency of MAL) for the
                    sale of bunkers. For this reason, based on my interpretation of the Court of
                    Appeal decision in <em>The Vasiliy Golovnin</em> which
                    requires a claimant to satisfy the court that it has a good arguable case on the
                    merits, the plaintiff is not entitled to invoke the admiralty jurisdiction of
                    the court and accordingly, the admiralty writ should therefore be struck out.
                    Alternatively, if the correct view is that there is no such requirement of a
                    good arguable case on the merits (as the decision in <em>The
                        Eagle Prestige</em> would seem to suggest), the plaintiff’s
                    claim should also be struck out pursuant to O 18 r 19 or the inherent
                    jurisdiction of the court. This is because the claim for payment of bunkers
                    under the alleged contracts between the plaintiff and the defendant is obviously
                    unsustainable and bound to fail: <em>The Osprey</em> [1999]

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The claim in unjust enrichment</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     In relation to the plaintiff’s
                    alternative claim in unjust enrichment, it was common ground that the elements
                    necessary to establish such a cause of action are the following (see Goff &amp;
                    Jones, <em>The Law of Restitution</em> (London: Sweet &amp;
                    Maxwell, 7th ed., 2007) (“Goff &amp; Jones”) at para 1-016;

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_77-p2_a"></a>(a)     The defendant must have been
                        enriched by the receipt of a benefit;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_77-p2_b"></a>(b)     The benefit must have been gained at the expense of the
                        plaintiff; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_77-p2_c"></a>(c)     The benefit was gained in circumstances where it would be unjust for the
                        defendant to retain it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     The plaintiff’s submission, which one
                    should bear in mind was presented in the alternative in the event that the
                    contractual claim fails, was simple enough: first, the defendant had been
                    enriched by the bunkers that were supplied to its vessels; second, such
                    enrichment was clearly at the expense of the plaintiff who supplied the bunkers
                    and was not paid; and third, the enrichment was unjust as the defendant had
                    known of or had induced the plaintiff’s mistaken belief that there were
                    binding contracts between the plaintiff and the defendant for the sale of the
                    bunkers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     Mr Gurbani on behalf of the defendant did
                    not mount a vigorous challenge on whether the ingredients for the cause of
                    action in unjust enrichment were satisfied, although it was submitted at various
                    junctures that the plaintiff had failed to show that the enrichment was
                    “unjust”. The primary line of attack by Mr Gurbani was
                    concerned with what may be termed the limiting principles to a restitutionary
                    claim, as well the defence of change of position. The first limiting principle
                    relied upon by Mr Gurbani is that restitution will not be allowed where the
                    claimant conferred the benefit on the defendant while performing an obligation
                    (including a contractual obligation) which it owed to another. The reason for
                    this is that the court will be slow “to cut across contractual boundaries
                    and redistribute to a stranger, the owner, the risks which the plaintiff
                    implicitly agreed to bear when he contracted with a third party” (see
                    Goff &amp; Jones at para 1-074). In <em>Pan Ocean Shipping Ltd v
                        Credit Corp Ltd</em> [1994] 1 WLR 161, the House of Lords
                    stated (at 166E-G):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">But, quite part from the fact that the existence of a remedy in
                        restitution in such circumstances must still be regarded as a matter of
                        debate, it is always recognised that <em>serious difficulties
                            arise if the law seeks to expand the law of restitution to redistribute
                            risks for which provision has been made under an applicable
                            contract</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     Mr Gurbani pointed out that the
                    plaintiff’s claim based on unjust enrichment was predicated on its
                    contractual claim against the defendant failing. That being the case, if the
                    plaintiff has no contract with the defendant, he argued that this means that the
                    plaintiff must have supplied the bunkers to the defendant’s vessels
                    pursuant to its contract with MAL. The operation of the abovementioned limiting
                    principle, Mr Gurbani’s argued, would hence bar the restitutionary
                    claim, because the plaintiff cannot circumvent the contractual mechanism and
                    specifically its allocation of risk by relying on a claim for unjust enrichment.
                    The problem with Mr Gurbani’s argument, however, lies in the
                    assumption that if the court is of the view that there is no contract between
                    the plaintiff and defendant for the supply of the bunkers, there must therefore
                    be a contract for the supply of the bunkers between the plaintiff and MAL. As
                    Mr Leong rightly pointed out, the latter outcome does not necessarily
                    follow from the former conclusion. The position could well be that there was
                    simply no properly formed contract at all for the supply of the bunkers in
                    question. In particular, the plaintiff’s case was that it had no intention
                    to contract directly with MAL. Since it is not obvious that a contract for the
                    supply of the bunkers existed between the plaintiff and MAL, this limiting
                    principle based on the conferment of the benefit being the performance of a
                    contractual obligation owed to another, cannot justify striking out the
                    plaintiff’s claim for unjust enrichment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     The other contention by Mr Gurbani, which
                    pertains to another limit to a restitutionary claim, was more persuasive. This
                    is the principle of <em>restitutio in integrum</em>, namely
                    that restitution will not be ordered if the defendant cannot be restored to its
                    original position. The underlying basis for this principle is very similar to
                    that underpinning the defence of change of position. The learned authors in Goff
                    &amp; Jones commented thus (at para 1-084):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The essence of the limiting principle that <em>restitutio
                            in integrum</em> must be possible is that it would be inequitable
                        to require the defendant to make restitution if he cannot be restored to his
                        original position. Its application is not confined to the rescission of
                        transactions or to actions for the recovery of money paid. Indeed, a similar
                        principle underlies the defences of change of position…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     The defendant’s most forceful argument
                    was that the plaintiff’s claim in unjust enrichment is bound to fail as
                    the evidence show clearly that the defendant had changed its position following
                    the receipt of the bunkers. The defence of change of position, a relatively
                    recent development of the law typically attributed to the decision of the House
                    of Lords in <em>Lipkin Gorman (a firm) v Karpnale Ltd</em>
                    [1991] 2 AC 548, has been accepted by our Court of Appeal in <em>MCST Plan No. 473 v De Beers Jewellery Pte Ltd</em> [2002]
                    1 SLR(R) 418 (“<em>De Beers</em>”)
                    (at [35]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This was one of the defences overtly accepted in <em>Kleinwort Benson Ltd. Lord Goff</em> said (<a href="#p1_18">[18]</a> <em>supra</em> at 538):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">I recognise that the law of restitution must embody specific defences
                            which are concerned to protect the stability of closed transactions. The
                            defence of <em>change of position</em> is one such
                            defence; the defences of <em>compromise</em>, and
                                <em>settlement of an honest claim</em> (the
                            scope of which is a matter of debate), are others. It is possible that
                            others may be developed ... [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The defence of change of position was recognised - some say,
                        created - in <em>Lipkin Gorman (a firm) v Karpnale
                            Ltd</em> [1991] 2 AC 548. Lord Goff held that "a <em>bona fide</em> change of position should of itself be a
                        good defence". He elaborated (at 580):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">At present I do not wish to state the principle any less broadly than
                            this: that the defence is available to a person whose position has so
                            changed that it would be inequitable in all the circumstances to require
                            him to make restitution, or alternatively to make restitution in full.
                            [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In Seagate Technology Pte Ltd v Goh Han Kim [1994]
                        3 SLR(R) 836 , the court noted that this defence was also
                        available in Singapore. It would seem that there are three elements to the
                        defence:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    The payee has changed his
                            position.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    The change is bona fide.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(c)    It would be inequitable to require him to make
                                restitution or to make restitution in full.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     Mr Gurbani submitted that the defendant
                    had clearly changed its position following the receipt of the bunkers, having
                    expended the bunkers received by the various vessels concerned, and having paid
                    out a substantial sum of money to MAL in full settlement of what the defendant
                    all along believed was its only contractual obligation. Such change of position
                    was <em>bona fide</em> and it would be inequitable to
                    require the defendant to make restitution. The defendant’s submission was
                    that it was patently clear, even at this interlocutory stage, that all three
                    ingredients of the defence, as laid down by the Court of Appeal in <em>De Beers</em>, are satisfied such that the plaintiff’s
                    claim can have no chance of success. In addition, the defendant submitted that
                    it was equally evident that, having made payment to MAL which became insolvent,
                    it would not be able to recover the monies paid. As such, the defendant would
                    not be able to be restored to its original position, and thus the
                    plaintiff’s claim would also fail because of the principle of <em>restitutio in integrum</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     In response to these submissions, the only
                    rebuttal from the plaintiff was to question the <em>bona
                        fides</em> of the defendant’s payment to MAL, an issue which in
                    the plaintiff’s counsel submission was one that ought to be tried. With
                    respect, this argument was misconceived. It must be remembered that the unjust
                    enrichment claim was pleaded in the alternative, meaning it will be considered
                    only in the event that the contractual claim was unsuccessful. If the
                    contractual claim (in particular that aspect of it based on agency by estoppel)
                    has failed, it would necessarily mean that the court has reached the finding
                    that the defendant did not know that MAL was misrepresenting to the bunker
                    industry as to its authority as an agent of the defendant. It ought to follow
                    that there can be no issue that the defendant had therefore paid MAL in good
                    faith.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     Related to the above points is that if this
                    court were to hold the defendant liable in unjust enrichment to the plaintiff,
                    even though the defendant had already paid another party MAL for the bunkers,
                    the result is that the defendant would effectively be exposed to double
                    liability. In <em>Yaku Shin (JB) Sdn Bhd v Panasonic AVC Networks
                        Singapore Pte Ltd</em> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 193, which involved a
                    claim for quantum meruit, Woo Bih Li JC (as he then was) held (at
                    [82]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Nevertheless, I agree that YKJB’s claim on a quantum meruit must
                        fail for the simple reason that this is not a case where PS is unjustly
                        enriched. I have found that PS’s liability for the disputed
                        transactions is to YKM. Furthermore, if PS is also liable to YKJB on a
                        quantum meruit, then it has double liabilities, one to YKM and one to YKJB,
                        which cannot be right. YKJB’s recourse is against YKM whether on an
                        express or implied contract or some other basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     In my view, the plaintiff’s alternative
                    claim for unjust enrichment has no chance of success, because the defendant had
                    in good faith expended the bunkers for its vessels and paid MAL the full
                    contractual price for them. In the circumstances, I accept the submissions by
                    the defendant’s counsel that the limiting principle of <em>restitutio in integrum</em> as well as the defence of change of
                    position are applicable in the present case, such that the claim is doomed to
                    fail. Accordingly, the plaintiff has failed to discharge its burden of showing a
                    good arguable case on the merits for its unjust enrichment claim, which means
                    that the admiralty jurisdiction of the court has not been validly invoked.
                    Further and in the alternative, the claim in unjust enrichment should be struck
                    out under O 18 r 19 or the inherent jurisdiction of the court as being plainly
                    unsustainable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     Having reached the above conclusion that both
                    the plaintiff’s contractual claim and its alternative unjust enrichment
                    claim should be struck out for lack of admiralty jurisdiction as well as being
                    plainly unsustainable under O 18 r 19 or the inherent jurisdiction of the court,
                    it is strictly unnecessary to consider the other arguments by the defendant
                    based on the “one claim one ship” rule and issue estoppel.
                    However, the defendant did seek a specific declaration that the plaintiff is not
                    entitled to invoke the admiralty jurisdiction of the court against the
                    defendant’s vessels, by virtue of the “one claim one ship”
                    principle. Also, comprehensive submissions were made by both parties on these
                    two issues. I shall therefore address them as well.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">“One claim one ship” rule</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     The defendant contended that the plaintiff had
                    invoked the admiralty jurisdiction once in the US Rule B proceedings against one
                    of the defendant’s vessels, the “Bunga Kasturi Lima” and
                    having done so, was precluded from invoking admiralty jurisdiction again in
                    Singapore by the service of the writ of summons in this action on the
                    “Bunga Melati 5”, a sister ship of the “Bunga Kasturi
                    Lima”. In support of this contention, reliance was placed on the
                    “one claim one ship” rule, which is often attributed to the
                    English decision of <em>The Banco</em> [1973] P 137
                        (“<em>The Banco</em>”). In that case, the
                    plaintiff had commenced an action <em>in rem</em> in
                    England and arrested the offending ship as well as six other sister ships as
                    security for the claim. The English Court of Appeal set aside the six sister
                    ship arrests, holding that on a construction of s 3(4) of the UK
                    Administration of Justice Act (which is in <em>pari
                        materia</em> to s 4(4) of the Act), the <em>in
                        rem</em> admiralty jurisdiction of the court could only be invoked
                    against either the offending ship or any other ship in the same ownership, but
                    not against both ships.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     This principle laid down in <em>The Banco</em> has been accepted as part of Singapore law. In
                        <em>The Brunei 602</em>
                    [1983-1984] SLR(R) 306 (“<em>The
                        Brunei</em>”), the court held (at [13]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In our judgment it is now settled law that when a plaintiff brings an
                        action <em>in rem</em> against more than one ship owned
                        by a defendant, the jurisdiction of the court is invoked when the writ is
                        served on one of the named ships and the warrant of arrest is executed. That
                        having been done, the plaintiff cannot go against the other named sister
                        ships and should strike them out of the writ. If he does not do so, the
                        court, on the application of the defendant, will strike the other named
                        sister ships out of the writ and set aside service of the writ and warrant
                        of arrest on the other named sister ship.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     As pointed out earlier (at <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a>), the court’s admiralty jurisdiction
                        <em>in rem</em> may be invoked either by an arrest of
                    the vessel or by service of the <em>in rem</em> writ on the
                    vessel named in the writ, whichever occurred earlier: see <em>The
                        Fierbinti</em> [1994] 3 SLR(R) 574. It was common ground
                    between parties that in considering the application of the “one claim on
                    ship” principle to the present case, the fact that there was no arrest of
                    any vessel but only service of the admiralty writ on the vessel, does not
                    therefore preclude the application of the “one claim one ship”
                    principle.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     However, it can be observed that the actual
                    ruling in <em>The Banco</em> operates within a narrow
                    compass, namely that there can be no multiple invocation of admiralty
                    jurisdiction against more than one ship <em>concurrently in the
                        same jurisdiction</em> for the same claim. Essentially, the
                    defendant’s counsel in the present case was seeking to extend the ambit of
                    the prohibition to a case where there have been earlier <em>in
                        rem</em> proceedings for the same claim commenced in a <em>foreign jurisdiction</em> against another sister ship of the
                    defendant, seemingly regardless of the stage or outcome of those foreign
                    proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     In support of such a wide reading of <em>The Banco</em> principle, Mr Gurbani relied on a Hong
                    Kong court’s decision in <em>The Neptune</em> [1986]
                    HKLR 345 (“<em>The Neptune</em>”). In that
                    case, the plaintiff arrested one of the defendant’s ships in Sri Lanka and
                    obtained security in respect of its claim. The plaintiff then arrested another
                    of the defendant’s ships in Hong Kong, in respect of the same claim for
                    which <em>they had previously obtained security</em> in Sri
                    Lanka. It was held that the plaintiff’s act of arresting the second ship
                    owned by the defendant was in conflict “with the principle in <em>The Banco</em> that only one vessel may be arrested”
                    (at 354).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     On the other hand, the plaintiff’s
                    counsel Mr Leong cited the English case of <em>The
                        Kommunar</em> (No. 2) [1997] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 8 (“<em>The Kommunar</em>”). There, the defendant’s
                    vessel was arrested in England and the plaintiff applied for appraisement and
                    sale of the vessel. One of the defendant’s sister ships was earlier
                    arrested by another claimant in South Africa, and the plaintiff had claimed
                    against the proceeds of sale in South Africa. The defendant sought to set aside
                    the arrest of the vessel in England <em>inter alia</em> on
                    the ground that the arrest was in breach of the “one ship one
                    claim” rule as encapsulated in s 21(8) of the UK Supreme Act, which
                    provided as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where as regards any such claim as is mentioned in section 20(2)(e) to
                        (r), a ship has been served with a writ or arrest in an action <em>in rem</em> brought to enforce that claim, no other ship
                        may be served with a writ or arrested in that or any other action <em>in rem</em> brought to enforce that claim; but this
                        subsection does not prevent the issue, in respect of any one such claim, of
                        a writ naming more than one ship or of two or more writs each naming a
                        different ship.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     Colman J found that on a construction of
                    s 21(8), it was meant merely to give effect to the principle in <em>The Banco</em>, which on its facts was limited to a case of
                    multiple arrests confined to the English ports. The learned judge observed that
                    s 21(8) of their Act did not expressly refer to proceedings outside
                    England. Such express reference to foreign proceedings would have been made, if
                    the intention of the Parliament had been that s 21(8) should have such a
                    wide application. Accordingly, Colman J confined the applicability of
                    s 21(8) to <em>in rem</em> proceedings or prior
                    arrests in England only, and held that the earlier South African proceedings
                    were not a bar to the proceedings before him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     The English approach is largely consistent
                    with the holding of the Federal Court of Australia in <em>Patrick
                        Stevedores No. 2 Pty Ltd v Proceeds of Sale of the Vessel MV
                        “Skulptor Konenkov”</em> (1997) 144 ALR 394
                        (“<em>The Skulptor Konenkov</em>”),
                    another decision relied on by Mr Leong. The claimant in that case had filed
                    a claim in Canada against the sale proceeds one of the defendant’s vessels
                    the “Alexsandr Starostenko”, which had been arrested by another
                    creditor. The issue before the court was whether the claimant, having recovered
                    some amounts in the <em>in rem</em> proceedings in Canada,
                    could proceed for the balance owing to it in the Australian proceedings against
                    another of the defendant’s vessels the “Skulptor Konenkov". This
                    turned on the proper interpretation of s 20(3) of the Australian Admiralty
                    Act 1988, which provided that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where a ship has been arrested in a proceeding commenced as
                        mentioned in section 15, 17, 18 or 19, no other ship shall be arrested in
                        the proceeding unless the first-mentioned ship:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    was invalidly arrested and has been released
                                from arrest;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    was unlawfully removed from the custody of the
                                Marshal...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     The Australian court also considered the
                    International Convention Relating to the Arrest of Seagoing Ships of 1952
                    (“the 1952 Arrest Convention”). Article 3(3) of the 1952 Arrest
                    Convention provides for when the arrest of a vessel in one Contracting State
                    will bar a subsequent arrest in another Contracting State, as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A ship shall not be arrested, nor shall bail or other security be given
                        more than once in any one or more of the jurisdictions of any of the
                        Contracting States in respect of the same maritime claim by the same
                        claimant: and, if a ship has been arrested in any one of such
                        jurisdictions...any subsequent arrest of the ship or of any ship in the same
                        ownership by the same claimant for the same maritime claim shall be set
                        aside...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     Sheppard J commented that while something
                    may be said for the view that s 20(3) should apply extra-territorially to
                    achieve conformity with the effect of the 1952 Arrest Convention, the fact
                    remained that Australia was not a party to the Convention. In the absence of
                    express statutory provision, it was unlikely that the Parliament intended
                    s 20(3) to have extra-territorial effect. There were other difficulties in
                    construing the provision in an expansive manner to encompass foreign
                    proceedings, notable of which was the problem of ascertaining the true nature of
                    the foreign proceedings and whether they were the same as domestic <em>in rem</em> proceedings. The Australian court therefore
                    reached the conclusion that the scope of the prohibition in s 20(3) was
                    limited to Australian <em>in rem</em> proceedings and
                    arrests in Australia.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     The question of whether the “one ship
                    one claim” principle extends to foreign proceedings has not, as counsel
                    informed me, been settled by our courts. In <em>Admiralty Law and
                        Practice</em>, the learned author first referred to the Hong Kong
                    decision of <em>The Neptune</em>, and then to the English
                    and Australian decisions highlighted above, with the following helpful comment
                    on the factors that a Singapore court may have regard in resolving the issue (at
                    148):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Whether a Singapore Court would follow these two decisions [<em>The Kommunar</em> and <em>The Skulptor
                            Konenkov</em>] is a matter of speculation, though when the issue
                        presents itself, the fact that there is no provision equivalent to section
                        21(8) in the High Court (Admiralty Jurisdiction) Act even after its
                        amendment in 2004, the risk of harassment of ships that could potentially
                        arise from arresting them in different jurisdictions over the same claim,
                        possibly giving rise to an abuse of process, any difficulty in the
                        determination of the nature of the foreign proceedings, the possible
                        extra-territorial application of a domestic legislation and the adverse
                        consequences of <em>lis alibi pendens</em> would be
                        some of the relevant factors to consider.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     It is true, as Mr Gurbani argued, that
                    both the English and Australian decisions were based on an interpretation of
                    their specific statutory provisions respectively, which find no equivalent in
                    the Singapore statute. To that extent, the decisions may not be directly
                    relevant to what the position in Singapore ought to be. However, Mr Gurbani
                    went one step further to contend that the absence of an equivalent provision in
                    the local context to s 21(8) of the English legislation (which has been
                    interpreted by the English court to be of purely domestic effect), must mean
                    accordingly that the local position is not to be similarly circumscribed but
                    should extend to foreign proceedings. With respect, the logic of that submission
                    is not apparent. As Mr Leong rightly highlighted, s 21(8) of the
                    English Act merely represents a codification of the principle in <em>The Banco</em>, which has already been accepted as good law
                    by the Singapore courts (see above at <a href="#p1_89">[89]</a>).
                    The fact that the Singapore Parliament chose not to expressly legislate (during
                    the 2004 amendments) for the position in <em>The Banco</em>
                    does not indicate, one way or another, whether the statutory intent is for the
                    principle to be extended to cover prior arrests or invocation of admiralty
                    jurisdiction in foreign courts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    The more pertinent point that can be
                    extracted from the English and Australian authorities relates to the approach
                    adopted, namely that the court would be slow to construe a statutory provision
                    as having extra-territorial effect in the absence of express legislative
                    intention. Also instructive is how the Australian court was influenced by the
                    fact that Australia was not a party to the 1952 Arrest Convention. Singapore
                    similarly is not a party to the Convention. The “one ship one
                    claim” principle is not even statutorily provided for under the Act, and
                    it follows that there obviously is nothing in the Act which expressly extends
                    the scope of its operation to foreign proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    What Mr Gurbani advocated was a blanket
                    prohibition against the invocation of the admiralty jurisdiction of the court as
                    long as there had been prior <em>in rem</em> proceedings in
                    respect of the same claim in a foreign jurisdiction, regardless of the status
                    and outcome of those foreign proceedings. The proposition is not without
                    difficulties. One would think that matters such as whether there are <em>concurrent</em> proceedings before the foreign court and the
                    Singapore court, and whether security had been obtained in the foreign court,
                    should not be irrelevant. In this regard, the facts in <em>The
                        Neptune</em> are quite clearly distinguishable from the situation in
                    the present case. There, the claimant had already obtained security in Sri Lanka
                    and was seeking to arrest another of the defendant’s ship in Hong Kong to
                    obtain <em>further security</em>. The line of English cases
                    referred to in <em>The Neptune</em> similarly concerned
                    subsequent arrests in cases where security had already been provided for the
                    release of the vessel in the first jurisdiction. In contrast, the plaintiff in
                    the present case did not actually obtain any security in the US Rule B
                    proceedings, which have since also come to an end. Quite evidently, there is a
                    stronger argument that it is oppressive and an abuse of process for the claimant
                    to be initiating concurrent proceedings in different jurisdictions and obtaining
                    security multiple times.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    A further problem with extending the scope
                    of the “one ship one claim” principle to foreign proceedings is
                    the difficulty of ascertaining the precise nature of those proceedings. Indeed,
                    under the blanket approach advocated by Mr Gurbani, it would seem that
                    whether a claimant is prevented from invoking the admiralty jurisdiction of the
                    Singapore courts will depend critically on whether the earlier foreign
                    proceedings can be characterised as the same as, or at least sufficiently
                    similar to, local <em>in rem</em> proceedings. Yet, this
                    inquiry, which raises the question of foreign law, cannot be expected to be
                    straightforward. It is noteworthy that in the <em>The
                        Kommunar</em> and <em>The Skulptor Konenkov</em>,
                    the English and Australian courts avoided this tricky comparative exercise, and
                    instead proceeded on the assumption that the foreign proceedings were the same
                    as under their domestic laws. In the case before me, both parties called experts
                    which rendered opinions that are, if I may say so, equally persuasive, yet
                    reaching opposite conclusions. The defendant’s experts explained that the
                    Rule B proceedings in the US are very much in the nature of a sister ship
                        <em>in rem</em> action as known under Singapore law,
                    because they essentially serve the same two key functions, namely to compel the
                    defendant to appear and answer the plaintiff’s claim by subjecting his
                    property within the court’s territorial jurisdiction to the court’s
                    control, and for the purpose of obtaining security for the claim. On the other
                    hand, the plaintiff’s expert, while accepting that there are quite a
                    number of similarities between Rule B attachment in the US and <em>in rem</em> proceedings in Singapore, took the view that
                    there are fundamental differences which indicate that the Rule B procedure is
                        <em>in personam</em> in nature, such as the absence of
                    protection against change of ownership and the lack of secured interest in the
                    property attached. The competing opinions, which were both supported by cogent
                    arguments, are illustrative of the difficulties that will be faced by the court
                    in determining whether the foreign proceedings should be regarded as being the
                    equivalent of Singapore <em>in rem</em> proceedings.
                    Indeed, the answer may often be a matter of degree, and it would seem odd for
                    the issue of whether a plaintiff is precluded from invoking the admiralty
                    jurisdiction of the Singapore court to turn on something as malleable as the
                    degree of similarity between the foreign proceedings and <em>in
                        rem</em> proceedings in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    Bearing in mind that this court’s
                    admiralty jurisdiction is derived from the Act, and the general principle that a
                    statute should not be construed to have extra-territorial effect in the absence
                    of express provision to the contrary, I would hesitate to extend the scope of
                    the “one ship one claim” rule (as accepted in <em>The Brunei</em>) beyond the context of multiple arrests or service of
                    writs on ships in Singapore. If the Parliament intended for <em>in rem</em> proceedings in foreign jurisdictions to be a bar to an
                    action <em>in rem</em> in Singapore, the Act would have
                    contained express provision to that effect. The conclusion is all the more so if
                    regard is had to the difficulties that would be faced by the court if it is
                    required to determine whether the foreign proceedings in question should be
                    characterised as being of the same nature as <em>in
                        rem</em> proceedings in Singapore for the purpose of triggering the
                    prohibition. Even if the “one ship one claim” rule can be extended
                    to cover earlier foreign proceedings, it should not be a blanket ban as
                    propounded by the defendant in the present case. One must not lose sight of the
                    mischief behind the “one claim one ship” rule in <em>The Banco</em>, which is in essence to prevent a claimant
                    from harassing the defendant and abusing the court process. Whether that is so,
                    in the context where a claimant seeks to invoke the Singapore court’s
                    admiralty jurisdiction when there already exists prior foreign proceedings, must
                    depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. The important factors to
                    consider should include whether the foreign proceedings are still pending and
                    the potential adverse effects of <em>lis alibi
                    pendens</em>, whether the claimant had already obtained security in the
                    foreign proceedings and is seeking to obtain further security, and the reasons
                    why the claimant is bringing a second <em>in rem</em>
                    action in Singapore. Thus, it cannot be of no significance in the present case
                    that the proceedings in the US had already come to an end, and that the
                    plaintiff had not managed to obtain any security for its claim from the US
                    proceedings. For the above reasons, had it been necessary for my decision, I
                    would not have struck out the plaintiff’s action based on the “one
                    claim one ship” rule. I therefore also declined to declare that the
                    plaintiff is not entitled to invoke the admiralty jurisdiction of the court
                    against the defendant’s vessels on account of the “one claim one
                    ship” principle.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue estoppel</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    It remains to address the arguments on issue
                    estoppel. The defendant submitted that the plaintiff’s allegations of
                    breach of contract and unjust enrichment had been considered and determined by
                    the US courts. As such, the plaintiff was estopped from litigating the same
                    issues before the Singapore court, such that the plaintiff’s action herein
                    should be therefore dismissed as being frivolous, vexatious or an abuse of
                    process.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    The defendant’s contention was
                    essentially based on the doctrine of <em>res judicata</em>,
                    which can encompass two concepts. A foreign judgment may give rise to a
                        <em>cause of action estoppel</em> which prevents a
                    party from asserting or denying as against the other party, the existence of a
                    cause of action, the non-existence or existence of which has already been
                    determined by the foreign court. By comparison, a foreign judgment may also
                    create an issue estoppel, which will prevent a matter of fact or law necessarily
                    decided by the foreign court from being re-litigated (see <em>Dicey &amp; Morris on Conflict of Laws</em> (London: Sweet &amp;
                    Maxwell, 14th ed., 2006) at 14-027). The distinction is succinctly borne out in
                    the following statement by Sundaresh Menon JC (as he then was) in <em>Goh Nellie v Goh Lian Teck</em> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 453

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If the previous decision does not determine the cause of action sued on in
                        the later proceedings, that decision may still be invoked as having
                        determined, as an essential step in its reasoning, an issue that proves
                        relevant in the later case and further consideration of that issue maybe
                        foreclosed…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    In the present case, the defendant’s
                    submission was based on issue estoppel as opposed to cause of action estoppel,
                    presumably because it accepted that there was no actual hearing and resolution
                    by the US courts on the substantive causes of action of the plaintiff in
                    contract and unjust enrichment. The only rulings in the US proceedings were made
                    in the context of the defendant’s motion to vacate the attachment of the
                    defendant’s vessel, the motion succeeding both at first instance and on
                    appeal.</p>

                        the foreign court must be the same as that arising in the proceedings at
                        hand.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    There was no dispute that the US courts were
                    of competent jurisdiction, and that the same parties were involved in the US
                    proceedings as in the present case. Mr Gurbani argued on behalf of the
                    defendant that the issues before the court in both sets of proceedings were also
                    identical, which related to whether the defendant was liable to the plaintiff
                    either for breach of contracts for the supply of bunkers, or alternatively in
                    unjust enrichment. Insofar as the plaintiff’s assertion was that the
                    specific submissions on agency by estoppel and the admission of liability (by
                    virtue of the corporate guarantee) were not canvassed before the US courts, the
                    defendant disagreed, and in any event pointed out that these were matters which
                    ought to have been raised such that the plaintiff was still precluded from
                    raising them in the present proceedings due to the wider conception of abuse of
                    process. I agree generally with Mr Gurbani’s submission that there is
                    an identity of issues in the two sets of proceedings, save that it is crucial to
                    remind ourselves that these same issues were decided in the US proceedings
                        <em>in the context of a jurisdictional challenge at an
                        interlocutory stage to vacate the attachment order</em> over the
                    defendant’s vessel. This has important implications from the perspective
                    of considering whether the US judgments are to be regarded as final and
                    conclusive on the merits, which in my view is the crux of the matter in relation
                    to the point on issue estoppel.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether US judgments final and conclusive on the merits</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    In <em>The Sennar (No.
                        2)</em> [1985] 1 WLR 490 (“<em>The
                        Sennar</em>”), Lord Diplock explained what constituted a final
                    and conclusive judgment on the merits (at 494):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is often said that the final judgment of the foreign court must be "on
                        the merits." The moral overtones which this expression tends to conjure up
                        may make it misleading. What it means in the context of judgments delivered
                        by courts of justice is that the court has held that it has Jurisdiction to
                        adjudicate upon an issue raised in the cause of action to which the
                        particular set of facts give rise; and that <em>its judgment
                            on that cause of action is one that cannot be varied, re-opened or set
                            aside by the court that delivered it or any other court of co-ordinate
                            Jurisdiction although it may be subject to appeal</em> to a court
                        of higher Jurisdiction. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    In <em>The “Vasiliy
                        Golovnin”</em> [2007] 4 SLR(R) 277, Tan Lee
                    Meng J similarly held (at [42]) that “[f]or a judgment to be
                    conclusive and final, it must be one that cannot be reopened by the court that
                    pronounced it”. The learned judge also endorsed (at [40]) the following
                    comment made by Lord Brandon of Oakbrook in <em>The
                        Sennar</em> on when a judgment is with respect to “the merits
                    of the case”:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Looking at the matter negatively a decision on procedure alone is not a
                        decision on the merits. Looking at the matter positively a decision on the
                        merits is a decision which establishes certain facts as proved or not in
                        dispute; states what are the relevant principles of law applicable to such
                        facts; and expresses a conclusion with regard to the effect of applying
                        those principles to the factual situation concerned. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    Mr Gurbani submitted that in order to
                    obtain a Rule B attachment in the US, one of the requirements which a claimant
                    has to satisfy is that it has a <em>prima facie</em>
                    maritime claim against the defendant, and this necessarily involves an
                    examination of the merits of the claim. In the US proceedings, the California
                    District Court had, after considering the evidence in the form of witness
                    declarations, and after hearing full arguments, held that the plaintiff had
                    failed to establish such a <em>prima facie</em> case for
                    breach of contract and unjust enrichment. The decision was upheld, after further
                    comprehensive written submissions and oral arguments, by the United States Court
                    of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. In the circumstances, Mr Gurbani argued,
                    the US judgments must be considered final and conclusive on the merits. In
                    Mr Gurbani’s submission, it is immaterial that the US decisions were
                    made in the interlocutory context of considering a jurisdictional
                    challenge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    It indeed appears to be generally accepted
                    now that it is possible for a ruling made at the interlocutory stage to
                    nonetheless qualify as being final and conclusive on the merits, for the purpose
                    of raising an issue estoppel. In particular, Mr Gurbani cited the decisions
                    in <em>The Sennar</em>, <em>Tracomin S.A. v
                        Sudan Oil Seeds Co Ltd</em> [1983] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 560 and
                        <em>Desert Sun Loan Corp v Hill</em> [1996] 2 All ER
                    847 in support of such a proposition. In the context of considering the
                    recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments, it has also been commented
                    that “decisions on jurisdictional applications or challenges, which may
                    well be interlocutory in the foreign court, may sometimes be seen as final and
                    conclusive” (see Adrian Briggs and Peter Rees, <em>Civil
                        Jurisdiction and Judgments</em> (London: Informa, 5th ed,
                    2009)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    However, it is critical to appreciate the
                    precise nature of the determination made by the courts in such cases that has
                    been regarded as final and conclusive. In <em>The
                        Sennar</em>, the Dutch court had dismissed an action on the ground
                    that a jurisdiction agreement required the claimant to bring its action in Sudan
                    instead. It was the Dutch court’s holding on the effect and validity of
                    the jurisdictional agreement that was regarded as being final and conclusive on
                    the merits. In <em>Tracomin S.A. v Sudan Oil Seeds Co
                        Ltd</em>, it was the decision of the Swiss court determining if an
                    arbitration clause had been incorporated into the contract. It can be seen that
                    the common thread in these cases is that the ruling in question, even though
                    made at the interlocutory stage, is one that cannot be reopened or varied by the
                    court. This is because issues relating to the applicability or effect of
                    jurisdictional clauses and arbitration clauses, by their very nature, are to be
                    determined and disposed of once and for all at the jurisdictional stage. Whether
                    a jurisdictional clause means that a matter should be stayed in favour of the
                    contractual forum is clearly an issue that will not be revisited at trial. The
                    very function of such jurisdiction clauses is to address the antecedent question
                    at the preliminary stage of where the litigation should be conducted. Once a
                    jurisdiction clause is held to apply or not to apply during the jurisdictional
                    stage, it will have little purpose to serve beyond that and during the trial on
                    the merits. Indeed, this is the reason why persuasive academic arguments have
                    been made that questions as to the existence and scope of jurisdictional clauses
                    should be established to the requisite standard of certainty in civil
                    proceedings (<em>ie</em> on a balance of probabilities)
                    even at the interlocutory stage: see Stephen Pitel &amp; Jonathan de Vries,
                    “The Standard of Proof for Jurisdiction Clauses” (2008) 46
                    Canadian Business Law Journal 66. The same can be said of a holding that an
                    arbitration clause covers the dispute such that the matter should proceed for
                    arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    As noted by the learned commentators of
                        <em>Dicey &amp; Morris on the Conflict of Laws</em>
                    (London: Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 13th ed., 2000) at para 14-030, the key to
                    understanding how issue estoppel was held to arise in these cases is that the
                    issue in question, even though it might be procedural in nature, had been
                    determined by the court with finality and the order made in respect of that
                    issue was not merely provisional in nature:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The issue determined by the foreign court in <em>The
                            Sennar</em> (No. 2), was that a jurisdiction agreement bound the
                        claimant to bring his claim in Sudan, and as such may have been considered
                        as being procedural in nature. But it was <em>the final
                            conclusion of the foreign court on the point which it had been asked to
                            decide</em>, namely, whether the exclusive jurisdiction agreement
                        applied to a claim framed in tort; and it was on this account held capable
                        of supporting an estoppel against the claimant upon the issue. In <em>Desert Sun Loan Corp. v Hill</em>, the Court of Appeal
                        accepted in principle that issue estoppel could arise from an interlocutory
                        judgment of a foreign court on <em>a procedural,
                            non-substantive issue</em> where there was express submission of
                        the issue in question to the foreign court, and <em>the
                            specific issue of fact was raised before and decided, finally and not
                            just provisionally, by the court</em>. It was emphasised that
                        before according preclusive effect to any such finding by a foreign court
                        the need for caution should be borne in mind. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    Returning to the present case, the US courts
                    had dealt with the issues of whether the defendant was liable to the plaintiff
                    for breach of contract or unjust enrichment, only for the purpose of deciding
                    whether the attachment order should be vacated, and <em>only to
                        the extent that the plaintiff had failed to establish a prima facie case
                        based on the state of the evidence before the court</em>. To my mind,
                    this was not a final conclusion, and it clearly remained open for the US courts
                    to reach a different view on the same issues at the subsequent stage of
                    considering the actual motion to dismiss the Verified Complaint. This is clearly
                    reflected by the following comments of the first instance judge from the
                    transcripts of proceedings:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">On the plaintiff’s breach of contract cause of action, there is at
                        least at this stage insufficient support for a breach of contract cause of
                        action in light of the fact that <em>at least at this stage
                            the evidence is insufficient to make a prima facie showing of a contract
                            between the plaintiff and the defendant</em>…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…my ruling does not address the motion to dismiss which will be
                        heard at a later time…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Similarly, the court finds that the plaintiff did not meet its burden with
                        respect to the quantum meruit cause of action. <em>I
                            recognise that plaintiff is not required to prove its case at this time,
                            and my ruling only pertains to this hearing</em>…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Similarly, the judgment of the US appeal court was concerned with
                    whether the lower court properly vacated the attachment, and was limited to a
                    consideration of whether the plaintiff had failed to show it had a valid
                        <em>prima facie</em> breach of contract or unjust
                    enrichment against the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    It seems clear that the US courts did not
                    actually make any conclusive findings or establish any facts as proved, at any
                    rate not to the requisite full civil standard of proof. It follows that the
                    courts did not express any conclusion with regard to the effect of applying
                    relevant legal principles to <em>the proven</em> facts of
                    the case. Adopting the approach of Lord Brandon of Oakbrook in <em>The Sennar</em> (see above at <a href="#p1_110">[110]</a>), it may therefore be said that the judgments were not
                    “on the merits”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    It is also telling that a similar position
                    appears to have in fact been adopted by the defendant itself in the US
                    proceedings. The defendant’s Answering Brief on appeal to the Ninth
                    Circuit Court of Appeals stated that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…the District Court expressly recognised that the Rule E(4)(f)
                        hearing was not for a final determination of the merits of
                        Equatorial’s underlying claim, and the Court did not purport to make
                        such a final determination…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    In my opinion, the findings of the US courts
                    on the issues relating to the defendant’s liability in contract or unjust
                    enrichment to the plaintiff were clearly capable of being re-opened and
                    reconsidered by the court in subsequent proceedings to determine the substantive
                    causes of action. In particular, the court, if it subsequently heard the actual
                    motion to dismiss the Verified Complaint, would clearly not have been bound by
                    the earlier findings made in the context of determining whether the attachment
                    of the vessel should be vacated. That being the case, my view is that the US
                    rulings in question are not to be regarded as final and conclusive on the merits
                    in respect of those same issues which are before this court, and accordingly no
                    issue estoppel arises. As such, were it material to my decision, the
                    defendant’s argument based on issue estoppel would not have been
                    successful in striking out the plaintiff’s claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    To recapitulate, the admiralty jurisdiction
                    of this court was not properly invoked because the plaintiff failed to discharge
                    its burden of establishing a good arguable case on the merits of its claims in
                    contract and unjust enrichment. In addition, the plaintiff’s claims were
                    also shown to be plainly and obviously unsustainable. As a result, the
                    defendant’s application to strike out the writ of summons was allowed,
                    both on the basis of lack of jurisdiction, as well as pursuant to the
                    court’s powers to strike out an action under O 18 r 19 or its inherent
                    jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    Both parties preferred that the costs of the
                    application be agreed if not taxed, and I so ordered.</p>
