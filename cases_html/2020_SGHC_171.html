Mr Hua also claimed that the proposed document was required for Wanjia’s internal purposes.

The withholding tax amount was calculated by Wanjia to be US$140,000. Wanjia claimed that it had already made payment on behalf of SBI to the local tax bureau at Jiangyin for the amount of US$140,000. It also stated that it “guarantee[d]” that SBI’s liability to pay withholding tax would not exceed US$175,000, and that any excess would be paid by Wanjia.

Accordingly, it was reasonably foreseeable that a finding by the defendant that there had been improper conduct on the part of certain officer(s) of the company would have led to actions being taken against the named person(s).

This mandate was not specifically targeted at investigating the plaintiff’s conduct, as he was not the only individual involved in these transactions.

It was not, and could not have been within the defendant’s reasonable contemplation that SBI would take action against the plaintiff in particular.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 In my view, the threshold requirement of factual foreseeability was satisfied in the present case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 In arriving at this conclusion, I was mindful of the Court of Appeal’s observation in <span class="font-italic">Spandeck</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [75], quoting <span class="font-italic">Sunny Metal &amp; Engineering Pte Ltd v Ng </span><span class="font-italic">Khim Ming Eric </span>[2007] 1 SLR(R) 853 at [55]) that the criterion of factual foreseeability “will<span class="font-italic"> almost always be satisfied</span>, simply because of its very nature and the very wide nature of the ‘net’ it necessarily casts” [emphasis in original]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 A fairly exceptional case in which factual foreseeability was not found to be satisfied is <span class="font-italic">Ngiam</span><span class="font-italic"> Kong Seng and another v Lim Chiew Hock </span>[2008] 3 SLR(R) 674. In that case, the first and second appellants – who were husband and wife – sued the respondent for negligence in causing a traffic accident which left the first appellant severely injured. The second appellant alleged that the respondent had failed to inform her of the severity of the first appellant’s injuries and of the respondent’s involvement in the accident; the respondent had allegedly represented himself to be a helpful bystander who had rendered assistance to the first appellant, thereby causing the second appellant to develop feelings of gratitude towards the respondent. After the second appellant found out that the respondent had allegedly been responsible for the accident, she claimed to have suffered from major depression and suicidal tendencies due to the respondent’s “betrayal”. The Court of Appeal rejected the second appellant’s claim and held (at [132]) that, notwithstanding the “naturally wide ambit” of the requirement of factual foreseeability, that requirement was not satisfied because it “boggle[d] the imagination and stretche[d] the realms of reality” that “the mere communication of the information in question without more could result in harm to” the second appellant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 In the present case, the prospect that the defendant’s negligence could cause harm to the plaintiff was plainly not an extreme fanciful possibility. I agreed with the plaintiff that the defendant’s reliance on the broad scope of its mandate did not assist its case. From its own investigations, the defendant must have been aware that the plaintiff was one of the key parties involved in the NPT Transactions. The defendant also expressly admitted to having knowledge that its findings would be made known to SBI’s shareholders during the EGM.

</div>
</div> Therefore, it ought to have been within the defendant’s contemplation that any negligence on its part in investigating the NPT Transactions and preparing the Executive Summary might potentially cause harm to the plaintiff. It could also be reasonably foreseen that the plaintiff would suffer harm, including reputational harm, if the PwC Report and/or Executive Summary contained factually inaccurate or misleading information pertaining to the plaintiff’s conduct or involvement in the NPT Transactions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Moreover, the defendant’s argument that SBI could have taken “any number of actions” against the plaintiff was unpersuasive. In <span class="font-italic">Spandeck</span>, the Court of Appeal clarified (at [89]) that the plaintiff need not establish that the defendant ought to have foreseen the specific kind of harm which was eventually caused to the plaintiff, and that proof of factual foreseeability of harm in general<span class="font-italic"> </span>would suffice. The threshold criterion of factual foreseeability was thus clearly made out in the present case. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Legal proximity </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 The requirement of legal proximity focuses on the court’s assessment of the closeness of the relationship between the parties. In making this assessment, the court can consider the concepts of physical, circumstantial and causal proximity, as well as the “twin criteria of voluntary assumption of responsibility and reliance”. As far as possible, these concepts should be applied by first “analogising the facts of the case for decision with those of decided cases, if such exist” (<span class="font-italic">Spandeck</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [81]–[82]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 It was therefore necessary to determine, as a preliminary matter, whether the facts of the present case were analogous to those of any relevant previously-decided authorities. In this regard, the parties referred me to three distinct groups of cases.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The plaintiff submitted that the present case was factually similar to the Canadian cases of <span class="font-italic">Correia et al v </span><span class="font-italic">Canac Kitchens et al </span>(2008) 91 O.R. (3d) 353 (“<span class="font-italic">Correia</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">Hill v Hamilton-Wentworth Regional Police Services Board </span>[2007] 3 S.C.R. 129 (“<span class="font-italic">Hill</span>”), both of which involved investigators who were held to owe a duty of care to the suspects under investigation. I will refer to these cases collectively as the “Negligent Investigation Cases”.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Alternatively, the plaintiff asserted that the present case was analogous to <span class="font-italic">Spring v Guardian Assurance Plc </span>[1995] 2 AC 296 (“<span class="font-italic">Spring</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">Ramesh s/o Krishnan v AXA Life Insurance Singapore Pte Ltd </span>[2015] 4 SLR 1 (“<span class="font-italic">Ramesh</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC)</span>”), in which the High Court held that an employer who was providing a reference for an existing or former employee to another potential employer owed a duty of care to the employee being referred. I will refer to these cases collectively as the “Negligent Employer Referral Cases”.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Conversely, the defendant contended that the present case was analogous to cases involving auditors who were found not to owe a duty of care to shareholders and/or potential investors who relied upon their audited statements to make investments. These included cases such as <span class="font-italic">Caparo Industries </span><span class="font-italic">Plc. v Dickman and Others </span>[1990] 2 AC 605 (“<span class="font-italic">Caparo</span>”), <span class="font-italic">Anthony </span><span class="font-italic">and Others v Wright and Others </span>[1995] 1 BCLC 236 (“<span class="font-italic">Anthony</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">Ikumene</span><span class="font-italic"> Singapore Pte Ltd and another v Leong Chee Leng (trading as Elizabeth Leong &amp; Co) </span>[1993] 2 SLR(R) 480. Reliance was also placed on <span class="font-italic">Resource Piling </span><span class="font-italic">Pte Ltd v Geospecs Pte Ltd </span>[2014] 1 SLR 485 (“<span class="font-italic">Resource Piling</span>”), where a soil investigator who was engaged by a developer to produce borehole logs was held not to owe a duty of care to a contractor who subsequently used the logs to price a tender. I will refer to these cases collectively as the “Negligent Advice Affecting Third Party Cases”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 In my view, the two lines of cases relied upon by the plaintiff were inapplicable to the present context. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 In relation to the Negligent Investigation Cases, it was pertinent to note that, as the defendant rightly pointed out, these cases established a new<span class="font-italic"> </span>tort – <span class="font-italic">viz</span>., the tort of negligent investigation – which presently appears to exist only in Canada and, at any rate, has not been accepted as law in Singapore. In <span class="font-italic">Hill</span>, the Supreme Court of Canada accepted for the first time that police officers owe a duty of care to their suspects being investigated, and in <span class="font-italic">Correia</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the Ontario Court of Appeal extended that established duty to private investigators.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Secondly, both <span class="font-italic">Correia </span>and <span class="font-italic">Hill </span>emphasised the particularised<span class="font-italic"> </span>nature of the relationship between the investigator and the suspect in those cases. In <span class="font-italic">Hill</span>, the plaintiff had been identified as a “particularised” suspect in a series of robberies. In other words, he had been “singled out” as an <span class="font-italic">individual</span> for investigation and “was no longer merely one person in a pool of potential suspects” (at [33]). Similarly, in <span class="font-italic">Correia</span>, the private investigation firm in question had been tasked to investigate a few specific individuals, and had wrongly identified the plaintiff as one of these suspects. In contrast, the defendant’s investigations in the present case were targeted at a series of <span class="font-italic">transactions</span>, namely SBI’s acquisition and subsequent disposal of NPT shares. They were not targeted at any particular individual. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Thirdly, the plaintiffs in <span class="font-italic">Correia </span>and <span class="font-italic">Hill </span>had extremely high personal interests at stake. This was explicitly identified as a consideration which supported the existence of a proximate relationship (see <span class="font-italic">Hill </span>at [34]; <span class="font-italic">Correia </span>at [29]). In <span class="font-italic">Hill</span>, it was noted that the plaintiff had a “critical personal interest” in the conduct of the investigation as “his freedom, his reputation and how he may spend a good portion of his life” were at stake (at [34]). Likewise, in <span class="font-italic">Correia</span>, the private investigators were assumed to have carried out a “complete investigation”, and the identified employees were to be dismissed and <span class="font-italic">immediately </span>handed over to the police for arrest (at [25]). In my assessment, the personal interests at stake in this case were not as “critical” or extreme as those highlighted in <span class="font-italic">Hill </span>and <span class="font-italic">Correia</span>. While it was admittedly foreseeable that the defendant’s negligence might cause the plaintiff to suffer reputational harm, the defendant’s findings could not result in the immediate deprivation of the plaintiff’s liberty or ineluctably give rise to criminal liability on the plaintiff’s part. <span class="font-italic">Hill </span>and <span class="font-italic">Correia </span>were thus distinguishable on their facts and context. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 The Negligent Employer Referral Cases were likewise inapplicable to the present case. In <span class="font-italic">Ramesh</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC)</span>, George Wei JC (as he then was) stressed (at [253]) that an employer who provides an employment reference for an ex-employee does so “having <span class="font-italic">special knowledge </span>of the ex-employee, for the assistance and in the service of the ex-employee, and with the <span class="font-italic">express or implied authority</span> of the ex-employee” [emphasis added]. This analysis was subsequently endorsed on appeal in <span class="font-italic">Ramesh s/o Krishnan v AXA Life Insurance Singapore Pte Ltd </span>[2016] 4 SLR 1124<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [58]. Likewise, in <span class="font-italic">Spring</span>, Lord Goff stressed that “[t]he employer is possessed of special knowledge, derived from his experience of the employee’s character, skill and diligence in the performance of his duties while working for the employer” (at 319E). In the present case, the defendant cannot be said to have had “special knowledge” of the plaintiff’s involvement in the NPT Transactions as it was ultimately dependent on SBI and its employees for such information. It would also be disingenuous to suggest that the defendant had acted “in the service of” or “with the express or implied authority” of the plaintiff. As such, I found that the Negligent Employer Referral Cases were of limited relevance here. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 In my view, the Negligent Advice Affecting Third Party Cases referred to by the plaintiff bore much closer resemblance to the facts of this case. All of these cases involved third-party professionals who, like the defendant in the present case, were engaged by entities <span class="font-italic">other than the claimants</span> to advise on issues which affected various parties<span class="font-italic">, including (but not limited to) the claimants. </span>I did not see any reason why the principles in these cases could not be extended beyond the auditor-investor context. Indeed, the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Resource Piling </span>had applied the principles in <span class="font-italic">Caparo </span>to a case involving a contractor and a soil investigator.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Correspondingly, I agreed with the defendant’s submission that, per <span class="font-italic">Caparo</span>,<span class="font-italic"> Anthony </span>and <span class="font-italic">Resource Piling</span>, the burden lay on the plaintiff to prove the existence of a “special relationship” between himself and the defendant in order to establish that the requisite legal proximity was made out (see <span class="font-italic">Caparo </span>at 649; <span class="font-italic">Anthony </span>at 239; <span class="font-italic">Resource Piling </span>at [38]). In ascertaining whether such a “special relationship” exists, courts have traditionally focused on the following factors: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the defendant in rendering professional advice to his client assumed a responsibility to a third party, <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>the claimant, for the rendering of that advice (<span class="font-italic">Anthony </span>at 239; <span class="font-italic">Resource Piling </span>at [26]); and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b)   the defendant knew or intended that the claimant would rely on that advice (<span class="font-italic">Caparo </span>at 620–621; <span class="font-italic">Anthony </span>at 239). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 These factors, which I shall refer to as “voluntary assumption of responsibility” and “reliance” respectively, have been subsumed under (and are thus wholly compatible with) the <span class="font-italic">Spandeck</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>framework (see [66] above). Both factors were evidently absent on the facts of this case. I elaborate further on my reasoning below. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Voluntary assumption of responsibility </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 In my view, the defendant could not be said to have voluntarily assumed responsibility to the plaintiff. The factual contractual matrix was of critical importance. To state what was perhaps obvious, the defendant was not engaged by the plaintiff but by SBI’s Audit Committee. It was thus difficult to see how the defendant could have voluntarily assumed responsibility to the plaintiff, who was a third party to the contract between SBI and the defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Furthermore and in any event, the law is clear that “an express disclaimer of responsibility [can] prevent a tortious duty of care from arising, by negating the proximity sought to be established by the concept of an ‘assumption of responsibility’” (see <span class="font-italic">Go Dante Yap v Bank Austria </span><span class="font-italic">Creditanstalt AG </span>[2011] 4 SLR 559 at [38]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 In the present case, the defendant expressly disclaimed responsibility for its investigation and report to any person <span class="font-italic">except </span>SBI’s Audit Committee. The relevant provision is Clause 4.6 of the Engagement Letter, which stated:

</div> </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Our Report is intended for, and only for, the benefit of the Audit Committee and the Sponsor and for no other purpose. <span class="font-italic">We do not accept or assume responsibility for our work, and our Report thereof, to anyone except the Audit Committee.</span> Our work will not be planned or conducted in contemplation of reliance by any third party. Therefore, items of possible interest to a third party will not be specifically addressed and matters may exist that would be assessed differently by a third party. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 The plaintiff pointed out, quite correctly, that it was not bound by Clause 4.6 since it was not privy to the contract between SBI and the defendant. Be that as it may, I found that Clause 4.6 was nevertheless relevant to the extent that it demonstrated that the defendant did not, factually speaking, voluntarily assume any responsibility to the plaintiff. The existence of this clause thus weighed heavily against a finding that the plaintiff and the defendant shared a “special relationship”. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Reliance</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 As for the criterion of reliance, the plaintiff submitted that, although he did not “rely” on the defendant’s report in the same way that a commissioning party would have, he nevertheless “depended” upon the defendant’s exercise of care in the compilation and presentation of the report. With respect, the distinction that the plaintiff sought to draw between the concepts of “reliance” and “dependence” was not made clear. It appeared that the plaintiff may have been alluding to Lord Browne-Wilkinson’s observation in <span class="font-italic">White </span><span class="font-italic">and another v Jones and another </span>[1995] 2 AC 207 (“<span class="font-italic">White</span>”) at 271H–272A that “[i]f B is unaware of the fact that A has assumed to act in B’s affairs … B cannot possibly have relied on A. What is important is not that A knows that B is consciously relying on A, but A knows that B’s economic well-being is <span class="font-italic">dependent </span>upon A’s careful conduct of B’s affairs” [emphasis added]. However, local courts have not endorsed this concept of “dependence” as a relevant factor in the proximity analysis. The extent to which the concept of “dependence” featured in the outcome of the decision in <span class="font-italic">White </span>is also uncertain – indeed, the Singapore Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Anwar Patrick Adrian and another </span><span class="font-italic">v Ng Chong &amp; Hue LLC and another </span>[2014] 3 SLR 761 at [160] analysed <span class="font-italic">White </span>as a case which “treat[ed] the concept of assumption of responsibility as a legal test, in and of itself” [emphasis in original omitted]. For these reasons, I declined to accord any significance to the defendant’s submissions on this point. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 Viewing the circumstances of the case in the round, I was not satisfied that the plaintiff had reasonably relied on the Executive Summary. As the defendant pointed out, the plaintiff’s pleaded case was not that<span class="font-italic"> </span>he would rely on the Executive Summary, but that SBI’s shareholders would rely on the Executive Summary in making a decision as to whether to support him. There was no direct relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant, much less a relationship of <span class="font-italic">reliance</span>. Furthermore, the plaintiff had clearly chosen to play no part in the preparation of the PwC Report or Executive Summary despite having been invited to give his input on the same. As I shall further explain at [135] below, the plaintiff was unable to provide a credible explanation for his professed inability to respond to the defendant’s inquiries. He did not even attempt to ask for more time, if indeed he felt that he had been given insufficient time to respond. The plain inference was that he had simply refused to respond, and he had to be responsible for the consequences of his own choice. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 For the aforementioned reasons, I found that the requirement of legal proximity was not satisfied. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Policy considerations </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 The plaintiff asserted that policy considerations favoured the imposition of a duty of care in the present case. In particular, there was a “pressing public interest” to ensure that corporate investigators such as the defendant were not negligent in conducting investigations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 The defendant argued in turn that the following policy considerations militated against the imposition of a duty of care. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Firstly, actions for reputational loss ordinarily fall within the realm of the law of defamation. Imposing a duty of care in this class of cases would cut across related areas of tort law, and deprive defendants of the protection that those laws specifically provide.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Secondly, the imposition of a duty of care might lead to a potential conflict between the defendant’s contractual duties towards its principal (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, SBI) and its alleged duty towards the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Thirdly, the imposition of a duty of care might cause a chilling effect by disincentivising professional firms from reviewing matters fully and reporting conclusions forthrightly and frankly.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Fourthly, part of the plaintiff’s case appeared to be founded on the tort of conspiracy, which was not pleaded by the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 I was unable to see the relevance of argument (d) above. Even if I took the defendant’s case at its highest and accepted that the plaintiff was relying on an unpleaded cause of action, this did not <span class="font-italic">ipso facto </span>amount to a policy consideration militating against the imposition of a duty of care. I also accepted that there was a public interest in ensuring that private investigators such as the defendant carried out their duties with reasonable care. This public interest had to be balanced against the countervailing policy considerations, which I examine in further detail below.    </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Potential overlap with the law of defamation </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 I agreed with Wei JC’s observation in <span class="font-italic">Ramesh (HC) </span>at [273] that the tort of defamation was not fundamentally inconsistent with the imposition of a duty of care in negligence. For example, while it might not be defamatory <span class="font-italic">per se </span>to tell an unpleasant truth about someone, there might still be negligence if the defendant failed to qualify or explain circumstances and other facts which put a different colour on the unpleasant truth (see <span class="font-italic">Ramesh</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC) </span>at [272]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 However, I was of the view that there was a clear overlap between the tort of defamation and the imposition of a duty of care in this particular instance. This was because the present action was premised on reputational loss, which fell squarely within the realm of defamation. As such, imposing a duty of care in this case would, as the defendant contended, unfairly deprive the defendant of certain defences (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>qualified privilege) which may only be available under the defamation regime.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Potential conflict with the defendant’s contractual duties </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 There was also an obvious conflict between the defendant’s contractual duties towards SBI and its alleged duty of care to the plaintiff. This was because the defendant had expressly disclaimed liability for its investigation and report to any person except SBI’s Audit Committee. In these circumstances, exposing the defendant to a duty of care would “drastically chang[e] the commercial parameters under which the work was first contracted for and performed”. This would be detrimental to both contractual freedom as well as commercial certainty.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Chilling effect on professional fact finding </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 Finally, putting professional firms like the defendant which are engaged for forensic investigation and fact-finding purposes under a duty of care to <span class="font-italic">any </span>person who is named in their reports might potentially encourage defensive and excessively circumspect reporting, which would not be in the public interest. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 To counter this argument, counsel for the plaintiff referred me to the Canadian case of <span class="font-italic">Correia</span>, in which the Ontario Court of Appeal held (at [43]) that any potential disadvantages which might arise from the so-called “chilling effect” would be “substantially outweighed by the advantage of encouraging greater care”.  However, the Canadian context differs significantly from the local context. In <span class="font-italic">Correia</span>, emphasis was placed on the fact that “there [was] little effective public oversight of private policing” and that “injured persons [had] limited avenues of redress” (at [46]). The plaintiff did not put forth any grounds to show that similar considerations applied to the present context. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 For the above reasons, I found that policy considerations weighed against the imposition of a duty of care.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on the first issue </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 In summary, while the requirement of factual foreseeability was satisfied, the requirement of legal proximity was not made out and there were cogent policy considerations which militated against the imposition of a duty of care in the present case. Accordingly, I found that the defendant did not owe the plaintiff a duty of care.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the defendant breached its duty of care to the plaintiff </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 While my conclusion on the first issue is sufficient to dispose of this case in its entirety, I shall also address the second issue, <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>whether the defendant had breached its duty of care, given that the evidence at trial was heavily focused on this issue. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The applicable standard of care  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 According to the plaintiff, the standard of care expected of the defendant extended to the following duties: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a)  exercising due diligence in its review of the evidence it had gathered; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) upholding the principles of natural justice; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) exercising reasonable care to ensure that (i) the facts stated in the PwC Report and Executive Summary were true; and that (ii) any opinions expressed therein were based on and supported by facts that were true. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 The plaintiff’s allegations of the defendant’s breaches of duty went towards the following undertakings by the defendant: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) findings on the background facts relating to the NPT transactions; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) findings on the Acquisition Transaction;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) findings on the Disposal Transaction; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) findings on SBI’s possible breach(es) of Chinese tax law; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) findings on SBI’s possible breach(es) of Singapore securities law; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) the process of investigating the NPT Transactions and preparing the PwC Report and Executive Summary. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 I will address each of these areas in turn. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Findings on the background facts relating to the NPT Transactions </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 The plaintiff’s submissions on this point were highly fact-specific.

With respect, I was unable to see how paragraph 8 as drafted led to the inference that Mr Chen was a Chinese citizen.

Firstly, I note that the defendant had qualified its findings in paragraph 10 with the phrase “on this basis”, which indicated that its conclusions were premised on the evidence which had been available to it at the material time. The two telegraphic transfer forms were only disclosed as evidence in these proceedings and had not been reviewed by PwC prior to the commencement of the Suit. Secondly, even if the contents of the two telegraphic transfer forms were taken into consideration, the evidence as a whole did not support the finding that any direct <span class="font-italic">cash </span>payments had been made for the acquisition of the 35% equity interest in NPT. Crucially, the plaintiff himself had admitted during cross-examination that payment of the shares had been made by way of set-off.

</div>
</div> It was thus incorrect to suggest that the onus of withholding tax lay with NPT alone. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 The plaintiff’s objections to the defendant’s and/or Mr Ye’s expertise were also unwarranted. Firstly, the plaintiff’s suggestion that the defendant did not have the relevant tax expertise was speculative and unsubstantiated. As stated at [110] above, I saw no reason to doubt Mr Goh’s evidence that he had sought the advice of a Chinese tax expert in his firm. Secondly, I disagreed with the plaintiff’s argument that “[Mr] Ye’s opinions [were] fundamentally flawed because he did not check with the relevant tax authority whether any prosecution was raised against the parties”. The issue of enforcement was distinct from the issue of whether there had been a possible breach of Chinese tax law. Where the <span class="font-italic">legality </span>of the NPT Transactions was concerned, Mr Ye’s evidence was corroborated by both Mr Meng and UniLegal in all material respects. Finally, I did not accept that the Jiangyin State Administration of Taxation was the only entity which was competent to address the issue of whether there had been any under-declaration of tax. As the defendant pointed out, tax liability was a question of Chinese tax law and was thus amenable to expert opinion. Indeed, the plaintiff himself had called Mr Meng, a practising lawyer and not an officer with the Jiangyin State Administration of Taxation, as an expert witness to testify on the Chinese tax law issues in this Suit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 Thus, I agreed with the defendant that the facts and circumstances of the NPT Transactions provided sufficient basis for the defendant to form the presumptive view that both the Acquisition and the Disposal Transactions may have led to a breach of Chinese tax law.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Findings on SBI’s possible breach(es) of Singapore securities law </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 In relation to the defendant’s findings that the NPT Transactions may have led to a possible breach of Singapore securities law, the plaintiff made the following contentions.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The defendant did not analyse the requirements and consequences of a s 254 SFA breach in sufficient detail. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The defendant had presented its findings as if what had occurred amounted to a criminal offence. However, ss 119 and 254 SFA only dealt with civil liability. Moreover, the CAD had investigated and closed the case, and this made clear that there were no criminal offences arising from the NPT Transactions. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The defendant should have advised SBI that it had, by its actions, waived or acquiesced in any impropriety which was associated with the NPT Transactions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 Once again, I found these arguments unpersuasive. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 Firstly, it was not necessary for the defendant to engage in an in-depth analysis of the requirements of s 254 SFA and/or the consequences of a breach of that provision. Nor was it necessary for the defendant to advise SBI on the concepts of waiver and acquiescence. These were legal issues and doctrines which lay beyond the scope of the defendant’s mandate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 Secondly, the defendant was not appointed to identify specific criminal conduct on the plaintiff’s (or any other SBI employee’s) part, and the PwC Report and Executive Summary were deliberately worded to avoid making any accusations to that effect. The defendant was careful to state that it was only “raising the question” as to whether there had been a breach of the relevant securities laws. Furthermore, at no point did the defendant state, whether expressly or impliedly, that SBI’s potential liability was of a criminal nature. The fact that the CAD eventually took no action to prosecute any individual or entity did not, without more, mean that the defendant must have erred or been negligent in its findings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 For these reasons, the defendant’s findings on SBI’s possible breaches of Singapore securities law also did not constitute a breach of its duty of care. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Process of investigating the NPT Transactions and preparing the PwC Report and Executive Summary  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 Finally, the plaintiff contended that the defendant’s investigative <span class="font-italic">process </span>was also flawed for the following reasons. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The defendant had not given the plaintiff sufficient time to respond to the Draft Executive Summary and the questionnaire which had been e-mailed to him on 27 August 2016.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The defendant had failed to conduct the requisite due diligence. In particular, it did not procure a statement from the plaintiff or Jonathan Hui. Nor did it interview or even contact the relevant Chinese parties (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, Mr Chen, Mr Hua and Ollie Hua) who had been involved in the NPT Transactions. Instead, the defendant had merely “repeated” what it had heard or gathered from Amy Soh.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The defendant had been prejudiced against the plaintiff all along. This was evident from its “unfair and unprofessional” attitude in handling the allegations against John Chan which, when juxtaposed against its treatment of the NPT Transactions, demonstrated that it favoured John Chan over the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 I found that the defendant had conducted a thorough fact-finding review and hence I was not persuaded by any of these allegations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 Firstly, I was of the view that the defendant had given the plaintiff a reasonable and adequate opportunity to respond to the Draft Executive Summary and the accompanying questionnaire. Notably, the Draft Executive Summary (as well as the final Executive Summary) did not contain any specific allegations against the plaintiff. While these documents did refer to the plaintiff’s involvement in the NPT Transactions, they did not suggest that he was necessarily responsible for any liability arising therefrom. Moreover, while I acknowledged that the plaintiff had only been given four days (two of which were non-business days) to respond to the defendant’s e-mail of 27 August 2016, the plaintiff could easily have replied to the defendant’s e-mail before the stipulated deadline in order to request for an extension of time, if indeed he had felt that such an extension was required. The plaintiff’s explanation

</div> that he had not done so because he felt that it was “patently absurd to expect anyone to be able to meaningfully respond to queries on transactions that had occurred 8 years ago, with no access to any documents” was thoroughly unconvincing. As noted at [81] above, the plaintiff had refused to respond to the e-mail on or before the stipulated deadline of 31 August 2016. He did not even attempt to respond until after the EGM on 16 September 2016. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 Secondly, I disagreed that the defendant had not exercised the due diligence that was required of it, or that it had merely regurgitated the information which it had gathered from Amy Soh without verifying its accuracy. The defendant had conducted its own investigations and had in fact made a number of new discoveries which were previously unknown to SBI’s Board, chief of which was the existence of the signed version of the Second Disposal ETA.

</div> The plaintiff and Jonathan Hui were the most relevant persons to obtain responses and clarification from, and the defendant had made the necessary efforts to engage them. Jonathan Hui’s immediate responses were duly noted and reflected in the contents of the Executive Summary. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 Finally, the plaintiff’s suggestion that the defendant was merely being used as a vehicle by John Chan and the other members of SBI’s Board was, with respect, entirely speculative and unsubstantiated. To buttress his allegations in this regard, the plaintiff pointed to several incidents, namely (a) the execution of an (allegedly fictitious) contract by John Chan, and (b) John Chan’s purported wrongdoings in relation to a solar energy project in South Africa to show that John Chan’s misdeeds were not picked up by the defendant even though his performance was undeniably “bad”. I declined to give any weight to these bare allegations as they were not pleaded, and there was a clear paucity of evidence in relation to each of the aforementioned incidents. Furthermore, it was untrue that the defendant had simply ignored all of John Chan’s supposed wrongdoings. The defendant had found that two of Jonathan Hui’s allegations against John Chan were made out, and had gone so far as to suggest that John Chan’s conduct did not accord with SBI’s standard of governance.

</div> These findings were fully reported to SBI’s Board and were subsequently disclosed to SBI’s shareholders in the 1 September 2016 Letter. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on the second issue </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 I was of the view that the defendant’s findings and the means by which it had arrived at these findings were reasonable, fair and objective. Legitimate concerns were raised pertaining to the existence of two sets each of the Acquisition ETAs and the Disposal ETAs which required further investigation, explanation and clarification. These concerns were properly flagged out to SBI’s Board for consideration in the interests of good governance. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 I found that the explanations for these concerns that the plaintiff had placed before the court were largely self-serving. Even if he had put forward the same explanations from the outset (<span class="font-italic">ie</span> before or at the EGM on 16 September 2016), it was difficult to see how SBI’s Board would have been persuaded to disregard the defendant’s recommendation to consider instructing legal counsel to review its factual findings and to provide advice to the Board. In all likelihood, the Board would still have deemed it necessary to seek legal advice and undertake further enquiry in any event.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 I was satisfied that, even if the defendant had owed a duty of care to the plaintiff, its conduct had not fallen below the requisite standard of care.

The plaintiff did not call any witnesses to testify that they would have supported the plaintiff if the Executive Summary had not been published. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Secondly, the valuation of shares was a matter of expert opinion and no such evidence had been adduced in the present case. Nor was there any evidence to show that the financial performance of SBI would have improved if the plaintiff had been successful in installing his nominees as directors of SBI during the EGM. In any event, this was pure conjecture. A bare assertion that John Chan’s record as CEO was “quite dismal” was clearly of no assistance. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Thirdly, the plaintiff did not lead any evidence to show that he had suffered reputational harm or psychological trauma as a result of the publication of the Executive Summary.

</div> that he had not pointed to any evidence of loss or damage in his expert report. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 There was thus no basis whatsoever for me to find that the plaintiff had suffered any loss or damage arising from the defendant’s alleged negligence. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 Over the course of the proceedings, it became apparent that the present action was driven by the plaintiff’s personal grievances and his acute dissatisfaction over many things. Among these were the perceived prejudice by the defendant against the plaintiff and the defendant’s ostensible failure to hold John Chan to account in spite of the allegations which had been raised against him. This constituted part of the plaintiff’s conspiracy theory that the defendant had set out to ensure that John Chan was absolved of blame and had been determined to “fix” the plaintiff instead. I was unable to see any proper basis for this theory which, in any event, was not part of the plaintiff’s pleaded case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 I found that the plaintiff had not adduced credible evidence in support of his claim and had failed to establish his claim on all three issues in contention. I therefore dismissed the plaintiff’s claim in its entirety.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Costs </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 Having perused the parties’ written submissions on costs, I determined that the plaintiff should bear the defendant’s costs fixed at $240,000. In coming to this assessment, I applied an appropriate uplift to the baseline figure of $180,000. I derived this baseline by applying 100% of the recommended daily tariff of $20,000 for each of the first five days of trial, and 80% of $20,000 for each of the remaining five days. This was in line with Appendix G of the Supreme Court Practice Directions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 The uplift of $60,000 to the baseline of $180,000 was justified mainly on account of the plaintiff’s conduct of the matter. The trial was prolonged over 10 days mainly because of the plaintiff’s election to venture into examining issues which were not part of his pleaded case and which turned out to be irrelevant to the issues in dispute. Furthermore, the plaintiff chose to call expert witnesses on Chinese tax law and forensic accounting, necessitating the defendant taking corresponding measures by calling their own expert witnesses to address the plaintiff’s expert evidence. In addition, there were considerable factual disputes in the claim which threw up a mixture of fairly complex legal issues spanning tort, defamation, as well as corporate and tax law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 Over and above the fixed costs, I allowed the defendant’s full disbursements of $277,141.09 as claimed. A large proportion of these disbursements (78%) comprised expenses incurred in engaging their two expert witnesses. These expenses were substantial but I was satisfied that they were reasonably and properly incurred in defending the claim. I therefore saw no reason in principle to disallow the defendant’s disbursements as claimed.  </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">See Kee Oon <br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Narayanan Vijya Kumar (M/s Vijay &amp; Co) and Malcolm Tan Ban Hoe (City Law LLC) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Ang Peng Koon Patrick, Chew Xiang, Chow Jie Ying, and Cheong Tian Ci Torsten (Rajah &amp; Tann Singapore LLP) for the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
