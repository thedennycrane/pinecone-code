<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The most <em>fundamental</em> feature of our criminal jurisprudence is the time
                    honoured principle which mandates that the Prosecution bears the burden to prove
                    the charge against the accused beyond reasonable doubt. Short of statutory
                    presumptions enacted by Parliament for specific offences, there can be no doubt
                    that this principle must be applied strictly. As aptly observed by VK
                    Rajah J (as he then was) in <em>Jagatheesan s/o Krishnasamy
                        v Public Prosecutor</em> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 45
                        (“<em>Jagatheesan</em>”), a trial judge
                    must always bear in mind that the starting point of the analysis of any criminal
                    case is not neutral. An accused is presumed innocent and this presumption is not
                    displaced until the Prosecution has discharged its burden of
                proof.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       These two appeals have brought to the fore yet
                    again that this fundamental principle of law must be applied unwaveringly to
                    prevent any miscarriage of justice. This case serves as a reminder that the
                    Prosecution’s burden of proof cannot be discharged simply by persuading
                    the trial judge to accept that the Prosecution’s version of the events is
                    more <em>probable</em> than the version offered by the
                    accused without addressing the critical question whether the evidence adduced by
                    the Prosecution has proved the charge beyond reasonable doubt. When this occurs,
                    it may lead to an egregious error in conflating and confusing the crucial
                    difference in the treatment of the burden of proof in a criminal case with that
                    of a civil trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Charges</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The two appellants, Jayasekara Arachchilage
                    Hemantha Neranjan Gamini (20 years old), and Jullian Hettige Hasitha Migara
                    Perera (23 years old) (hereinafter referred to as “Jayasekara” and
                    “Jullian” respectively) were charged for, in furtherance of the
                    common intention with two other persons, committing robbery of $80 in the
                    possession of one Manikku Archarige Weerantha Silva (“PW1”) on 4
                    November 2009 between 4 am to 5 am, under s 392 read with s 34 of the Penal Code
                    (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed). Jayasekara was also charged for voluntarily
                    causing hurt to one Sembakutti Sudarma De Silva (“PW2”) by kicking
                    his hip area on 4 November 2009 between 4 am to 5 am, under s 323 of the Penal
                    Code.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The appellants were convicted of the charges by
                    the district judge (“the DJ”) and were each sentenced to 42
                    months’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane under s 392. Jayasekara
                    was sentenced to one week imprisonment for the s 323 offence with the
                    sentence to run concurrently. The appellants appealed against both convictions
                    and sentences.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Prosecution’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       It was the Prosecution’s case that PW1 and
                    PW2 were victims of a robbery committed by Jayasekara, Jullian and two other
                    persons. PW1 and PW2 as well as Jayasekara and Jullian are all Sri Lankan
                    nationals and were known to each other at the material time. The
                    Prosecution’s position is that PW1 is a businessman who dealt with the
                    importation of car spare parts. According to both PW1 and PW2, they were having
                    drinks with some friends, <em>ie</em> one Danushka and
                    three of his friends on 4 November 2009 at the coffeeshop on the ground floor of
                    the Shing building located at Verdun Road when Jayasekara approached PW1 for
                    some money to buy drinks. After PW1 refused to give any money to Jayasekara, PW1
                    asked PW2 to leave the coffeeshop as he sensed that there could be trouble. PW1
                    and PW2 then left the coffeeshop and started walking in the direction away from
                    Jayasekara and his friends, and walked towards an open space carpark also
                    located along Verdun Road.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       As PW1 and PW2 were near the carpark, someone
                    behind them shouted “Hey Stop” in Sinhala. PW1 and PW2 then saw
                    the appellants and two other persons running towards them. PW1 and PW2 started
                    running away from them towards the carpark. As they were being chased, one of
                    the persons (amongst the appellants and two other persons) threw an empty beer
                    bottle which landed and broke in front of PW1 and PW2. The appellants then
                    overtook PW1 and PW2. Simultaneously, one of the two other persons kicked PW1
                    from behind on his neck. The force was strong enough to cause PW1 to fall down.
                    At this time, Jayasekara allegedly kicked PW2 on his hip which also caused PW2
                    to fall down. While PW1 was on the ground, Jayasekara allegedly kicked him on
                    his left upper arm and asked him for money. Jayasekara allegedly tried to take
                    PW1’s wallet from his right side pocket, but PW1 rolled onto his side and
                    used his right hand to prevent his wallet from being taken. As a result of the
                    struggle, PW1’s left shin suffered some bruises and scratches and his
                    t-shirt had shoe marks on it from Jayasekara’s kick. PW1 allegedly used
                    his left hand to prop himself off the ground with a view to escape. This left
                    PW1’s left side pocket exposed and Jayasekara allegedly reached into his
                    pocket and robbed him of $80 cash.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       PW1 then got up and ran towards Mustafa Centre,
                    and it was alleged that the appellants and the two persons chased after him. PW1
                    and PW2 ran in separate directions. PW1 headed towards the Shing building and
                    thereafter hid himself inside Mustafa Shopping Centre. While PW1 was hiding, PW2
                    walked to the junction of Kitchener Road and Serangoon Road where he encountered
                    Jullian. According to PW2, Jullian approached him and asked for a cigarette but
                    PW2 refused. PW2 then went to a café where he waited for PW1. After hiding for
                    about 45 minutes, PW1 called PW2 on the mobile to meet him at a taxi stand along
                    Serangoon Road in front of Serangoon Plaza. They met and decided to head for the
                    Rochor Neighbourhood Police Centre (“Rochor Police Centre”) to
                    report the robbery.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Appellants’ defence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The appellants are private students in Singapore
                    on study passes. It is the appellants’ position that PW1 and PW2 had
                    fabricated the robbery to frame them due to a grudge that PW1 had with
                    Jayasekara arising from the latter’s relationship with a prostitute known
                    as Nirasha; and because of some unpleasant encounters which each of the
                    appellants had with prostitutes controlled by PW1and PW2 on two separate
                    occasions in the early hours of 4 November 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       According to the defence, PW1 was a pimp engaged
                    in the prostitution of Sri Lankan women in the Serangoon Road area, and PW2 was
                    his assistant in this prostitution racket. PW1 had brought Sri Lankan girls into
                    Singapore to work as prostitutes. Sometime in July 2008, PW1 brought Nirasha to
                    Singapore. Nirasha believed that she was going to work as a dancer. On arrival
                    in Singapore, Nirasha was, however, forced to work as a prostitute. While in
                    Singapore, Jayasekara and Nirasha became lovers, a relationship which was
                    strongly opposed by PW1. According to Jayasekara, PW1 had threatened to assault
                    him if he did not cease his relationship with Nirasha. In particular, Jayasekara
                    related an incident where PW1 and some men came to his room one night at around
                    midnight to warn him to end his relationship with Nirasha. Subsequently, Nirasha
                    was arrested in or around June 2009. She asked Jayasekara for assistance to
                    purchase a return air ticket to Sir Lanka. Jayasekara obtained some money from
                    his mother to purchase the air ticket. Nirasha thereafter left with
                    Jayasekara’s mother back to Sri Lanka.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On 3 November 2009, Jayasekara left his house
                    at around 11.30 pm to meet one Suda Aiya for drinks. While he was on his way,
                    Jayasekara met Jullian, who agreed to join him for drinks. At Mustafa Travel
                    Agency, they met Suda Aiya who arrived with another person.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> They started drinking at the corner of the
                    travel agency at about 1 am on 4 November. Jullian left the group some time
                    before 5 am without informing Jayasekara.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Subsequently, Jaysekara borrowed $50 from Suda
                    Aiya, after which he walked towards the Farrer Park hostel to engage the
                    services of a Sri Lankan prostitute. According to Jayasekara, as Sri Lankan
                    prostitutes avoided Sri Lankan customers, he pretended to be from India.
                    Jayasekara paid the prostitute $50 to have “two shots” of sexual
                    intercourse with her. However, after they had sexual intercourse for the first
                    time, the prostitute refused to continue her services after she discovered from
                    Jayasekara’s mobile ringtone (playing a Sir Lankan tune) that he was a Sri
                    Lankan. Thereafter the prostitute left and Jayasekara went after her to seek a
                    refund of $20. When the prostitute refused, PW1 and PW2 appeared. PW1 told
                    Jayasekara to leave. Jayasekara refused and insisted on getting his refund. PW1
                    then punched Jayasekara on the left eyebrow and right shoulder. Jayasekara ran
                    away and rejoined Suda Aiya and Jullian (who had by then returned) at the corner
                    of the Mustafa Travel Agency and continued to drink and chat. Jayasekara did not
                    relate the incident to Jullian at that time because he was concerned that
                    Jullian might start a fight as he was a bit drunk by then and further they had a
                    rioting charge pending as well.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     As for Jullian, after he left Jayasekara and
                    the group before 5 am, he headed to the Shing Hotel to look for a prostitute. He
                    too engaged the services of a prostitute for $50. After taking the money, the
                    prostitute refused to go with him after she realised that Jullian was a Sri
                    Lankan. To resolve the matter, Jullian approached PW1.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> PW1 informed him that
                    there was no problem and that he could engage her services.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>
                    Jullian however told PW1 that he could not force the prostitute. He then decided
                    to rejoin Suda Aiya for more drinks. About 30 minutes later, PW1 appeared
                    with the police and the appellants were arrested.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The DJ adopted a rather curious route in
                    arriving at his decision. In his Grounds of Decision (“GD”), he
                    commenced his analysis by stating that the version of events given by PW1 and
                    PW2 should be accepted as he was of the view that the evidence adduced by them
                    was “<em>unshaken</em>”. The sum total of the
                    DJ’s reasoning in arriving at this finding is set out in 2 paragraphs of
                    his GD which is reproduced below:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">26    I believe and accept the accounts given by PW1 and
                            PW2. Despite strenuous cross examination, their evidence was unshaken.
                            While the defence sought to make much of discrepancies between
                            PW1’s and PW2’s account of the robbery, to the extent of
                            requiring both witnesses to re-enact PW1’s movements while
                            struggling on the ground with Jayasekara, I would only note that during
                            such a chaotic and confused period, exactness of recall is hardly to be
                            expected and to expect either PW1 or PW2 to remember and to furnish a
                            blow by blow account of what exactly happened is
                        unrealistic.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">27    In any event, PW2’s account of having been
                            kicked by Jayasekara in the left hip region was corroborated by the
                            injury which was noted by PW4.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The DJ observed that PW2’s evidence of
                    having been kicked by Jayasekara in the left hip region was corroborated by PW4
                    who had noted the injury at the time when PWI and PW2 made the police
                    report.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The DJ found that “<em>in contrast</em>”, the appellants’ evidence was
                    implausible at some points, and was inconsistent with the accounts provided in
                    their police statements. Jayasekara had alleged that he met Jullian with two of
                    Jullian’s friends, but he claimed in his police statement that he was with
                    two friends and that Jullian was alone. Jullian, on the other hand, had claimed
                    in his statement that he was with a friend known as Kasun and that he went alone
                    to meet Jayasekara. This was inconsistent with Jullian’s testimony that he
                    was with a friend known as Deepal, and not Kasun. The DJ also disbelieved
                    Jayasekara’s evidence that Suda Aiya, before lending him $50, had told
                    Jayasekara not to “hang around in the night” since he had a
                    pending rioting charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The DJ also observed that Jayasekara’s
                    alleged injury on his left eyebrow was not corroborated by any police officer,
                    and that there was a medical note from a doctor who had examined Jayasekara in
                    which it was expressly recorded that there was no injury to his head region. The
                    DJ observed that his evidence of an injury on his left eyebrow was inconsistent
                    with his account in his police statement in which he stated he was hit on his
                    cheek and on the left side of his face. With this, the DJ found that the claim
                    that Jayasekara was punched by PW1 was untrue, and found Jullian’s
                    evidence that he saw Jayasekara’s injury on his left eyebrow was obviously
                    an attempt to corroborate Jayasekara’s version of events and was equally
                    untrue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Although the DJ was of the view that it was
                    not necessary or relevant to make any finding as to PW1’s and PW2’s
                        “profession”,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> he observed that if
                    PW1 had, as alleged by Jayasekara, assaulted him and had operated as a pimp, the
                    “last thing” that PW1 would want would be to involve the police.
                    He therefore dismissed Jayasekara’s allegation that he was framed by
                    PW1.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The DJ disbelieved Jullian’s account
                    that he was prepared to walk away from the prostitute without retrieving his
                    refund of $50, as it was observed that that amount was half of Jullian’s
                    disposable income. He was of the view that it was “impossible to
                    believe” that Jullian would not have asked for the money back and had
                    simply walked away following the prostitute’s refusal to accede to his
                    request for a refund.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The DJ observed that in spite of the
                    antagonistic relationship between Jayasekara and PW1 over Nirasha, Jayasekara
                    had referred to PW1 in his police statements as “the fat male Sri
                    Lankan” and had also stated that he did not know PW1 but had only seen
                    him around.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     In view of the “litany of
                        discrepancies”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> in the appellants’
                    evidence, the DJ held that there was “little or no truth” in their
                    evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     In the appeal before me, the appellants relied
                    on several arguments as the basis of the appeal. It was argued that the DJ had
                    misdirected himself in failing to apply the trite principle of law that the onus
                    is on the Prosecution to prove its case and the charge beyond any reasonable
                    doubt, before a conviction could be made out. The appellants contend that the DJ
                    had convicted the appellants purely or substantially on the inconsistencies in
                    the appellants’ evidence and had placed undue weight on the
                    inconsistencies which he had highlighted. Crucially, it was emphatically
                    stressed that the DJ had overlooked several fundamental omissions in the
                    Prosecution’s case and had disregarded serious inconsistencies in the
                    Prosecution’s own evidence. Amongst the omissions in the
                    Prosecution’s case which were highlighted by the appellants’
                    counsel, two of them stand out for particular mention. First, there was no
                    medical evidence to prove the injuries which were allegedly inflicted on PW1 and
                    PW2 in the course of the robbery, and second, the cash sum of $80, the fruit of
                    the robbery, was not recovered from the appellants when they were searched upon
                    arrest. Both these omissions pertain to critical elements of the accusations
                    levelled by PW1 and PW2 against the appellants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The appellants relied on the decision of
                        <em>Jagatheesan</em> to emphasise the
                    Prosecution’s burden of proving its case beyond a reasonable doubt. In
                    particular, the following observations are pertinent (per V K Rajah J
                    (as he then was) at [55]–[56]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…As Prof Larry Laudan puts it, "<em>What
                            distinguishes a rational doubt from an irrational one is that the former
                            reacts to a weakness in the case offered by the prosecution, while the
                            latter does not</em>."…Reasonable doubt is, in other words,
                        a reasoned doubt.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The second reason why I am partial to this particular formulation of
                        reasonable doubt is that it correctly shifts the focus from what could
                        potentially be a purely subjective call on the part of the trial judge to a
                        more objective one of <em>requiring the trial judge to
                            "[reason] through the evidence</em>": Larry Laudan at 319.
                        Therefore, <em>it is not sufficient for the trial judge
                            merely to state whether he has been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt.
                            He must be able to say precisely why and how the evidence supports the
                            Prosecution's theory of the accused's guilt</em>. This process of
                        reasoning is important not only because it constrains the subjectivity of
                        the trial judge's fact-finding mission; it is crucial because the trial
                        process should also seek to "persuade the person whose conduct is under
                        scrutiny of the truth and justice of its conclusions": R A Duff, Trials and
                        Punishment (Cambridge University Press, 1986) at p 116; T R S Allan,
                        Constitutional Justice: A Liberal Theory of the Rule of Law (Oxford
                        University Press, 2001) at p 81. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Court further clarified that (at [61]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…the Prosecution bears the burden of proving its case beyond
                        reasonable doubt. While this does not mean that the Prosecution has to
                        dispel all conceivable doubts, the doctrine mandates that, at the very
                        least, those doubts for which there is a reason that is, in turn, relatable
                        to and supported by the evidence presented, must be excluded. <em>Reasonable doubt might also arise by virtue of the lack of
                            evidence submitted, when such evidence is necessary to support the
                            Prosecution's theory of guilt. Such a definition of reasonable doubt
                            requires the trial judge to apply his mind to the evidence; to carefully
                            sift and reason through the evidence</em> to ensure and affirm
                        that his finding of guilt or innocence is grounded entirely in logic and
                        fact. A trial judge must also bear in mind that the starting point of the
                        analysis is not neutral. An accused is presumed innocent and this
                        presumption is not displaced until the Prosecution has discharged its burden
                        of proof. <em>Therefore, if the evidence throws up a
                            reasonable doubt, it is not so much that the accused should be given the
                            benefit of the doubt as much as the Prosecution's case simply not being
                            proved</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The appellants further relied on the Court of
                    Appeal’s decision of <em>Public Prosecutor v Mohammed Liton
                        Mohammed Syeed Mallik</em> [2008] 1 SLR(R) 601
                        (“<em>Mohammed Liton</em>”). The Court of
                    Appeal, in endorsing (at [34]–[35]) the
                    observations of the trial judge in <em>Public Proseuctor v
                        Mohammed Liton Mohammed Syeed Mallik</em> [2007] SGHC 47,
                    underscored an important reminder that it is not the duty of the trial judge in
                    a criminal case to choose the more probable version amongst two competing
                    version of events:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Unlike civil cases, where the court may choose between two competing
                        stories and accept the one on a balance of probabilities, that is to say,
                        accepting that version because it seemed more plausible than the other, in a
                        criminal case, there is an important norm to be taken into account at all
                        times - that <em>where there is a reasonable doubt, that
                            doubt must be resolved in favour of the accused</em>. It is
                        inherent [in] the requirement that the prosecution proves its case beyond
                        reasonable doubt.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…What this means is that <em>unlike a civil case,
                            the court's verdict might not merely be determined on the basis that as
                            between the two competing stories, which version was the more plausible
                            one. In a criminal case, the court may find ... the complainant's story
                            to be more probable than that of the accused person's version, and yet,
                            be convinced that there is a reasonable possibility that the accused
                            person's story could be true</em>. If that were the case, the
                        court's duty is to acquit. Unlike a civil case, <em>the court
                            need not make a decision by concentrating on which of the two versions
                            was more probable</em>. In the criminal trial the court must
                        remind itself to break from any habitual inclination to contemplate the
                        question of the burden of proof on the basis of a civil case, and instead,
                        ask itself whether there was a reasonable possibility that the accused
                        person's version was true.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In the present case, the appellants submitted
                    that no explanation whatsoever was provided by the DJ as to why and how he
                    arrived at the conclusion that the Prosecution’s evidence was unshaken. It
                    was further submitted that the DJ appeared to have convicted the appellants
                    simply because he found their version of events to be implausible and by this
                    process reversed the burden of proof to the appellants to establish their
                    innocence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">General observations of the Prosecution’s evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     There are various aspects of the charges which
                    by its nature are capable of corroboration or proof with reference to objective
                    evidence. As will be demonstrated below, none was adduced. Without objective
                    evidence, the case against the appellants at the trial was almost entirely based
                    on the testimony of PW1 and PW2. In such a case, it is crucial to carefully
                    evaluate the credibility of the key witnesses which in this case would be PW1
                    and PW2. This assessment was purportedly carried out by the DJ without stating
                    his reasons. As will be shown below, the objective evidence before the court,
                    when properly analysed, in fact cast serious doubts on the credibility of PW1
                    and PW2.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In this connection, it is instructive to refer
                    to the seminal decision of <em>Jagatheesan</em> where the
                    court observed (at [44]–[45]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There is no absolute prohibition or legal impediment in convicting an
                        accused on the evidence of a single witness: see <em>Yeo Eng
                            Siang v PP</em> [2005] 2 SLR(R) 409 at [25] (although in <em>Tan
                            Wei Yi v PP</em> [2005] 3 SLR(R) 471 (“<em>Tan Wei Yi</em>”) at [23] Yong Pung How CJ expressed his reservations in doing
                        so). Indeed, one wholly honest and reliable witness on one side may often
                        prove to be far more significant or compelling and outweigh several
                        witnesses on the other side who may be neither reliable nor
                        independent.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The court must nevertheless be mindful of the inherent dangers of such a
                        conviction and subject the evidence at hand to close scrutiny: see <em>Low Lin Lin v PP</em> [2002] 2 SLR(R) 881 at
                            [49]. This is true whether the
                        witness is an accomplice (see <em>Chua Poh Kiat Anthony v
                            PP</em> [1998] 2 SLR(R) 342, or an interested witness
                        (see <em>Kwang Boon Keong Peter v PP</em> [1998]
                        2 SLR(R) 211). In such situations, a conviction can only be upheld
                        if the testimony is so compelling to the extent that a conviction can be
                        founded entirely and exclusively on it. This means no more than that the
                        witness’s testimony evidence is so compelling that the
                        Prosecution’s case is proved beyond reasonable doubt, <em>solely</em> on the basis of that witness’s
                        testimony: <em>Teo Keng Pong v PP</em> [1996]
                        2 SLR(R) 890 (“<em>Teo Keng
                        Pong</em>”) at [73].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     With this caveat, I now direct my attention to
                    address the various omissions in the Prosecution’s evidence as raised by
                    the appellants.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Material omissions in Prosecution’s evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">No evidence of the broken beer bottle</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     According to the account of PW1 and PW2, the
                    robbery incident started with someone shouting “Hey Stop” followed
                    by the throwing of a beer bottle which landed and broke in front of PW1 and PW2.
                    Accordingly, this would be a useful point to commence the analysis of the
                    evidence or lack thereof in relation to the robbery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     There was no evidence of the broken beer
                    bottle that was allegedly thrown at the open space car park. The police failed
                    to visit the scene of the alleged robbery to look for the broken pieces of the
                    alleged broken bottle. Indeed, PW1 testified that he was not even taken to the
                    carpark where the alleged robbery took place for investigation.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> This could
                    and should have been done but was inexplicably not done.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The prosecution also failed to call either of
                    the two other persons who were involved in the alleged robbery to the stand.
                    Either or both of them would have been a material witness as to whether the beer
                    bottle was thrown as alleged by PW1 and PW2. This would in turn have shed light
                    on whether the account provided by PW1 and PW2 was true and
                accurate.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">No evidence of the alleged injuries to the victims</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The absence of corroborative evidence in
                    respect of the injuries allegedly sustained by PW1 and PW2 is particularly
                    significant. The original charges preferred against the appellants were robbery
                    with hurt under s 394 of the Penal Code. On the first day of the trial, the
                    charges were amended to proceed by way of s 392 of the Penal Code instead. The
                    charges under s 392 of the Penal Code do not necessarily require proof of hurt.
                    It is not clear why the charges were amended but it was probably no coincidence
                    that the injuries allegedly sustained by PW1 and PW2 were not supported by any
                    medical report or even by photographs. Clearly the lack of corroborative
                    evidence was significant enough to cause the Prosecution to amend the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     PW1 claimed that he was hit (by one of the two
                    persons apart from the appellants) on his neck from behind, and that it was a
                    very hard blow which caused him to fall.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> PW1 further claimed that Jayasekara
                    kicked him on his upper left arm while he was still lying on the
                        ground<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> and in the course
                    of the struggle, his left shin also sustained scratches and bruises.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> PW2 claimed that
                    Jayasekara also kicked him at his left hip area which caused him to fall down.
                    PW2 alleged that it was a “tremendous kick” and a “very
                    hard kick”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span>
                    Therefore, according to PW1 and PW2, several injuries were allegedly inflicted
                    by Jayasekara on both of them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     However, these assertions were actually
                    contradicted by independent evidence from more than one police officer. PW5, a
                    police officer with Rochor Police Centre, had specifically observed PW1’s
                    neck and found no visible injuries on his neck. In addition, PW1 did not refer
                    to any other injury allegedly inflicted by the appellants when he was asked at
                    the police station even though he claimed that he was kicked by Jayasekara on
                    the upper left arm and sustained bruises and scratches on his left
                        shin:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p>

                    different answer. Contrary to his earlier answer, PW4 testified that he did not
                    in fact provide first aid to PW2. He had offered it but it was turned down by
                        PW2.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> Taking
                    PW4’s evidence at face value, there is nothing to suggest that the

                    Jayasekara’s kick. As such, I find that there is no corroborative value in
                    PW4’s evidence as regards the bruise found on PW2.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The DJ should have accorded the requisite

                    not seen limping throughout the time when he walked with PW3. Furthermore,

                    corroborated by PW4’s evidence, this was contradicted by PW3’s
                    evidence that there were no visible injuries on either PW1 or PW2 and neither
                    complained of any injuries, as well as PW5’s material evidence that he did

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The absence of evidence in relation to the
                    alleged injuries is particularly crucial in the present case. Although,
                    ordinarily, the charges under s 392 of the Penal Code do not necessarily require
                    proof of hurt, it is pertinent that by the Prosecution’s own account of
                    events as provided by PW1 and PW2, actual hurt was alleged to have been caused
                    by the appellants to both of them. In this regard, not only was there no medical
                    evidence whatsoever to corroborate PW1’s and PW2’s account, the
                    evidence adduced by the Prosecution’s witnesses had in fact undermined the
                    Prosecution’s case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Failure to adduce corroborative evidence of the victims’
                injuries</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     There is no evidence to support PW1’s
                    alleged injuries apart from his own assertion accompanied by PW2’s
                    supporting testimony. As highlighted above, PW1’s allegation of injuries
                    runs contrary to the independent evidence given by several police officers. As
                    for PW2’s alleged injury to his hip, the Prosecution submitted during the
                    appeal before me that it was sufficiently corroborated by PW4’s evidence
                    and medical evidence was therefore not required. The Prosecution relied on the
                    following passage from <em>Sahadevan s/o Gundan v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [2003] 1 SLR(R) 145 (“<em>Sahadevan</em>”) (at [32]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Counsel for the appellant submitted that the district judge had erred in
                        that Sgt Zul's testimony should not have been relied upon as the basis to
                        find that hurt had been caused to Pandi. It was further submitted that hurt,
                        pain and swelling are issues requiring proof by medical experts and Sgt Zul
                        was not a doctor who could testify on this crucial aspect of the case
                        against the appellant. I was unable to accept this contention. <em>Whether hurt is caused is a finding of fact, which is not
                            necessarily to be always corroborated by evidence given by medical
                            experts</em>. <em>A trial judge is entitled to find
                            that hurt has been caused, with or without medical evidence</em>,
                        if he is convinced that it has been proven, in light of all the evidence
                        before him.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     In my view, it is a general principle of law
                    that, whether corroboration by independent evidence <em>was
                        necessary</em>, and if so, <em>what kind</em> of
                    corroborative evidence was required (such as photographs, medical reports,
                    doctor’s letter, <em>etc</em>) depends on the facts
                    and circumstances of each case. Particular consideration should be given to the
                    strength and sufficiency of the direct and circumstantial evidence available in
                    each case and whether the evidence is capable of corroboration. All things being
                    equal, the more specific the allegation of injury, the greater the need for
                    corroborative evidence to satisfy the burden of proving the specificity of the
                    allegation. Likewise, the more serious the alleged injury, the more suspect it
                    would be for failing to adduce corroborative evidence; for a court would view
                    with circumspection the failure to provide corroborative evidence when such
                    corroboration was available and where no satisfactory explanation was provided
                    for its omission.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     In the present case, there can be no doubt
                    that the injuries allegedly inflicted on PW1 and PW2 were capable of
                    corroboration by way of medical reports. At the very least, photographs of the
                    alleged injuries should have been taken but unfortunately this elementary step
                    was not carried out by the police investigators. As pointed out, PW4’s
                    evidence has been thrown into doubt by PW3’s and PW5’s testimony
                    (see <a href="#p1_35">[35]</a>–<a href="#p1_38">[38]</a> above). The Prosecution’s failure to produce
                    independent corroborative evidence had therefore severely weakened its case. The
                    absence of any objective evidence to substantiate the injury becomes even more
                    suspect given that PW2 had alleged that he suffered a “tremendous”
                    and “very hard blow” which caused him to fall to the ground. One
                    would expect some photograph or medical report to prove the injury particularly
                    in light of the nature of the injury alleged by PW2. The complete absence of any
                    objective evidence was therefore highly unsatisfactory.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Furthermore, no explanation was given as to
                    why either of the two other persons who were involved in the alleged robbery was
                    not called to the stand. Clearly they would have provided material and relevant
                    evidence; it was after all, not the appellants who had hit PW1 at the back of
                    his neck which caused him to fall. Instead it was one of the other two persons.
                    If PW1’s and PW2’ accounts were to be believed, the two persons
                    would have witnessed Jayasekara’s alleged kick on PW1’s left upper
                    arm and the alleged kick on PW2’s hip, as well as the robbing of $80 cash
                    from PW1. Further, Danushka who was in the coffeeshop with PW1 and PW2 when PW1
                    first spoke to Jayasekara was also not called to corroborate the event that
                    allegedly led to PW1 and PW2 abruptly leaving the coffeeshop without even
                    finishing their beer. It was PW2’s evidence that Danushka stayed in the
                    same place as PW1 but had returned to Sri Lanka by the time of the trial.
                    Moreover, given that the charges preferred against the appellants were that they
                    had committed the robbery in furtherance of the <em>common
                        intention</em> shared with these two persons, it was anomalous that
                    the two persons were not charged and tried at the same trial with the
                    appellants. No reason was offered by the Prosecution to explain this
                    anomaly.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Finally, the Prosecution could have adduced
                    the CCTV footage from Rochor Police Centre. In the course of trial, during
                    cross-examination of PW3, it was revealed that there was a CCTV at Rochor Police

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     According to the appellants’ counsel, at
                    the conclusion of this line of questioning, the Prosecution then informed the DJ
                    that “based on what has come up, [he] will endeavour to locate Sgt Ho and
                    the CCTV records”. This was asserted by counsel in the closing
                    submissions at the trial below<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span>, the written submissions
                    for the appeal<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span>, and also during the appeal
                    hearing before me<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span>,
                    and was left undisputed by the Prosecution. In the appeal before me, the
                    Prosecution explained that the CCTV recording has been recycled. However this
                    was not told to the appellants’ counsel until the Reply Submissions by the
                    Prosecution in the court below. However it was not clear from the Reply
                    Submissions when the CCTV recording was erased. This was unfortunate as the CCTV
                    records would have provided some evidence to establish the physical state of PW1
                    and PW2 when they arrived at the police station to file their report. It would
                    have established whether PW1 was wearing footwear on only one foot in accordance
                    with PW1’s version of events (he claimed to have lost the other footwear
                    in the struggle) and whether PW2 was limping (due to the injuries inflicted by
                    Jayasekara) as claimed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">From the above, it is clear that there
                    were ample opportunities and avenues for the Prosecution to adduce objective
                    evidence by way of medical reports, photographs of the injuries, remnants of the
                    broken beer bottle, the CCTV footage or by calling the two friends of the
                    appellants who were involved in the robbery or Danushka, to corroborate the
                    testimonies of PW1 and PW2 but curiously none was done. Instead they elected to
                    proceed solely on the basis of the testimonies of PW1 and PW2. The Prosecution
                    must therefore stand or fall by their election.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">No evidence in relation to the $80 cash</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Jayasekara was charged and convicted of
                    robbing PW1 of $80 cash. Jayasekara was arrested shortly after the alleged
                    robbery and yet the stolen money was not found on him. In <em>Sahadevan</em>, the Court held that there was no general rule which
                    required the fruits of the crime (in this case, the $80 cash) to be recovered
                    before a charge of robbery could be made out. In the circumstances of <em>Sahadevan</em> however, the Prosecution’s failure to
                    adduce evidence of the cash that was allegedly robbed considerably weakened its
                    own case particularly when the victim’s credibility was suspect (at
                        <a href="#p1_30">[30]</a> and [35]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Even though… there is really no rule of law that the fruits of a
                        crime must be recovered before the charge against an accused is proven, I
                        was of the view that, taking into account the surrounding circumstances of
                        this case and the need to place a greater scrutiny on Pandi's evidence, the
                        failure to recover the $50 from the appellant <em>considerably weakened</em> the Prosecution's case...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…the burden of proof was still on the Prosecution to prove the
                        appellant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, however tenuous the defence
                        might have been: see <em>Tan Edmund v PP</em> [1995]
                        1 SLR(R) 618. In discharging this burden, it was not at all
                        sufficient for the Prosecution to merely point to the inadequacies of the
                        appellant's testimony.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     In the present case, the appellants were
                    searched when they were arrested at about 6.45 am on 4 November 2009. This was
                    slightly more than an hour after the alleged robbery. However the $80 was not
                    found on either of them. PW5 testified that nothing incriminating was found on
                        them.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> Indeed, less
                    than $5 was found on <em>one of the appellants</em> and
                    surprisingly the Prosecution’s witness was not even clear which of the two
                    appellants was found with the $5 cash.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> According to PW6, he was told by PW1
                    that the $80 which was robbed by Jayasekara comprised one $50 note and three $10
                        notes.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span>
                    What happened to the balance $75?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Furthermore, in my view, in so far as the
                    establishing of charge required proof of theft, it would be unsafe to prove this
                    aspect based on the mere say so of PW1, a witness who lacked credibility (this
                    will be elaborated below at <a href="#p1_51">[51]</a>–<a href="#p1_58">[58]</a>) and whose
                    evidence was inconsistent in several material aspects and contradicted by the
                    evidence from several police officers (as already shown above at <a href="#p1_33">[33]</a>–<a href="#p1_38">[38]</a>). From this perspective, the Prosecution’s failure to
                    recover the sum of $80 assumes even more significance. Although there is no
                    general rule of evidence that the fruits of a crime had to be recovered in order
                    to establish the charge of robbery, in the present case the appellants were
                    caught and arrested within a short period of time after the alleged robbery and
                    no explanation was advanced as to why the cash was not found on them. They were
                    arrested within metres from the scene of the alleged robbery. The fact that the
                    appellants were comfortable to remain in the vicinity of the scene of the crime
                    would suggest that they were not suspecting to be arrested. Therefore it cannot
                    be and has not been suggested that the appellants had concealed the stolen
                    money. The need for a viable explanation for the missing $80 cash was especially
                    crucial since the credibility of PW1, whose testimony was the main evidence
                    relied by the Prosecution, was highly questionable. In this regard, the DJ did
                    not provide any reasons for his finding that the Prosecution’s case was
                    made out despite the Prosecution’s failure to adduce any material evidence
                    to account for the missing $80 cash. The DJ also omitted to deal with the
                    Prosecution’s suggestion that the $80 was spent on alcohol, and in
                    particular, on a bottle of Johnny Walker (Prosecution’s Reply Submissions
                    dated 31 May 2010 at p 8):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…the Victims had been separated from the Accused Persons for about
                        an hour plus. They did not have the opportunity to continue observing the
                        Accused Persons. Moreover, when the Accused Persons were arrested, they were
                        observed to be drunk and, by their own admission, a ‘Johnny
                        Walker’ bottle was with them. The Accused Persons in our case had both
                        the time and the means to spend the S$80 which was taken from PW1 because of
                        the close proximity of shops selling alcoholic drinks in the
                        vicinity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     I am unable to accept the Prosecution’s
                    suggestion which is speculative at best. Indeed, the DJ in his GD did not even
                    deal with this suggestion by the Prosecution. In any event, the
                    Prosecution’s suggestion was based on an incomplete representation of the
                    evidence. Jayasekara’s testimony that the bottle of Johnny Walker was
                    purchased by Suda Aiya (and not Jayasekara)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> was not challenged by the
                    Prosecution and that it only costs about $39.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> The
                    Prosecution did not submit or lead any evidence to suggest that Jayasekara may
                    have passed the balance cash which he had allegedly robbed from PW1 to Suda
                    Aiya. In addition, at the time of the arrest, PW5 admitted in court that he had
                    only looked at the Johnny Walker bottle from a distance, and did not even ask
                    the appellants whether the bottle was purchased by them.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> Furthermore, PW5 did not
                    seize the bottle as he believed that the bottle was not relevant to the
                        case.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     It may well be that the failure to account for
                    the stolen money; <em>or</em> failure to produce medical
                    evidence to establish the alleged injuries; <em>or</em>
                    failure to investigate the scene of the crime to retrieve the broken beer
                    bottle; may not; when taken <em>in isolation</em> be,
                        <em>in and of itself</em> fatal to the
                    Prosecution’s case. However, the various omissions to corroborate, when
                    taken <em>collectively</em> and examined in totality,
                    presents a very different picture, that is, one which is full of unacceptable
                    gaps and holes. In his GD, the DJ did not address the above omissions and gaps
                    in the Prosecution’s evidence <em>at all</em> and
                    accordingly failed to give <em>any</em> consideration to
                    the manifest lack of corroborative evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Doubts about the credibility of PW1 and PW2</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Inherently incredulous aspects of the Prosecution’s
                case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Without the assistance of vital corroborative
                    evidence, the case against the appellants was essentially based on the
                    testimonies of PW1 and PW2. Under these circumstances, it was, <em>a fortiori</em>, imperative for the DJ to carefully evaluate
                    the testimonies of PW1 and PW2 to determine whether the charges have been made
                    out. It is eminently obvious that it would not be sufficient for the DJ to
                    simply state that he was satisfied that PW1’s and PW2’s testimony
                    were truthful. It behoved him to explain <em>precisely</em>
                    why and how the evidence supported the Prosecution’s case (see <em>Jagatheesan</em> at [56]). In the present case, it is apparent that, in the whole of
                    the two paragraphs dedicated to observations on the Prosecution’s
                        case,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> no reason whatsoever was provided
                    by the DJ as to why and how he arrived at the conclusion that the
                    Prosecution’s evidence was unshaken. No reason was likewise provided by
                    the DJ to explain the <em>evidential</em> basis for
                    accepting the version of events given by PW1 and PW2. As elaborated above, there
                    were in fact obvious and material gaps in the Prosecution’s evidence. The
                    DJ appeared to have accepted the Prosecution’s version because he found
                    the appellants’ version to be “implausible”. As the analysis
                    of PW1’s and PW2’s evidence was, unfortunately, not carried out by
                    the DJ on the face of his GD, it leaves me now to undertake that task with
                    reference to the evidence before me.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Several dubious aspects of PW1’s and
                    PW2’s evidence were brought to my attention by counsel for the appellants.
                    First, after PW1 was hit on the neck and fell to the ground, it was alleged that
                    Jullian pressed on PW1’s feet to hold him down to the ground so that he
                    could not get up.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span>
                    While being held down, Jayasekara was alleged to have kicked PW1 on his upper
                    left arm and had taken the $80 cash from PW1’s pocket.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> At the same time, the
                    two other persons with the appellants were also around. PW2 was also on the
                    ground as he was allegedly kicked on the hip by Jayasekara. Given such
                    significant physical advantage over the victims (four assailants standing
                    against two victims lying on the ground), it was inexplicable that the
                    appellants would have robbed PW1 only of $80, and left his handphone<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> and wallet containing
                    about US$1,000 untouched.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> This is even more unbelievable as it
                    was the evidence of PW1 that he was most concerned with his wallet and he was
                    holding onto it. This would provide even more reason for the appellants to take
                    PW1’s wallet forcibly from him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     According to their own version of events, both
                    PW1 and PW2 also exhibited quite bizarre behaviour. First, instead of running
                    straight to Rochor Police Centre or at least seeking help from the people in the
                    surrounding areas after the alleged robbery, PW1 instead went into Mustafa
                    Centre to hide for about 45 minutes. I can accept that PW1 being a foreigner may
                    not be entirely comfortable to report the robbery incident over the phone to the
                    police and would prefer to make a police report at the station. However, it must
                    be borne in mind that it was PW1’s evidence that the appellants and their
                    two friends were chasing him when he ran into Mustafa Centre to hide. PW1 agreed
                    that when he entered Mustafa Centre, he saw the security guards at the
                        entrance.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span>
                    However, when he was asked why he did not seek the assistance of the security
                    guards to inform them that he had just been robbed by four persons and that
                    these robbers had pursued him to the doorsteps of Mustafa Centre, he provided a
                    most incredulous response. He testified that he did not complain to the security
                    guards because “They are not people who will settle outside
                    problems”! If PW1 is to be believed, this was no “outside
                    problem” unless the problem was indeed related to the dispute over the
                    prostitutes as alleged by the appellants. It was, according to PW1, a violent
                    and traumatic robbery and yet he did not take the most obvious step to alert or
                    inform the security guards at the entrance of Mustafa Centre.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     PW2’s version is even more bizarre. He
                    claimed that he was simply walking around the Serangoon Road area after he fled
                    from the robbers. To add to the incredulity of his account, Jullian on sighting
                    PW2, instead of avoiding or running away from him, actually approached PW2 (the
                    victim of the allegedly violent robbery) to ask for a cigarette! The DJ’s
                    analysis of this point was odd to say the least. He observed at [39] of his GD:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I had pointed out that if PW2 had acceded, PW2 would have equally been
                        open to the charge of consorting with someone who had just robbed him and
                        that the inference could not fairly be drawn. At that time, counsel had
                        agreed and had not pursued the matter. But as it has been referred to in one
                        of the submissions of the accused, I will simply say that since PW2 would be
                        open to this accusation whether he agreed or refused, I will not draw an
                        adverse inference from his conduct.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     The point was not whether an adverse inference
                    ought to be drawn against PW2 but rather that his account of the events was
                    inherently incredulous and should be rejected altogether. Further, the
                    DJ’s explanation presupposed the “cigarette” incident did
                    happen. It is Jullian’s case that it did not. The point which was
                    articulated by counsel for the appellants is that it was outrageous to suggest
                    that Jullian would approach the victim of a robbery which had just occurred
                    minutes ago for a cigarette in the middle of Serangoon Road (which was very busy
                    even at that time of the night<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span>) as if nothing had happened. When PW2
                    was questioned on his reaction to the approach by Jullian some 30 minutes after
                    the robbery and assault, he answered “I didn’t feel
                    anything”. Finally, it is difficult to follow the DJ’s reasoning
                    that if PW2 had acceded to Jullian’s request for a cigarette, PW2 would be
                    open to a charge of consorting with the robbers. That was for PW2 to explain and
                    not for the DJ to speculate with an illogical explanation. PW2’s response
                    was he simply refused. In any event, it was inexplicable why PW2 would be open
                    to a charge of consorting if he had simply provided the cigarette to Jullian. He
                    could have done so out of fear if he was to be believed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     It was also bewildering that the appellants,
                    instead of running away to avoid detection and possibly arrest, would instead
                    return to the coffee shop for drinks some ten metres away from the scene of the
                    crime. Such behaviour, in my view, was clearly inconsistent with someone who had
                    just committed an allegedly violent robbery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     PW1 claimed that his t-shirt had some shoe
                    marks and lines as a result of the kick by Jayasekara. These alleged marks would
                    have again provided some corroborative evidence of the kick, the struggle on the
                    ground, and the robbery. Yet PW1 testified that before going to the police
                    station to report the robbery, he had changed into another shirt.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> According to PW1, he was
                    so fearful that he hid in Mustafa Centre for some 45 minutes before going to the
                    police station with PW2 to report the incident, and yet he had time to go back
                    to change to a new shirt before going to the police station, which in the
                    process, had conveniently resulted in the removal of evidence that could support
                    the alleged kick and the ensuing struggle on the ground.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     It was PW2’s evidence that he heard PW1
                    telling Jayasekara at the coffeeshop from a distance: “No, I won’t
                        give”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span>
                    It must be remembered that it is Jayasekara’s case that he sought a
                    partial refund of $20 from PW1 when the prostitute refused to continue her
                    services after she found out that he was a Sri Lankan. PW1 refused and punched
                    Jayasekara when he refused to leave without the refund. However, it is not
                    necessary for me to make a finding whether PW1’s refusal was in relation
                    to Jayasekara’s demand for the refund, suffice to say that perhaps this
                    ought to have been explored in the court below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Were PW1 and PW2 involved in the prostitution trade?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     The DJ observed that it was neither relevant
                    nor necessary to make a finding on PW1’s and PW2’s
                    “profession”. I disagree with the DJ that the issue of PW1’s
                    and PW2’s trade or profession was irrelevant in the context of this case.
                    It was the central theme of the appellants’ defence. Jayasekara alleged
                    that PW1 bore a grudge against him because of his intimate relationship with a
                    prostitute named Nirasha which PW1 had objected to. Both appellants related
                    unpleasant incidents with PW1 on 4 November 2009, shortly before the alleged
                    robbery, over the services of Sri Lankan prostitutes purportedly controlled by
                    PW1. In my opinion, any evidence which suggests that PW1 and PW2 were engaged in
                    the prostitution trade would go some way in supporting the veracity of the
                    appellants’ version of events.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     It is material that PW1 initially testified in
                    court that he had never been out with Nirasha.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> That was entirely inconsistent with
                    the photograph (exhibit D5) which showed PW1 sitting next to Nirasha while
                    on an outing. When he was confronted with D5, PW1 changed his evidence and
                    agreed that he had been out with Nirasha before and claimed that he thought the
                    earlier question was whether he had ever <em>slept</em>
                    with her. Further, PW1 also admitted that he was aware from his friends that
                    Nirasha was working as a prostitute in the Serangoon Road area. As such, there
                    can be no denial that PW1 was at least familiar with one prostitute. It is
                    significant that that prostitute was the one with whom Jayasekara claimed to
                    have an intimate relationship which was objected to by PW1.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     PW1’s evidence that he chose to stay in
                    the Serangoon Road area because it was convenient for him to purchase items for
                    his business<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span>
                    was later shown to be <b><em>false</em></b>, where he made a
                    material admission that he had tried to <b><em>portray</em></b>
                    himself as a businessman:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     It would appear that the reason provided by
                    PW1 for staying in the Serangoon Road area was established to be false. The
                    invoices adduced by PW1 and PW2 in their attempt to prove that they were
                    legitimate businessman who were engaged, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, in the importation of car spare parts and spectacle frames
                    did not support their claim either. Various invoices were submitted in evidence.
                    Out of the fifteen invoices submitted, nine were dated after 4 November
                    2009, the day of the alleged robbery. In respect of the invoices which were
                    dated prior to 4 November 2009, neither PW1’s nor PW2’s names were
                    stated on them. Instead they were addressed to Anura Diesel House
                    (“Anura”). PW1 then claimed that he has a business relationship
                    with Pradeep who was Anura’s purchasing officer. Pradeep was allegedly in
                    Sri Lanka at the time of the trial.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span> PW1 further claimed that when he visits
                    Singapore to buy goods, he does not negotiate with the suppliers directly but
                    buys through Pradeep as the middleman.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span> However, PW1 was able to produce some
                    invoices bearing his name after the date of the alleged robbery. PW1 claimed
                    that he first started coming to Singapore to buy goods some four years
                        ago.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> Yet despite the alleged length of
                    time of trading in Singapore, PW1 was not able to produce a single invoice
                    bearing his name prior to the alleged robbery. It is of course no coincidence
                    that the area where the Sri Lankan prostitutes ply their trade is in the
                    Serangoon Road area. Why spin a false story about the reason for staying in the
                    Serangoon Road area if PW1 was engaged in a legitimate business as he claimed?
                    Finally, even if PW1 had some business dealings in car spare parts or spectacle
                    frames, it did not follow that he was not engaged in the prostitution trade as
                    well.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     PW1’s assertion that he was in Singapore
                    previously to conduct legitimate business was also undermined by revelations
                    that he had used false passports which bore different and false names, to enter
                    Singapore on seven occasions. In that context, Jayasekara’s counsel, in
                    cross-examination highlighted his questionable credibility:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     The repeated use of multiple false passports
                    by PW1 to enter Singapore would be more consistent with an illegitimate
                    trade.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     As demonstrated above, there are several
                        <em>material</em> inconsistencies in the
                    Prosecution’s evidence. The DJ omitted to explain how, despite these
                    material omissions and inconsistencies, the Prosecution’s evidence had
                    remained ‘<em>unshaken</em>’, and how PW1 could
                    be found to be a credible witness in spite of the inconsistencies in his own
                    evidence and various incredulous aspects of his evidence. From the bare
                    treatment accorded to the Prosecution’s case in his GD, it was patently
                    clear that the DJ had failed to attach any or sufficient weight to the material
                    omissions and inconsistencies in the Prosecution’s evidence. Although
                    there is some objective evidence before me to suggest that PW1 and PW2 may have
                    been engaged in the prostitute trade, in light of my findings as regards the
                    Prosecution’s evidence, it is strictly not necessary for me to determine
                    this point. However, it is certainly not as implausible or irrelevant as the DJ
                    had made it out to be.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The DJ’s assessment of the appellants’ evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     In my view, the DJ and the Prosecution had
                    needlessly devoted too much attention in dwelling on immaterial discrepancies in
                    the evidence of the appellants. It really does not take much away from the
                    defence, or add much to the Prosecution’s case, whether Jayasekara was
                    with two friends before he met Jullian; whether Jullian was with Kasun or Deepal
                    before he met Jayasekara; whether it was plausible that Suda Aiya would, before
                    lending $50 to Jayasekara, advise him not to “hang around in the
                    night”; whether it was implausible that Jullian would walk away from the
                    prostitute without any refund given that $50 represented half of Jullian’s
                    disposable income; and whether Jayasekara was punched in the left eyebrow, or
                    the left side of his face or cheek. These are not very significant
                    discrepancies. As held in <em>Chean Siong Guat v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [1969] 2 MLJ 63:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Discrepancies may, in my view, be found in any case for the simple reason
                        that no two persons can describe the same thing in exactly the same way.
                        Sometimes what may appear to be discrepancies are in reality different ways
                        of describing the same thing, or it may happen that the witnesses who are
                        describing the same thing might have seen it in different ways and at
                        different times and that is how discrepancies are likely to arise. These
                        discrepancies may either be minor or serious discrepancies. Absolute truth
                        is I think beyond human perception and conflicting versions of an incident,
                        even by honest and disinterested witnesses, is a common experience. In
                        weighing the testimony of witnesses, human fallibility in observation,
                        retention and recollection are often recognised by the court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     This observation was endorsed in <em>Public Prosecutor v Singh Kalpanath</em> [1995]
                    3 SLR(R) 158 where the Court gave the following guidance in regarding
                    minor discrepancies (at <a href="#p1_60">[60]</a>):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Adequate allowance must be accorded to the human fallibility in retention
                        and recollection. It is also common to find varying accounts of the same
                        incident by the same person. No one can describe the same thing exactly in
                        the same way over and over again: see <em>Chean Siong Guat v
                            PP</em> [1969] 2 MLJ 63</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     Likewise, the Court in <em>Loh
                        Khoon Hai v Public Prosecutor</em> [1996] 1 SLR(R) 958 gave
                    the apt reminder that (at [25]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…The above discrepancies could be explained and were not material
                        so as to affect the credit of Teh. Bearing in mind that the process of
                        testimony is not a memory test, minor inconsistencies are often inevitable.
                        Moreover, there may appear to be inconsistencies due to the way questions
                        are phrased. The crux is whether the totality of the evidence was
                        believable</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Furthermore, the Court in <em>Sim Teck Meng David v Public Prosecutor</em>
                    [2004] SGHC 119 made similar observations that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">At this juncture, I noted that in most criminal trials, there would occur
                        minor discrepancies between the testimonies of two witnesses. One cannot
                        expect perfectly compatible testimonies. Such expectations would negate the
                        fact that between each witness there lay differences in perception,
                        retention and recollection of events. These are factors that must be taken
                        into account when a court is faced with discrepant testimonies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     I pause to observe that the DJ was, however,
                    quite generous in his treatment of the inconsistencies in the evidence of PW1
                    and PW2 at [26] of his GD:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">While the defence sought to make much of discrepancies between PW1’s
                        and PW2’s account of the robbery, to the extent of requiring both
                        witnesses to re-enact PW1’s movements while struggling on the ground
                        with Jayasekara, I would only note that during such a chaotic and confused
                        period, exactness of recall is hardly to be expected and to expect either
                        PW1 or PW2 to remember and to furnish a blow by blow account of what exactly
                        happened is unrealistic.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     I have also noted that the DJ thought it fit
                    to criticise the lack of medical evidence in relation to Jayasekara’s
                    injuries allegedly inflicted by PW1 but at the same time completely failed to
                    take cognizance of the lack of objective evidence as well as the contradictory
                    evidence of the police witnesses in relation to the <em>multiple</em> injuries allegedly suffered by PW1 and
                PW2.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     The DJ observed that although Jayasekara
                    claimed that he had a long antagonistic relationship with PW1, he found it
                    noteworthy that Jayasekara in his initial statement of 4 November 2009 did not
                    name PW1 specifically but referred to him as “the fat male Sri
                    Lankan”. Further in his subsequent statement of 6 November 2009,
                    Jayasekara said that he did not know PW1 and only saw him around and did not
                    know why PW1 would accuse him of robbery. In the immediate preceding sentence of
                    the same statement, Jayasekara said that he had known PW1 for about two years.
                    Viewed in context, it was clear that when Jayasekara said that he did not know
                    PW1, he meant he did not know him <em>personally</em>,
                    otherwise it did not make any sense for him to say in the same breath that he
                    had known him for about two years. While it was true that Jayasekara did not
                    reveal his prior antagonistic relationship with PW1 at the time when the
                    statements were recorded, both appellants had consistently maintained in all
                    their police statements that PW1 and PW2 were pimps for Sri Lankan prostitutes
                    operating in the Serangoon Road area. Furthermore, Jayasekara was somewhat
                    intoxicated and not in a clear mind at that time. Even PW1 testified that
                    Jayasekara was “drunk” at the time of the alleged
                        robbery.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span> In fact PW1 was sure that Jayasekara was drunk
                    because “[o]nce person is drunk, behaviour is
                        different”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     In addition to the above, the DJ disbelieved
                    the appellants’ case that the victims had operated as pimps, and that the
                    appellants were framed by PW1 and PW2 due to a prior dispute over Nirasha. In
                    particular, the DJ observed that if PW1 had assaulted him and had operated as a
                    pimp as alleged by Jayasekara’s account of events, the “last
                    thing” that PW1 would want would be police involvement. However, it is
                    accepted that even if the Defence’s case was <b><em>disbelieved</em></b> by the trial judge, it remained <b><em>imperative</em></b> for the Prosecution to discharge its burden of
                    proving its own case beyond a reasonable doubt. This was emphasised in the
                    Magistrate’s Appeal decision of <em>Teo Keng Pong v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [1996] 2 SLR(R) 890 (at [67]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In my view, there was nothing in the grounds of judgment to indicate that
                        the magistrate did not apply the correct burden or standard of proof. No
                        doubt, the magistrate did not use the words "beyond reasonable doubt",
                        however, it was clear from the manner she approached the issues that she was
                        looking for proof beyond reasonable doubt. Hence, she addressed herself to
                        the question whether PW1's evidence was "unusually convincing". It is
                        pertinent to note that she made a finding that it was, before proceeding to
                        examine the defence evidence. <em>This showed that the
                            magistrate was aware that even if the Defence's evidence was
                            disbelieved, the onus was first and foremost on the Prosecution to prove
                            its case beyond reasonable doubt</em>. The magistrate said that
                        she was convinced that the Prosecution's evidence represented the truth.
                        This was simply another way of saying that she had no reasonable
                        doubt.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Indeed, similar observations were made in <em>Sahadevan</em> (at [35]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…the burden of proof was still on the Prosecution to prove the
                        appellant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, <em>however
                            tenuous the defence might have been</em>…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It was also observed in <em>Tan Edmund v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [1995] 1 SLR(R) 618 that (at [15]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There is no need to deal in minute detail with the defence of the
                        appellant; for however tenuous that defence might have been, the burden
                        still lay on the Prosecution to prove the appellant's guilt beyond
                        reasonable doubt, and in discharging that burden, it was insufficient for
                        them to point to the inadequacies of the appellant's or their witnesses'
                        testimonies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     As such, <em>even if</em>
                    the DJ was to disbelieve the appellants’ case that the victims had
                    operated as pimps and that they had framed the appellants due to a dispute over
                    Nirasha, the onus was, first and foremost, on the Prosecution to establish the
                    charge beyond a reasonable doubt. As already shown above, the Prosecution has
                    significantly failed to adduce evidence of the alleged injuries and failed to
                    provide material corroborative evidence. It was also shown that there were
                    irreconcilable doubts about the credibility of PW1’s and PW2’s
                    evidence in view of the inherently incredulous aspects of their accounts.
                    Moreover, as has already been discussed above (<a href="#p1_59">[59]</a>–<a href="#p1_65">[65]</a>), far from
                    being tenuous, the appellants’ case appeared to be supported by some
                    objective evidence. In this regard, it is helpful to refer to the decision of
                        <em>Sahadevan</em>, where the facts of that case bear
                    similarities to the present case in several material respects:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_74-p2_a"></a>(a)     Like the present case, there was no
                        evidence of the fruits of the robbery despite the arrest, hours after the
                        alleged robbery.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_74-p2_b"></a>(b)     The victim alleged that the accused had burnt his special pass at the
                        time of the robbery. The police claimed that they searched the area for
                        evidence of burnt paper and were unable to find anything. Here the police
                        did not even search the area for the broken beer bottle. <em>A fortiori</em>, like <em>Sahadevan</em>,
                        any doubt as to whether the beer bottle was thrown at PW1 and PW2 should be
                        resolved in favour of the appellants.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_74-p2_c"></a>(c)     There was also no medical evidence to support the injury
                        alleged by the victim. However, the court in <em>Sahadevan</em> did not regard this absence as decisive as it was
                        of the view that a trial judge was entitled to find that hurt has been
                        caused with or without medical evidence. However, the difference between
                            <em>Sahadevan</em> and the present case as regards
                        the lack of medical evidence is that in the present case, the alleged claims
                        of various injuries were <em>contradicted</em> by the
                        testimonies of several police officers, <em>ie</em>
                        PW3, PW4 and PW5.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_74-p2_d"></a>(d)     I should add for completeness that in <em>Sahadevan</em>, the court also found that there were material
                        inconsistencies between the allegations stated in the victim’s First
                        Information Report and his testimony in court. Similarly, there were
                        material inconsistencies in the evidence of PW1 and PW2. In the present
                        case, the First Information Report (“FIR”) was unhelpful as it
                        had only oddly recorded a bare sentence which merely stated “two male
                        subjects detained” and nothing more.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span> Typically, one would have
                        thought that the events recorded on the FIR would have preceded any arrest
                        or detention of suspects. Nonetheless, as counsel for the appellants did not
                        submit on the unusual nature of the FIR, I shall say no more in that
                        regard.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_74-p2_e"></a>(e)     The
                        court in <em>Sahadevan</em> also found inconsistencies
                        in the evidence of the accused and arrived at the conclusion that
                        “the appellant was unable to establish an affirmative defence to
                        prove his innocence” (see <em>Sahadevan</em> at
                            [36]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     On the basis of the evidence before the court,
                    Yong CJ in <em>Sahadevan</em> held that the conviction was
                    unsafe and set aside the conviction and the sentence. He stressed that
                    “[i]n discharging this burden, it was not at all sufficient for the
                    Prosecution to merely point to the inadequacies of the appellant’s
                    testimony”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     The appellants’ case theory was that PW1
                    and PW2 had fabricated the robbery and the alleged injuries to frame them due to
                    disputes over prostitutes beginning with Jayasekara’s relationship with
                    Nirasha. In arriving at my decision, it was strictly not necessary for me to
                    determine the motive behind PW1’s and PW2’s complaint. In making my
                    decision, the key consideration was the fundamental principle of law which
                    requires the Prosecution to prove the charges beyond a reasonable doubt. Having
                    examined the evidence carefully and assessed the case in its entirety, it was
                    evidently clear that, this was a classic case of the DJ <em>reversing</em> the burden of proof and convicting the appellants
                    simply because he found various aspects of the appellants’ evidence to be
                    implausible. From the material inconsistencies found in the Prosecution’s
                    evidence, the manifest lack of independent corroborative evidence to support the
                    Prosecution’s case, and the inherently incredulous aspects in the
                    Prosecution’s version of events, the Prosecution had clearly failed to
                    prove its case against the appellants beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     I was mindful of the limited situations under
                    which an appellate court will disturb the findings of fact by the trial judge.
                    However in this case, the DJ not only misdirected himself on the crucial
                    question on burden of proof, he also failed to provide any proper basis for his
                    determination that PW1’s and PW2’s evidence were “<em>unshaken</em>”. Given the absence of any reasoning by
                    the DJ, the appellate court was free to form its own independent opinion about
                    the proper inference to be drawn from the evidence before me.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     For the reasons above, I find the convictions
                    to be unsafe and accordingly, I allow the appeal and set aside the convictions
                    and sentences.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     In arriving at my decision, I was greatly
                    assisted by Mr Fernando and Mr Lam, counsel for the appellants who pursued the
                    appeal before me with vigour, passion and conviction. I commend them for their
                        <em>pro-bono</em> work.</p>
