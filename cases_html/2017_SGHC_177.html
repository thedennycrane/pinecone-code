Surviving her were her four sons and four daughters; her husband, Tan Yee Tam (“TYT”) had passed away in 2002. Mdm Tan left behind two wills and a piece of property at 2 Wiltshire Road (“the Property”). The first will was made on 4 June 2008 (“the 2008 Will”); the plaintiff, Mr Tan Kim Heng, who is Mdm Tan’s second eldest son, was the sole beneficiary under this will.

Finally, I awarded costs to the defendant and made an order for the defendant to be indemnified by Mdm Tan’s estate for all costs incurred by her in defending this action less the costs paid or recovered from the plaintiff.

The 2015 Will was prepared by Mr Tan Lam Siong, a lawyer who had acted for Mdm Tan in a property dispute some years ago. Mr Tan Lam Siong was a witness to the 2015 Will.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 On 16 January 2015, Mdm Tan was admitted to Tan Tock Seng Hospital (“the Hospital”) because her toe had become gangrenous. Her doctor advised her that amputation was necessary as otherwise she could die. Mdm Tan refused surgery and on 24 January 2015, she was discharged from the Hospital and returned to the Property. Mdm Tan passed away two days later, on 26 February 2015.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The issues </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 The three issues that arose for my determination were:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) whether the 2015 Will was valid;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) whether the 2008 Will was valid; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) whether Mdm Tan had disposed of her equitable interest in the Property to herself and the plaintiff as joint tenants.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 In his pleaded case, the plaintiff had also claimed that Mdm Tan had declared a trust over her equitable interest in the Property in favour of herself and the plaintiff as joint owners.

It was clear from the evidence that Mdm Tan did not lack testamentary capacity when she executed the 2015 Will. In his closing submissions, the plaintiff also decided not to dispute Mdm Tan’s testamentary capacity. The evidence also showed that the 2015 Will was explained to Mdm Tan and she understood the 2015 Will before she signed it. Finally, there was no evidence that she signed the 2015 Will under undue influence. Indeed, the evidence showed that Mdm Tan was a strong lady who was strong-willed and that she remained so even during the time that she was hospitalised shortly before she passed away.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether Mdm Tan had disposed of her equitable interest in the Property</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 As stated earlier at [9], Mdm Tan inherited the Property as the sole beneficiary under TYT’s will.

It was not disputed that Mdm Tan’s interest in the Property was therefore an equitable one. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 The plaintiff’s case was that Mdm Tan’s equitable interest in the Property ceased to be a part of her estate because she had disposed of her equitable interest in the Property in favour of herself and the plaintiff as joint tenants before she died. Therefore, the plaintiff claimed that the interest in the Property devolved to him upon Mdm Tan’s death by virtue of the rule of survivorship. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 It was common ground that under s 7(2) of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed) (“CLA”), a “disposition of an equitable interest … must be in writing signed by the person disposing of the same …”.

However, this was not pursued during his closing submissions, and rightly so. The Transmission Application simply could not be a disposition by Mdm Tan of her equitable interest in the Property. The purpose of the Transmission Application was merely to register the Property in the names of Mdm Tan and the plaintiff in their capacities as the personal representatives of TYT’s estate.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the Affidavit was a disposition</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 It will be recalled that OS 127/2008 was an application by Mdm Tan and the plaintiff, initially for a declaration that they were the legal and beneficial owners of the Property. Subsequently, Netto realised that the Property should be vested in TYT’s estate instead. OS 127/2008 was then amended to include an alternative prayer that the Property be vested in TYT’s estate. The court granted an order in terms of this alternative prayer. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The Affidavit described what OS 995/2006 was about and referred to the High Court’s decision dismissing the claim in OS 995/2006 and the Court of Appeal’s decision dismissing the appeal.

The plaintiff submitted that the Affidavit, read with OS 127/2008, constituted Mdm Tan’s disposition of her equitable interest in the Property.

</div>
</div> I disagreed with the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 In my view, the Affidavit, read with OS 127/2008, could not possibly be construed as a disposition of Mdm Tan’s equitable interest in the Property. The prayer in OS 127/2008 (which the plaintiff relied on) was for a declaration that Mdm Tan and the plaintiff were the legal and beneficial owners of the Property. This was clearly not a disposition. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 At best, it might be argued that the prayer for a declaration as to ownership assumed that Mdm Tan had disposed of her equitable interest to herself and the plaintiff. However, in my judgment, the evidence clearly contradicted any such assumption.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 First, there was no suggestion in Netto’s evidence, or in the letters that she wrote to Mdm Tan in 2008, that Mdm Tan had disposed of her equitable interest. Had there been such a disposition, one would have expected some mention of this by Netto since she was handling the matters relating to the Property then.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Second, the Affidavit was signed by Mdm Tan in January 2008. Subsequently, Mdm Tan executed the 2008 Will in June 2008. Netto drafted the 2008 Will for Mdm Tan because Mdm Tan had expressed her wish that her estate be passed to the plaintiff upon her death. It was not disputed that the main asset in Mdm Tan’s estate was the Property. There would have been no need for the 2008 Will if Mdm Tan had already disposed of her equitable interest in the Property to the plaintiff. In his closing submissions, the plaintiff tried to explain that Mdm Tan signed the 2008 Will as a precaution. However, this was contradicted by Netto’s letter to Mdm Tan and the plaintiff dated 23 April 2008.

</div> In that letter, Netto advised Mdm Tan and the plaintiff to make a will to “safeguard each other’s position” since “the vesting of the title in one or both of [them] may not take place until an order [was] obtained.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 In my view, the plaintiff’s allegation that Mdm Tan had disposed of her equitable interest in the Property to herself and the plaintiff as joint tenants was nothing more than a mere afterthought. This was evident for the following reasons: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The plaintiff filed the present action on 17 March 2015, just four days after he obtained a copy of the 2015 Will. In his statement of claim dated 17 March 2015, the plaintiff challenged the 2015 Will and sought a declaration that the 2008 Will was the valid will. The statement of claim contained no allegation that Mdm Tan had disposed of her equitable interest in the Property.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The plaintiff amended his statement of claim on 3 July 2015 and again on 30 October 2015. Yet, in both cases, the statement of claim continued to remain silent as to any disposition by Mdm Tan of her interest in the Property. Instead, the plaintiff pleaded that Mdm Tan gave her entire estate to him pursuant to the 2008 Will.

Further, the plaintiff pleaded for the first time that Mdm Tan had disposed of her equitable interest in the Property to herself and the plaintiff as joint owners. This time, the plaintiff relied on the cause papers filed in OS 127/2008 and on the Transmission Application. The plaintiff also pleaded for the first time the alternative claim that Mdm Tan had declared a trust over her equitable interest in the Property in favour of herself and the plaintiff as joint owners. In my view, it spoke volumes that the plaintiff was alleging a disposition of Mdm Tan’s equitable interest in the Property for the first time almost two years after he commenced this action and despite having had several opportunities to do so earlier when he amended his pleadings. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the Affidavit satisfied s 7(2) of the CLA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Even if one accepted the prayer for the declaration as to ownership as evidence that Mdm Tan had disposed of her equitable interest to herself and the plaintiff, the Affidavit would still not be sufficient for the purposes of s 7(2) of the CLA.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 The language in s 7(2) of the CLA is clear.

Accordingly, the defendant could not rely on non-compliance with s 7(2) of the CLA to defeat the disposition of Mdm Tan’s equitable interest in the Property to the plaintiff and herself as joint tenants. This argument was irrelevant given my finding that there was no such disposition of Mdm Tan’s equitable interest in the Property in the first place. In any event, in my view, the doctrine of part performance did not assist the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Courts have generally taken a pragmatic approach in applying the doctrine of part performance to mitigate against the rigours of the strict requirement of writing, in order to prevent a statute from being used as an instrument of fraud.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 As mentioned earlier, the acts of part performance must be referable to the disposition (see [41] above). This means that the acts relied upon should point to the existence of the disposition: <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore</span> vol 7 (LexisNexis, 2016 Reissue) at para 80.139. In my view, none of the acts of part performance relied on by the plaintiff could be said to be referable to the disposition of Mdm Tan’s equitable interest in the Property to the plaintiff and herself as joint tenants. It must be borne in mind that the plaintiff’s case was that the Affidavit was the disposition. The acts set out at [42(a)] – [42(d)] above took place before the disposition and did not point to the existence of the disposition. The signing of the Affidavit (see [42(e)] above) was relied upon as the disposition itself and therefore could not be an act referable to the existence of the disposition. As for the 2008 Will (see [42(f)] above), the making of that will in fact contradicted the existence of the disposition. In my view, the plaintiff therefore could not rely on the doctrine of part performance. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 As the plaintiff had failed to prove his case, I dismissed his claim. I allowed the defendant’s counterclaim and declared the 2015 Will to be the last valid will of Mdm Tan. I also declared that the Property formed a part of Mdm Tan’s estate. Under the 2015 Will, Mdm Tan’s eight children will share equally in her estate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 I rejected the defendant’s application for costs on an indemnity basis and ordered the plaintiff to pay the defendant’s costs of this action fixed at $135,000 plus disbursements to be fixed by me if not agreed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Finally, I granted the defendant’s application that she be indemnified by the estate of Mdm Tan for all costs reasonably incurred by her in defending this action less such costs paid by or recovered from the plaintiff. The defence of this action was clearly for the benefit of all the beneficiaries of Mdm Tan’s estate under the 2015 Will.</div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left">Chua Lee Ming  <br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Eugene Singarajah Thuraisingam and Suang Wijaya (Eugene Thuraisingam LLP) for the plaintiff;<br/>Lim Seng Siew and Susan Tay Ting Lan (OTP Law Corporation) for the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"> </div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
