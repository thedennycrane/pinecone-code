<font color="#3322AA" face="Times New Roman" size="4">JUDGMENT:</font>
</strong>
</p>
<p xmlns=""><font color="#804040" face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>Grounds of Judgment</strong></font><b><u></u></b></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">1.    This case concerns an agreement for

the hire of photo-copying machines. The plaintiffs and the defendants charge the other

with breach of contract. There are two plaintiffs. Mr Thomson Teo Chin Leng and Madam

Doreen Woo Poh Choon. Madam Woo is the mother of Thomson Teo (the first plaintiff). The

first plaintiff started a small business and called it "Thomson Copy Service".

His mother became a partner in 1992. The business provided services such as photocopying,

binding, lamination and printing. Their principal customers were large enterprises. They

carried on their business at the material time at Block 554 Woodlands Drive. They rent the

premises for their business.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">2.    The plaintiffs’ business

relationship with the defendants began in 1986. The defendants are suppliers of

photocopying machines. The defendants run a fairly large business for their annual

turnover in the band of millions of dollars.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">3.    In late 1995 the plaintiffs found

that their business was doing well. At that time, the machine which did the speed-copying

was a model supplied by the defendants. It was called Model 3050. It was also called a

Selex copier. The plaintiffs had no problem with that machine. But they wanted to expand

their business. So they decided to upgrade the machine to a state-of-the-art machine. It

was a Fuji FX 5100 model. This machine was capable of printing A-4 size documents at a

super speed. It also had other attractive automation features. It was described as "A

wealth of features provides a wealth of opportunities". Persuaded by the

defendants’ salesman the plaintiffs agreed to rent the machine. In the event the

plaintiffs rented three machines in 1995 under two hire or rental agreements. The

agreements were for renting and not hire purchase. The three machines were :</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p><font face="Times New Roman">1. XEROX 3060 PLAN PRINTER</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">2. A 935 COLOUR COPIER</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">3. XEROX 5100 COPIER</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">The 3060 model was covered by a single rental and a full

service agreement dated 22 August 1995. There was no dispute or claim in respect of that

machine. The other two machines were covered by a rental agreement and a full service

dated 28 September 1995. The first plaintiff signed the agreements for the partnership

constituted by the two plaintiffs. The second defendant at that time was his partner. The

son reported to the Registry of Businesses on 22<sup> </sup>September 1999 that he left

the partnership on 31 October 1998. The mother therefore became the sole-proprietor. His

departure, however, had no difference to the relationship between them and the defendants

or the present proceedings. This was because this action concerns a contract signed by

both plaintiffs while they were partners. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">4.    It is fitting now to refer to the

relevant provisions of the rental agreement in respect of the A 935 and 5100 models :

(Except otherwise stated "the agreement" means the rental agreement of 28

September 1995).</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(a) The rental period was 84 months (7 years). The monthly

  hire payments were structured in this way : $1998 for the first 36 months, $3998 for the

  next 24 months and $5448 for the next 24 months. There was deferred rental of $19,751

  payable at the end of the agreement. They made a total of $318,383. The rental was in

  respect of both machines. There was an interest clause of 15% p.a. on overdues.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(b) The agreement provided by clause 3 that "The

  agreement cannot be cancelled or terminated except as expressly provided herein". </font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(c) Clause 10 provided that the defendants "may at

  any time terminate this Rental Agreement and repossess the Equipment if the Customer is in

  breach of this Agreement".</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">5.    Clause 12 provided as follows :</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p><font face="Times New Roman">"Upon the premature termination of this agreement

  pursuant to clause 10 or for any other reason, the Customer shall pay FXS the total of the

  following amounts:</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(a) all costs and expenses hereby incurred by FXS

    including any costs in relation to termination of this Agreement and repossession of the

    Equipment; </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(b) the total rent due and owing at the time of such

    payment;</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(c) total amount payable under this agreement less those

    paid to the date of premature termination and those due but unpaid as noted in 12(b)

    above; and</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(d) an administration fee of $100."</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">6.    The agreement stipulated 604

Sembawang Road #03-18, Sembawang Shopping Centre as the installation address. The

plaintiffs’ rented the unit for running the business. The area of the unit was a mere

365.2 square feet. That hypothetically measures 15 feet by 24 feet. Within that space the

plaintiffs had five machines. The defendants undertook the responsibility of installing

the new machine. This required some electrical work. In that there was a glitch and the

plaintiffs became bedevilled by it. It was explained by the second plaintiff, Doreen Woo,

in her evidence before me as follows :</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p><font face="Times New Roman">"That place is not meant for this big machine… .</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">We need to change some of the electrical points …

  before the machine cane come in to be used.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The electricity tripped in the Sembawang Shopping Centre

  when the electrician came to fix. It tripped even before the machine came. When the

  electricity tripped the landlord came to know about it because all the neighbouring shops

  were blacked out. During the blackout a lot of the other shops were affected. Their cash

  register cannot be opened. Some of them – the neighbouring shop – some of their

  customers were in the fitting room and there was quite a chaos. It disturbed a lot of

  other tenants as well. So the landlord "already told us that if this is going to

  happen when you bring in this machine, I will not allow".</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">7.    The plaintiffs were unable to accept

the machine into Unit 03-18 Sembawang Shopping Centre. If they returned it they would be

in breach of the agreement. In the event the machine was delivered to another place at

Boon Lay; it belonged to Doreen Woo’s brother.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">8.    The plaintiffs continued to pay the

monthly rent for all three machines – that is 3060, A935 and FX 5100. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">9.    Then they defaulted in the payment of

rents. The default occurred in the middle of 1998. The default was in respect of all three

machines.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">10.    Then in November 1999 the plaintiffs

filed this action asserting that the defendants were in breach of contract. The basic

allegation of breach was that the FX 5100 was not fit for the purpose which it was hired.

The other breaches the plaintiffs relied on were : The defendants agreed to change the

equipment if required but failed to do so. Further the defendants "guaranteed to

replace any equipment if it was not fit for whatever purpose for which it was specifically

hired for" but failed to do so. The plaintiffs further alleged that the electrical

power requirement of FX 5100 was such that it could not be used at the Sembawang Shopping

Centre and the defendants were at fault in failing to ascertain the feasibility of using

the machine at that place. It was alleged that the defendants were in the wrong in

prematurely recommending FX 5100 without doing a site survey first. Further it was pleaded

that the defendants "failed/refused/neglected to remedy the situation for the

plaintiffs and had in fact forced a delivery of the said equipment to another premise at

Boon Lay".</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">11.    Based on those assertions the

plaintiffs claimed huge losses and damages. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">12.    The defendants denied any breach by

them and asserted that the plaintiffs were in breach. They made these positive assertions

: There was nothing wrong with FX 5100. It was the plaintiffs’ responsibility to

provide for sufficient electricity supply. The defendants agreed to change or replace the

machine only if its performance was not according to the specifications. The plaintiffs

actually accepted the machine because the delivery at the Boon Lay premises was at the

request of the plaintiffs. The machine functioned properly at the Boon Lay premises where

there was no problem relating to the electricity supply.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">13.    The defendants counterclaimed the

following amounts as debt being outstanding rentals :</font></p>

</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">14.    The real issue for determination was

whether the FX 5100 supplied by the defendants was not fit for the purpose it was

purchased. Undoubtedly it was. There was not a thread of evidence even to indicate that it

was not. In fact when it was installed at Boon Lay it performed according to the

contractual specification under normal supply of electricity.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">15.    At the trial the plaintiffs

attempted to make a big issue of the fact it was not installed at Sembawang Shopping

Centre. It was said that the contractual place of installation was Sembawang Shopping

Centre. It was not installed there. Therefore the defendants were in breach of contract.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">16.    When all the evidence came to light

it became abundantly clear that the defendants were ready able and willing to install it

at the Sembawang Shopping Centre. The fault lay squarely with the plaintiffs. The

plaintiffs were trying to squeeze the FX 5100 into the small space they had rented and

thereby alarmed their landlord. The landlord forbade them to bring the FX 5100 machine

into the building. Madam Woo admitted this in her oral evidence before me. She had also

made an admission to the same effect in a letter of 8 October 1998 (AB 21). It contained

the following admission :</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p><font face="Times New Roman">"The reason is that we could not get permission to

  bring the machine into Sembawang Shopping Centre as the size and weight of the machine is

  not allowed by the landlord. Therefore, since the day we took delivery of the machine 3

  years ago, we had to place the machine at Boon Lay (leased space from a relative’s

  shop unit)"</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">17.    The first plaintiff

added a gloss to it. These are the extracts from his evidence before me : (NE 17, 18, 20).</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"So what happened was when the

  electrician came down, he installed the electricity and changed the ampere from 20 ampere

  to 20. Then after that, he tests and the whole row of the shop all black-out : So we are

  frightened, then we asked him "how, how come black-out?".</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">So the next day, then we called Gerry.

  Then he said must pay $10,000 to upgrade to another type of electricity, the industrial or

  what, I am not sure what it is. So we are shocked, $10,000.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Mr Gerry told us that must change and pay

  another $10,000 to change electricity. … So $10,000; I don’t think I can come

  out one shot $10,000. Before this the FX 5100 was already at Boon Lay for two

  months."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">18.    The evidence of both

plaintiffs sealed the fate of their case. It was not a breach of contract by the

defendants. It was the plaintiffs who were unable to receive it at Sembawang Shopping

Centre and asked for it to be delivered at Boon Lay. They, thus, attempted to take

advantage of their own wrong all their allegations against the defendants were a flight of

fancy.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">19.    Accordingly, I

decided against the plaintiffs and decided in favour of the defendants and gave judgment

on their counterclaim in the sum of $223,506.92.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">20.    The amount awarded

to the defendants require an explanation. The plaintiffs did not effectively submit on the

defendants’ quantum. However, I felt that the claim for full rental for the entire

period may not be reasonable. This was particularly so in respect of the FX 5100. The

defendants in the end decided to reduce by half their claim for undue rental and deferred

rental. That in my view was fair and reasonable. The new quantum added up to $223,506.92.

This was the amount for which I gave judgment on the counterclaim. Costs followed the

event.</font></p>
