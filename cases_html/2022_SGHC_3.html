Instead, s 24A applies to all claims in tort, whether or not the tort is a strict-liability tort or a fault-based tort. Indeed, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Yan Jun v Attorney-General</span> [2015] 1 SLR 752 (“<span class="font-italic">Yan </span><span class="font-italic">Jun</span>”) at [61] expressly stated that a purposive interpretation of s 24A(1) would entail reading the phrase “breach of duty” as encompassing all torts.

As the E-mails were published on 13 and 14 August 2011 and received by Mr Ho on or around the same time, more than six years have passed from the date on which the cause of action accrued.

The question, therefore, is when the plaintiff knew of their existence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 As the Court of Appeal held in <span class="font-italic">I</span><span class="font-italic">PP Financial Advisers</span> at [37] and [41], the legal burden of proof rests on the plaintiff to establish that his claim is not time-barred. Accordingly, the plaintiff in the present case bears the evidential burden of adducing some not inherently incredible evidence showing that he first saw the E-mails on 25 November 2017. If the plaintiff is able to adduce such evidence, the evidential burden then shifts to the defendant to adduce evidence in rebuttal. If no evidence in rebuttal is adduced, the court may conclude from the evidence of the plaintiff that the legal burden is discharged. If evidence in rebuttal is adduced by the defendant, the evidential burden shifts back to the plaintiff. If, ultimately, the evidential burden comes to rest on the defendant, the legal burden of proving that the claim is not time-barred would have been discharged by the plaintiff: see <span class="font-italic">SCT Technologies</span><span class="font-italic"> Pte Ltd v Western Copper Co Ltd </span>[2016] 1 SLR 1471 (“<span class="font-italic">SCT Technologies</span>”) at [19].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 The plaintiff’s evidence that he first saw the E-mails on 25 November 2017 is believable. Against this, the defendant did not adduce evidence refuting the plaintiff’s account of events. In particular, there is no evidence that the plaintiff came to know of the factual essence of his claim in libel, or the defendant’s identity, during the MRL Board or KPMG’s investigations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The plaintiff’s account of what transpired on 25 November 2017 in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”) and on the stand is internally consistent. Some weight must also be given to the fact that the plaintiff’s evidence is corroborated by Mdm Chung’s account of events.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The defendant points out that apart from Mdm Chung’s evidence, there is no independent or objective evidence corroborating the plaintiff’s assertion that he only found out about the E-mails on 25 November 2017. This is indeed the state of the evidence before me. There is no independent testimony from the plaintiff’s neighbours corroborating the plaintiff’s and Mdm Chung’s claim that there was a water leakage incident, and that they went down to Shunfu Ville to check on the situation on 25 November 2017. In addition, neither the Envelope nor the A4 papers were adduced as evidence before me. The plaintiff claimed that he could not recall what he did with the Envelope and the A4 papers and had assumed that these were either lost or destroyed during the move.

</div> The plaintiff’s evidence was that during the meeting, the MRL Board informed him that it had received a whistle-blowing report in relation to PT Aneka. As the plaintiff was involved in the running of PT Aneka and for confidentiality reasons, the plaintiff was not allowed to have sight of the whistle-blowing report.

</div> This is not far-fetched evidence.

The only topic of discussion which came close to alluding to the contents of the E-mails relates to the discussion about how the operations in Indonesia were important to MRL and that the whistle-blowing report would invariably affect the relationship between MRL and its major customer, Bayan Resources.

</div> I accept the plaintiff’s explanation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Finally, I reject the defendant’s argument that the plaintiff must have had a reasonable belief that the defendant had made a complaint against him in 2011, as a result of the friction between them. At its highest, the disagreements the plaintiff had with the defendant would only lead the plaintiff to <span class="font-italic">speculate</span> that the defendant might have lodged a complaint against him and, even if the plaintiff had believed that the defendant made a complaint against him, he would not be privy to the contents of the E-mails. The defendant also argues that if the plaintiff had enquired about the complaints propelling the investigations back in 2011, he could have found out about the E-mails. This is a highly speculative claim as there is no evidence that Mr Ho or the MRL Board would have been willing to disclose their source to the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In the main, I am satisfied that the plaintiff has discharged his legal burden of showing that he first came to know about the factual essence of his complaint, and the identity of the defendant, on 25 November 2017.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the damage would lead a reasonable person to consider it sufficiently serious to institute proceedings, and when the plaintiff knew of material facts about the damage</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 By the same token, it was only on 25 November 2017 that the plaintiff came to know of the material facts about the damage he sustained.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The damage was of a nature that would lead a reasonable person to consider commencing proceedings. The Alleged Defamatory Statements claim that the plaintiff was guilty of cheating, abuse, criminal breach of trust, and multiple instances of corruption over some years. The total amount of ill-gotten gains the plaintiff allegedly obtained from his misconduct amounted to at least US$2.1 million. On the face of the E-mails, these grave allegations were made known to Mr Ho, the CEO of MRL. In these circumstances, a reasonable person in the plaintiff’s position would take the view that these publications had seriously diminished his reputation and thereby seek recourse through the courts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 The defendant argues that the plaintiff had merely suffered some inconvenience due to the various investigations. His appointment as a director was not terminated and no prosecution was pursued against him due to the investigations.

</div> However, this argument ignores the fact that a claim in libel seeks compensation for the injury to one’s reputation and the distress one has to endure due to the publication of the defamatory material. For the reasons set out above, a reasonable person in the plaintiff’s shoes would most probably invoke the court process to claim compensation upon discovering the E-mails.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Therefore, time starts running from 25 November 2017.

It is evident on the face of the E-mails that the natural and ordinary meanings of the Alleged Defamatory Statements are what the plaintiff alleges (see above at [7] and [8]-), and those natural and ordinary meanings are defamatory. They contain allegations that the plaintiff committed multiple transgressions which could constitute criminal offences and reaped at least US$2.1 million from his dishonest ways. This would clearly lower the plaintiff’s standing in the estimation of right-thinking members of society. Finally, the Alleged Defamatory Statements refer to the plaintiff and the E-mails were published to Mr Ho. The Alleged Defamatory Statements were also republished (see below at [138]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 The defendant does not put up much of a fight in so far as these three requirements are concerned. Rather, his case is that the plaintiff’s claim in libel should be defeated because no real and substantial tort has been committed. In so arguing, the defendant relies on the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Yan </span><span class="font-italic">Jun</span>, which he claims followed the decision in <span class="font-italic">Jameel (Yousef) </span><span class="font-italic">v Dow Jones &amp; Co Inc </span>[2005] 2 WLR 1614 (“<span class="font-italic">Jameel</span>”).

</div> For context, the English case of <span class="font-italic">Jameel</span> stands for the general principle that a claim which discloses no real and substantial tort is liable to be struck out for being an abuse of process of the court (“the <span class="font-italic">Jameel </span>principle”) (see <span class="font-italic">Yan</span><span class="font-italic"> Jun</span> at [120]). The defendant argues that in the present case, no real and substantial tort has been committed because of the limited publication of the E-mails to Mr Ho and the limited particularity with which republication is pleaded. Specifically, the plaintiff’s pleadings do not state how he could be certain that the E-mails would be republished to the MRL Board, how many persons from the MRL Board the E-mails were republished to and their exact identities, and what damage was caused by the alleged republication.

</div> Even if the <span class="font-italic">Jameel</span> principle was to be accepted as part of Singapore law, the plaintiff argues that it is wholly inappropriate to apply the <span class="font-italic">Jameel</span> principle in the present case. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Yan Jun</span> at [118] had cautioned that the <span class="font-italic">Jameel</span> principle must be approached with the “necessary circumspection” [emphasis in original omitted] by the Singapore courts in light of how <span class="font-italic">Jameel</span> was decided under fundamentally different procedural rules and the potentially far-reaching nature of the principle. The plaintiff also relies on several High Court decisions which have confined the application of the <span class="font-italic">Jameel</span> principle.

</div></div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The E-mails were in fact republished to the MRL Board.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Even assuming that the E-mails were only published to Mr Ho, this was a situation where limited publication caused the plaintiff great embarrassment or distress and might have blighted his financial prospects. In particular, the injury suffered by the plaintiff here is greater than what was suffered by the claimant in <span class="font-italic">Yan Jun</span> because the Alleged Defamatory Statements implicated the plaintiff, who was a director of a public listed company at the material time, in multiple instances of corruption, cheating, abuse and criminal breach of trust.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 I agree with the plaintiff that the <span class="font-italic">Jameel</span> principle is not binding on this court. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Yan Jun</span> at [120] acknowledged that the case of <span class="font-italic">Jameel</span> contains some general principles that may be applicable in the Singapore context, but its discussion relating to <span class="font-italic">Jameel</span> is purely <span class="font-italic">obiter</span>. Even if the <span class="font-italic">Jameel</span> principle is binding on this court, the plaintiff’s claim in libel cannot be dismissed as an abuse of process for not disclosing a real and substantial tort.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 First, as Aedit Abdullah J noted in <span class="font-italic">Lee</span><span class="font-italic"> Hsien Loong v Leong Sze Hian</span> [2021] 4 SLR 1128 (“<span class="font-italic">Leong Sze Hian</span>”) at [69], the case of <span class="font-italic">Jameel</span> was really a case concerned with private international law principles and issues of forum shopping. These do not arise in the present case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Second, even if I accept that the <span class="font-italic">Jameel</span> principle extends beyond such situations, this court should not reject a claim in defamation as readily as the court in <span class="font-italic">Jameel</span> did. In holding that the claim in defamation did not amount to a real and substantial tort, the court in <span class="font-italic">Jameel</span> at [55] remarked that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">There have been two recent developments which have rendered the court more ready to entertain a submission that pursuit of a libel action is an abuse of process</span><span class="font-weight-bold">. </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The first is the introduction of the new Civil Proce</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">dure Rules</span><span class="font-italic">.</span> Pursuit of the overriding objective requires an approach by the court to litigation that is both more flexible and more proactive. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The second is the coming into effect of the Human Rights Act 1998</span>. Section 6 requires the court, as a public authority, to administer the law in a manner which is compatible with Convention rights, in so far as it is possible to do so. <span class="font-italic">Keeping a proper balance between the article 10 right of freedom of </span><span class="font-italic">expression and the protection of individual reputation must, so it seems to us, require the court to bring to a stop as an abuse of process defamation proceedings that are not serving the legitimate purpose of protecting the claimant’s reputation, which includes compensating the claimant only if that reputation has been unlawfully damaged. </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">It is for this reason that the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Yan Jun</span> stated that the principle enunciated in <span class="font-italic">Jameel</span> should be approached with necessary circumspection (at [118]). In <span class="font-italic">Leong Sze Hian</span> at [67], the High Court also observed that a broad-brush approach in applying the <span class="font-italic">Jameel</span> principle is not entirely appropriate since <span class="font-italic">Jameel </span>was largely animated by legal developments unique to the United Kingdom which find no ready parallel in Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Third, it is evident from the case of <span class="font-italic">Jameel </span>that the thrust of the mischief which the <span class="font-italic">Jameel</span> principle seeks to address is the abuse of process in “commit[ting] the resources of the…court” to an action where “so little is … at stake” (<span class="font-italic">Jameel </span>at [69]–[70]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">If the claimant succeeds in this action</span> and is awarded a small amount of damages, it can perhaps be said that he will have achieved vindication for the damage done to his reputation in this country, <span class="font-italic">but both the damage and the vindication will be minimal</span>. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The cost of the exercise will have been out of</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> all proportion to what has been achieved</span>. <span class="font-italic">The game will not merely not have</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">been worth the candle, it will not have been worth the wick.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">It would be an abuse of process to continue to commit the resources of the English court, including substantial judge and possibly jury time, to an action where so little is now seen to be at stake. </span>…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In determining whether the present claim is one where so little is at stake, the court should not<span class="font-italic"> solely</span> look at the extent of the publication. As observed by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Yan Jun</span> at [118], citing <span class="font-italic">Gatley on Libel and Slander </span>(Alistair Mullis &amp; Richard Parkes QC joint eds) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 12th Ed, 2013) (“<span class="font-italic">Gatley</span>”) at para 6.2, the question of whether there has been a real and substantial tort cannot depend upon a numbers game. Rather, the question is one of a cost-benefit calculation: “costs” in terms of the parties’ costs and the impact upon the court’s increasingly hard-pressed resources, and “benefit” in terms of the true value to the plaintiff of any realistically available remedy. This is ultimately a fact-sensitive inquiry. As Choo Han Teck J said in <span class="font-italic">Chan Boon Siang and others v Jasmin Nisban</span> [2018] 3 SLR 498 at [7], “[t]he crux of the matter is that although the court’s resources ought not to be used for the pursuit of trivial or pointless claims, each case must be determined on its own facts”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Bearing in mind the principles set out at [60] and [61], the plaintiff’s claim in libel cannot be struck down under the <span class="font-italic">Jameel</span> principle, because a real and substantial tort has been committed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 First, the plaintiff has sufficiently pleaded the republication of the Alleged Defamatory Statements to members of the MRL Board. Paragraph 6 of the plaintiff’s Reply (Amendment No 1) reads:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In relation to paragraph 6 of the Amended Defence, the Plaintiff does not dispute that the 13 August 2011 and 14 August 2011 Emails were sent to Mr Ho Soo Ching (“<span class="font-weight-bold">Mr Ho</span>”), the former Chief Executive Officer of MRL as stated at paragraph 6(a). However, given the nature and gravity of the Defamatory Statements, <span class="font-italic">the Defendant knew very well that his Defamatory </span><span class="font-italic">Statements would also be republished and made known to MRL’s Board of Directors (“</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Board</span><span class="font-italic">”). </span><span class="font-italic">In fact, the Defendant communicated those Defamatory Statements to Mr Ho with the full appreciation and intention that what he said would be repeated in whole or in part</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original in bold; emphasis added in italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Inherent in the above is a plea of republication to the MRL Board. By the averment that “the [d]efendant knew very well that his Defamatory Statements would also be republished and made known to MRL’s Board of Directors”, the defendant was put on notice that the plaintiff is seeking to claim damages for the republication to the MRL Board. This is because it is well-settled that damages to be assessed for the original publication include foreseeable loss, and that in turn encompasses loss arising out of foreseeable republication (<span class="font-italic">Goh Chok Tong v Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin</span> [1997] 3 SLR(R) 46 (“<span class="font-italic">Goh Chok </span><span class="font-italic">Tong</span>”) at [127]; cited with approval in <span class="font-italic">Low Tuck Kwong</span><span class="font-italic"> v Sukamto Sia</span> [2014] 1 SLR 639 (“<span class="font-italic">Low Tuck Kwong</span>”) at [38]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 There is no need for the plaintiff to plead how he came to know about the republication to the MRL Board. This is a matter of evidence. There is also no need to specify precisely how many persons from the MRL Board the Alleged Defamatory Statements were republished to and their exact identities, since the category of persons is sufficiently identified. It simply refers to the directors of MRL. As set out in <span class="font-italic">Singapore</span><span class="font-italic"> Civil Procedure 2021</span> vol 1 (Cavinder Bull gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2021) at para 18/12/25:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… In the case of a letter or other private communication, the name of each person to whom publication is alleged must be stated in the pleading; or, <span class="font-italic">if his name is unknown, he</span><span class="font-italic"> must be indicated in some manner that will identify him</span>. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Although this proposition is made in the context of publication, it should equally apply to republication.

</div> Given the different interpretations of what the whistle-blowing policy entailed, I am unable to make a determination as to whether it was compulsory, as a matter of MRL and PT Aneka’s internal policy, for the defendant to send the E-mails to the audit committee of the MRL Board.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Even if MRL and PT Aneka’s internal policy was mandatory in nature, the fact remains that a moral duty existed on the part of the defendant to communicate the Alleged Defamatory Statements to Mr Ho. They contain allegations of corruption, cheating, abuse and criminal breach of trust committed in relation to MRL’s subsidiaries. In particular, they involve wrongdoings perpetrated against PT Aneka, which was an indirect subsidiary of MRL. All of these are grave transgressions which, if true, would greatly injure MRL’s business interests and reputation. As an employee of PT Aneka, and hence a part of the wider MRL corporate group, the defendant had a moral duty to bring these to the attention of Mr Ho, the CEO of MRL, who wielded the power to take steps to commence investigations and put an end to the transgressions. For the same reason, Mr Ho had an interest in receiving such information. I therefore find that the interest-duty test is satisfied, and that the E-mails were published on an occasion of privilege to Mr Ho.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Malice</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Applicable legal principles</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 As the Alleged Defamatory Statements were made on an occasion of privilege, it is for the plaintiff to prove that the privilege was lost because of malice: <span class="font-italic">Hady</span><span class="font-italic"> Hartanto v Yee Kit Hong and others</span> [2014] 2 SLR 1127; [2014] SGHC 40 (“<span class="font-italic">Hady</span><span class="font-italic"> Hartanto</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [204]; <span class="font-italic">Lim Eng Hock Peter </span>at [36], citing <span class="font-italic">Horrocks </span>at 149–150.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Malice can be proven in one of two ways (<span class="font-italic">Hady Hartanto </span>at [205]; <span class="font-italic">Lim Eng Hock Peter </span>at [35]–[38], [40] and [44]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the plaintiff can show that the defendant had no honest belief, knew that the publication was false, or was reckless to the truth of what he published.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, even if the defendant had an honest belief in the truth of what he published, there would still be malice if: (i) the defendant’s dominant motive for publishing the statement was to injure the plaintiff, or (ii) he used the occasion (giving rise to the privilege) for an improper purpose, for example, to give vent to his personal spite towards the plaintiff or to obtain some advantage unconnected with the duty or the interest which constituted the reason for the privilege.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 Evidence of the defendant’s conduct and actions prior to the publication, at the time of the publication and after the publication, including the entire surrounding circumstances, must be viewed in totality: <span class="font-italic">Arul</span><span class="font-italic"> Chandran v Chew Chin Aik Victor JP</span> [2000] SGHC 111 (“<span class="font-italic">Arul Chandran (HC)</span>”) at [301].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Summary of parties’ submissions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 The foregoing legal principles are not in dispute.

First, seeing Mr Anga bring a big bag of money does not adequately account for the Alleged Defamatory Statement that the plaintiff received commissions from creditors in exchange for an assurance that they would be repaid. Second, it was never stated in the defendant’s AEIC that he saw Mr Anga bring a bag of money.

</div> Witnessing Mr Anga bring a big bag of money does not square with the description of receiving a complaint from Mr Anga.

What abuse did you witness my client commit?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A Okay, first, like I say when you employ a Malaysian in Singapore to work in Indonesia, but working for his company and not PT Aneka. So I consider it’s abuse. Another one is that he buy over my men. My superin – I – my supervisor also doing part job for them. Part-time job for them. It is totally abuse to me. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Q What you just said is not in your 13th of August email and it’s not in your affidavit, correct? Again, this is the first time we’re hearing this, correct?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A Yah, yah. Yes.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">As the defendant rightly conceded, these allegations were entirely new and never raised in his AEIC or the 13 August E-mail. This is yet another instance of the defendant inexplicably leaving out evidence, which would have been material to his case, from his AEIC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 Summing up the foregoing, it is apparent to me that the defendant had concocted the allegation that he had “witnessed” the plaintiff’s wrongdoings. He took this position only when he was confronted with the 13 August E-mail on the stand. This position did not feature anywhere in his AEIC: his AEIC merely claimed that the information in the 13 August E-mail originated from the Informants, and his AEIC was bereft of details as to his basis for the 14 August E-mail. No explanation was given as to why he had omitted to mention that he personally witnessed the plaintiff’s wrongdoings in his AEIC. This position proved to be indefensible as the cross-examination progressed. At times, when forced to specify what he saw, it became clear that what he allegedly saw did not lend any support to the Alleged Defamatory Statements (see above at [92(d)], [96] and [97]). For four of the Alleged Defamatory Statements, the defendant’s oral testimony oscillated as regards whether he witnessed or did not witness the plaintiff’s wrongful acts (see above at [92(b)]–[92(c)], [93], [95]–[97]). I therefore disbelieve the defendant’s evidence that he had personally witnessed the plaintiff’s wrongdoings that were set out in the E-mails.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Absence of credible evidence that the defendant’s information originated from the Informants</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 There is no objective evidence in the form of e-mail correspondence or messages between the Informants and the defendant proving that the defendant had obtained his information from the Informants. Furthermore, the defendant is the only witness before this court who has personal knowledge of whether his information came from the Informants. The defendant claimed that the Informants had told him the relevant information “through handphone or face-to-face meetings”, and no one else was present during his conversations with the Informants.

</div> The defendant could have taken those opportunities to draw the plaintiff’s misconduct to their attention.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 I note that the way in which the meeting minutes are worded does indicate that the 15 November Meeting was conducted in a question-and-answer format. Be that as it may, given the gravity of the allegations levelled against the plaintiff, and the fact that the plaintiff was a director of MRL at the material time, the MRL board members would certainly have wanted to hear the defendant out even if they had not asked a question which required him to raise this issue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 In addition, the questions posed to the defendant during the meeting clearly related to the operations of PT Aneka. Since most of the plaintiff’s wrongdoings set out in the E-mails relate to the running of PT Aneka, the 15 November Meeting presented itself as a great opportunity for the defendant to inform the MRL board members of the plaintiff’s multiple transgressions. The plaintiff was also not present at that meeting.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 Yet, the defendant did not raise any of the plaintiff’s misconduct set out in the E-mails.

</div> If so, then one would have thought that he would similarly act on that same sense of duty and seize the opportunity to bring the plaintiff’s misconduct to the board members’ attention at the 15 November Meeting, especially since they had the power and authority to put an end to the plaintiff’s wrongdoings. But he did not.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 The defendant’s omission to mention the plaintiff’s wrongdoings during the 15 November Meeting is telling. It indicates that at the time of publication, the defendant had no honest belief in the truth of the Alleged Defamatory Statements. He knew that these allegations could not stand up to scrutiny, which was why he kept quiet about these allegations when he went face to face with members of the MRL Board. It also indicates that the defendant had no Informants, and had not gathered evidence of the plaintiff’s misconduct or personally witnessed any of the misconduct. If he had, he could have relayed what he saw to the MRL board members, presented the evidence he had gathered and given the names of his Informants so that the MRL board members could interview them.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion: The defendant was motivated by malice</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 I am satisfied that the defendant was motivated by malice when he published the E-mails to Mr Ho. The plaintiff has pointed to the defendant’s inexplicable omission to raise the plaintiff’s misconduct to the MRL board members during the 15 November Meeting. In turn, the defendant is unable to adduce any credible evidence of his basis for making any of the Alleged Defamatory Statements. He pleaded in his Defence that he had obtained his information from his Informants. At trial, however, he asserted for the first time that he had personally witnessed all of the plaintiff’s wrongdoings as detailed in the E-mails and had conducted his own investigations into the plaintiff’s conduct. Quite apart from the fact that a new narrative had emerged at trial, these alleged sources of information are either riddled with internal inconsistencies or consist only of bare assertions which are implausible in the surrounding circumstances and unsupported by objective evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 How the defendant came to know of information underlying the Alleged Defamatory Statements is something squarely within the defendant’s knowledge. Yet, he is unable to get his story straight. The natural inference to draw from the state of the defendant’s evidence is that he had simply invented these allegations. It follows that he did not have an honest belief in the truth of the Alleged Defamatory Statements.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 A main plank of the defendant’s case is that he had no way of knowing whether the information provided to him was false.

</div> In support of this argument the defendant relies on <span class="font-italic">Low</span><span class="font-italic"> Tuck Kwong</span>, where the Court of Appeal at [84] cited Scrutton LJ’s remarks in <span class="font-italic">Greers Ltd v Pearman and Corder Ltd </span>(1922) 39 RPC 406 at 417:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Honest belief in an unfounded claim is not malice.

To the contrary, they support the plaintiff’s case by showing that an inference of a lack of honest belief should be drawn where the claim is <span class="font-italic">so unfounded</span>. As the analysis of the evidence reveals, the defendant’s alleged belief was completely unfounded. The defendant is unable to put forward any credible evidence that he had made these Alleged Defamatory Statements based on his own observations, information from his Informants, or his investigations. The complete lack of basis for the Alleged Defamatory Statements not only supports the inference that the defendant did not have an honest belief in them, but also leads to the conclusion that the defendant knew that they were false because they were conjured up by him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 To close off this section, I reiterate the comments by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Lim Eng Hock Peter </span>at [41]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The rationale underpinning the privilege is that because the defendant has a moral, social or legal duty to disclose the information and the recipient has an interest in receiving it, he should not be penalised for making an honest mistake.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Analysis: Was there republication to the audit committee board members?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 From the evidence set out above, I find that the sense and substance of the Alleged Defamatory Statements had been republished by Mr Ho to the audit committee board members. There are two reasons for this.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 First, Mr Ho conceded that the audit committee board members knew of the gist, substance and details of the allegations that were made against the plaintiff in the E-mails. Since Mr Ho met them on a couple of occasions to discuss the allegations made against the plaintiff and Mr Low, Mr Ho must have republished the sense and substance of all the Alleged Defamatory Statements to the audit committee board members during their oral discussions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 Second, this finding is consistent with the context in which Mr Ho’s oral discussions with the audit committee board members took place. It is important to appreciate that there was no written document accompanying Mr Ho’s oral report to the audit committee board members: he did not show them the E-mails, and their discussions took place before UHY completed its written report on 2 November 2011 and before the 4 November Report was prepared. If Mr Ho had not told the audit committee board members the details of the allegations in the E-mails, their oral discussions would have been in a vacuum. It also would not make sense for Mr Ho to have met the audit committee board members on a couple of occasions if all they had to work with was Mr Ho’s broad-sweeping statements that there had been some wrongdoings by a “senior member of staff” and “a mid-level person” (see above at [141]–[142]). Furthermore, the audit committee board members were in charge of receiving whistle-blowing reports in a public listed company. They could not have been satisfied with receiving a whistle-blowing report which only contained broad allegations of some wrongdoing concerning the Indonesian operations. They would most probably have inquired further and prompted Mr Ho to convey the details of the allegations in the E-mails.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Analysis: Was there republication to the entire MRL Board?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 I now turn to consider whether there was a republication of the Alleged Defamatory Statements to the entire MRL Board. Much of the analysis will turn on the contents of the 4 November Report as well as the 13 August E-mail. The relevant portions of the 13 August E-mail read:

The first paragraph of the 4 November Report claimed that the 13 August E-mail alleged that Mr Low and the plaintiff were “defrauding company”. While there was no explicit elaboration of how the plaintiff was defrauding the company, the next few paragraphs are telling. Paragraph 2 stated that after doing “<span class="font-italic">further</span> research and collection of information” [emphasis added], Mr Ho was “able to establish” that Mr Low had been dealing with PT Aneka through two companies, CV Mega Jaya (see paragraph 3) and PT Buana Lintas Marine (see paragraph 4). Objectively understood, paragraph 2 claimed that Mr Ho undertook follow-up actions based on the allegations stated in the 13 August E-mail and confirmed the allegations that Mr Low had been transacting with PT Aneka through those two companies. In other words, the 13 August E-mail contained allegations that Mr Low had been dealing with PT Aneka through CV Mega Jaya and PT Buana Lintas Marine. Paragraphs 3 and 4 of the 4 November Report proceeded to elaborate on how both of these companies, which supplied goods and services to PT Aneka, had been overcharging the latter. Paragraph 9 of the 4 November Report stated that the plaintiff was “named” in the 13 August E-mail, and recommended that the plaintiff “should be given an opportunity to answer some of the questions raised”. Absent any indication of what other allegations the 13 August E-mail contained, this paragraph read with the aforementioned paragraphs would convey to the reader that the plaintiff was somehow involved in the fraud surrounding the CV Mega Jaya and PT Buana Lintas Marine transactions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 The plaintiff asks this court to infer that the E-mails must have been republished to the MRL Board. Paragraph 9 of the 4 November Report stated that the plaintiff “should be given an opportunity to answer some of the questions raised”. The plaintiff submits that Mr Ho must have provided the E-mails to the MRL Board, otherwise the MRL Board would be clueless as to what sort of questions to ask the plaintiff.

It indicated that the 13 August E-mail contained allegations that the plaintiff was involved in defrauding PT Aneka through its transactions with CV Mega Jaya and PT Buana Lintas Marine. This appears to correspond to only two of the Alleged Defamatory Statements in the 13 August E-mail (see above at [149]). The difficulty is that these two Alleged Defamatory Statements set out the total amount of illicit profits earned by the plaintiff (and Mr Low), and the way in which the plaintiff was perpetrating the fraud. These matters were not adequately conveyed, directly or indirectly, in the 4 November Report.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 Nevertheless, in my judgment, the sense and substance of these two Alleged Defamatory Statements was republished by the 4 November Report. The <span class="font-italic">nub</span> of the defamatory sting embedded in these two Alleged Defamatory Statements was that the plaintiff was defrauding PT Aneka through its transactions with CV Mega Jaya and PT Buana Lintas.

The court held that even a partial publication of the original sting could be causative of damage (at [13]). Hence, even if the 4 November Report only conveyed a part of the whole sting found in two of the Alleged Defamatory Statements in the 13 August E-mail, this is sufficiently causative of the damage to the plaintiff’s reputation, especially since the part that was conveyed constitutes the essence of the defamatory sting.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">157 To conclude, while I was unable to draw the inference that the E-mails must have been republished to the MRL Board, I am satisfied that the sense and substance of two of the Alleged Defamatory Statements in the 13 August E-mail was republished to the MRL Board through the 4 November Report.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether the defendant intended the republication to the audit committee board members and the entire MRL Board</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 I agree with the plaintiff that the defendant had intended the republication of the Alleged Defamatory Statements to the audit committee board members.

The defendant also contends that the plaintiff voluntarily resigned of his own accord and, even if his resignation was involuntary, it was not directly attributable to the two E-mails.

The presence of malice, the absence of an apology, the fact that the defendant unjustifiably maintained the defence of qualified privilege, and the defendant’s lack of contrition are all factors justifying the plaintiff’s entitlement to aggravated damages: <span class="font-italic">Arul</span><span class="font-italic"> Chandran (CA) </span>at [57], <span class="font-italic">Lim Eng Hock Peter</span> <span class="font-italic">(Damages)</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [38], <span class="font-italic">Low Tuck Kwong</span> at [91] and <span class="font-italic">Yeo</span><span class="font-italic"> Nai Meng (HC)</span> at [123].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">166 Both aggravated damages and general damages are compensatory in nature. Accordingly, caution has to be exercised against double counting or otherwise over-compensating the plaintiff because the distress, humiliation and injury to feelings for which aggravated damages are awarded to compensate the plaintiff, are matters that may also properly be taken into account in awarding general damages. Ultimately, the total figure for both general and aggravated damages should not exceed fair compensation for the injury suffered by the claimant: <span class="font-italic">Koh Sin Chong Freddie v Chan Cheng Wah Bernard and others and another appeal</span> [2013] 4 SLR 629 at [75] and [77]. While there would be a single lump sum award for damages, the court ought to provide a breakdown of the sums awarded as general damages and as aggravated damages: <span class="font-italic">Lim</span><span class="font-italic"> Eng Hock Peter (Damages)</span> at [40]; <span class="font-italic">Basil Anthony Herman v Premier Security Co-operative Ltd and others</span> [2010] 3 SLR 110 at [65].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">167 I now turn to consider the quantum of general damages to be awarded the plaintiff. At the time of the publication and republication of the Alleged Defamatory Statements, the plaintiff was a director of MRL, a public listed company. The Alleged Defamatory Statements assert that the plaintiff was a dishonest person who had abused his position and power in MRL to engage, over a number of years, in acts of corruption, cheating, abuse and criminal breach of trust, and had amassed ill-gotten gains running up to at least US$2.1 million. There is no doubt that these cast serious imputations on the plaintiff as a director of a public listed company. Balanced against these is the limited circulation of the E-mails, which contained the damage to the plaintiff’s reputation. The E-mails were only published to Mr Ho. While all the Alleged Defamatory Statements were republished to the three audit committee board members, only two of the Alleged Defamatory Statements were republished to the entire MRL Board. The entire MRL Board consisted of nine directors and apart from Mr Ho, the plaintiff and the three audit committee board members, there were only four other directors.

</div> To date, the defendant has not issued an apology, choosing instead to raise the defence of qualified privilege and maintain that he had proper sources of information for these allegations even though there is no evidential basis for such an assertion. Such conduct clearly evinces the defendant’s lack of contrition.

In addition, there were two factors which justified a higher award of damages in <span class="font-italic">Yeo Nai Meng (HC)</span> than in the present case. First, while the plaintiff in the present case is a director of a public listed company, the plaintiff in <span class="font-italic">Yeo Nai Meng (HC)</span> “held positions of responsibility in public and private organisations”: <span class="font-italic">Yeo Nai Meng (CA)</span> at [69]. Second, even though the defamatory allegations made against the plaintiff in <span class="font-italic">Yeo Nai Meng (HC) </span>were comparable in nature to the Alleged Defamatory Statements, the defamatory sting of the allegations in <span class="font-italic">Yeo Nai Meng (HC)</span> was higher as they purported to be the considered opinions of a senior lawyer and a senior accountant.
