<strong>JUDGMENT:</strong>
</font>
</p>
<p xmlns=""><font color="#804040" face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>Grounds of Decision</strong></font></p>
<font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">1 The Defendants are the owners and developers of a 7-storey flatted

warehouse at Kallang Pudding Road ("the Project"). The Plaintiffs are the main

contractors for the project.</p>
<p align="justify">2 In this action the Plaintiffs claim for monies due under an

Architect's certificate along with certain ancillary reliefs. In SIC 513/2000 the

Plaintiffs applied for summary judgment. The learned Assistant Registrar did not allow the

application and granted the Defendants unconditional leave to defend the action. The

Plaintiffs appealed before me and on 11 October 2000, after hearing counsel for the

parties, I allowed the appeal and made the following orders:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(i) Judgment for the Plaintiffs in the sum of $368,205.34 plus

  interest;</p>
<p align="justify">(ii) Such judgment to be stayed pending determination of any

  counterclaim to be filed by the Defendants in respect of defective works. For the

  avoidance of doubt, the Defendants are not precluded from counterclaiming in respect of

  other matters save that the stay shall not operate in relation to those matters;</p>
<p align="justify">(iii) No order as to costs here and below.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">3 The Defendants have appealed against the first order giving judgment

against them in the sum of $368,205.34 plus interest and I now give my grounds of

decision.</p>
<p align="justify">4 On 24 June 1996 the parties entered into a contract ("the

Contract") in respect of the Project which incorporated the Singapore Institute of

Architects Conditions of Building Contract for lump sum contracts ("the SIA

Conditions"). The contract sum was $12.7 million and the contract period was 15

months from 19 July 1996. The Contract provided for nominated sub-contractors to be

appointed for certain specialised works and one of them was Diethelm Industries Pte Ltd

("Diethelm"). They were appointed on 24 September 1996 to supply and install the

aluminium cladding for the Project.</p>
<p align="justify">5 On 26 January 1998, the Architect issued, pursuant to clause 24(4) of

the Contract, a Completion Certificate which stated that the Project was completed on 24

January 1998. Attached to the Completion Certificate was a schedule ("the

Schedule") entitled "Minor Outstanding Works" which, under the terms of the

Contract, the Plaintiffs were to carry out before the Defendants would release the

retention monies. The certificate also stated that the 15-month Maintenance Period under

the contract would commence from the completion date and end on 24 March 1999.</p>
<p align="justify">6 The dispute between the parties hinged on whether the Plaintiffs had

satisfactorily completed the "Minor Outstanding Works" set out in the Schedule.

In particular, the Defendants had numerous complaints about the aluminium cladding

installed by Diethelm. The Plaintiffs claimed that this was because Diethelm were not

co-operative in attending to the Defendants' complaints in respect of the cladding.

Although there were some other defective works outstanding, the Defendants had themselves

said in their letter to the Plaintiffs on 8 April 1999 that Diethelm's aluminium cladding

work was the major complaint they had.</p>
<p align="justify">7 The Contract required the Plaintiffs to procure an on-demand

performance bond for 10% of the contract sum amounting to $1.27 million. On 8 April 1999

the Defendants called on the bond. However payment was not made pursuant to this call

because the parties agreed, at a meeting on 23 April, to settle the matter by appointing

an independent third party to identify the defects still outstanding. The Plaintiffs would

then be given a reasonable period to rectify those defects to the satisfaction of that

third party. It took another 2 months to resolve the details of this agreement but

eventually the parties agreed on and appointed Mr Chin Cheong of Building Appraisal Pte

Ltd ("BAPL"). The terms of this appointment are set out in the Plaintiffs'

letter of 18 June 1999 to him, which provides as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"PROPOSED ERECTION OF A ONE BLOCK OF 7-STOREY FLATTED WAREHOUSE

  DEVELOPMENT ON LOT 3633 MK 24 AT KALLANG PUDDING ROAD FOR M/S SIN YAM HUAT REALTY PTE LTD</p>
<p align="justify">1 We refer to the above project.</p>
<p>2 Various disagreement[s] have arisen between the respective parties on the work

  required to rectify alleged defects related to the above project.</p>
<p align="justify">3 As such, the parties [i.e. the owner of the building, M/s Sin Yam

  Huat Realty Pte Ltd ("Sin Yam Huat") and the main contractor M/s Soil Build Pte

  Ltd ("Soil Build")] have agreed to appoint an independent third party to

  identify and draw up a list of defects for which rectification works are required and to

  make a final assessment as to the costs of carrying out such work. You are hereby

  appointed jointly by Sin Yam Huat and Soil Build to act as the said third party expert.</p>
<p align="justify">4 The scope of your work would include the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">a Review drawings, specifications and reports prepared by consultants.</p>
<p align="justify">b Carry out a comprehensive site inspection of the alleged defects.</p>
<p align="justify">c Work with the parties to prepare a list of defects.</p>
<p align="justify">d Provide an opinion in respect of the "defects" or

    "making good" works or make recommendations, if necessary. </p>
<p align="justify">e Prepare four (4) copies of a report (including colour photographs)

    encompassing the above.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">5 In addition, you will be expected to draw up a reasonable time frame

  for completion of the rectification works. At the end of the stipulated time frame, you

  are to certify that the rectification works have been satisfactorily completed. If there

  are still outstanding or defective works at the end of the period stipulated for

  rectification, you are also to assess the cost of rectifying these defects. As third party

  expert, your decision/judgement in respect of the alleged defects will be final,

  conclusive and binding on the parties (without further recourse to court or arbitration

  proceedings).</p>
<p align="justify">6 Although you are jointly appointed [by] Sin Yam Huat and Soil Build,

  please note that Soil Build undertakes to pay your costs in respect of this matter.</p>
<p align="justify">7 Please confirm as soon as possible whether you will be accepting the

  appointment as third party."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">8 From this letter it can be seen that the parties had agreed for BAPL

to act as a sort of an arbitrator to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) decide what constituted the defects;</p>
<p align="justify">(b) set a reasonable period for the Plaintiffs to rectify those

  defects;</p>
<p align="justify">(c) at the end of this period, determine whether the defects have been

  rectified;</p>
<p align="justify">(d) in respect of the defects not satisfactorily rectified, assess the

  cost of rectifying them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">BAPL's decision on these matters was to be final and binding on the

parties in relation to the dispute between them under the Contract. Although it was not

expressly stated in the correspondence between the parties, it was a necessary consequence

of this agreement that the Defendants would be entitled to deduct from the retention

monies the total sum that BAPL assessed was the cost of rectifying the defects not

satisfactorily completed after the time given to the Plaintiffs to carry out such works.

It was also a necessary corollary that thereafter the Defendants would have no further

claim against the Plaintiffs in respect of the Contract or at least in respect of those

defects. I shall refer to this as "the Settlement Agreement".</p>
<p align="justify">9 BAPL accepted the appointment and produced a report in August 1999.

The report contains a list of defects and stated that 4 weeks was a reasonable period to

complete the rectification works. Based on this report the Plaintiffs undertook certain

rectification works and informed BAPL of the alleged completion of works prior to 11

November, on which date BAPL inspected the building. In their letter of 11 November, the

Plaintiffs requested BAPL to certify the completion of the rectification works, or assess

the cost of the defects not rectified to their satisfaction in accordance with the terms

of the Settlement Agreement.</p>
<p align="justify">10 However the Defendants' solicitors, M/s Salem Ibrahim &amp; Partners

("SIP") wrote to BAPL on 15 November to say that they did not <i>"deem"</i>

the 11 November inspection to be a <i>"comprehensive one, satisfactory for the

purpose of [BAPL] certifying all incomplete rectification works"</i>. They requested

BAPL to conduct urgently a <i>"comprehensive inspection"</i>. BAPL replied on 17

November and, among other matters, confessed to some confusion as regards the scope of

their appointment. On 19 November the Plaintiffs' solicitors, M/s Allen &amp; Gledhill

("A&amp;G") wrote to SIP and enclosed for the latter's consideration a draft

letter to BAPL to clarify the scope of work. A&amp;G did not receive any immediate

response to this letter and on 7 December they sent the following letter to BAPL (with a

copy forwarded to SIP):</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"PROPOSED 7-STOREY WAREHOUSE AT KALLANG PUDDING ROAD</p>
<p align="justify">We act for M/s Soil Build (Pte) Ltd</p>
<p align="justify">We refer to your letter dated 17 November 1999 addressed to M/s Salem

  Ibrahim &amp; Partners and your letter to Soil Build Pte Ltd dated 30 November 1999.</p>
<p align="justify">Your scope of work is described in detail in your letter of appointment

  dated 18 June 1999, a copy of which is enclosed for your reference.</p>
<p align="justify">In relation to your duties pertaining to the identification of defects,

  you are (as per the letter of appointment) required, inter alia, to do the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) Carry out a comprehensive site inspection.</p>
<p align="justify">(b) Draw up a reasonable time frame for completion of the rectification

    works.</p>
<p align="justify">(c) If there are still outstanding works at the end of the stipulated

    time frame, assess the cost of rectifying these defects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">We note that you produced a detailed expert [report] in August 1999

  pursuant to what we had deemed to be a 'comprehensive' site inspection. You have therefore

  satisfactorily carried out your function under paragraphs (a) and (b) above.</p>
<p align="justify">What remains is for you to inspect the site with a view to assessing

  the cost of rectifying outstanding defects as per (c) above. The letter of appointment

  dated 18 June 1999 is very clear in stipulating your obligation to make this assessment at

  paragraph 5 of the said letter. It is therefore not additional or further work as you seem

  to suggest. Once you have carried out this final task, you will be discharged of any

  further obligations.</p>
<p align="justify">Please proceed with the necessary assessment of cost of rectification

  works as per the letter of appointment dated 18 June 1999."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">11 In response to that letter to BAPL, SIP wrote to A&amp;G on 8

December 1999 to protest the manner in which the Plaintiffs had unilaterally instructed

BAPL. SIP stated that they had written an urgent letter to A&amp;G dated 3 December in

which they had suggested convening a meeting of the various actors involved in order to

resolve the impasse. SIP reiterated that such a meeting should be held. A&amp;G replied to

this letter on 13 December to state, among other things, that their 7 December letter to

BAPL did not contain any new instructions but merely reminded BAPL of the express terms of

their appointment. On 22 December, SIP wrote to A&amp;G requesting to know when BAPL would

be making a final inspection of the building as the Defendants wish to have their

representatives present when this was done. This letter was copied to BAPL. The Plaintiffs

sent an urgent fax to BAPL on the same day, making reference to SIP’s letter, and

asked if BAPL would wish to conduct any final inspection. BAPL replied to the Plaintiffs

on 23 December 1999 in the following manner:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"We are in the midst of preparing a cost estimation for the

  proposed rectification works. We will not require the gondola on site. The gondola can be

  removed, please instruct accordingly."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">Implicit in this response is the assertion that they would not be

conducting a final inspection.</p>
<p align="justify">12 On 3 January 2000, BAPL submitted their report of the cost estimates

in purported fulfilment of the terms of reference of their appointment. BAPL assessed that

the total cost of rectification was $85,580. However there was this note appended to the

report:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"We must highlight that these are estimated costs as the only way

  of obtaining an accurate figure is by the preparation of a detailed specification and

  obtaining competitive quotations."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">This enigmatic sentence was to become a further bone of contention

between the parties. On 25 January, SIP wrote to A&amp;G and the material paragraph states

as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Our clients do not accept the cost estimates of [BAPL] dated 3

  January 2000. A proper estimate of the costs can only be obtained by the preparation of

  detailed specifications and obtaining quotations from parties willing to undertake the

  rectification works."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">SIP stated that the Defendants reserved all their rights on the matter.</p>
<p align="justify">13 A&amp;G replied on 28 January and said the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"… you state that your clients do not accept the cost

  estimates of [BAPL] dated 3 January 2000. You must be aware that your clients’

  position is a clear breach of the agreement between our respective clients to appoint an

  independent third party to, inter alia, identify and value the outstanding rectification

  works without interference from any of the parties concerned. We wish to remind our

  clients that all determinations made by the third party were, as agreed by our respective

  clients, final, conclusive and binding."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">A&amp;G also stated that the Plaintiffs reserved their rights in this

matter.</p>
<p align="justify">14 On 11 February SIP, on behalf of the Defendants, made a second call

on the bond for the full sum of $1.27 million. In response the Plaintiffs took out Suit

No. 600180/2000 in which the substantive relief sought was a declaration that the

determination by BAPL on 3 January 2000 of the costs of rectification works was valid and

binding on the Defendants. At the same time the Plaintiffs applied for an interlocutory

injunction to restrain the Defendants from receiving any payment under the bond until

trial. This application came up before me on summons day on 25 February 2000. The parties

asked for a special date to be fixed and I adjourned it accordingly. The matter then came

up before Justice Rubin on 21 March. At that hearing, counsel for the parties informed the

learned judge that the parties were in negotiation and there was a possibility that the

matter could be settled. Justice Rubin accordingly adjourned the matter. Counsel for the

parties next appeared before me on 18 April and reported that they had agreed to settle

the matter by appointing a third party Quantity Surveyor to value the outstanding

rectification works. In view of that, I adjourned the matter for another 2 months. The

parties subsequently agreed to re-appoint BAPL to undertake this work. They agreed to the

exact terms of this appointment and this is set out in A&amp;G's letter to BAPL dated 12

May 2000 which provides as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"We refer to your letter dated 3 January 2000 wherein you had

  enclosed your cost estimate of $85,580.00 on the incomplete defective works in respect of

  the above project.</p>
<p align="justify">The said letter is silent as to whether your above costs estimate was

  done pursuant to a comprehensive site inspection of the above project in respect of

  outstanding defects. The parties have agreed to jointly instruct you, pursuant to your

  function as an independent third party, to undertake a comprehensive site inspection, and

  provide your final assessment of the value of the outstanding works based on your original

  report of August 1999.</p>
<p align="justify">Although you are jointly instructed to prepare the further report by

  both Sim Yam Huat Investment Holding Pte Ltd and our clients, our clients undertake to pay

  your additional costs in respect of this matter. The terms of your appointment are

  otherwise unchanged from Soil Build's letter dated 18 June 1999.</p>
<p align="justify">Please proceed to do the necessary site inspection as soon as possible.

  Your report should be completed no later than 31 May 2000."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">15 BAPL reverted on 19 May and set out their proposal for undertaking

the appointment. According to this letter, this comprised:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"A) <u>Scope Of Work</u></p>
<p align="justify">i) Carry out a further comprehensive site survey of the premises,

  on the 'alleged' defects;</p>
<p align="justify">ii) Preparing a cost estimate for the necessary rectification works;</p>
<p align="justify">iii) Inviting specialist contractors on cladding work to submit

  quotations for the necessary rectification works;</p>
<p align="justify">iv) Providing a detail breakdown of the cost estimate on the

  rectification works;</p>
<p align="justify">v) Prepare (4) four copies of our report of the above including all

  necessary photographs."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">16 A&amp;G replied to BAPL on 22 May to object to their defining their

own scope of works. A&amp;G pointed out that the terms of their appointment must be

strictly in accordance with the A&amp;G letter to BAPL of 12 May 2000 read with the

Plaintiffs' letter to BAPL of 18 June 1999. A&amp;G also objected to BAPL's proposal item

(iii), i.e. to invite specialist contractors on cladding works to submit quotations in

order to assess the cost of their rectification.</p>
<p align="justify">17 BAPL then reverted with a modified proposal in which item (iii) was

omitted. However SIP wrote to A&amp;G on 24 May to protest this "interference"

by A&amp;G of BAPL's functions. SIP reiterated their view that a proper cost estimate can

only be done by obtaining quotations as originally proposed by BAPL and insisted that the

cost estimate be prepared on the basis of their original proposed scope of works. A&amp;G

opposed this and the solicitors then engaged in an exchange of correspondence which did

not end in any agreement. These letters were copied to BAPL. At one point, the Defendants

sent a cheque to BAPL for $1,700 for the additional work incurred in inviting specialist

contractors to quote for the rectification of the cladding works. However BAPL did not

accept this and on 9 June 2000 wrote to A&amp;G as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"RE: PROPOSED 7-STOREY FLATTED WAREHOUSE AT KALLANG PUDDING ROAD:

  ASSESSMENT OF RECTIFICATION WORKS OF EXTERNAL CLADDINGS</p>
<p align="justify">We refer to the above matter and the various correspondences between

  respective solicitors and noted the contents therein.</p>
<p align="justify">We are in receipt of a cheque from M/s Sin Yam Huat Realty, in a sum of

  S$ 1,700.00.</p>
<p align="justify">We regret that we are unable to accept the cheque payment, as the fee

  payment of our services has been agreed.</p>
<p align="justify">In order for our firm to expedite the report, we suggest that parties

  allow us to carry out the assessment independently.</p>
<p align="justify">We are in the midst of completing the cost assessment of the

  rectification work and the report will be ready by the 13<sup>th</sup> June 2000."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">18 In the event, BAPL proceeded with their determination of the cost

estimate and sometime in June 2000 submitted a report stating that the cost of outstanding

rectification works was $149,510, which included an estimate of the diminution of value of

a small part of the works which BAPL had concluded was not practical to rectify. Meanwhile

the Architect had, on 22 May 2000, issued a final certificate in which he determined that

the sum payable by the Defendants to the Plaintiffs was $368,205.34 (inclusive of GST).

This sum took into account a deduction made by the Architect on the basis of his

assessment that the value of the outstanding defective works was $142,890.64. Proceeding

upon the determination by BAPL, the Plaintiffs made a demand on the Defendants for the sum

of $350,861.56 (before GST) by substituting BAPL's determination of the cost of

rectification for the Architect's. When the Defendants refused to pay, the Plaintiffs

commenced Suit 406/2000 on 23 June 2000. On 26 June, the application in S600180/2000 for

an injunction came up before me. At the end of that hearing I granted the injunction. On

17 July 2000 both suits, S406/2000/G and S600180/2000, were ordered to be consolidated.</p>
<p align="justify">19 The Plaintiffs applied, in SIC 513/2000 for, <i>inter alia, </i>summary

judgment on 2 alternative bases:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) on the valuation of works in the Architect’s final certificate

  with the total sum reduced by the amount determined by BAPL to be the costs of

  rectification, alternatively;</p>
<p align="justify">(b) on the Architect’s final certificate which had already

  deducted a sum equivalent to his assessment of the cost of rectification works.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">The learned Assistant Registrar heard the application on 29 September

and dismissed the application, granting the Defendants unconditional leave to defend the

action. The Plaintiffs appealed in the present appeal.</p>
<p align="justify">20 In respect of basis (a) above, as the Architect's certification is

not disputed, the crux of the matter is whether BAPL's assessment of $149,510 is

determinative of the dispute between the parties. It is not in dispute that the parties

have agreed to appoint BAPL to make this assessment which will be binding on them. This is

akin to an arbitration agreement on that sole issue. Therefore the only question is

whether BAPL had made the assessment in accordance with the terms of their appointment.

This would include considering whether, in making their assessment, BAPL had been

influenced in any manner by the Plaintiffs. I found that in objecting to BAPL’s

proposed scope of works set out in their letter of 19 May 2000, the Plaintiffs had

interfered with the discretion granted to BAPL to determine the matter. This is because

there was nothing in any of the 3 letters of appointment to BAPL (dated 18 June, 7

December 1999 and 12 May 2000) that constrained them to make the assessment in a

particular manner. Therefore in objecting to BAPL’s proposal to call for quotes in

order for them to arrive at their assessment, the Plaintiffs had interfered in such

determination.</p>
<p align="justify">21 However in respect of basis (b), there is no question that the

Architect’s certificate is to be given temporary finality in a Contract which adopts

the SIA Conditions. Clause 31(11) of those conditions provides as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"No certificate of the Architect under this Contract shall be

  final and binding in any dispute between the Employer and the Contractor, whether before

  an arbitrator or in the Courts, save only that, in the absence of fraud or improper

  pressure or interference by either party, full effect by way of Summary Judgement or

  Interim Award or otherwise shall, in the absence of express provision, be given to all

  decisions and certificates of the Architect … whether for payment or otherwise, until

  final judgement or award, as the case may be, and until such final judgement or award such

  decision or certificates shall (save as aforesaid …) be binding on the Employer and

  the Contractor in relation to any manner [sic] which, under the terms of the Contract, the

  Architect has as a fact taken into account or allowed or disallowed, or any disputed

  matter upon which under the terms of the Contract he has as a fact ruled, in his

  certificates or otherwise. The Architect shall in all matters certify strictly in

  accordance with the terms of the Contract. In any case of doubt the Architect shall, at

  the request of either party, state in writing within 28 days whether he has as a fact

  taken account of or allowed or disallowed or ruled upon any matter in his certificates, if

  so identifying any certificate and indicating the amount (if any) taken into account or

  allowed or disallowed, or the nature of any ruling made by him, as the case may be."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">The Defendants had made no complaints in relation to the

Architect’s certificate. Therefore pending a determination which is final and binding

between the parties of the costs of the rectification works, the Plaintiffs are entitled

to have effect given to the Architect’s final certificate in this action.

Accordingly, I gave judgment for the Plaintiffs in the sum of the certificate, i.e.

$368,205.34. However in view of the Defendants’ counterclaim in respect of the

rectification works, I ordered a stay of execution of the judgment pending determination

of such counterclaim.</p>
