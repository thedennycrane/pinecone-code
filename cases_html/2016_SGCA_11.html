He concluded that the statements had been made voluntarily and were thus admissible as evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The Judge rejected the evidence given by the Appellant at the <span class="font-italic">voir dire</span> on the grounds that it was inconsistent (see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Abdul Kahar bin Othman</span> [2013] SGHC 164 (“<span class="font-italic">Abdul Kahar (Conviction)</span>”) at [7]). He noted that the Appellant first claimed that the admissions in his statements had been induced by threats that his mother would be implicated if he did not admit to the offences. He thereafter claimed that the statements had been fabricated by ASP Tang and Mdm Sofia. He finally said that ASP Tang had asked him some questions which he had answered, and ASP Tang had then recorded those answers in the statements. The Judge also observed that the statements made by the Appellant were interspersed with specific details about his family which could only have come from him and not from ASP Tang. The Judge therefore preferred and accepted ASP Tang’s evidence that the recording of the statements was routine, and that the statements had been given voluntarily by the Appellant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 The Judge convicted the Appellant of both charges as he was satisfied that the Prosecution had proved beyond reasonable doubt that the Appellant “was possessing diamorphine for the purpose of trafficking” (see <span class="font-italic">Abdul Kahar (Conviction)</span> at [15]). The following factors lay behind the Judge’s decision.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 First, the Judge noted that the Appellant had not given any satisfactory explanation as to why Latif needed him to safekeep two bags of the size of A1 and A2 when both bags “could have easily been carried by Latif” (see <span class="font-italic">Abdul Kahar (Conviction)</span> at [8]). Second, the Judge rejected the Appellant’s evidence that A1 and A2 had not been concealed in a cavity in the cupboard mentioned at [9] above, but had instead been found in a drawer in that cupboard (see <span class="font-italic">Abdul Kahar (Conviction)</span> at [9]). The Judge preferred the evidence of the Prosecution’s witnesses that the two bags had indeed been concealed in a cavity in the cupboard. In this regard, he noted that the CNB officers had, in the Appellant’s presence, taken photographs of the place where A1 and A2 were found, and reasoned that if the two bags had indeed been found in the drawer mentioned by the Appellant, the Appellant would have indicated that to the CNB officers when they were photographing the scene. However, he did not do so. Third, the Judge held that if the Appellant truly did not know that A1, A2 and the wrapped package in G1 contained drugs, it did not make sense for him not to say anything or explain himself when confronted with the drugs in his car and at the Flat (see <span class="font-italic">Abdul Kahar (Conviction)</span> at [11]). Fourth, the Judge was of the view that the Appellant had not satisfactorily explained why traces of his DNA were found on (<span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>) the interior surface of A1 (see <span class="font-italic">Abdul Kahar (Conviction)</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [9]). Fifth, the Judge held that the Appellant had not given a satisfactory explanation as to why he had approximately $70,000 in cash in his bedroom, how there came to be a sum of approximately $100,000 in Mdm Bibah’s bank account and why Mdm Bibah’s bank passbook was found in his bedroom (see <span class="font-italic">Abdul Kahar (Conviction)</span> at [12]). Sixth, the Judge found that the Appellant’s cautioned statements indicated guilt on his part (see <span class="font-italic">Abdul Kahar (Conviction)</span> at [13]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 The Judge eventually sentenced the Appellant to death, but only after a procedural detour, which we will elaborate on further at [96]–[97] below.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The arguments on appeal</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Appellant’s arguments</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Before this court, the Appellant argued that for two reasons, the Judge erred in finding that he had made his cautioned statements and long statements voluntarily.

</div> ASP Tang could have threatened to implicate Mdm Bibah, or to confiscate her money or the Flat. He could also have threatened not to allow the Appellant’s wife, who was then in Indonesia, to come to Singapore. The Appellant claimed that those threats were in fact made, and thus rendered his statements involuntary.

The further evidence in question consisted of two affidavits. The first was an affidavit affirmed by Mdm Bibah that purported to explain how she had accumulated the sum of approximately $100,000 in her bank account. The affidavit exhibited monthly bank statements for that account dating back to January 2007. The second affidavit was one affirmed by the Appellant’s brother, Mr Abdul Mutalib bin Othman, which was said to show that the cash found in the Appellant’s bedroom were the Appellant’s earnings from his upholstery business, and not money made from drug trafficking.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The applicable legal principles</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 There was no dispute between the parties as to the legal principles governing the Appellant’s application for leave to adduce further evidence. These principles were considered in, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, <span class="font-italic">Mohammad Zam bin Abdul Rashid v Public Prosecutor</span> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 410 (“<span class="font-italic">Abdul Rashid</span>”), a case decided when the relevant statutory provision at the time was s  55(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 1999 Rev Ed) (“the SCJA (1999 Rev Ed)”). That provision stipulated that the Court of Appeal had the power to admit further evidence on appeal where it was necessary to do so:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In dealing with any appeal, the Court of Appeal may, if it thinks additional evidence is necessary, either take such evidence itself or direct it to be taken by the trial court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">We note in passing that s 55(1) of the SCJA (1999 Rev Ed) was later replicated in s 55(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed), which provision has since been repealed and replaced by s 392(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In <span class="font-italic">Abdul Rashid</span>, the offender sought to introduce further evidence in his appeal against sentence after pleading guilty in the court below. We held that s 55(1) of the SCJA (1999 Rev Ed) permitted an appellate court to “grant leave to adduce further evidence to avoid a miscarriage of justice”, but that important objective had to be balanced against “the public interest in the finality of trial and [in] ensuring that trials are not reopened each time evidence that should have been admitted at first instance was not admitted” (see <span class="font-italic">Abdul Rashid</span> at [6]). What was paramount under s 55(1) was “relevancy, more specifically, materiality, as well as the credibility … of the further evidence [sought] to be adduced” (see likewise <span class="font-italic">Abdul Rashid</span> at [6]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 We also observed in <span class="font-italic">Abdul Rashid</span> (at [7]) that the principles laid down in <span class="font-italic">Ladd v Marshall</span> [1954] 1 WLR 1489 provided a helpful “reference” in assessing whether further evidence should be permitted on appeal. However, we pointed out at the same time that <span class="font-italic">Ladd v Marshall</span> was a civil case, and that the court had to be mindful of “the higher burden of proving guilt in a criminal case” when applying those principles in the criminal context (see likewise <span class="font-italic">Abdul Rashid</span> at [7]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Under the <span class="font-italic">Ladd v Marshall</span> principles, further evidence may only be introduced on appeal where the evidence in question: (a) was not obtainable with reasonable diligence at the time of the proceedings in the court below; (b) would have an important influence on the result of the case; and (c) is apparently credible, although not incontrovertible. In the light of these principles as well as the considerations which will be alluded to hereafter, we dismissed the Appellant’s application for leave to adduce further evidence on appeal as we were not satisfied that the threshold for permitting the introduction of such evidence had been crossed.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Mdm Bibah’s affidavit</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Where the affidavit of Mdm Bibah was concerned, that affidavit stated that the money in her bank account was an “accumulation of many years of hard work and contributions” from her seven children.

By that time, she was already well into her retirement, and had not earned any salary for approximately 14 years. Her only source of funds consisted of the modest allowances from her children, which could not satisfactorily account for the large sums deposited into her bank account during that short five-month period.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 We would go further and venture to suggest that the deposits into Mdm Bibah’s bank account during those five months, instead of assisting the Appellant’s case, appeared to be wholly consistent with his long statements.

</div> According to that long statement, therefore, the Appellant was dealing in drugs between February 2010 and early July 2010. There was, in our view, an uncanny coincidence between this period, when the Appellant was peddling drugs (according to his second long statement), and the inexplicable large sums deposited into his mother’s bank account during that same period.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Mr Mutalib’s affidavit</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Turning now to Mr Mutalib’s affidavit, that affidavit was likewise, in our judgment, of little relevance.

We accordingly dismissed the Appellant’s application for leave to adduce further evidence on appeal. This brings us to the substantive issues which arose in the appeal, to which we now turn.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-justify font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the Judge erred in admitting as evidence the Appellant’s two cautioned statements and three long statements on the basis that they had been made voluntarily</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 We mentioned earlier that the admissibility of the Appellant’s two cautioned statements and three long statements turned on which of two competing accounts of the recording of those statements ought to be preferred and accepted, the Appellant’s or ASP Tang’s. This undoubtedly required an assessment of their credibility and veracity – an assessment which the Judge was best placed to make. It is trite that in such circumstances, an appellate court will interfere with the trial judge’s finding of fact only where it is plainly wrong or against the weight of the evidence (see <span class="font-italic">ADF v Public Prosecutor</span> [2010] 1 SLR 874 at [16(a)]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 In our judgment, far from his finding in this regard being plainly wrong or against the weight of evidence, the Judge was more than justified in the conclusions that he reached. There was therefore no basis for us to interfere with his finding that the two cautioned statements and the three long statements by the Appellant had been made voluntarily and were thus admissible as evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 The Appellant’s evidence on the inadmissibility of his statements was erratic, and his explanations, highly improbable. These two factors, apart from undermining the veracity of his account of the recording of the statements, combined to detract from his overall reliability and credibility as a witness. We will address the position in respect of the two cautioned statements before turning to the position in respect of the three long statements.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The admissibility of the two cautioned statements</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Three factors led us to reject the Appellant’s narrative as to the involuntariness of his two cautioned statements. First, there were inconsistencies between the case which the Appellant’s counsel put to ASP Tang and the Appellant’s own evidence; indeed, there were inconsistencies even within the Appellant’s own evidence. Four of these inconsistencies bear mention:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The Appellant’s counsel, when cross-examining ASP Tang, put it to him that the Appellant’s cautioned statements had been made involuntarily because they had been induced by threats or had been recorded under oppressive circumstances. Significantly, counsel <span class="font-italic">did not</span> put to ASP Tang an additional ground which the Appellant mentioned for the first time only in his examination-in-chief, namely, that he had been induced to admit to the offences by a promise from ASP Tang to help to bring his (the Appellant’s) wife to Singapore to see him.

In cross-examination, however, the Appellant changed his position and claimed that the cautioned statements had not been made by him at all and also had not been explained to him. Instead, ASP Tang and/or Mdm Sophia had fabricated the statements, and the Appellant had merely been asked to sign whenever a signature was required.

</div> When the Appellant was further asked in cross-examination whether Mdm Sophia translated those assertions to ASP Tang, the Appellant’s response was that he did not understand English. While English may not have been the Appellant’s primary language, it is, in our view, doubtful that his command of English was indeed so poor that he could not even tell whether or not Mdm Sophia was trying to relay his message to ASP Tang.

Given that the Appellant had, in his cautioned statements, effectively admitted to selling drugs for profit, if at least part of the large amount of cash found in his bedroom had come from peddling drugs, that would give the CNB all the more reason to confiscate the cash. It is inconceivable that the Appellant would think that by admitting to selling drugs, the CNB would not confiscate the cash found in his bedroom.

The fact that the Appellant gave the cautioned statements voluntarily is entirely consistent with the results of the medical examinations, which did not indicate anything out of the ordinary apart from superficial abrasions on the left side of the Appellant’s forehead.

But, the cumulative picture that emerged from the Appellant’s testimony on the recording of his statements was that he was making broad, unfocused and self-serving assertions in support of his position that his statements had been given involuntarily. His evidence was internally inconsistent and shifting, and even the final position that he settled on was difficult to accept.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 ASP Tang’s evidence, in contrast, was systematic and detailed. ASP Tang gave evidence that the recording of the Appellant’s statements had been routine, and that the statements had been interpreted and read back to the Appellant, who had been permitted to make corrections before signing the statements. ASP Tang’s evidence was unshaken under cross-examination. We therefore found no basis to disturb the Judge’s finding that the two cautioned statements and the three long statements by the Appellant had been made voluntarily.

Section 18(2) states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Any person who is proved or presumed to have had a controlled drug in his possession shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have known the nature of that drug.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The only question before us was whether, on the evidence, the Appellant had rebutted this presumption.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The Judge held that the Appellant had not done so. Having considered the evidence, we could not see any basis to disturb the Judge’s conclusion on this point. In explaining our reasons for so deciding, we first set out the law and review some cases which are illustrative of how and when the presumption of knowledge may be rebutted. We then turn to the objective contemporaneous evidence in the present case, which, in our judgment, corroborated and fortified the Judge’s conclusion that the Appellant was in fact peddling drugs and not just safekeeping the drugs in question for Latif.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 In <span class="font-italic">Nagae</span><span class="font-italic">nthran a/l K Dharmalingam v Public Prosecutor</span> [2011] 4 SLR 1156 (“<span class="font-italic">Nagae</span><span class="font-italic">nthran</span>”), this court addressed the effect of the presumption under s 18(2) of the MDA, and what an accused would need to show (as well as to what standard of proof) to rebut the presumption. In short, the accused would be required to establish on a balance of probabilities the <span class="font-italic">non</span>-existence of knowledge of the nature of the drugs concerned. He could do so by proving, for example, that he had mistakenly thought that the drugs in his possession were something innocuous, such as detergent. The remarks of Chan Sek Keong CJ in <span class="font-italic">Nagae</span><span class="font-italic">nthran</span> at [23], [24] and [27] are instructive and bear setting out at length:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">23 … To rebut the presumption of knowledge, all the accused has to do is to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that he <span class="font-italic">did not know</span> the nature of the controlled drug referred to in the charge. The material issue in s 18(2) of the MDA is <span class="font-italic">not</span> the <span class="font-italic">existence</span> of the accused’s knowledge of the controlled drug, <span class="font-italic">but</span> the <span class="font-italic">non-existence</span> of such knowledge on his part.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">24 As to the meaning of the phrase “the nature of the drug”, our view is that it refers to the actual controlled drug found in the “thing” (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, the bag or container, <span class="font-italic">etc</span>) that was in the possession of the accused at the material time. For instance, if heroin is found in a bag or a container in the accused’s possession and he is unable to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that he had no knowledge of the heroin (see [27] below), he would be presumed under s 18(2) of the MDA to have known of the heroin in his possession.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">27 How can an accused rebut the presumption of knowledge of the nature of the controlled drug found in his possession (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, in a bag he is carrying or on his person)? He can do so by proving, on a balance of probabilities, that he genuinely believed that what was in his possession was something innocuous (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, washing powder, when it was in fact heroin (see <span class="font-italic">Warner v Metropolitan Police Commissioner</span> [1969] 2 AC 256)), or that he thought it was a controlled drug other than the one actually found in this possession (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, where he genuinely believed he was carrying “ice”, rather than heroin (see <span class="font-italic">Khor Soon Lee v PP</span> [2011] 3 SLR 201)).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Chan CJ also emphasised at [31] of <span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran</span> that the inquiry was, in the final analysis, one of fact.

This is a question of fact in each case, and turns very much on the trial judge’s assessment of the credibility of the defence witnesses (especially that of the accused, if he chooses to testify).

He admitted that he was a drug courier for a person named Tony, and that he had been tasked by Tony to carry drugs from Malaysia into Singapore. He asserted, however, that he had been led to believe that he was carrying only erimin, ketamine and ecstasy, the trafficking of which did not attract the death penalty, and not heroin, the trafficking of which did.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 The accused’s evidence was that when Tony approached him to deliver drugs, he specifically asked Tony whether heroin would be involved in the deliveries. The accused did not want to traffic in heroin because he was afraid of the death penalty. Tony assured the accused that the deliveries would not involve heroin. The accused’s evidence to that effect was not challenged by the Prosecution (see <span class="font-italic">Khor Soon Lee</span> at [6]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 In the result, this court held that in the circumstances, the accused had rebutted the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA. The court relied on the following facts to reach that conclusion:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The accused had, on numerous previous occasions, assisted Tony in transporting drugs into Singapore. He had been assured by Tony on those occasions that the drugs did not include heroin. There was accordingly a consistent pattern of importing controlled drugs, the importation of which did not carry the sanction of capital punishment. The particular transaction involved in <span class="font-italic">Khor Soon Lee</span>, which involved diamorphine, was a deviation from this consistent pattern (see <span class="font-italic">Khor Soon Lee</span> at [23]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) In view of the consistent and established pattern of importation, the accused had no reason to suspect that the package in question in <span class="font-italic">Khor Soon Lee</span> contained diamorphine (see <span class="font-italic">Khor Soon Lee</span> at [24]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The accused had a close personal relationship with Tony and trusted him. That explained why he believed Tony’s assurance that the packages which he delivered for Tony would not contain diamorphine, and why he adhered to Tony’s instructions not to open up those packages (see <span class="font-italic">Khor Soon Lee</span> at [25]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Tony’s DNA was found on the package in question in <span class="font-italic">Khor Soon Lee</span>, which corroborated the accused’s account that Tony had a significant role in the transaction (see <span class="font-italic">Khor Soon Lee</span> at [25]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) All of the above assertions were not challenged by the Prosecution.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">This court therefore concluded that whilst the accused might have been negligent or reckless in not checking the contents of the package involved in <span class="font-italic">Khor Soon Lee</span>, he had not been wilfully blind and, therefore, had established the <span class="font-italic">non</span>-existence of any knowledge that what he was carrying was heroin (see <span class="font-italic">Khor Soon Lee</span> at [28]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 The later case of <span class="font-italic">Din</span><span class="font-italic">esh Pillai a/l K Raja Retnam v Public Prosecutor</span> [2012] 2 SLR 903 (“<span class="font-italic">Dinesh Pillai</span>”) provides a useful contrast to <span class="font-italic">Khor Soon Lee</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 The offender in <span class="font-italic">Dinesh Pillai</span> was paid to deliver “secret” and “expensive” food from Malaysia to Singapore (see <span class="font-italic">Dinesh Pillai </span>at [2]). The food was given to the offender wrapped in brown paper and placed in a red plastic bag along with a packet of curry and a packet of freshly cut chilli. The offender was instructed to carry the packet of food across Woodlands Checkpoint, and thereafter wait for instructions on whom it was to be delivered to.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 The offender made two deliveries in this manner on separate occasions. He was paid RM200 for the first delivery and RM300 for the second. He was arrested while making his third delivery, and the substance wrapped in brown paper on that occasion (“the Brown Packet”) was found, upon analysis, to contain not less than 19.35g of diamorphine. The offender argued that “although he suspected that the Brown Packet contained contraband or something illegal, he never associated it with a controlled drug, much less diamorphine” (see <span class="font-italic">Dinesh Pillai </span>at [19]). He claimed that he was shocked when he was informed by the CNB that the Brown Packet contained diamorphine.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 This court dismissed the offender’s argument and held that he had not rebutted the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA. This was because he did not believe that the Brown Packet contained only food and had the opportunity to check what was in it; yet, he did not do so (see <span class="font-italic">Dinesh Pillai</span> at [20]–[21]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">20 … This is not a case where the appellant reasonably believed that the Brown Packet contained some controlled drug other than diamorphine (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, “ice”, ecstasy, <span class="font-italic">etc</span>) and had good reason for such belief (compare, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, … <span class="font-italic">Khor Soon Lee</span> …) … In the present case, the appellant <span class="font-italic">did not bother to take the simple step of peeping into the Brown Packet to see what it contained despite suspecting that it contained something illegal</span> …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">21 In our view, the appellant has failed to rebut the s 18(2) MDA presumption on a balance of probabilities because <span class="font-italic">he turned a blind eye to what the Brown Packet contained despite suspecting that it contained something illegal</span>. The factual distinction between this case and <span class="font-italic">Khor Soon Lee</span> is that in the latter case, <span class="font-italic">the accused did not have any suspicion that he was carrying anything other than erimin and ketamine (which the court accepted)</span>. In contrast, in the present case, the appellant was aware that he was carrying something illegal, and he could easily have verified what that thing was by simply opening the Brown Packet. <span class="font-italic">It was not enough for the appellant to take the position that he did not open the Brown Packet because he had been told not to do so.</span> …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 <span class="font-italic">Khor Soon Lee</span> and <span class="font-italic">Dinesh Pillai</span> illustrate the need to examine with care the entire circumstances in which the transaction in question occurred, and, in relation to cases such as the present, the importance of scrutinising the evidence and narrative given by the offender to determine its veracity.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The evidence in the present case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 In the present case, we could not find any basis for interfering with the Judge’s conclusion that the Appellant knew the nature of the drugs in his possession. There were at least three factors, all independent of the  admissions in the Appellant’s statements, which led us to reject his narrative and affirm the Judge’s conclusion.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Gaps and internal incoherence in the Appellant’s narrative</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 First, there were gaps in the Appellant’s account of the material events that ruptured the internal coherence of his narrative. The Appellant offered no convincing explanation for his unquestioning subservience to Latif. He did not explain why Latif telephoned for no apparent reason to ask him to safekeep A1, A2 and the wrapped package in G1 for a day. He also did not explain why he agreed to Latif’s request without inquiring further. In respect of A1 and A2, the Appellant said that Latif “wanted to see his friend in Jurong”, and that “[i]t was troublesome for him to … bring [the bags] along with him”.

</div> But, even if that was accepted – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, even if it was indeed the case that the Appellant was prepared to safekeep A1 and A2 for Latif for no apparent reason – there was no reason why the Appellant should have been willing to drive to Joo Koon Circle from the Flat in Bukit Batok later in the afternoon on the same day just to receive yet <span class="font-italic">another</span> item from Latif (<span class="font-italic">viz</span>, the wrapped package in G1) for safekeeping.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 The bizarreness of the Appellant’s account was heightened by his admission that he had never “collected any stuff from [Latif] before – prior to the day of [his] arrest”.

</div> The Appellant also gave no explanation as to why he did not probe Latif further on the contents of A1, A2 and the wrapped package in G1, or even just glance at or feel the contents of those three items to try to find out for himself what they contained.

The DNA Profiling Laboratory at the HSA conducted DNA profiling on A1, and the results revealed the presence of the Appellant’s DNA on both the exterior and the interior surfaces of A1. The Appellant’s evidence was that when he received A1 and A2 from Latif, A1 was inside A2. The Appellant did not open up A2 or even look into it after receiving it from Latif.

Instead, during cross-examination, he attempted to explain the presence of his DNA on the interior surface of A1 in this way: when he placed A2 (which, according to him, was the outer bag) into the above-mentioned drawer, he “noticed [at] the opening [of A2], there was a plastic bag, red plastic bag [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, A1] … that is about to come out”.

</div> the day after the Appellant’s arrest. It was thus sent to the Appellant the day after he claimed to have received A1, A2 and the wrapped package in G1 from Latif for safekeeping. This message was incompatible with the Appellant’s account that Latif had given him those three items the day before merely for safekeeping. If that had indeed been the case, one would have expected Latif to simply ask the Appellant where he (the Appellant) was, so that Latif could retrieve those items from him. Instead, the text message expressed Latif’s concern that there might have been a “problem” with what he had given the Appellant the previous day, and that the Appellant might have been “short of the stuff”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 Taking it at its highest, the second text message suggested that the Appellant had purchased drugs from Latif, and that Latif was asking him whether the amount of drugs was correct. Even taking it at its lowest, this message undermined the Appellant’s account of his interactions with Latif on 6 July 2010. It was not just a case of the Appellant blindly obeying Latif’s instructions to safekeep A1, A2 and the wrapped package in G1.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 When the Appellant was cross-examined on these two text messages, his only response was to deny that he knew what either of these messages meant,

Even leaving aside the admissions in the Appellant’s statements, the large amount of cash found in his bedroom and the sizeable sum of approximately $100,000 in Mdm Bibah’s bank account, it was our judgment that the Appellant had failed to establish on a balance of probabilities that he did not know the nature of the drugs in his possession.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 These factors, when considered in their totality, corroborated the admissions in the Appellant’s cautioned statements and long statements, which, in our view, were rightly admitted by the Judge as evidence. The large quantity of drugs found in the Appellant’s bedroom, together with other drug-related paraphernalia such as smaller unused Ziploc bags, rubber bands, a stained weighing scale and a stained spoon, strongly suggested that the Appellant was trafficking in drugs. The Appellant had therefore failed to rebut the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA, and the Judge was entitled to find that the Prosecution had established beyond reasonable doubt that the Appellant was in possession of the drugs for the purpose of trafficking in them. We therefore dismissed his appeal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 There is, however, one inconsequential error in the Judge’s decision which we need to mention. One of the factors which the Judge relied on in convicting the Appellant was that Mdm Bibah’s passbook had been found in the Appellant’s bedroom as opposed to her own bedroom (see <span class="font-italic">Abdul Kahar (Conviction)</span> at [12]; see also [32] above). That was, however, an incorrect factual position. The Prosecution’s witnesses gave clear and uncontroverted evidence that the passbook had been recovered from <span class="font-italic">Mdm Bibah’s</span> bedroom rather than the Appellant’s.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> We rejected this argument as it was wholly without merit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 First, the Appellant did not establish any legal basis for staying the execution of his death sentence pending the resolution of two other<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">unrelated </span>cases. Second, it was, in any event, difficult to see how the outcome of the two other cases which raised the constitutionality of s 33B of the MDA would have any bearing on the Appellant’s case. It was clear that the Appellant could not avail himself of the “substantive assistance” provision in s 33B of the MDA as the prerequisites to trigger the operation of that provision had not been met. The Public Prosecutor had not given the Appellant a certificate of substantive assistance. Moreover, the Appellant’s involvement in drug trafficking was not confined to “transporting, sending or delivering a controlled drug” within the terms of s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) of the MDA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 At this juncture, we should explain that the Judge convicted the Appellant of the two drug trafficking charges on 27 August 2013, and thereafter delivered his judgment on sentence (reported as <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Abdul Kahar bin Othman</span> [2013] SGHC 222 (“<span class="font-italic">Abdul Kahar (Sentencing)</span>”)) on 24 October 2013. In that judgment, the Judge drew attention to the then “newly-enacted s 33B of the [MDA]” (see <span class="font-italic">Abdul Kahar (Sentencing)</span> at [1]). He held that “[a]lthough … the [Appellant’s] involvement … went beyond transporting, sending, or delivering the drugs”, he would give the Appellant “the benefit of the doubt” (see <span class="font-italic">Abdul Kahar (Sentencing)</span> at [4]) since the case was “among the first cases under the new provisions” (see <span class="font-italic">Abdul Kahar (Sentencing)</span> at [5]). He thus held that the Appellant “had acted as a ‘courier’ only” (see <span class="font-italic">Abdul Kahar (Sentencing)</span> at [5]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 The Judge’s decision on sentence formed the basis of a criminal reference brought by the Prosecution and heard by this court as it was constituted for the present appeal. We unanimously held, in a judgment reported as <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Chum Tat Suan and another</span> [2015] 1 SLR 834 (“<span class="font-italic">Chum Tat Suan</span>”), that the Judge was “wrong to have held that [the Appellant] was a courier when the Judge was ‘satisfied that [the Appellant’s] involvement in trafficking <span class="font-italic">went beyond transporting, sending or delivering</span> [the drugs]’” [emphasis in original] (see <span class="font-italic">Chum Tat Suan</span> at [70]). We thus quashed the Judge’s decision on sentence, and remitted the matter to him to determine whether the Appellant’s involvement in drug trafficking was restricted to the activities within s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA. Thereafter, the Judge found that the activities which the Appellant had engaged in fell outside the scope of that provision, and accordingly sentenced him to death.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 In our judgment, it was clear that the Appellant would not be able to avail himself of s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA, not least because his involvement in drug trafficking went beyond “transporting, sending or delivering a controlled drug”. There was no reason to interfere with the Judge’s finding that the Appellant was actively involved in purchasing, re-packaging and selling drugs. We therefore refused to stay the execution of the Appellant’s death sentence.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 For all of the foregoing reasons, we could not find any basis to interfere with the Judge’s decision to convict the Appellant and sentence him to death. We also could not see any basis to admit the further evidence which the Appellant sought leave to introduce on appeal, or to stay the execution of his death sentence. We therefore dismissed his appeal, as well as his application for leave to adduce further evidence and his request for a stay of the execution of his sentence.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Chao Hick Tin         Woo Bih Li          Tay Yong Kwang<br/>Judge of Appeal        Judge                  Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Rupert Seah (Rupert Seah &amp; Co) and Ranadhir Gupta (A ZamZam &amp; Co) for the appellant;<br/>Mark Jayaratnam and Lim How Khang (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the respondent.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
