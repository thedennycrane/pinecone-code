<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This suit is but another chapter in the legal
                    saga involving the Chip Hup group of companies. The parties had asked that this
                    action be heard by the same judge hearing Suit 779 of 2006 (“Suit
                    779”) but subsequent thereto as Suit 779 was perceived as the main action
                    between the protagonists, Mr Lim Leong Huat (“Lim”) and
                    Mr Neo Kok Eng (“Neo”). This is encapsulated in the order of
                    court dated 4 September 2008. There have been and still are a number of related
                    actions arising from the disputes between the protagonists: see <em>Lim Leong Huat v Chip Hup Hup Kee Construction Pte Ltd</em>
                    [2010] SGHC 170 (“<em>Lim Leong
                    Huat</em>”) at [19].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The first defendant in this suit, Neo, is the
                    main character in the entire saga. Neo is a director and the registered holder
                    of 99.11% of the shares in the second defendant, Chip Hup Holding Pte Ltd
                    (“CHH”). Neo is also the husband of the third defendant, Mdm Sun
                    Seow Eng, whom I shall refer to as “Mrs Neo”. The plaintiff,
                    Mr Tan Yong San (“Tan”), is the registered holder of the
                    remaining 0.89% of the shares in CHH. Tan was also formerly a director of CHH
                    until his removal by Neo in December 2006.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       In the present action, Tan is suing all three
                    defendants under s 216 of the Companies Act (Cap 50,
                    2006 Rev Ed) on the basis that Neo had been running the affairs of CHH
                    in a manner oppressive to him. Although Mrs Neo is not a shareholder of CHH
                    and had no role in its management, she has also been named as a defendant
                    because Tan is seeking certain reliefs against her pursuant to his claim under
                    s 216. Tan alleges further or in the alternative that Neo and Mrs Neo
                    had unlawfully conspired to injure him as a shareholder of CHH.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The facts</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Neo was originally in the business of timber
                    trading. His late father started the business as a sole proprietorship in the
                    1950s and was assisted by Neo and his three brothers, Neo Kok Ching
                    (“NKC”), Neo Kok Hua and Neo Kok Khuan. In 1979, Neo’s
                    family incorporated a company called Chip Hup Timber Pte Ltd (“CH
                    Timber”) to take over the business. Neo and his brothers were made
                    shareholders of CH Timber. I note that Neo had testified in Suit 779 that CH
                    Timber was incorporated in 1982 but this discrepancy is not
                material.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       After CH Timber was formed, Neo went on to
                    incorporate the following companies, either by himself or with his
                    brothers:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Chip Hup Hup Kee Trading Pte Ltd, a building and
                            construction company incorporated in 1983, which was subsequently
                            renamed as Chip Hup Hup Kee Construction Pte Ltd
                            (“CHKC”);</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">CHH, which was incorporated in 1989 to complement
                            CH Timber’s business;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Chippel Overseas Supplies Pte Ltd
                            (“COS”), a general import and export company incorporated
                            in 1989; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Chippel Construction Pte Ltd
                            (“CCPL”), a building and construction company incorporated
                            in 1997.</div>
<p class="Judg-1">I will refer to CH Timber, CHKC, CHH, COS and CCPL collectively as
                    “the Chip Hup Group”. At all times until the restructuring of the
                    Chip Hup Group in 1999 (see <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a> below), Neo
                    owned 100% of the shares in COS and CCPL either directly or indirectly through
                    his nominees Peter Tan, Sun Bee Choo and Wendy Loh.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       From the early 90s onwards, Neo’s brothers
                    began to leave the family businesses one by one and transferred any shares they
                    held in CH Timber, CHH and CHKC to Neo. Neo’s father passed away in 1993
                    although his estate continued to retain some shares in CH Timber. By 1996, only
                    NKC and Neo remained in the family business. In time, NKC wanted to leave as
                    well and accordingly transferred his shares in CH Timber to Neo. NKC had also
                    intended to transfer his shares in CHH and CHKC to Neo around that time but was
                    unable to do so. This was because under the law as it stood then, every company
                    had to have at least two shareholders and two directors, in accordance with ss
                    42 and 145(1) of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 1994 Rev Ed)
                    respectively. Since Neo and NKC were the only two shareholders and directors of
                    CHH and CHKC at the time, NKC was unable to transfer his shares and
                    directorships in those companies until Neo found a replacement. At this point,
                    NKC held one share in CHH and 247,000 shares in CHKC.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Tan’s acquisition of shares in CHH and CHKC</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Lim is someone who played a very important role
                    in the events leading up to this suit. He was the general manager of CHKC from
                    1994 until 2006. He is also Tan’s brother-in-law. Sometime in 1998, Lim
                    had recommended to Neo that Tan was a suitable candidate to take over
                    NKC’s shares and directorships in CHH and CHKC. At that time, Tan was
                    working with a company called Oceanwell Shipping Pte Ltd (which was owned by his
                    brother) and drawing a salary of about $1,300 a month. He had no other income,
                    owned no real property and he was staying with his parents in their HDB flat at
                    Eunos Cresecent. Neo agreed with Lim’s recommendation. Thus in 1998, NKC
                    transferred his one share in CHH and 50,000 shares in CHKC to Tan. NKC’s
                    remaining 197,000 shares in CHKC were transferred to Neo. Tan was also made a
                    director of CHH and CHKC. It is not disputed that Tan did not pay for the shares
                    he received. His share certificates were left with CHH.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       After Tan became a director and shareholder of
                    CHH and CHKC, he was paid a monthly fee of $1,200 by CHKC. This fee was
                    increased to $2,000 from 2000. Tan was also made a director of COS in 1999, and
                    of CH Timber and CCPL in 2002. He received additional director’s fees from
                    COS beginning 1999 and from CH Timber beginning 2005. Thus, from 2005, Tan was
                    being paid approximately $4,000 per month for his various directorships in the
                    Chip Hup Group. He did not acquire any shares in COS, CH Timber or
                CCPL.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       By the end of 1998, the shareholding of the Chip
                    Hup Group was as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Restructuring of the Chip Hup Group</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     In 1999, the Chip Hup Group was restructured.
                    CHH became the holding company, holding 100% of the shares in CHKC, COS and
                    CCPL, and 89% in CH Timber. As part of the restructuring, a share swap was
                    carried out whereby Neo’s and Tan’s shares in CHH’s
                    subsidiaries were transferred to CHH in consideration for CHH issuing them new
                    shares. These new shares issued by CHH to Neo and Tan were equivalent to the
                    cash value of the shares they had transferred to CHH as part of the share swap.
                    Thus, Neo was issued 18,422,350 shares, while Tan was issued 169,250 shares. CHH
                    also issued additional shares to Neo on two subsequent occasions:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_a"></a>(a)     In the year ending 31 May 2001, Neo
                        subscribed and paid for 350,000 more shares in CHH.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_b"></a>(b)     Sometime in May 2002, the remaining
                        shares of CH Timber which were previously held by Neo’s father’s
                        estate were given to Neo by the beneficiaries of the estate. Neo then
                        transferred those shares to CHH in exchange for CHH issuing 115,211
                        additional shares to Neo. As a result, CH Timber also became 100% owned by
                        CHH.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Thus, from the end of 2002 until the time of
                    this action, Neo had a total of 18,887,563 shares or 99.11% of the share capital
                    of CHH. Tan had a total of 169,251 shares or 0.89% of the share capital of CHH.
                    Tan signed all the necessary documents authorising the restructuring of the Chip
                    Hup Group and the allotment of additional shares to Neo by CHH.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The management of CHH and CHKC</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     From the time that Tan became a director and
                    shareholder of CHH and CHKC, he did not participate in the management of either
                    company. Most of the revenue in the Chip Hup Group was in fact coming from its
                    construction arm, CHKC, whose daily operations were being run by Lim and Neo.
                    Under Lim’s management, CHKC’s business grew rapidly. Its annual
                    revenue increased from $6.6m in 1994 (the year Lim joined) to $78.8m in 1998 at
                    the height of the construction boom. Although its business slowed down from 2000
                    onwards, its revenue was still consistently around the $40m mark. Tan’s
                    role in all this was to come to the office once in a while to sign documents in
                    his capacity as a director. He also signed the audited accounts of CHH and CHKC
                    every year. If there were any documents that needed signing urgently, Lim would
                    bring them to Tan when they met for lunch.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Most of the documents which Tan was required
                    to sign were counter-indemnities for various insurance companies. CHKC employed
                    many foreign workers in its construction business and, as such, was required to
                    furnish a security bond of $5,000 per worker to the Controller of Immigration.
                    These security bonds were provided in the form of insurance guarantees by the
                    insurance companies, who in turn required CHKC and its directors (<em>ie</em> Neo and Tan) to indemnify them for any liability
                    under the guarantees. Aside from these counter-indemnities, Neo and Tan also
                    signed personal guarantees for credit facilities granted to CHKC.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Tan’s ouster from the Chip Hup Group</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Lim’s and Neo’s 12-year cosy
                    relationship came to an end in late 2006. Both Lim and Neo had differing
                    versions as to why they had a big fall out in late 2006 (see <em>Lim Leong Huat</em> at [8]). It is clear, and I so found in Suit 779,
                    that they fell out over money. Things came to a head in late October 2006 when
                    Neo and Lim had a major and very public quarrel in the office over the amount of
                    loans CHKC allegedly owed Lim. Neo suspended Lim from employment and eventually
                    dismissed him in November 2006. Lim then brought a claim against CHKC and Neo to
                    enforce repayment of his loans (totalling $7.205m), causing CHKC to respond with
                    a massive counterclaim of $55m (later reduced to $40m). That action became Suit
                    779 which was also heard and decided by me.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Unsurprisingly, the relationship between Tan
                    and Neo also deteriorated soon after Lim and Neo fell out. Both parties dispute
                    the exact reasons leading to Tan’s ouster from the Chip Hup Group but it
                    was clear at least, and I so find, that Neo no longer trusted Tan as he believed
                    Tan was aligned with Lim. By a letter dated 7 December 2006, Neo wrote to Tan
                    requesting and requiring him to resign as a director of CHH and CHKC. Tan was
                    also removed as a director of CH Timber, COS and CCPL shortly
                thereafter.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Tan’s claim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Tan filed this present action in April 2007.
                    He accused Neo of oppressive conduct by removing him as a director of all the
                    companies in the Chip Hup Group for no good reason. Tan also alleged that even
                    before his removal from the Chip Hup Group, Neo had been guilty of several
                    improper and oppressive acts in his management of CHH, which Tan only discovered
                    after his ouster. Tan’s pleaded complaints against Neo are as

                    asking for CHH to be wound up, for Neo and Mrs Neo to account for the
                    monies they allegedly misappropriated or misused, and for the various improper
                    transactions listed above to be rectified or cancelled. Tan is also claiming in
                    the alternative that Neo and Mrs Neo had unlawfully conspired to injure him
                    by arranging for CHKC to pay them inflated amounts as reimbursement for
                    groceries purchased for CHKC’s foreign workers. It should be noted that
                    Tan’s complaint against Mrs Neo only relates to the groceries issue
                    (at [16(e)] above).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Defence and counterclaim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Neo has raised a number of defences to
                    Tan’s claim. First, he contends that Tan was only holding his shares in
                    CHH and CHKC as his nominee. Consequently, Tan is not entitled to complain of
                    any oppressive conduct on his part. Secondly, Neo claims that the acts
                    complained of at <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a> above were either
                    carried out legitimately or not carried out at all. As such, there was no
                    oppression to speak of in any event. Lastly, Neo contends that Tan is barred
                    from bringing this claim now due to limitation, laches and acquiescence.
                    Following his allegation that Tan was only a nominee shareholder, Neo has also
                    counterclaimed for an order compelling Tan to transfer his 169,251 shares in CHH
                    to Neo. As for Mrs Neo, she has adopted Neo’s defence against Tan and
                    also raises one additional point – that her role was limited to helping
                    Neo purchase groceries for CHKC and that it was only Neo who made reimbursement
                    claims from CHKC.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues arising in this action</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Therefore, there are four issues to be

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">My findings in Suit 779 of 2006</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Before I deal with the various issues here, it
                    is crucial to first reiterate certain findings I made in Suit 779, which was
                    heard by me just before the trial of this action. This is because there are
                    certain factual issues common to both proceedings. In fact, counsel for both
                    sides agreed, in chambers before the start of this trial, that the evidence used
                    in Suit 779 could be used as evidence here. It was on this basis that a lot of
                    the documents used in Suit 779, including a manual cash book, (using the same
                    annotation “3.EAB.11” as in Suit 779), were put into the evidence
                    in this action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     As noted above, Suit 779 was concerned with
                    Lim’s claim against CHKC and Neo for the return of his loans. CHKC
                    responded with a counterclaim against Lim, his wife, and a company owned by Lim
                    called AZ Associates Pte Ltd (“AZ”). CHKC’s (and
                    Neo’s) case was that during his employment with CHKC, Lim had full control
                    over its accounts, finances and operations and abused his position by
                    misappropriating CHKC’s funds, wrongfully manipulating its accounts,
                    overpaying himself salaries without authority and unlawfully retaining profits
                    from certain construction projects. All this wrongdoing was purportedly
                    discovered only after Lim and Neo fell out and Neo began to investigate
                    Lim’s claim that CHKC owed him millions. Lim denied these acts of
                    wrongdoing and pointed the finger right back at Neo, saying that Neo was the one
                    in control of CHKC and had in fact been treating CHKC as his personal cash
                    register by unlawfully siphoning monies out of it, in addition to other
                    nefarious activities. After a six-week trial and three days of closing
                    submissions, I granted judgment mainly in favour of Lim on 8 June 2010 while
                    dismissing most of CHKC’s counterclaims. Both parties’ appeals
                    against my decision were dismissed by the Court of Appeal in November 2010. My
                    pertinent findings in Suit 779 are summarised below at <a href="#p1_22">[22]</a>–<a href="#p1_26">[26]</a>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     I found that <em>both</em> Lim and Neo were engaged in a host of unlawful and
                    unsavoury practices at CHKC, each with the knowledge and connivance of the
                    other. Examples of such practices included:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_a"></a>(a)     The issuance of fictitious invoices
                        by CHKC for work which was not done in order to artificially inflate
                        CHKC’s pre-tax profits with a view to listing CHH on the Singapore
                        Exchange;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
                        withdrawal of monies from CHKC in the form of cheques which were recorded as
                        payments to fictitious subcontractors; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_c"></a>(c)     The creation of “Salary Accruals”
                        accounts to siphon off tax-free income from CHKC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     I must elaborate more on the Salary Accruals
                    accounts as this forms one of Tan’s alleged acts of oppression (see
                    [16(f)] above). I found that for a long time, Lim and Neo had implemented a
                    system in CHKC where it pretended to pay the salaries of non-existent local
                    workers. These phantom workers, euphemistically called “Proxies”,
                    were real persons complete with identity card numbers and Central Provident Fund
                    (“CPF”) accounts. They were put on CHKC’s payroll but did
                    not do any actual work for the company nor were they paid a salary as such. CHKC
                    only paid the CPF components of their notional salaries. The purpose of these
                    Proxies was to create the false impression that CHKC had more local workers on
                    its payroll than there actually were, enabling it to circumvent foreign worker
                    quotas set by the Ministry of Manpower. As a result, CHKC was able to hire
                    significantly more foreign workers than it otherwise could have.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     I also found that although CHKC did not pay
                    the non-CPF component of the Proxies’ salaries, Neo (with Lim’s
                    assistance) had falsified CHKC’s accounts to reflect these salaries as
                    having been paid personally by Neo. These were the Salary Accruals accounts. Neo
                    would then draw monies from CHKC out of these accounts as purported
                    reimbursement of the salaries he “paid” on behalf of CHKC. The
                    Salary Accruals thus allowed Neo to evade income tax as the monies from such
                    accounts could be appropriated directly without forming part of CHKC’s
                    taxable income. Lim initially helped Neo to maintain the Salary Accruals
                    accounts, but was later given a share of the spoils from 2001 onwards. Neo
                    admitted in cross-examination during the trial of Suit 779 that he had drawn
                    more than $10m from Salary Accruals over the years. Lim, on his part, claimed
                    that he was entitled to $6m from the Salary Accruals accounts as Neo had
                    allegedly promised him a 40% share of the Salary Accruals. While I did not make
                    a finding on the exact amounts drawn out from CHKC, it was obvious that both Lim
                    and Neo were up to their necks in this scheme and had between them siphoned off
                    millions of dollars from the company before their falling out in
                2006.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     My next two findings relate to Tan’s
                    complaints at [16(d)] and [16(e)] above. Neo’s reliance on foreign workers
                    for CHKC’s business was not merely due to the fact that foreign workers
                    were cheaper and more productive. They were also quite literally a source of his
                    wealth. Each foreign worker had to pay a yearly commission of about $2,000 to
                    $3,000 to their Singapore employer, which was used to defray various expenses
                    connected to their employment. I found that Neo had misappropriated the
                    commissions paid by CHKC’s Chinese foreign workers which were meant for
                    CHKC. I also found that Neo had been submitting inflated claims to CHKC for
                    grocery expenses purportedly incurred by him and Mrs Neo for CHKC’s
                    foreign workers. Unlike the system of Salary Accruals mentioned earlier, there
                    was no evidence of Lim’s involvement in these activities. Indeed, I found
                    that Neo had kept tight control over CHKC’s Chinese foreign workers and
                    that the management team of these Chinese workers (which I will refer to as the
                    “China Team”) reported to Neo, not Lim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Lastly, I made certain findings on the general
                    credibility of Neo and his key witnesses. It became apparent during the trial of
                    Suit 779 that Neo was prepared to and did lie at the drop of a hat. Despite
                    being caught out on his evidence repeatedly during cross-examination by
                    Lim’s counsel, Neo stubbornly continued to insist that he left complete
                    control of CHKC to Lim and was unaware of the various nefarious activities going
                    on in the company, in the face of overwhelming proof to the contrary. Aside from
                    fabricating evidence at trial, I found that Neo had been guilty of swearing
                    false affidavits, misleading the court in prior proceedings, and withholding
                    discovery of important documents. I also made adverse findings against two of
                    Neo’s key witnesses, Aileen Khoo Choon Yean (“Aileen”) and
                    Juliet Siah Jui Gek (“Juliet”). Aileen and Juliet were accounts
                    executives in CHKC and gave evidence for Neo in both Suit 779 and this action.
                    Like her boss Neo, I found that Aileen was fabricating evidence during the trial
                    of Suit 779. She remained evasive and uncooperative in cross-examination even as
                    her lies were exposed one by one. She, like Neo, had also sworn false affidavits
                    in prior proceedings, and she even resorted to forging documents to support CHKC
                    in its counterclaim. Juliet was not as evasive as Aileen but she was a very
                    non-committal witness and seemed to be just confirming what the other witnesses
                    were saying. She, like Aileen, had also given false evidence in prior
                    proceedings before the trial of Suit 779 and was unable to explain why she did
                    so when pressed in cross-examination. The unreliability of CHKC’s key
                    witnesses was one major reason why I found most of its counterclaims to be
                    totally false.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Having said all this, I was constantly alive
                    to the danger of pre-judging the issues in the present action based on my
                    knowledge of matters in Suit 779 alone. As the present case ultimately involves
                    different parties, different issues and fresh evidence, my findings in Suit 779
                    were only relevant to, but not conclusive of, the issues in this case. With this
                    caveat in mind, I now turn to the issues proper.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">First issue – Whether Tan was a nominee shareholder in
                CHH</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Neo’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Neo’s case is that by 1996, NKC had
                    already become a nominee shareholder and director of CHH and CHKC after he
                    decided that he wanted to leave the management of both companies. Accordingly,
                    NKC signed blank transfer forms for the transfer of his shares and passed them
                    to Neo.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> Subsequently in 1998, Lim advised Neo to appoint
                    Tan as his nominee in NKC’s stead so that they did not have to keep
                    troubling NKC to sign documents. Although Neo had never met Tan before, he
                    agreed to Lim’s proposal because he trusted Lim, and left it to him to
                    make the necessary arrangements. Neo then got NKC to sign the share transfer
                    forms transferring one share in CHH and 50,000 shares in CHKC to
                        Tan.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> In consideration of Tan agreeing
                    to become a nominee shareholder and director, and assume personal liability for
                    the various documents he signed (referred to at <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a> above), Neo got CHKC to pay Tan a monthly
                fee.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Neo contends that Tan’s conduct since
                    joining CHH and CHKC has always been consistent with that of a nominee
                    shareholder. Tan did not display any interest in the companies’
                    businesses. Tan admitted in his own Affidavit of Evidence in Chief
                    (“AEIC”) and in cross-examination that he would simply sign
                    documents when he was required to without raising much query.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> Furthermore, Tan did
                    not exercise any rights of ownership over his shares. He had left his share
                    certificates with CHH and did not ask for them until the commencement of this
                        suit.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> Despite his evidence that the main reason
                    for his becoming a director in the Chip Hup Group was the expected increase in
                    value of the shares when CHH was listed,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> he admitted in
                    cross-examination that he did not know when this would happen.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> Although he assumed that listing would take
                    place in about four to five years, he did not ask Lim or Neo what became of
                    their listing ambitions even after 2003, five years from the date he
                        joined.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Neo, on his part, did not regard Tan as a true
                    shareholder of CHH. He did not arrange to inform Tan of any matters other than
                    when his signature or input as a director was required.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> In
                    fact, Neo claimed in cross-examination that he had never even met or spoken to
                        Tan.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> Tan also confirmed that he had only been to
                    one of CHKC’s annual dinner and dance functions in 1999, where he was not
                    even seated at the main table alongside Lim and Neo.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Tan’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Tan’s case, on the other hand, is that
                    Lim had offered him the opportunity to replace NKC as a director of CHH and CHKC
                    in return for him signing the various counter-indemnities and personal
                    guarantees he was required to sign as a director of CHKC. As I noted above (at
                        <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a>), CHKC’s business grew
                    rapidly after Lim joined it in 1994 and this naturally meant that the number of
                    foreign workers it hired similarly increased. Indeed, from 1998 onwards, CHKC
                    was hiring close to 1,000 foreign workers a year on average. With a security
                    bond of $5,000 per foreign worker, the cumulative liability Tan was required to
                    assume was enormous. In return for him taking up this burden, Tan would be given
                    50,000 shares in CHKC and 1 share in CHH. Lim also informed Tan that there were
                    plans to list CHH and if they were successful, his shares would be worth a lot
                    of money.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Tan submits that CHH’s contemporary
                    documents did not evince the existence of a nominee arrangement between him and
                    Neo. On the contrary, they supported his case that he was the beneficial owner
                    of the shares. First, there was a letter dated 18 December 1999 from CHH to
                    the Commissioner of Stamp Duties informing it about the restructuring of the
                    Chip Hup Group and requesting for exemption from payment of stamp
                        duty.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> This letter was signed by Neo
                    and part of it is set out below:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...Miss Sun Bee Choo and Miss Wendy Loh Chen Yi who are

                    next to their names expressly identifying them as nominee shareholders of Neo.
                    There was no asterisk next to Tan’s name.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Secondly, the minutes of CHH’s
                    directors’ meeting on 18 December 1999<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> (which related to the restructuring of
                    the Chip Hup Group and the consequent allocation of shares by CHH) did not give
                    any indication that Tan would be holding his shares in CHH as a nominee
                    shareholder of Neo. Neo admitted in cross-examination that these minutes would
                    have been an opportune time to record the existence of such a nominee
                        arrangement.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Thirdly, there was a letter dated 28 April
                    2000 from JNL Secretarial &amp; Management Services (which provided secretarial

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">My findings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Unfortunately, a significant piece of the
                    evidence on this issue was missing. The most important ground of dispute between
                    the parties on this issue was what Lim said to Tan and Neo when Tan first agreed
                    to join CHH and CHKC in 1998. Lim was the crucial middleman who brokered the
                    arrangement between Tan and Neo. In this regard I accepted Neo’s evidence
                    that he did not deal with Tan directly in the negotiations leading to
                    Tan’s acquisition of the shares.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> Tan tried
                    to allege at trial that he had met Neo personally in September 1998 before
                    taking over NKC as a director and shareholder and that Neo had told him that
                    50,000 shares in CHKC would be given to him as a gift.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> I did not believe his claim. This fact was
                    obviously a very crucial one, yet Tan had failed to mention it in his AEIC. In
                    fact, his AEIC goes on to state at paragraph 23:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There was never any discussion between myself and Neo (whether directly or
                        through Lim), whereby it was agreed that I would be Neo’s nominee
                        shareholder and director. In fact, no such arrangement was ever proposed to
                        me, whether directly or indirectly. There is therefore no basis for the
                        Defendants’ allegation that I was Neo’s nominee.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">I find it very difficult to accept that Tan would have included such a
                    statement in his AEIC without mentioning also that Neo had, on the contrary,
                    promised to give him 50,000 shares in CHKC at the alleged September 1998
                    meeting. His allegation at trial was an afterthought.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Despite the fact that Lim was best placed to
                    give evidence on the actual arrangement between Tan and Neo, both sides have
                    chosen not to call him as a witness. Ironically, both sides in their closing
                    submissions have also pointed the finger at each other for failing to call Lim
                    to give evidence. Instead, Neo attempted to rely on the evidence of his former
                    nominees Peter Tan, Sun Bee Choo and Wendy Loh to prove that Tan was also his
                    nominee. I gave little weight to their evidence. None of these witnesses had any
                    personal knowledge of the circumstances concerning the transfer of shares from
                    NKC to Tan. Just because they were nominees did not prove that Tan was also a
                    nominee. None of these witnesses had direct knowledge and they were either
                    speculating or relying on what Neo himself had told them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     In my view, since Tan and Neo have given
                    diametrically opposing versions of what Lim had said to them, I am unable to
                    favour one version over the other when Lim was not even in court to be
                    cross-examined. As such, I placed little weight on what Lim had purportedly said
                    to either of them. Before reviewing the remaining evidence, it is apposite to
                    note that Neo bears the burden of proof here since he is the party alleging the
                    existence of the nominee arrangement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     I found much of the remaining evidence quite
                    equivocal. On one hand, I agree with Neo that Tan did not seem too concerned
                    about his shares in CHH, despite saying that he only agreed to become a director
                    because of the potential increase in their value following a public listing. He
                    never once asked Lim or Neo about how CHH’s plans to list were coming
                    along, even after his estimated waiting period of four to five years had
                    elapsed. He also admitted in cross-examination that he was not even aware of the
                    value of his shares when he first took over as a shareholder from
                        NKC.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> I found it odd that Tan would be interested
                    in the value of his shares following a listing, but not take the trouble to even
                    ask about their initial worth or when the listing would take place. On the
                    whole, my impression of Tan was that he was simply content to collect his
                    directors’ fees every month while signing off on documents without
                    question.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     On the other hand, I also agree with Tan that
                    the objective facts were not very consistent with him being a nominee. Prior to
                    the restructuring of the Chip Hup Group in 1999, Neo’s nominees Sun Bee
                    Choo and Wendy Loh held only one share in CH Timber, COS and CCPL (see the table
                    displaying the Chip Hup Group’s shareholding above at <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a>). Tan, in contrast, held 50,000 shares in CHKC.
                    If Neo had really intended to make Tan his nominee, there was no need to give
                    him so many shares. Neo claimed in cross-examination that Lim had asked him to
                    transfer 50,000 shares to Tan instead in order to “give him some
                        face”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> For the reasons given above at
                        <a href="#p1_37">[37]</a>, I gave little weight to this
                    explanation. In fact, I note that prior to transferring his 50,000 shares in
                    CHKC to Tan, NKC held 247,000 shares in CHKC which were split into six blocks.
                    These blocks of shares were captured in share certificates of one share, 70,000
                    shares, 29,999 shares, 20,000 shares, 42,500 shares and 84,500
                        shares.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> If Tan was just a nominee, it would
                    have been much easier to give him one of the existing share certificates for
                    42,500 shares or 70,000 shares since there would be no difference in substance.
                    Instead, the share certificate for 84,500 shares was split into 50,000 shares
                    which were transferred to Tan, and 34,500 shares which were transferred to Neo.
                    When Neo was confronted with this fact in cross-examination, he said
                    (unsurprisingly) that he just agreed with whatever Lim had proposed at that
                        time.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> I did not believe this at all.
                    I find that it was Neo who made this decision to split the 84,500 block of
                    shares and allot 50,000 shares to Tan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Furthermore, the outcome of the restructuring
                    of the Chip Hup Group was also inconsistent with Neo’s allegation that Tan
                    is a nominee shareholder. As noted above at <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a>, CHH issued 169,250 new shares to Tan as part of the share
                    swap following the restructuring. Neo admitted at trial that this was done with
                    his full knowledge and consent.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> If Tan
                    was merely a nominee, Neo could have simply got CHH to issue him a token round
                    number of shares like 10,000 or 50,000. The fact that Tan was issued 169,250
                    shares shows that his and Neo’s respective shareholdings in CHH were
                    carefully calibrated, since the number of shares issued by CHH was equivalent to
                    the cash value of the shares he and Neo had transferred to CHH pursuant to the
                    share swap. This exercise only made sense if Tan was to be the beneficial owner
                    of the new shares issued by CHH. The contemporaneous documentary evidence, some
                    of which as noted above were signed by Neo, supported Tan’s ownership of
                    the shares in his own right, see <a href="#p1_32">[32]</a>-<a href="#p1_34">[34]</a> above.
                    Additionally, I have found as a fact in Suit 779 that the idea to restructure
                    the Chip Hup Group and to list CHH was Neo’s idea. Nothing I heard from
                    the witnesses or the documents in this action has caused me to change my
                    mind.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Tan was cross-examined at length. Save for his
                    attempt to claim that he had met Neo prior to his being appointed as a director
                    and shareholder of CHKC and CHH, I found him to be a straightforward and
                    truthful witness. His answers were consistent and his story did not waver. I
                    therefore preferred Tan’s evidence over that of Neo, who told the same
                    lies as he did in Suit 779. Tan struck me, and I so find, that he was someone
                    without any great drive or ambition. He seemed content and never seemed to
                    strive very hard in his daily endeavours. What rang true, which he consistently
                    maintained, was that he had to sign numerous guarantees and counter-indemnities
                    as a director of CHKC. That liability was considerable compared to what he was
                    paid as a director. The shares were therefore as much an incentive for Tan
                    assuming this liability as the director’s fees he received. Tan’s
                    ambivalent interest in the value of his shares is but a reflection of his
                    character – if the reward came, he would happily take it; if it was
                    delayed he was not one to chase after it. I also find that he was confident that
                    between Lim and Neo and the apparent financial strength of CHKC, Tan thought the
                    possibility of being called upon to satisfy the guarantees or
                    counter-indemnities he signed was not high.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Having reviewed the evidence, I find that Tan
                    was the beneficial owner of his shares in CHH, and that no nominee arrangement
                    existed between him and Neo. Although I disbelieved his story that the shares
                    were his main reason for agreeing to become a director of CHH and CHKC, the
                    objective facts and contemporary documents relied on by him strongly supported
                    his case. I find that the monthly payments and to a lesser extent the ownership
                    of these shares were the principal reasons for Tan agreeing to be a director in
                    CHH and CHKC. Tan’s lack of any real interest in the shares or
                    participation in the companies as a director did not preclude him from asserting
                    that Neo had intended to give them to him beneficially. Not for the first time,
                    Neo tried to brush aside all this adverse evidence by saying that it was all
                    Lim’s doing, that he trusted Lim completely, and that Lim misled him into
                    signing documents in the belief Tan was just a nominee. However, he was unable
                    to explain in cross-examination why Lim would have wanted to deceive him in this
                    way long before their quarrel took place:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">I don’t know why he would want to hide things

                            I would sign. I left everything to him and I would just sign because
                            this is for a smoother process, as I usually do not go to the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Neo had adopted this same strategy here as he
                    did at the trial of Suit 779. He kept insisting that he blindly trusted Lim and
                    left Lim in control of CHKC’s affairs, while he remained blissfully
                    unaware of all the wrongdoing Lim was perpetrating in CHKC. I found this to be
                    an utter lie and what he said here only reinforced my initial view. Neo is a
                    shrewd and careful businessman who was very familiar with CHKC’s accounts,
                    finances and operations. He was not one to trust people blindly and nothing he
                    said in this trial changed my impression of him or the unreliability of his
                    evidence. There was no way he could have been misled by Lim into thinking that
                    Tan was a nominee shareholder when the surrounding evidence, including documents
                    he signed, suggested otherwise. Therefore, I find in favour of Tan on this
                    issue. It follows that Neo’s counterclaim against Tan must be
                    dismissed.</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Tan’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Tan’s case is that in November 2006,
                    after Lim and Neo had fallen out, he received a fax from ELS Corporate Services
                    Pte Ltd (“ELS”), which provided corporate secretarial services to
                    CHH, dated 14 November 2006 enclosing two letters of resignation (from CHH and
                    CHKC) for him to sign. Shortly thereafter, he received a telephone call from Neo
                    asking him to resign from the companies. Neo told him that CHKC owed money to
                    Lim and other creditors, and that he should resign to avoid any potential
                    liability. When Tan checked with Lim for details, Lim said that he was claiming
                    for the return of his loans from CHKC, and that Neo had suspended him from work
                    as a response. Tan accordingly refused to sign the letters of resignation as he
                    felt that the dispute between Lim and Neo had nothing to do with
                        him.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> Neo then wrote to him in a letter
                    dated 7 December 2006<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span>
                    removing him as a director of CHH and CHKC in accordance with art 82(g) of both
                    companies’ Articles of Association which read:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">82.    The office of
                            director shall become vacant if the director–</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">...</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(g)    be requested in writing by all his
                                Co-Directors to resign.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Subsequently in late December 2006, Tan
                    received notices of three extraordinary general meetings (“EGMs”)
                    scheduled on 26 January 2007 at 9am, 10am and 11am to remove him as a
                    director of CH Timber, COS and CCPL. No reason was given for these proposals.
                    When he showed up at CHH’s registered office (the venue for all three
                    EGMs) on the scheduled date to demand an explanation for the proposals to remove
                    him as a director, he was told that there was no need to attend the meetings and
                    was asked to leave. Later that day, he received a telephone call from a
                    representative of ELS informing him that he was not entitled to attend the EGMs
                    as Neo was CHH’s sole corporate representative in CH Timber, COS and
                        CCPL.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Neo’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Neo’s case is that shortly after Lim had
                    commenced Suit 779 against CHKC in November 2006, he had asked Tan to sign
                    CHKC’s audited accounts for 2006 (“the 2006 audited
                    accounts”). Tan refused, saying that he had to check with Lim first.
                    Because of this, Neo realised that Tan was on Lim’s side and could not be
                    trusted to act in the interests of CHKC. Neo thus asked Tan to resign as a
                    director of CHH and CHKC. When Tan refused, Neo decided to remove him anyway by
                    his letter of 7 December 2006.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> Neo has not
                    given any independent reason for later removing Tan as a director of CH Timber,
                    COS and CCPL.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">My findings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The main dispute between the parties here is
                    whether Tan had refused to sign the 2006 audited accounts. Tan vigorously denies
                    this allegation, and in fact wrote to ELS<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> and Neo<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> after his removal from CHH and
                    CHKC making his position known. Tan’s letters to ELS and Neo were dated 12
                    and 19 December 2006 respectively. I found these letters persuasive because
                    they were written by Tan only a few days after he was ousted from CHH and CHKC.
                    In contrast, there were no documents alleging that Tan had refused to sign the
                    2006 audited accounts, or had otherwise acted against the interests of CHKC,
                    prior to Neo’s letter of 7 December 2006 removing him as a
                    director.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     More importantly, I find that Neo was lying in
                    his AEIC. Neo stated that he had asked Tan to sign the 2006 audited accounts
                    after Lim had commenced Suit 779 against CHKC. After Tan refused, Neo asked him
                    to resign as a director of CHH and CHKC. However, Lim only filed his writ of
                    summons in Suit 779 on 21 November 2006. The fax from ELS to Tan enclosing
                    the letters of resignation was dated 14 November 2006. Therefore, it was
                    clear that Neo had already intended to remove Tan as a director even before Suit
                    779 was commenced.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     In fact, Neo even admitted during
                    cross-examination that he would normally sign CHKC’s accounts before Tan
                    did, but Neo himself had refused to sign the 2006 audited accounts because Lim
                    had told him they were all false.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> How
                    then, could he expect Tan to sign them? Neo amazingly claimed at trial that he
                    had asked Tan to sign the 2006 audited accounts first “to see if he had
                    the guts to sign them.” I did not believe this and find this to be yet
                    another one of Neo’s lies. On the evidence available, I find that when Tan
                    was removed as a director of CHH and CHKC, he had not done anything to suggest
                    that he was acting against the interests of both companies. Neo simply wanted
                    him out because Neo believed he was aligned with Lim. Whether that suspicion was
                    subsequently justified did not change the fact that there was no good reason for
                    removing Tan at the time. Moreover I find that Tan received his Director’s
                    remuneration in consideration of inter alia, his personal liabilities under the
                    numerous counter-indemnities that he signed. So long as any of these
                    counter-indemnities remained alive, he would have been entitled to his
                    Director’s remuneration. It naturally follows that there was also, to a
                    lesser extent, no good reason for subsequently ousting Tan as a director of CH
                    Timber, COS and CCPL although there was no evidence of Tan signing similar
                    counter-indemnities in the respect of these companies.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Depriving Tan of access to CHH’s subsidiaries’
                accounts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     It is not disputed that Tan, through his
                    solicitors, had requested to see the accounts of CH Timber, COS and CCPL in
                    January 2007, shortly before the EGMs to remove him as a director from those
                    three companies were held. Tan’s request was denied. Neo’s and
                    CHH’s position is simply that Tan was not entitled to inspect the
                        accounts.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Tan also alleged in his AEIC that in May and
                    September 2009, he attended two of CHH’s annual general meetings
                    (“AGMs”) convened to adopt CHH’s accounts for 2006 and 2007
                    respectively. Tan had objected to approving these accounts (which were stated to
                    be compiled without audit or review) because of several concerns he had with
                    them, but was outvoted. CHH apparently took the position that Tan’s
                    concerns mostly pertained to its subsidiary, CHKC. However, Tan was never given
                    a copy of CHKC’s audited accounts, either before or after the
                        AGMs.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> When his solicitors wrote to
                    CHH’s solicitors to request for a copy of CHKC’s audited accounts,

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Although Tan has only pleaded that he was

                    seriously dispute that Tan was also deprived of access to CHKC’s audited
                    accounts. Their position that Tan was not entitled to the accounts of
                    CHH’s subsidiaries has clearly been stated in their pleadings and their
                    solicitors’ correspondence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Diluting Tan’s shareholding in CHH from 33.3% to

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Tan clearly has no case on his allegation of
                    share dilution. He signed all the necessary documents dealing with the

                    In fact, his AEIC does not even cover this issue. Neo had also stated in his
                    AEIC that Tan had never complained about the share swap in CHH or the allotment
                    of shares to Neo.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> He was not cross-examined on this point at

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Misappropriation by Neo of commissions which CHKC’s foreign
                workers were supposed to pay to it</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Tan’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     As I mentioned in <em>Lim Leong
                        Huat</em> and at <a href="#p1_25">[25]</a> above, CHKC
                    employed many foreign construction workers for its operations and it was
                    customary for these workers to pay a yearly commission of $2,000–$3,000 to
                    their employers to defray expenses connected to their hiring and employment.
                    According to Neo’s evidence, approximately 95% of CHKC’s foreign
                    workers were from China.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> Tan’s case is that Neo had
                    pocketed the commissions which these Chinese workers were supposed to pay to
                    CHKC. While Tan himself has no personal knowledge of what he alleges, he has
                    relied on the evidence of one Zhang Guilin (“Zhang”), who was
                    formerly part of CHKC’s China Team. Tan has also relied on the forensic
                    evidence of his expert witness, Mr Aw Eng Hai (“Mr Aw”),
                    who is a certified public accountant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Zhang had appeared as a witness in Suit 779.
                    He was formerly the number two man in CHKC’s China Team and was
                    responsible for managing and running all aspects of employment for CHKC’s
                    Chinese foreign workers. Zhang testified in Suit 779 and in this trial that
                    CHKC’s Chinese workers each made a yearly payment of about $2,000 as
                    commissions. These commissions were collected by Zhang to pay to
                        CHKC.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> Mr Aw also testified in his
                    expert report that CHKC’s documents do not show that these commissions
                    were received by it.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> Tan alleges that the commissions must
                    therefore have been misappropriated by Neo.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Mr Aw has also provided an estimate of
                    the value of the commissions Neo allegedly took. By calculating the average
                    number of foreign workers hired by CHKC from its financial years 1999 to 2008
                    and multiplying it by $2,000–$3,000, the total value of commissions
                    allegedly misappropriated is between $13,420,833 (using the figure of $2,000)
                    and $20,131,250 (using the figure of $3,000).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span> The
                    figures arrived at by Mr Aw are not rounded sums because he was only given
                    a part of the data for financial years 1999 and 2008 and had pro-rated the
                    commissions accordingly.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Neo’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Neo’s case is one of plain denial. He
                    states that he was unaware of any practice in CHKC where commissions were paid,
                    and reiterated his position that CHKC’s employees were all under
                    Lim’s control.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span> Neo also relied on the
                    evidence of his own accounting expert, Mr Bob Yap Cheng Ghee
                    (“Mr Yap”), to rebut the findings in Mr Aw’s
                    expert report. In his report,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span> Mr Yap states that it was unclear whether
                    all of CHKC’s foreign workers paid a yearly commission to CHKC or just the
                    China workers. The report also notes that Mr Aw’s estimate of $13.4m
                    to $20.1m taken in commissions was merely the result of a mathematical exercise
                    and might not be supported by the documents themselves.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">My findings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Both Mr Aw and Mr Yap were unable to
                    trace from CHKC’s documents whether the foreign worker commissions were
                    paid or misappropriated. What is only known is that there were no records of
                    CHKC having received such commissions. Nevertheless, I accept Zhang’s
                    evidence that commissions were paid by the Chinese workers and that he had
                    collected some of these monies to pay to CHKC. Zhang’s story is
                    corroborated by an admission given by Aileen in cross-examination. Aileen had
                    been asked about an incident where the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore
                    (“IRAS”) had raided Zhang’s office and found over $100,000
                    in a safe, which they directed be paid to CHKC. Aileen admitted that Neo had
                    given her the money to bank into CHKC’s account and, more crucially, that
                    Neo had informed her that the monies were commissions collected from the Chinese
                    workers by Zhang.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Although Zhang admitted in cross-examination
                    that he had not passed the commissions to CHKC directly (he instead handed the
                    monies to one Su Ji, who was in charge of the China Team’s
                        accounts),<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span> I have no hesitation in
                    concluding that the monies eventually found their way into Neo’s hands. As
                    I mentioned above at <a href="#p1_25">[25]</a>, I found in Suit
                    779 that it was Neo, not Lim, who worked closely with the China Team and who
                    kept tight control over CHKC’s China workers. Neo did not introduce any
                    new evidence in this suit to convince me otherwise; he simply stuck to his usual
                    mantra that Lim was in charge of everything. On the evidence given by Zhang and
                    Aileen above, I find that Neo must have known of the existence of the foreign
                    worker commissions. His attempt to deny such knowledge in his AEIC suggests to
                    me that he was trying to hide something, which most likely is the fact that he
                    had kept such commissions for himself.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Neo in fact tried to change his evidence
                    during the trial. He claimed in cross-examination that the China workers
                    actually paid a $2,000 “administrative fee” to CHKC in return for
                    them being paid an increased salary.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span> I did not believe him. Neo had denied
                    outright in his AEIC that any commissions were paid at all without even
                    clarifying that these so-called administrative fees were collected. His belated
                    story in fact contradicted his own pleadings which stated that the only sum
                    deducted from the foreign workers’ wages was a monthly sum of $75 which
                    was meant to cover the costs of their meals, and that they did not make any
                    yearly payment of $2,000–$3,000 at all.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span> Even if I accept his story
                    that the alleged commissions were, in fact administrative fees to offset the
                    foreign workers’ higher salaries, the fact remains that nowhere in the
                    accounts of CHKC was it recorded that such payments of $2,000 per worker were
                    being made. When this was pointed out to Neo in cross-examination, he incredibly
                    changed his evidence yet again and said that CHKC did not collect these
                        monies.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     Having heard the evidence, I see no reason to
                    depart from my earlier findings in Suit 779 that CHKC’s China workers had
                    paid yearly commissions to it and that these commissions were all pocketed by
                    Neo. Although it is not known for sure exactly how much was taken (since Neo had
                    cleverly kept no records of such matters), I accept that Mr Aw’s
                    method of multiplying the average number of foreign workers by the amount of the
                    commission (which I find to be $2,000) is the most reliable method for arriving
                    at a total figure. However, it must also be noted that Zhang only gave evidence
                    of commissions paid by CHKC’s China workers, not all its foreign workers.
                    Since Neo had earlier testified that CHKC’s China workers made up about
                    95% of its foreign workforce, I multiplied the figure of $13,420,833 given by
                    Mr Aw in his expert report by 95% to arrive at a figure of $12,749,791.35.
                    I therefore find that Neo had, from 1999 to 2008, misappropriated around $12.75m
                    from CHKC in commissions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Artificially inflating the amounts which Neo and Mrs Neo charged
                CHKC for the purchase of groceries</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Tan’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     CHKC provided meals for its construction
                    workers. From 1999 to 2006, Mrs Neo purchased groceries on behalf of CHKC
                    which were then delivered to its various construction sites for the preparation
                    of meals. CHKC would then reimburse either Neo or Mrs Neo. From February
                    2006 onwards, CHKC purchased groceries directly from the suppliers. Tan’s
                    case is that from 1999 to February 2006, Neo and Mrs Neo charged CHKC
                    $4.50–$5.50 per worker per day in respect of the groceries purchased, and
                    that this price was inflated.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span> As
                    Tan has no first-hand knowledge of this allegation, he has relied solely on the
                    expert evidence of Mr Aw to prove his case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     Mr Aw, in his expert report, relies on
                    two methods to show that the amounts claimed by Neo and Mrs Neo were
                    inflated. The first method simply involves comparing the value of grocery
                    invoices for the period from June 2001 to February 2006 against the
                    corresponding amounts claimed by Neo and Mrs Neo (Mr Aw was not
                    provided any grocery invoices from 1999 to May 2001).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span> Mr Aw’s comparison
                    shows that on average, 64% of the total reimbursement claimed from June 2001 to
                    February 2006 was not supported by invoices and therefore presumed to be
                    inflated. Mr Aw then multiplied this 64% with the total reimbursement
                    claimed from 1999 to February 2006 and estimated that Neo and Mrs Neo had
                    inflated their total grocery claims by about $7,465,700.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Mr Aw’s second method involves
                    calculating the average monthly cost of meals per worker, based on CHKC’s
                    expenses incurred after February 2006 (when it started purchasing directly from
                    the suppliers).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span> Based on CHKC’s
                    accounts, Mr Aw estimated the average monthly cost of meals per worker as
                    $48. Thus, if Neo and Mrs Neo previously charged $4.50 per worker per day
                    (which amounted to $135 per worker per month), they had inflated their expenses
                    by $87 per worker per month. Multiplying this figure of $87 with the total
                    number of CHKC’s foreign workers from 1999 to 2006, Mr Aw estimated
                    that Neo and Mrs Neo had inflated their total grocery claims by
                    $5,584,356.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     Tan also alleges that Neo and Mrs Neo
                    might actually have inflated their groceries claims by 100% because they have
                    not produced any evidence of their personal accounts to show that they actually
                    paid for the groceries.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Neo’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     Neo does not dispute that he charged CHKC
                    $4.50 per worker per day for groceries expenses. His position is that this was a
                    reasonable sum and in fact, it was the arrangement between him and CHKC to claim
                    reimbursements on a “per head” basis instead of invoices because
                    invoices were not always collected from the groceries suppliers. Mrs Neo,
                    who gave evidence for Neo, testified in cross-examination that she did not
                    always ask for invoices when purchasing groceries because some of the suppliers
                    which were registered for Goods and Services Tax (“GST”) told her
                    that she would not be required to pay GST if she did not ask for an
                        invoice.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Neo next argues that if the figures used by
                    Mr Aw were adopted, it would mean that the average daily cost of all three
                    meals for a foreign worker was around $1.56–$1.57, which was an
                    unreasonably low figure. This is echoed by his expert, Mr Yap.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_52" id="Ftn_52_1"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span> Mr Yap added that the figures used by
                    Mr Aw in computing CHKC’s groceries expenses after February 2006 did
                    not take into account associated expenses like transport costs and
                GST.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Mrs Neo’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     Mrs Neo’s separate defence was that
                    she was involved only in the purchase of groceries. She would pay for these
                    groceries by cash or cheque (both drawn on her joint bank account with Neo). She
                    would then hand over any invoices she received from the suppliers to Neo, who
                    would make the necessary claims for reimbursements. She also states that she was
                    not paid anything by Neo or CHKC for her assistance.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_53" id="Ftn_53_1"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span> She further testified in
                    cross-examination that she left the reimbursement process entirely to Neo and
                    denied receiving any reimbursement monies.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_54" id="Ftn_54_1"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">My findings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     On the evidence available, I find that Neo had
                    been knowingly submitting inflated claims to CHKC for groceries expenses. The
                    most striking factor leading to this finding was the fact that both methods of
                    calculation employed by Mr Aw yielded very similar results. Based on his
                    first method, Mr Aw arrived at an inflation percentage of 64%, which when
                    subtracted from $4.50 (which was the figure used by Neo) meant that the average
                    daily cost of feeding one worker was $1.62. Based on his second method, which
                    involved calculating CHKC’s expenses after it started buying directly from
                    the suppliers, the average daily cost of feeding one worker was
                $1.56.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     The proximity of these figures is quite
                    telling because it implies that the cost of feeding workers after CHKC started
                    buying direct from the suppliers was more or less the same as Neo’s claims
                    which were supported by invoices. This suggests that the portion of the claims
                    not supported by invoices must have been inflated. Neo has not given any
                    compelling explanation why CHKC’s expenses on groceries should be so
                    radically different after it started buying from the suppliers in February 2006.
                    Although I agree that rather low sums were spent on feeding the workers, there
                    was no other empirical evidence placed before me to show that it was impossible
                    to feed a foreign worker on $1.56–$1.62 per day, even when buying
                    groceries in bulk. I do note, however, that Lim had testified in Suit 779 that
                    CHKC’s workers had complained about the quality of the food whenever he
                    visited the construction sites.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_55" id="Ftn_55_1"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     I disbelieved Mrs Neo’s evidence
                    that she did not ask for groceries invoices in order to avoid paying GST. Her
                    evidence completely went against Neo’s and Aileen’s testimony that
                    the invoices were used for claiming GST input credits instead of substantiating
                    Neo’s reimbursement claims.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_56" id="Ftn_56_1"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span> I also note that Neo has not given any
                    evidence of his own to justify his position that it was reasonable to charge
                    $4.50 per worker per day. No explanation was given at trial or in his AEIC as to
                    how this figure was arrived at and why it was more appropriate to claim on a per
                    head basis rather than on invoices. Even his expert witness, Mr Yap, did
                    not provide any independent calculations to justify the figure of $4.50. His
                    instructions were merely to comment on the figures in Mr Aw’s report
                    and not provide calculations on his own. My conclusion was that Neo had simply
                    arrived at an arbitrary figure of $4.50 when he knew that the amounts spent on
                    groceries were much less.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     I also find that Mrs Neo, on her part,
                    was fully aware that Neo had been submitting inflated claims to CHKC and had
                    knowingly assisted him in such a scheme. First of all, CHKC’s manual cash
                    book, which was an important piece of evidence used in Suit 779, showed many
                    entries where reimbursements in cash were recorded as being made to Mrs Neo
                    over a period from 2001 to 2004. The sums involved were not insignificant and
                    averaged around $100,000 each time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     Secondly, Mrs Neo’s answers and
                    demeanour in cross-examination strongly indicated not only that she had always
                    been aware of Neo’s inflation of grocery claims she was, in addition, a
                    more than willing accomplice. She admitted that she knew Neo had been charging
                    CHKC for groceries on a per head basis instead of on invoices, despite the fact
                    that the suppliers she purchased groceries from all provided
                        invoices.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_57" id="Ftn_57_1"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span> As I mentioned above at
                        <a href="#p1_71">[71]</a>, I disbelieved her evidence that
                    she did not request for invoices to avoid paying GST. In my view, this was
                    simply an excuse concocted to support Neo’s case that the computation of
                    groceries claims on a per head basis was fully justified. When Tan’s
                    counsel pointed out to Mrs Neo that her reasons for not requesting invoices
                    completely went against Neo’s own case, she dramatically proclaimed that
                    she was only interested in the welfare of CHKC’s workers at the time and
                    had tried to avoid paying GST in order to buy more food for the
                        workers:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_58" id="Ftn_58_1"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span></p>

                            them sufficiently, ensuring that they can work for the company. This is
                            my contribution to Mr Neo and our company. As long as our workers
                            are fed well, my projects could be completed on time and on schedule. I
                            would have fulfilled my role, and facts have proven that my workers are
                            the best and they were able to finish the projects on
                        time.</span></p>

                            further contradicted Mr Neo’s case. You have just told us
                            that GST is a small matter to you, but do you not see that, as far as
                            Mr Neo is concerned, by his evidence, invoices would be collected
                            if and only if, they could be used to claim GST from the
                            government?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">I’m not interested in Mr Neo’s

                            concerned about anything else and I don’t wish to know about
                            anything else... Even though we have a budget and five meals are to be
                            provided, sometimes if we did their work well, we would even give them
                            supper, and many a times, whatever I bought is actually in excess of the
                            $4.50 to $5 per worker, but it doesn’t matter. As long as they
                            work well and we could finish our projects on time, I am willing to come

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     The above passage was quite representative of
                    Mrs Neo’s general performance in cross-examination. She would give
                    long-winded and irrelevant answers in response to simple questions from both
                    counsel and the court. Her demeanour was also very theatrical and left me with
                    the clear impression that she was not being honest in her evidence. Indeed, she
                    seemed to be simply acting out a rehearsed script to support Neo’s case.
                    This can be seen in many of her responses to counsel’s questions, an
                    example of which is set out as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_59" id="Ftn_59_1"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Did you know that Mr Neo did not use those

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">I’m not aware of that.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Are you saying that, as far as you are concerned,

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Okay, to me, I’ll take instructions from the

                            feel of the prices of vegetables per kilogram. And as for the invoices
                            for the meet and other dried foodstuff and grains, they would also know
                            the prices of these things on a per kilo basis. Actually, I bought
                            whatever – I bought things according to the instructions given by
                            the kitchen.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">I’m sure of that, Mrs Neo.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">Another example of Mrs Neo’s rehearsed evidence in
                    response to questions from the court is set out below:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_60" id="Ftn_60_1"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a></span></p>

                            man says we need so many kilos of this vegetable, so many kilos of that
                            vegetable, how does he tell you this? Does he telephone

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">I would actually bring him down to the market and

                            shown the invoices as to the prices of these vegetables. Our China team
                            is very capable. They would have a table set out and, based on the
                            number of workers, we would know how many kilograms of meat, of
                            vegetables and grains to be given per worker. They would have worked out
                            a formula. And then for staples such as flour, because they bake buns,
                            we usually don’t give them a fixed quantity. They could take as
                            much as they can, and sometimes they would just call and we would send
                            50 sacks of flour down immediately.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">COURT:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Mrs Neo, we’ll be here until Chinese
                            New Year if you don’t listen to my question. What was the question
                            I asked you, can you remember?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">The quantity.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     I find, on the whole, that Mrs Neo knew
                    there was no justification for charging CHKC $4.50 per worker per day for
                    groceries.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     I did accept, however, that Neo and
                    Mrs Neo at least paid the sums reflected in CHKC’s groceries
                    invoices. Although Tan submitted that the groceries were not even paid for by
                    them, there was no record of any other person paying for groceries, or claiming
                    reimbursement thereof. The question then is how much were the grocery claims
                    inflated by. In this regard, I accept Mr Aw’s figure of 64% as the
                    inflation percentage. Using the figures provided in his expert
                        report,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_61" id="Ftn_61_1"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span> I find
                    that Neo had claimed a total of $11,665,157 from 1999 to 2006. From this, I
                    subtracted $1,772,207 and $1,174,335 because CHKC’s accounts showed that
                    these sums were actually not paid out. I was thus left with a balance of
                    $8,718,615.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     Although CHKC was the one which paid for
                    Neo’s claims, some of the groceries Mrs Neo purchased were actually
                    meant for two related companies, CCPL and AZ. As I mentioned above at <a href="#p1_21">[21]</a>, AZ is a company owned by Lim and is not part
                    of the Chip Hup Group. It used to work closely with CHKC when Lim was still the
                    latter’s general manager and also employed foreign workers. CHKC would
                    reimburse Neo for groceries bought on behalf of CCPL and AZ and would in turn
                    claim reimbursement from those two companies. The figures show that CHKC charged
                    CCPL and AZ a total of $1,100,571 and $2,915,255 respectively as reimbursement
                    from 1999 to 2006. Although the amounts paid by CCPL for groceries could also
                    have been taken into account for the purposes of the present action (since
                    Tan’s complaint is that he has been oppressed as a member of CHH), Tan has
                    only chosen to plead that the amounts CHKC paid for groceries were inflated.
                    Thus, I subtracted $1,100,571 and $2,915,255 from the sum of $8,718,615 to
                    arrive at a balance of $4,702,789. Multiplying this figure with the inflation
                    percentage of 64% gave me a final figure of $3,009,784.96. I thus find that Neo
                    had inflated his groceries reimbursement claims by $3.01m to CHKC’s
                    detriment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Misappropriation of funds from CHKC in the guise of reimbursements
                due to Neo for paying the salaries of non-existent workers</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     This particular complaint of Tan’s deals
                    with the Salary Accruals issue mentioned at <a href="#p1_23">[23]</a>–<a href="#p1_24">[24]</a> above.
                    Tan’s case is basically what Lim alleged in Suit 779; that Neo had
                    unlawfully siphoned off money from CHKC through the Salary Accruals accounts by
                    pretending to pay the non-CPF salaries of its Proxies. Tan has no first-hand
                    knowledge of this matter and his expert witness, Mr Aw, was only able to
                    show that monies from Salary Accruals were credited into Neo’s running
                    account with CHKC and drawn out. Tan is thus relying primarily on the evidence
                    used in Suit 779 to show that Neo was the mastermind who came up with the Salary
                    Accruals system and used it to siphon profits out of CHKC to CHH’s (and
                    therefore Tan’s) detriment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     Neo, for his part, has not introduced any
                    significant new evidence here beyond his evidence in Suit 779. His position,
                    unsurprisingly, is that Lim had created the Salary Accruals in CHKC as Lim was
                    in charge of everything including the accounts staff. As such, my findings on
                    the Salary Accruals would largely be dependent on the evidence adduced in Suit
                    779. However, one important point must be dealt with first. Neo admitted in Suit
                    779 that he had withdrawn more than $10m in Salary Accruals from 1997 to 2003.
                    However, he claimed in this trial that he “realised”, after the
                    trial of Suit 779 and after engaging professional accountants, that he did not
                    take the $10m at all.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_62" id="Ftn_62_1"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     The Salary Accruals matter was in fact a major
                    issue in Suit 779 and both Lim and Neo adduced extensive evidence on it. Since
                    the parties here have also relied on that evidence to a large extent, I have no
                    hesitation repeating my findings in Suit 779 that both Lim and Neo were
                    responsible for creating the Salary Accruals accounts and that Neo had knowingly
                    drawn monies from these accounts for his own benefit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     Neo called Aileen and Juliet as witnesses in
                    this trial to give evidence that Lim, not Neo, was the one in charge of
                    CHKC’s accounts and therefore, Lim must have been the person responsible
                    for the Salary Accruals. However, just like Neo, they both displayed the same
                    lack of credibility as they did in Suit 779. Juliet was able to answer very
                    little questions in her examination-in-chief and cross-examination. Most of the
                    time, she would either reply that she was not sure or that she could not
                    remember. She did admit, however, both in Suit 779 and in this trial that she
                    had given false evidence for Neo in previous proceedings, including a criminal
                        prosecution.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_63" id="Ftn_63_1"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span> Yet, when counsel asked why
                    she had chosen to give false evidence, she kept saying that she did not know. I
                    find that Juliet had given false evidence for Neo in previous proceedings and in
                    this suit because she was afraid of being sued by him or CHKC. Neo on behalf of
                    CHKC had commenced proceedings against several of CHKC’s former employees
                    such as Yeow Chern Lean, Jean Khoo and Lim Lian Choon (who was Lim’s
                    brother) after Lim had launched Suit 779 against Neo and CHKC. It was out of
                    this fear of being included as a target that Juliet felt pressured to ally
                    herself with Neo and lie on his behalf.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     Aileen was an even less credible witness than
                    Juliet. While Juliet remained mostly non-committal during cross-examination,
                    Aileen was openly hostile and evasive. Like her boss Neo, she would continue to
                    stubbornly cling to her position even when the objective evidence was
                    overwhelmingly against her. One example relates to Neo’s story that Tan
                    had refused to sign the 2006 audited accounts. Aileen first testified in
                    cross-examination that Neo had asked Tan to sign the accounts and Tan refused.
                    She later admitted that the accounts were inaccurate at the time Tan was
                    required to sign them. Despite this admission, she insisted that the accounts
                    were nevertheless ready to be signed by Tan. It took many questions before
                    Tan’s counsel could finally get her to concede that Tan was right in not
                    signing the accounts since they were inaccurate:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_64" id="Ftn_64_1"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     It was perhaps unsurprising that Aileen was so
                    loyal to Neo to the extent that she would fearlessly lie on his behalf, both in
                    this trial and in related proceedings. As I found in Suit 779 (see <em>Lim Leong Huat</em> at [176]), Aileen had been dipping her
                    hands into CHKC’s till by paying herself an additional salary every month
                    when she was administering its accounts. She had also put her sister’s
                    name on CHKC’s payroll as a Proxy and arranged to pay her sister an actual
                    salary (<em>ie</em>, non-CPF component), of $750 per month.
                    Much like Juliet, I find that Aileen had very good reasons for giving false
                    evidence for Neo in his various lawsuits because she could be sued by him.
                    Rather than face that very real threat, she chose to throw in her lot to Neo.
                    Furthermore, while it is unclear whether there was any basis for Neo or CHKC to
                    sue Juliet (there being no evidence before me on this point), it was clear that
                    Aileen was in real danger of being sued since she had been misappropriating
                    monies from CHKC. When Tan’s counsel pressed Aileen on this point in
                    cross-examination, she admitted that she had been paying herself an extra salary
                    each month but added, quite incredibly and disingenuously, that this was done on
                    Lim’s instructions.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_65" id="Ftn_65_1"><sup>[note: 65]</sup></a></span> I did
                    not believe this at all. Like her boss Neo, I find that Aileen was simply trying
                    to push the blame to Lim as a desperate attempt to cover up her
                misdeeds.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     The question that remains is how much Neo drew
                    out of CHKC in Salary Accruals. CHKC’s independent auditors’ report
                    for the financial year 2006 stated that the sum of $10,574,632 in respect of
                    “wages” was erroneously credited to a director’s account in
                    previous years.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_66" id="Ftn_66_1"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span> Since Tan did not have an account with
                    CHKC, the only person whom the auditors’ report could have referred to was
                    Neo. Furthermore, Mr Aw’s report (which was corroborated by the
                    evidence in Suit 779) stated that Neo only drew out Salary Accruals from 1997 to
                    May 2003,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_67" id="Ftn_67_1"><sup>[note: 67]</sup></a></span> and that by 31 May 2003, Neo’s
                    account with CHKC showed a nil balance.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_68" id="Ftn_68_1"><sup>[note: 68]</sup></a></span> The
                    logical conclusion is that Neo had drawn a total of $10,574,632 in Salary
                    Accruals from CHKC by 2003. Although Neo submits that his account with CHKC has
                    since been rectified, the fact that he had previously siphoned money from CHKC
                    through the Salary Accruals accounts would still be a relevant factor in
                    determining whether Tan has been oppressed as a shareholder of
                CHH.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Artificially increasing the share capital of CHKC</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     Tan’s case is that in 2001 and 2002, Neo
                    procured CHKC to issue 1.6 million and 2 million new shares respectively to CHH,
                    and that these share issuances were partly funded by setting off monies owed to
                    Neo under the Salary Accruals accounts. Since the Salary Accruals were false,
                    Neo had therefore artificially increased CHKC’s share capital. Neo admits
                    that the Salary Accruals were used to partly fund the issuance of shares to
                        CHH,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_69" id="Ftn_69_1"><sup>[note: 69]</sup></a></span> but claimed that
                    he was unaware of this fact at the time because he had left the arrangements for
                    the share capital increase to Lim and did not know how the additional shares
                    were paid for. I did not believe him. Following from my finding that Neo
                    (together with Lim) had created the Salary Accruals accounts for his own
                    benefit, he must have been aware of how the Salary Accruals were utilised. It is
                    not necessary for me to make an exact finding on how much Salary Accruals were
                    used to artificially capitalise CHKC as these sums are part of the total of
                    $10.57m drawn out by Neo in Salary Accruals and have therefore already been
                    accounted for.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Misuse of CHKC’s funds for Neo’s own purposes</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Tan’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     Tan’s case is that Neo had treated CHKC
                    as a vehicle for his own personal dealings by procuring it to make payments to
                    various third parties without any legitimate basis. For example:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_86-p2_a"></a>(a)     Neo got CHKC to pay the sums of
                        $638,856.50 and $607,299 to a China-based company called Beijing Residential
                        Development &amp; Construction Group Co (“BRDC”) in December
                        1998 and November 1999 respectively but has failed to show any legitimate
                        reason or such payments.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_86-p2_b"></a>(b)     Neo got CHKC to make monthly payments of $600 to his
                        brother, Neo Kok Khuan, from June 1999 to September 2003 purportedly as
                        salary. However, Neo Kok Khuan did not perform any work for CHKC during this
                        period. Similarly, Neo got CHKC to pay a monthly salary to Zhang Wen Xin, a
                        member of its China Team, from January 2004 to November 2007. Zhang Wen Xin
                        was actually working in Dubai during this period and did not perform any
                        work for CHKC.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_86-p2_c"></a>(c)     Neo got CHKC to make dubious loans totalling $194,312.38 to Wu Xue Feng,
                        who was the head of the China Team. The loans have not been
                    repaid.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Neo’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     Neo’s case is that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_87-p2_a"></a>(a)     The payments of $638,856.50 and
                        $607,299 were made to BRDC pursuant to an agreement between CHKC and BRDC
                        for the supply of China workers. The said sums were actually administrative
                        charges for eight construction projects that CHKC had sub-contracted to BRDC
                        as provided for under the agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_87-p2_b"></a>(b)     Neo Kok Khuan was paid a monthly salary for helping out
                        at CHKC’s store at Jalan Besut. As for Zhang Wen Xin, he was posted to
                        Dubai to work on a project for BRDC, and the arrangement was that BRDC would
                        reimburse CHKC for any costs incurred, including the monthly salary paid by
                        CHKC.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_87-p2_c"></a>(c)     Neo
                        admitted in cross-examination that the loans made to Wu Xue Feng were for
                        his personal expenses and had nothing to do with CHKC’s business. He
                        also admitted that there were no loan documents and that CHKC had yet to
                        take any steps to recover the loans.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_70" id="Ftn_70_1"><sup>[note: 70]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">My findings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     I found the evidence on the payments from CHKC
                    to BRDC quite equivocal because there was no direct evidence to show that Neo
                    intended CHKC to benefit BRDC without any genuine commercial motive. Instead,
                    Tan has resorted to poking holes in Neo’s explanation that the payments
                    were administrative charges for certain projects. I did not think that this was
                    sufficient to prove Tan’s case because BRDC and CHKC already had an
                    established commercial relationship then. BRDC was the company which supplied
                    CHKC with China workers and the managers in CHKC’s China Team were in fact
                    seconded from BRDC. Thus, I could not find on a balance of probabilities that
                    the payments to BRDC were made for Neo’s own personal purposes. Similarly,
                    the evidence of the monthly payments of $600 to Neo Kok Khuan was too scant to
                    prove that they were personal gifts instead of salaries.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     However, I was satisfied that the payments to
                    Zhang Wen Xin and Wu Xue Feng were not made for any legitimate commercial
                    interest. Zhang Wen Xin was paid from January 2004 to November 2007 but even by
                    the time of the trial, Neo admitted that CHKC had yet to chase for repayment on
                    the pretext that he had no time.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_71" id="Ftn_71_1"><sup>[note: 71]</sup></a></span> I did
                    not believe him. Mr Aw had calculated that the total salary paid to Zhang
                    Wen Xin was $244,000<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_72" id="Ftn_72_1"><sup>[note: 72]</sup></a></span> and this figure was not disputed by Neo
                    in cross-examination. This was not a small sum and I did not accept that a
                    businessman as shrewd as Neo would not have sought repayment of this sum for so
                    long simply because there was no time. The more likely explanation was that Neo
                    had intended for CHKC to make under the table payments to Zhang Wen Xin. This
                    was similarly the case for Wu Xue Feng as Neo himself had admitted above at
                    [87(c)].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     My findings on this matter are corroborated by
                    the evidence in Suit 779. I noted in that case (see <em>Lim Leong
                        Huat</em> at [110(a)]) that CHKC’s manual cashbook showed a lot
                    of unexplained cash payments from it to Su Ji, who was in charge of finance in
                    CHKC’s China Team. I find that the reason why Neo got CHKC to make all
                    these payments to these members of the China Team is because they were helping
                    him to skim money off the China workers through the collection of commissions.
                    It was thus clear that the payments made to them by CHKC had no legitimate
                    business purpose. On the whole, I find that Neo had been misusing CHKC’s
                    funds for his own purposes.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Failure to maintain proper accounts and records of CHH and
                CHKC</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     I have no trouble finding that Neo had, to put
                    it lightly, failed to maintain proper accounts and records of CHH and CHKC. The
                    evidence both in this suit and in Suit 779 showed conclusively that Neo had been
                    engaged in a multitude of nefarious activities in CHKC which, not least,
                    involved the wrongful manipulation of its accounts. It naturally follows that
                    the accounts of CHH, being the holding company of CHKC, would similarly be
                    distorted.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Refusing to share profits with Tan</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     Tan’s case is that he did not receive
                    any dividends from CHH from 2000 till date. This was despite the fact that the
                    accumulated after-tax profits of CHKC (which as mentioned above at <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a> was the main revenue generator in the Chip
                    Hup Group) for the financial years 2000–2005 amounted to about
                        $4.5m.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_73" id="Ftn_73_1"><sup>[note: 73]</sup></a></span> Neo accepted the figure of $4.5m
                    and also admitted that CHH did not declare dividends.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_74" id="Ftn_74_1"><sup>[note: 74]</sup></a></span> His case is that he
                    himself did not receive any dividends and thus he did not see how Tan could
                    claim that he was entitled to dividends.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_75" id="Ftn_75_1"><sup>[note: 75]</sup></a></span> In view of my above
                    findings on the commissions, groceries and Salary Accruals, it is clear that Neo
                    had been liberally helping himself to CHKC’s profits without including
                    Tan. Thus, by not getting CHH to declare dividends, Neo had totally excluded Tan
                    from any profit sharing whatsoever.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Summary of findings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     In summary, I find that Tan has proven the

<p class="Judg-1">I also find that with regard to allegation (d), Mrs Neo had
                    knowingly assisted Neo in inflating reimbursement claims for groceries. It
                    remains to consider whether Neo and Mrs Neo have any defences against
                    Tan’s complaints.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Third issue – Whether Tan is barred from complaining about any
                of the alleged oppressive acts on the grounds of limitation, laches or
                acquiescence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     Neo and Mrs Neo submit that in any event,
                    Tan cannot complain about being oppressed as a minority shareholder of CHH. They
                    have three alternative arguments. First, most of Tan’s complaints are
                    time-barred under s 6 of the Limitation Act (Cap 163,
                    1996 Rev Ed). Secondly, he is barred from complaining by the equitable
                    doctrine of laches. Lastly, Tan had acquiesced in the matters complained of and
                    is estopped from raising them now.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Applicability of the Limitation Act</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     Section 6 of the Limitation Act is not
                    applicable to the present case. Tan’s cause of action is based on the
                    right of a member of a company to apply to court for relief under s 216 of
                    the Companies Act. This action is statutory in nature and not founded on a
                    contract, or on tort, or on any other limb under s 6 of the Limitation Act
                    in particular. Moreover, a plain reading of s 216(1)(a) of the Companies
                    Act shows that a course of conduct taken over a period of time could amount to
                    oppression. The Court of Appeal recently noted in <em>Over &amp;
                        Over Ltd v Bonvests Holdings Ltd</em> [2010] 2 SLR 776
                        (“<em>Over &amp; Over</em>”) at [74] that
                    the majority of cases in s 216 applications pertained to this type of
                    scenario as opposed to a single, isolated act being done. Since the court, in
                    such situations, will have to look at how the affairs of the company have been
                    conducted as a whole over the entire period (<em>In re H R Harmer
                        Ltd</em> [1959] 1 WLR 62 at 86), it would defeat the purpose
                    of s 216(1)(a) if the Limitation Act barred minority shareholders from
                    complaining about earlier acts forming part of the overall
                conduct.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Laches</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     The equitable principle of laches requires
                    that a plaintiff seeking an equitable remedy must come to court quickly once he
                    knows that his rights are being infringed. In <em>Syed Ali Redha
                        Alsagoff v Syed Salim Alhadad bin Syed Ahmad Alhadad</em> [1996]
                    2 SLR(R) 470, Warren Khoo J held at [47] that the doctrine of laches
                    was an equitable defence in answer to a claim in <em>equity</em>. In other words, it had no place where a plaintiff was
                    asserting <em>legal</em> rights against a defendant. Khoo
                    J’s judgment was fully endorsed on appeal to the Court of Appeal: see
                        <em>Scan Electronics (S) Pte Ltd v Syed Ali Redha
                        Alsagoff</em> [1997] 1 SLR(R) 970 (“<em>Scan Electronics</em>”) at [19]. However, the court
                    immediately went on to state, at [20]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Suffice it to say that the defence of laches may operate where the
                        plaintiff has “by his conduct or neglect ... put the other party in a
                        situation in which it would not be reasonable to place him, if the remedy
                        were afterwards to be asserted”... Thus, unreasonable delay or
                        negligence in pursuing a right or claim, <em>particularly an
                            equitable one</em>, may be held to disentitle the plaintiff to
                        relief.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     The Court of Appeal thus seemed to be
                    contradicting itself because the above passage implies that laches may still
                    operate to bar a legal right or claim, contrary to its earlier, unequivocal
                    endorsement of Khoo J’s decision in the court below. The decision in
                        <em>Scan Electronics</em> was considered by Andrew
                    Ang J in <em>Cytec Industries Pte Ltd v APP Chemicals
                        International (Mau) Ltd</em> [2009] 4 SLR(R) 769. The
                    learned judge interpreted the Court of Appeal’s above statement in
                        <em>Scan Electronics</em> to mean that the doctrine of
                    laches could also bar entitlement to equitable remedies in aid of a legal right
                    or claim. However, insofar as a plaintiff was seeking a legal remedy to enforce
                    a legal right, the doctrine of laches had no application. Thus, the defendant in
                    that case was unable to invoke laches to resist the plaintiff’s claim to
                    recover a debt.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     I respectfully agree with Ang J’s
                    judgment. The general principle is that laches would operate to bar the grant of
                    equitable <em>relief</em>, whether or not the underlying
                    claim originated in common law or equity. In <em>Smith v
                        Clay</em> (1767) 29 ER 743, Lord Camden LC held at
                    744:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A court of equity, which is never active in relief against conscience, or
                        public convenience, has always refused its aid to stale demands, where the
                        party has slept upon his right and acquiesced for a great length of
                        time.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Nothing can call forth this court into activity, but conscience, good
                        faith, and reasonable diligence; where these are wanting, the Court is
                        passive, and does nothing.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Laches and neglect are always discountenanced; and therefore from the
                        beginning of this jurisdiction, there was always a limitation to suits in
                        this court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     Lord Camden LC’s statement was made at a
                    time when the common law courts were separate from the courts of equity. Under
                    the common law, there was no limitation period and a plaintiff could bring a
                    claim decades after the cause of action arose. However, because common law
                    remedies were very limited, the courts of equity developed a wide and flexible
                    range of remedies to supplement the remedies awarded at common law. Unlike their
                    common law counterparts, the courts of equity acted on conscience and retained
                    the discretion to refuse relief to an undeserving claimant. The distinction
                    between common law remedies and equitable remedies is explained more fully in
                    John McGhee QC, <em>Snell’s Equity</em> (Sweet &amp;
                    Maxwell, 31st Ed, 2005) at para 12-04:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...equitable remedies are in general discretionary. At law, a claimant who
                        proved his case was entitled as of right not only to his judgment but also
                        to enforce it by the forms of execution available at law, however little his
                        conduct appealed to the court, however dilatory he had been, and however
                        unfair the result. Equity, on the other hand, exercised a discretion in
                        granting its remedies, looking to the conduct not merely of the defendant
                        but also of the claimant. Thus it would usually refuse relief to those who
                        had unclean hands, or who were not willing to do equity, or who slept on
                        their rights, or whose claim would produce unfair results. Claimants such as
                        these would be left to whatever remedy they might have at law; and if a
                        claimant had an adequate remedy at law, that of itself was a ground for
                        refusing equitable relief.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    Thus, historically, the defence of laches
                    only operated against a claimant who sought relief in a court of equity, whether
                    or not the underlying claim was legal or equitable. For example, an action for
                    breach of contract was a common law action and a successful plaintiff would
                    always be entitled to claim damages as of right at common law. However, the
                    remedy of specific performance was an equitable remedy and could be barred by
                    laches. Although the common law courts and courts of equity were subsequently
                    fused through the UK Supreme Court of Judicature Acts 1873 and 1875, the
                    historical distinction between common law remedies and equitable remedies
                    remains even today. The principle that laches is not an available defence to a
                    plaintiff who was not seeking equitable relief is well established in other
                    jurisdictions: see <em>eg Lester v Woodgate</em>
                    [2010] EWCA Civ 199; <em>Orr v Ford</em> (1989)
                    167 CLR 316; <em>Rhyolite Resources Inc v Canquest Resource
                        Corp</em> (1999) 64 BCLR (3d) 80.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    In the present case, Tan’s claim is
                    founded on s 216 of the Companies Act, which also makes available a range
                    of remedies to an aggrieved complainant. Since the remedies Tan is seeking are
                    derived from statute and not from equity, the <em>prima
                        facie</em> position is that laches, or other equitable defences for
                    that matter, do not bar his right to claim for relief under s 216. However,
                    such a view in my opinion would be too simplistic. Although a claim under
                    s 216 is statutory in nature, the principles on what constitutes oppressive
                    or unfairly prejudicial conduct are heavily influenced by considerations of
                    fairness and equity. In <em>O’Neill v Phillips</em>
                    [1999] 1 WLR 1092, Lord Hoffmann considered the principles on what
                    constituted unfair prejudice under s 459 of the UK Companies Act 1985 (c 6)
                    and held, at 1098–1099:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...company law has developed seamlessly from the law of partnership, which
                        was treated by equity, like the Roman societas, as a contract of good faith.
                            <em>One of the traditional roles of equity, as a separate
                            jurisdiction, was to restrain the exercise of strict legal rights in
                            certain relationships in which it considered that this would be contrary
                            to good faith. These principles have, with appropriate modification,
                            been carried over into company law</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...there will be cases in which equitable considerations make it unfair
                        for those conducting the affairs of the company to rely upon their strict
                        legal powers. Thus unfairness may consist in a breach of the rules or in
                        using the rules in a manner which equity would regard as contrary to good
                        faith.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    Lord Hoffmann’s speech was
                    unequivocally endorsed in two subsequent Court of Appeal cases, <em>Sim Yong Kim v Evenstar Investments Pte Ltd</em> [2006]
                    3 SLR(R) 827 and <em>Lim Swee Khiang v Borden Co (Pte)
                        Ltd</em> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 745, where it was held that
                    s 459 of the UK Companies Act 1985 corresponded materially to our
                    s 216 of the Companies Act. More recently in <em>Over &amp;
                        Over</em> (<em>supra</em>), the Court of Appeal
                    reiterated at [81] that commercial fairness was the touchstone by which the
                    court determines whether to grant relief under s 216, and that whether a
                    course of conduct may be characterised as unfair was a “multifaceted
                    inquiry”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    Since considerations of fairness and equity
                    play a crucial role in an action under s 216, a court should rightly be
                    able to take into account the conduct of all the parties in determining whether
                    there has been unfairness as a whole warranting the grant of relief under
                    s 216(2). After all, fairness is a relative concept. Furthermore, because
                    the court has a very wide discretion in granting such relief, it would only be
                    natural to consider the relative equities of both the minority and majority
                    shareholders in determining the appropriate form of relief. I find support for
                    this view in Margaret Chew, <em>Minority Shareholders’
                        Rights and Remedies</em> (LexisNexis, 2nd Ed, 2007) at pp
                    224–225:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Under section 216 of the Companies Act, the courts have to decide the
                        standards of fair play and the conditions of fair dealing as between the
                        parties, to ascertain whether one party has acted unfairly vis-à-vis the
                        other or others. Fairness is the enclave of equity and it could be said that
                        section 216 imports equity into determining the limits of its application.
                        The courts are empowered by statute to exercise an equitable jurisdiction.
                        As such, the principles of equity are relevant...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...It is submitted that the courts have a wide remedial or curial
                        discretion under section 216 of the Companies Act and may customise remedies
                        to suit the equities of the case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    This view is also echoed in Robin Hollington
                    QC, <em>Shareholders’ Rights</em> (Sweet &amp;
                    Maxwell, 5th Ed, 2007) at para 7-123 where the learned author discusses the
                    application of the “clean hands” doctrine in equity to the UK
                    equivalent of our s 216:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where the petitioner is relying upon traditional equitable principles to
                        establish unfair prejudice, then it appears that the court will apply the
                        general equitable principle that those seeking equitable relief must come to
                        the court with “clean hands”. ... Any misconduct on the part
                        of the petitioner, in so far as it relates to the grounds of unfair
                        prejudice relief, must of course be material to the court’s assessment
                        of the unfairness of the treatment of the minority by the majority and of
                        the relief that ought to be granted to redress any wrong done.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    In my judgment, therefore, the court in an
                    action under s 216 of the Companies Act can take into account equitable
                    defences such as laches and the “clean hands” doctrine in
                    determining whether there has been oppressive conduct and in awarding any
                    consequential relief. With regard to laches in particular, the English High
                    Court in <em>Re a company (No 005134 of 1986), ex parte
                        Harries</em> [1989] BCLC 383 has also held that laches may bar relief
                    on a petition under s 459 of the UK Companies Act 1985.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    I must clarify though, that equitable
                    defences in an action under s 216 are not meant to operate in an
                    all-or-nothing fashion. It is not the case where inordinate delay or the absence
                    of clean hands on the part of a plaintiff would automatically disentitle him to
                    relief. Rather, any inequity on his part would simply be a relevant factor in
                    the court’s overall assessment of whether there has been unfairness
                    warranting relief under s 216(2), and what type of relief is just and
                    equitable in the circumstances. For example, in <em>Richardson v
                        Blackmore</em> [2006] BCC 276, the petitioner had run a company as a
                    quasi-partnership with the two respondents. All three held equal shares in the
                    company. The two respondents wanted to quit the business and sold their shares
                    to a third party for £300,000 each without the knowledge or consent of the
                    petitioner. This relegated the petitioner from the position of an equal
                    shareholder with two others to that of being a true minority shareholder. The
                    petitioner brought an action under s 459 of the UK Companies Act 1985
                    alleging that he had been unfairly prejudiced.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    It subsequently emerged during the trial
                    that the petitioner had, prior to the sale, forged a letter from another party
                    containing a purported offer to buy out the two respondents at £200,000
                    each (<em>ie</em> a lower price). That purported offer was
                    of no interest to the respondents and it did not affect subsequent events. The
                    respondents sought to argue, <em>inter alia</em>, that the
                    conduct of the petitioner in forging the fake letter of offer disentitled him to
                    relief, by analogy with the “clean hands” doctrine. The English
                    Court of Appeal rejected this argument. Lloyd LJ, whom the rest of the court
                    agreed with, held at [52]–[53]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">52    It seems to me that the judge was plainly right
                            that the forgery did not automatically discharge the obligations of good
                            faith which he had found to be imposed on the former partners towards
                            each other. If [the two respondents] had found out about the forgery at
                            or soon after the date of the letter, they would no doubt have reacted
                            strongly in one way or another. But it does not follow that they would
                            have regarded any obligations of good faith between the former partners
                            as terminated. They might have wished to reinforce them and insist that
                            they be properly observed. There is certainly no basis for a finding
                            that the good faith obligations were in some way discharged without any
                            of the parties having had any choice in the matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">53    There is more to be said for the contention that
                            the petitioner’s conduct was relevant to the court’s
                            discretion whether or not to grant relief under s 461 if the
                            conditions under s 459 were satisfied. The judge dealt with this
                            rather briefly in para 112, quoted above (para 37). He cited the
                            decision of Nourse J in <em>Re London School of
                                Electronics Ltd</em> (1985) 1 BCC 99, 394 at pp 99,
                            399–400; [1986] Ch 211 at pp 221–222 as authority for
                            the proposition that there is no requirement that the petitioner under
                            s 459 should come to the court with clean hands. It is authority
                            for that proposition, but it also shows that conduct which in another
                            context might be used to invoke the clean hands doctrine can be relevant
                            on a s 459 petition, in that it “may nevertheless affect the
                            relief which the court thinks fit to grant”: see p 99, 400;
                            222B–C. Nourse J did not say so in terms, but it seems to me clear
                            that, depending on the seriousness of the matter and the degree of its
                            relevance, such conduct would be capable of leading a court to deny the
                            petitioner any relief at all, even though the conditions under
                            s 459 are made out.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">On the facts, Lloyd LJ agreed with the trial judge that the forged
                    letter had no immediate or necessary relation to the circumstances which the
                    petitioner’s claim to relief depended upon. At best it was an episode in
                    the background history. As such, the petitioner’s conduct was neither
                    sufficiently serious nor sufficiently closely related to the respondents’
                    unfairly prejudicial conduct for the court, in its discretion, to refuse to
                    grant him a remedy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    It thus seems clear that while the court
                    will take into account any equitable defences a defendant might have in an
                    application under s 216 of the Companies Act, the extent to which these
                    defences would disentitle a plaintiff to relief under s 216(2) must be
                    decided on the facts of each case. Ultimately, “the courts have a wide
                    discretion to do what is just and equitable in the circumstance”: see
                        <em>Eng Gee Seng v Quek Choon Teck</em> [2010]
                    1 SLR 241 (“<em>Eng Gee Seng</em>”)
                    at [8].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    On the facts of the present case, I do not
                    think that Neo or Mrs Neo can place much reliance on the defence of laches
                    to oppose Tan’s claim. In <em>Management Corporation Strata
                        Title No 473 v De Beers Jewellery Pte Ltd</em> [2002]
                    1 SLR(R) 418, the Court of Appeal held that there were two elements to
                    consider when raising the defence of laches: (1) the length of the delay and (2)
                    whether such delay has caused any prejudice or injustice. With regard to the
                    first limb, Neville J stated in <em>Beale v Kyte</em>
                    [1907] 1 Ch 564 at 566:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...in order that laches or acquiescence may be a defence there must be
                        notice of the error, and time runs from the date of the notice and not from
                        the time when the error is committed; and it is inconceivable to my mind
                        that on a question of laches time can run from the time the mistake was
                        committed. It seems to me it must run from the time when the
                        plaintiff’s attention is first called to the error.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    Similarly in <em>Genelabs
                        Diagnostics Pte Ltd v Institut Pasteur</em> [2000]
                    3 SLR(R) 530 (“<em>Genelabs</em>”),
                    the Court of Appeal held that the plaintiffs were not barred by laches from
                    commencing an action for patent infringement against the defendant. In computing
                    the length of delay, the court only took into account the period starting from
                    when the plaintiffs first became aware of the infringing acts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    Having heard the evidence, I am satisfied
                    that Tan only became aware of Neo’s various acts of oppression after he
                    was unceremoniously removed from the Chip Hup Group in late 2006. As the present
                    suit was filed in April 2007, there was no inordinate delay on Tan’s
                    part.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Acquiescence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    The defence of acquiescence is described in
                    the following manner in <em>Halsbury’s Laws of
                        England</em> vol 16 (4th Ed Reissue) at para 924, which was cited by
                    the Court of Appeal in <em>Genelabs</em> (<em>supra</em>) at [76]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The term acquiescence is... properly used where a person having a right
                        and seeing another person about to commit, or in the course of committing an
                        act infringing that right, stands by in such a manner as really to induce
                        the person committing the act and who might otherwise have abstained from
                        it, to believe that he consents to its being committed; a person so
                        standing-by cannot afterwards be heard to complain of the act. In that sense
                        the doctrine of acquiescence may be defined as quisence under such
                        circumstances that assent may reasonably inferred from it and is no more
                        than an instance of the law of estoppel by words or conduct...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    Acquiescence is frequently pleaded together
                    with the defence of laches because both defences are based on the inaction of
                    the party against whom the defence is invoked. As a result, some cases have
                    tended to conflate both concepts. However, they are separate and distinct
                    defences with different consequences. This is explained more fully by Patten LJ
                    in <em>Lester v Woodgate</em> (<em>supra</em>) at [21]–[22]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">21    The word laches is also sometimes used to denote
                            the type of passive conduct which can amount to acquiescence and so
                            found an estoppel when it can be shown that the party standing by has
                            induced the would-be defendant to believe that his rights will not be
                            enforced and that other party has, as a consequence, acted in a way
                            which would make the subsequent enforcement of those rights
                            unconscionable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">22    But where the conduct relied on consists of no more
                            than undue delay, it operates only to bar the grant of equitable relief
                            such as an injunction. It does not extinguish the claimants’ legal
                            right or bar its enforcement by, for example, the award of common law
                            damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    Thus, laches in its strict sense refers only
                    to delay on the part of the plaintiff coupled with prejudice to the defendant.
                    As explained above at <a href="#p1_96">[96]</a>–<a href="#p1_100">[100]</a>, laches can only be used as a defence
                    against a claim for equitable relief. Acquiescence on the other hand is premised
                    not on delay, but on the fact that the plaintiff has, by standing by and doing
                    nothing, made certain representations to the defendant in circumstances to found
                    an estoppel, waiver, or abandonment of rights: see <em>Orr v
                        Ford</em> (<em>supra</em>) at 337–338.
                    Unlike laches, the defence of acquiescence is not limited to resisting claims
                    for equitable relief.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    There have in fact been cases on minority
                    oppression where the courts have refused to grant relief due to the minority
                    shareholder’s acquiescence in the affairs complained of. In <em>Re Grandactual Ltd</em> [2006] BCC 73, some members of a
                    particular class of shareholders brought a petition under s 459 of the UK
                    Companies Act 1985 in 2004, alleging that the conduct of the company’s
                    affairs was unfairly prejudicial to them. The petitioners’ complaint was
                    that their shares had been diluted due to a directors’ resolution in 1995
                    increasing the number of authorised shares without calling a meeting of that
                    class of shareholders. The court struck out the petition on the basis that the
                    petitioners had participated in the company’s affairs without protest for
                    nine years before the petition was presented.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    Similarly in <em>Lim Chee
                        Twang v Chan Shuk Kuen Helina</em> [2010] 2 SLR 209, the
                    minority shareholder in a group of companies brought an action under s 216
                    of the Companies Act. One of his complaints was that the majority shareholder
                    had arbitrarily allocated expenses and profits across various companies in the
                    group. However, as he had acquiesced in the majority shareholder’s conduct
                    by signing the audited accounts year after year while knowing what was being
                    done, the court held that he could not be heard to complain about the state of
                    the companies’ accounts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    It is an obvious requirement that to succeed
                    on a defence of acquiescence, the acquiescing party must have been aware of the
                    acts he now seeks to complain of because one cannot acquiesce to something he
                    does not know: <em>LS Investment Pte Ltd v Majlis Ugama Islam
                        Singapura</em> [1998] 3 SLR(R) 369 at [40]; <em>Keppel Tatlee Bank Ltd v Teck Koon Investment Pte Ltd</em>
                    [2000] 1 SLR(R) 355 at [27]. In the present case, Tan was not aware of
                    Neo’s and Mrs Neo’s acts of oppression until after he was
                    ousted from the Chip Hup Group and cannot be said to have acquiesced to them.
                    The one exception relates to Neo’s refusal to get CHH to declare dividends
                    from 2000 and I have accordingly taken Tan’s acquiescence into account on
                    this particular matter. As regards his other complaints, the defence of
                    acquiescence fails.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Fourth issue – Whether, in the circumstances, Tan has made out
                a case of oppression justifying relief under s 216(2) of the Companies
                Act</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    Although Neo and Mrs Neo have not
                    succeeded in either of their pleaded defences, this does not bring the matter to
                    an end. As I mentioned above at <a href="#p1_103">[103]</a>, the
                    court in a s 216 action can take into account the conduct of all the
                    parties in determining whether there has been any unfairness justifying the
                    grant of relief. While Tan has neither delayed nor acquiesced in the matters
                    complained of, I find that there are two factors present in this case weighing
                    against him: (1) the implicit understanding he had with Neo in relation to the
                    running of CHH and (2) his collateral purpose in pursuing the present action to
                    assist Lim in the ongoing legal war between Lim and Neo.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Tan’s understanding with Neo</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    Tan was not a typical minority shareholder.
                    He did not run the business of CHH or CHKC with Neo as a quasi-partnership on
                    the basis of mutual trust and confidence, nor was he a passive investor who
                    expected Neo to at least put the interests of those companies over Neo’s
                    own. He was brought into CHH and CHKC by Lim for the sole purpose of
                    rubber-stamping the companies’ documents and taking on the various
                    liabilities from the counter-indemnities and personal guarantees he signed.
                    There was absolutely no other reason for Neo to have made Tan a director and
                    shareholder of CHH and CHKC; Neo did not know Tan at all and Tan himself had no
                    experience in the construction industry. Tan’s own evidence was that he
                    left the management of CHH and CHKC completely up to Neo while he simply showed
                    up once in a while to sign documents. In consideration for assuming the
                    liabilities as a director of CHH and CHKC, he was paid monthly directors’
                    fees (which were higher than his previous salary) and given shares in CHH and
                    CHKC; the latter were converted into shares in CHH after the restructuring and
                    share swap in 1999.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    Although I find that Neo had intended to
                    give beneficial ownership of the abovementioned shares to Tan, I also find that
                    Tan was never really concerned about his rights as a shareholder. As I mentioned
                    earlier at <a href="#p1_38">[38]</a>, I disbelieved Tan’s
                    evidence that he was primarily interested in the value of the shares he received
                    when he first agreed to join CHH and CHKC and was simply content to receive his
                    monthly directors’ fees. Moreover, Tan never displayed any interest on how
                    the business of the Chip Hup Group was being run all this while since he became
                    a director and shareholder of CHH and CHKC in 1998. This was why Tan only became
                    aware of what Neo had been up to after he was ousted in 2006. Even when CHH did
                    not declare any dividends since 2000, Tan did not bother raising any queries to
                    Neo. I find that the circumstances in which Tan became a shareholder of CHH and
                    CHKC, coupled with his sheer passiveness and subservience in relation to the
                    running of the Chip Hup Group throughout this period, was indicative of an
                    implicit understanding between him and Neo – that Tan would dutifully sign
                    whatever documents needed to be signed and let Neo run the Chip Hup Group as he
                    saw fit as long as Tan was able to collect his directors’ fees every
                    month. Although Tan was paid a dividend of $10,000 in 1999, I find that this
                    payment was entirely gratuitous and did not evidence an understanding that Tan
                    was entitled to profit-sharing in CHH or its subsidiaries.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    It is clear from the authorities that what
                    constitutes unfair conduct may be assessed with reference to the legitimate
                    expectations of minority shareholders, which may in turn arise from informal or
                    implied understandings <em>vis-à-vis</em> the majority
                    shareholders: <em>Ng Sing King v PSA International Pte
                        Ltd</em> [2005] 2 SLR(R) 56 at [95]; <em>Eng
                        Gee Seng</em> at [11]; <em>Over &amp; Over</em>
                    at [84]. While such informal or implied understandings are usually relied on to
                    subject the actions of the majority to greater scrutiny, they can conversely
                    also be used to prevent the minority from complaining about matters in which
                    they had given the majority <em>carte blanche</em>. The
                    present case is one such example. Since the understanding between Tan and Neo
                    was that Neo could run the Chip Hup Group as his personal fiefdom, Tan cannot be
                    heard to complain now that Neo had been manipulating CHH and its subsidiaries
                    for his own personal gain. It did not matter that Tan was unaware of and could
                    not acquiesce to the <em>specific</em> acts Neo had done
                    throughout this period.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Collateral purpose</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    I also find, having heard the evidence, that
                    Tan had more than one purpose in bringing the present action against Neo and
                    Mrs Neo. While I believe that Tan is genuinely aggrieved at being ousted
                    from the Chip Hup Group, I am of the view that Tan is also using the present
                    suit to assist Lim in his ongoing legal war with Neo. It is very clear from the
                    surrounding circumstances that Tan had been working closely with Lim in this
                    litigation. There are three factors pointing to this conclusion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    First, Tan must have known from the start of
                    this action that Lim had worked hand-in-glove with Neo in running CHKC. That was
                    certainly one of his avowed bases for confidence in signing the numerous
                    counter-indemnities thereby incurring personal liability. At some point in time,
                    probably around the time of his removal from the Chip Hup Group or soon
                    thereafter, he must have held discussions with Lim and saw the bitter contest
                    that was about to unfold between the two camps and therefore the facts relating
                    to the disputes. Lim had disclosed in his own pleadings in Suit 779 that he had
                    assisted Neo in generating fictitious invoices to inflate CHKC’s profits,
                    in recording all manner of payments to fictitious subcontractors to hide their
                    true nature, and that he had received monies from the Salary Accruals accounts
                    as a means of “profit sharing” with Neo. Despite Lim’s close
                    involvement in many of the alleged acts of oppression, Tan had chosen not to add
                    Lim as a defendant in this suit. Instead, he has targeted only Neo and
                    Mrs Neo when the latter’s involvement in the oppressive conduct was
                    far more insignificant compared to Lim’s.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    Secondly, when Tan first commenced this
                    action, he was able to complain about various oppressive acts by Neo such as the
                    misappropriation of commissions and inflation of groceries claims in his
                    pleadings, before any discovery was given. Since, on Tan’s own evidence,
                    he had been unaware of these matters until after he was kicked out of the Chip
                    Hup Group, his information could only have come from someone else who knew about
                    these matters <em>i.e</em>. Lim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    Lastly, Tan’s own witnesses,
                    Mr Aw and Zhang, had also given evidence for Lim in Suit 779. In fact,
                    Zhang’s AEIC in Suit 779 was substantially identical to his AEIC in this
                    action; the only differences between the two AEICs were superficial in nature.
                    Zhang also testified in cross-examination in this trial that he met with
                    Lim’s instead of Tan’s solicitors for the purposes of making his
                    present AEIC.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_76" id="Ftn_76_1"><sup>[note: 76]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    As Tan had been co-operating with Lim in
                    this action instead of trying to hold Lim accountable for his involvement in the
                    oppressive conduct, I am extremely doubtful that Tan truly felt prejudiced by
                    Neo’s actions prior to his ouster from the Chip Hup Group. I find that the
                    only other reason Tan could have raised these issues anyway was to assist Lim in
                    his bitter war against Neo. As I noted in <em>Lim Leong
                        Huat</em> at [19], the dispute between Neo and Lim has had a longer
                    history than most actions. Aside from the massive litigation in Suit 779, Neo
                    had also commenced related proceedings in CHKC’s name against Lim’s
                    brother and former colleagues in CHKC who had refused to testify on Neo’s
                    side against Lim. Both Lim and Neo seem bent on bringing each other to ruin and
                    this present action was as much a way for Lim to get back at Neo as it was for
                    Tan to seek relief.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Was there oppression justifying relief?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    Considering all the circumstances, I am
                    satisfied that Tan has made out a case of oppression justifying relief under
                    s 216(2) of the Companies Act, but only on the grounds that he had been
                    wrongfully ousted as a director of all five companies in the Chip Hup Group and
                    subsequently denied access to their accounts. Tan cannot complain of the other
                    acts of oppression prior to his ouster because he had an implicit understanding
                    with Neo that the latter was entitled to run the Chip Hup Group as he saw fit,
                    and also because he was not genuinely aggrieved at these prior acts of
                    oppression. This understanding with Neo came to an end after Tan was abruptly
                    ousted from the Chip Hup Group in 2006 (and deprived of his directors’
                    fees). Because Tan remains a beneficial shareholder of CHH, I find that his
                    expulsion and continued exclusion from CHH’s affairs is oppressive to
                    him.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Relief</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    The most obvious form of relief in response
                    to being excluded from the affairs of CHH is to simply order Neo to buy out
                    Tan’s shares. I am not minded to grant any other form of relief on account
                    of Tan’s own conduct and the fact that he only holds 0.89% of the shares
                    in CHH. On the issue of valuation, since Tan left the running of the Chip Hup
                    Group to Neo without any expectation of profit-sharing, the fairest price for
                    Tan’s shares should be their initial capitalised value of $169,251 (after
                    the restructuring and share swap). Tan would thus be getting what he started off
                    with – no more, no less.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conspiracy to injure</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    I have found that Mrs Neo was an
                    accomplice and knowingly assisted Neo in illegally siphoning money out of CHKC
                    through inflated grocery claims. Tan has made out his alternative claim in the
                    tort of conspiracy against Neo and Mrs Neo. However the real injury caused
                    by Neo and Mrs Neo in relation to the inflation of groceries claims was
                    done to CHKC. Whilst it is true that such an injury will also affect the value
                    of a shareholder’s shares, in view of the relief granted to Tan, it does
                    not arise in this case. Although the authorities show that the court in an
                    action under s 216 can order a malfeasor to compensate the company directly
                    for any injury done to it, subject to <a href="#p1_131">[131]</a>
                    below, I have already given my reasons above for restricting any relief granted
                    under s 216 to a share buyout.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    For the foregoing reasons, I order that Neo
                    is to purchase Tan’s 0.89% shareholding in CHH for the price of $169,251.
                    Tan’s remaining prayers for relief are dismissed. Neo’s counterclaim
                    is similarly dismissed. Although Tan has succeeded in establishing oppression
                    under s 216, the rest of his complaints about Neo’s conduct, which
                    took up a substantial amount of the trial, were unsuccessful. In the
                    circumstances of the case I therefore order Tan, Neo and CHH to each bear their
                    own costs of this action. As for Mrs Neo, given her culpability in
                    knowingly assisting Neo in claiming inflated sums for groceries, and because she
                    was not separately represented, she has to bear her own costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    I should add, for the avoidance of doubt,
                    that my findings in this case have been made solely on the evidence placed
                    before me by the parties (and the evidence in Suit 779). They should not be
                    taken as a constraint on future proceedings of a different nature or involving
                    different parties (for example, proceedings taken by a liquidator appointed by
                    creditors or by the authorities).</p>
