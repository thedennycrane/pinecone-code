I disagree with this submission. It is not necessary for a body corporate to be first convicted before an officer of the body corporate can be lawfully convicted under s 59(1) of the CDSA. All that is required is for the Prosecution to establish that the body corporate has committed an offence under the CDSA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The relevant provisions of the CDSA are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Acquiring, possessing, using, concealing or transferring benefits of criminal conduct</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">47.</span>—(1) Any person who —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) conceals or disguises any property which is, or in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, represents, his benefits from criminal conduct;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) <span class="font-italic">converts or transfers that property</span> or removes it from the jurisdiction; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) acquires, possesses or uses that property,</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">shall be guilty of an offence.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2)  Any person who, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property is, or in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, represents, another person’s benefits from criminal conduct —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) conceals or disguises that property; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) converts or transfers that property or removes it from the jurisdiction,</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">shall be guilty of an offence.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Offences by bodies corporate, etc.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">59.</span>—(1) Where an offence under this Act committed by <span class="font-italic">a body corporate</span> is <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">proved</span> —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 In my view, the word “proved” in s 59(1) of the CDSA simply means that sufficient evidence is available to satisfy the court that an offence has been committed by the body corporate and there are no relevant defences to exculpate the body corporate. If Parliament truly intended for the body corporate to be convicted first before its officers can be convicted, the provision would have read instead: where a body corporate has been <span class="font-italic">convicted</span> of an offence under this Act. The Appellant’s interpretation requires one to read “proved” as “convicted” which goes against the plain reading of the statute. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Treating the absence of a conviction of a body corporate as a bar to convicting its officers can also lead to absurd results. For instance, if the body corporate has become defunct by the time investigations are completed, this will mean that its officers will enjoy impunity, especially in a case where they have chosen to shut down the body corporate just so as to avoid prosecution. That clearly cannot be right.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 During the hearing of this appeal, Mr Foo also agreed with this interpretation. I am very grateful to Mr Foo who was able on my request to perform some research and analysis of the legislative history of this provision during the lunch break (even though this question was not strictly referred to him as <span class="font-italic">amicus curiae</span>). In this regard, Mr Foo pointed out that parliamentary intention is silent and highlighted however that similar wording is found in numerous other criminal legislation in Singapore, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, s 17(1) of the Undesirable Publications Act (Cap 338, 1998 Rev Ed) and s 11(1) of the Hostage-Taking Act (Cap 126C, 2011 Rev Ed).

</div> Since the Appellant does not dispute this finding, this is sufficient for me to conclude that the Prosecution has “proved” that WEL committed an offence under s 47(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the CDSA, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, it transferred monies which were in whole or in part its benefits of criminal conduct out of its account. Even if an offence under s 47(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the CDSA is not proved, I find that at the very least, an offence under s 47(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the CDSA has been proved. The main difference between these two offences is that the latter concerns the benefits of <span class="font-italic">another</span> person’s criminal conduct. Thus even if the stolen properties were not WEL’s own benefits from criminal conduct but Nadia’s and/or Sima’s benefits, the District Judge found beyond a reasonable doubt that WEL <span class="font-italic">knew or </span><span class="font-italic">had reasonable grounds to believe</span> that the six deposits which were paid into its account were stolen properties (regardless of who had stolen them). The elements of s 47(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the CDSA are therefore satisfied. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Accordingly, either on the basis of s 47(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) or s 47(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the CDSA, an offence has been “proved” to be committed by WEL, triggering the operation of s 59(1) of the CDSA in relation to the Appellant as an officer of WEL. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Attributable to the Appellant’s neglect</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The primary issue to be determined in relation to the CDSA charges is whether the offences committed by WEL are attributable to any neglect on the part of the Appellant under s 59(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the CDSA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Section 59(1) of the CDSA reads:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Offences by bodies corporate, etc.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">59.</span>—(1) Where an offence under this Act committed by a body corporate is proved —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) to have been committed with the consent or connivance of an officer; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) <span class="font-italic">to be attributable</span><span class="font-italic"> to any neglect on his part</span>, </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">the officer as well as the body corporate shall be guilty of the offence and shall be liable to be proceeded against and punished accordingly.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 The District Judge found that the Appellant was negligent as he had placed himself in the mere position of “a dummy director of WEL” by relinquishing complete control of WEL.

</div> The District Judge thus found that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">78.  [The Appellant] did not take any steps to inform himself of the affairs of WEL. He was in no position to guide and monitor its business. His role was limited to scanning the bank statements and other correspondences and emailing them to Nadia. No evidence was adduced that Nadia and/or Sima were required to inform him of the activities of WEL to enable him to maintain proper oversight of WEL.

This had led to WEL receiving the six deposits.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 On appeal, the Appellant seeks to challenge these findings of fact made by the District Judge on two fronts. First, the Appellant was not <span class="font-italic">negligent</span> in the discharge of his duties as he was employed to act only as a local resident director in a purely non-executive capacity. The Appellant was thus not in the best position to effectively monitor and supervise WEL’s operations and affairs.

</div> appear to treat the words “any neglect on his part” in s 59(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the CDSA as importing the same obligation as that to “use reasonable diligence in the discharge of his office” in s 157(1) of the CA. In my view, however, I do not think it is right to conflate these two distinct concepts as the latter is a far more general obligation than the former. The key inquiry of the requisite neglect in s 59(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the CDSA is a more specific one that is pegged to the commission of the offence in question by the body corporate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 This interpretation is supported by a survey of the UK jurisprudence. In <span class="font-italic">Wotherspoon</span><span class="font-italic"> v HM Advocate</span> [1978] JC 74 (“<span class="font-italic">Wotherspoon</span>”), the applicant had been found guilty of two charges under s 37(1) of the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974 (c 37) (UK) in respect of the absence of fencing around certain parts of several machines in a factory run by a company of which he was the managing director. He appealed on the ground that the presiding judge had misdirected the jury by failing to give it any adequate guidance as to the meaning of the words “attributable to any neglect”. In dismissing the appeal, the Lord Justice-General, Lord Emslie observed (at 78): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… that <span class="font-italic">the word </span><span class="font-italic">“neglect” in its natural meaning pre-supposes the existence of some obligation or duty on the part of the person charged with neglect</span>. Where that word appears in section 37(1) it is associated with certain specified officers of a body corporate or with persons “purporting to act in any such capacity”. It is <span class="font-italic">any neglect on their part to which the commission of an offence within a specified category by a body corporate is attributable which attracts the penal sanction</span><span class="font-italic">.</span> … [I]t seems clear that the section as a whole is concerned primarily to provide a penal sanction against those persons charged with functions of management who can be shown to have been responsible for the commission of a relevant offence by an artificial persona, a body corporate. Accordingly, in considering in a given case<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>whether there has been neglect within the meaning of section 37(1) on the part of a particular director or other particular officer charged, the search must be to <span class="font-italic">discover whether the accused has failed to take some steps to prevent the commission</span><span class="font-italic"> of an offence by the corporation to which he belongs if the taking of those steps either expressly falls or should be held to fall within the scope of the functions of the office which he holds</span>. In all cases accordingly the functions of the office of a person charged with a contravention of section 37(1) will be a highly relevant consideration for any Judge or jury and the question whether there was on his part, as the holder of his particular office, a failure to take a step which he could and should have taken will fall to be answered in light of the whole circumstances of the case including <span class="font-italic">his state of knowledge of the need for action</span><span class="font-italic">, or the existence of a state of fact requiring action to be taken of which he ought to have been aware</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 These remarks were subsequently adopted by the English Court of Appeal case of <span class="font-italic">R v P</span> [2007] EWCA Crim 1937 (“<span class="font-italic">R v P</span>”), where Latham LJ expressed the view that the critical question is whether the officer <span class="font-italic">ought to have been aware</span> that he could and should have taken action to prevent the commission of the offence – action which he never did take although it was within the scope of his duties to do so – and not whether he <span class="font-italic">knew</span> of the commission of the offence but turned a blind eye to it. Thus, even if the officer was unaware of the commission of the offence, if by reason of the circumstances and the nature and scope of his responsibilities, he <span class="font-italic">ought to have been put on inquiry</span>, he would be guilty of neglect if he failed to take the appropriate preventive action. In the words of Latham LJ (at [13]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The question, at the end of the day, will always be, as the Lord Justice General said in [<span class="font-italic">Wotherspoon</span>], whether or not it is proper, where there is no actual knowledge of the state of facts, nonetheless the officer in question of the company should have, by reason of the surrounding circumstances, been put on enquiry so as to require him to have taken steps to determine whether or not the appropriate safety procedures were in place. That will depend in every case on the evidence put forward by the prosecution in the first instance, and, if there is sufficient evidence to justify the matter going to the jury, the overall evidence, including that of the defendant, at the end of the trial.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 In <span class="font-italic">R</span><span class="font-italic"> v P</span>, this meant that in order for the defendant to be convicted of a similar offence, it did not need to be established that the defendant had in fact known of the dangerous practice carried out in the company’s factory in his capacity as managing director of the company; the relevant question was whether the facts were such that he should have been put on inquiry to check that appropriate safety measures were put in place in the factory. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 These authorities were subsequently affirmed by the House of Lords in <span class="font-italic">R v Chargot Limited (t/a Contract Services) and others </span>[2008] UKHL 73 (“<span class="font-italic">Chargot</span>”), a case dealing with the same statutory provision. While Lord Hope of Craighead agreed that the essential inquiry is whether the officer should have been put on inquiry so as to take steps to prevent the offence, his Lordship emphasised that the facts which must be proved to establish that the officer’s state of mind amounted to neglect varies from case to case. In particular, stronger evidence is required to prove or infer neglect where the activities comprising the offence were not under the officer’s direction or control. It is instructive to set out Lord Hope’s observations (at [33]–[34]) in full:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [T]he circumstances will vary from case to case. So no fixed rule can be laid down as to what the prosecution must identify and prove in order to establish that the officer’s state of mind was such as to amount to consent, connivance or neglect. <span class="font-italic">In some cases, as where the officer’s place of activity was remote from the work place or what was done there was not under his immediate direction and control, this may require the leading of quite detailed evidence of which fair notice may have to be given. In others, where the officer was in day to day contact with what was done there, very little more may be needed.</span> In <span class="font-italic">Wotherspoon v HM Advocate </span>1978 JC 74, 78 Lord Justice General Emslie said the section is concerned primarily to provide a penal sanction against those persons charged with functions of management who can be shown to have been responsible for the commission of the offence by a body corporate, and that <span class="font-italic">the functions of the office which he holds will be a highly relevant consideration</span>. In <span class="font-italic">R v P Ltd </span>[2008] ICR 96 Lathan LJ endorsed the Lord Justice General’s observation that the question, in the end of the day, will always be whether the officer in question should have been put on inquiry so as to have taken steps to determine whether or not the appropriate safety procedures were in place. I would too. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The state of mind that the words “connivance” and “neglect” contemplate is one that may also be established by inference. … Where it is shown that the body corporate [committed the predicate offence], it will be a relatively short step for the inference to be drawn that there was connivance or neglect on his part <span class="font-italic">if the circumstances under which the risk </span>[to workplace safety, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the predicate offence]<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">arose were under the direction or control of the officer. The more remote his area of responsibility is from those circumstances, the harder it will be to draw that inference.</span> </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 For completeness, I also note that the observations made in <span class="font-italic">Wotherspoon</span> and <span class="font-italic">Chargot</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>have been adopted and applied in Australia in relation to an <span class="font-italic">in pari materia</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>provision: see s 55(1) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act 1984 (WA) and the decision of the Court of Appeal of the Western Australian Supreme Court in <span class="font-italic">Fry v Keating</span> [2013] WASCA 109 at [28]–[31].  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Based on the foregoing, the applicable principles may be summarised as follows. To prove neglect, it must be shown that the officer knew or ought to have known of the existence of facts requiring him to take steps which fell within the scope of the functions of his role to prevent the commission of the offence by the company, and that he failed to take such steps. In assessing the state of his knowledge and the scope of action which he allegedly neglected to perform, the functions of his office will be a relevant consideration. The more remote his office from the facts surrounding the offence, the more difficult it is to infer that the officer was negligent, and hence stronger evidence would be required of the Prosecution.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Was the Appellant negligent?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 In view of the above, the key question to be answered is whether, having regard to the functions of his office, the Appellant <span class="font-italic">ought</span> to have been aware that WEL was dealing with stolen properties such that he ought to have taken steps within his functions to prevent WEL’s commission of the offences. It is thus no defence for the Appellant to claim (at [55] above) that he lacked actual knowledge of the fraudulent dealings of WEL. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 I also reject the Appellant’s submission (at [55] above) that the Appellant cannot possibly be negligent because he was a merely a local resident director who was not employed to supervise and manage WEL. The duties of a non-executive director are not dependent on the terms of his employment contract. The duties of a director (even a non-executive director) are imposed by the common law and statute and cannot be contracted away by any form of employment contract. It is antithetical for a person to agree to be a director on the condition that he will not exercise <span class="font-italic">any</span> form of supervision or control over the affairs of the company. Whilst I can accept that a non-executive director is not obliged to keep constant tabs on his company, I cannot accept that he can completely relinquish even the duty of having some minimal level of supervision over the company’s affairs. Therefore, although the limited functions of the Appellant’s office are relevant to the question of neglect, it remains to be assessed whether the surrounding facts and circumstances ought to have made him aware of the predicate offences and whether there were steps he could have taken – even in his limited role – to ensure that WEL was not engaging in any criminal acts in contravention of the CDSA. In other words, it is not a conceptual impossibility that a non-executive director can be prosecuted and found guilty of an offence under s 59(1) of the CDSA; it depends on the facts arising in each case. Taking into account the fact that he was a non-executive director with no active management duties, stronger evidence is required to infer the requisite state of knowledge on his part before holding him accountable for the failure to take actions within the scope of the functions of his role to prevent the commission of the offence by the company.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 In my view, the surrounding circumstances in the present case ought to have put the Appellant on inquiry that illicit activities were being carried out through WEL, such that the Appellant ought to have stepped up his supervision over WEL’s activities. The following “red flags” highlighted by the District Judge support this conclusion:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) The Appellant was informed by SCB that it had rejected his application to open a corporate bank account for both Kassar and Lottus on the ground that checks done on the directors had not turned out quite well.

The fact that he was highly suspicious by this time buttresses and lends weight to the conclusion that he ought to have known that WEL might also be involved in illegal activities which calls for the need to take some action on his part as an officer of WEL.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 However, despite the state of his knowledge of these facts and circumstances that clearly called for him to make inquiries, the Appellant neglected to take any active steps to take investigative and/or preventive action, which he ought to have done. Being in constant contact with Sima and Nadia, it would have taken only an email from him to ask questions on the activities of WEL, the reasons for the closure of Kassar’s bank accounts and the multiple funds recall notices. In spite of his experience as the director of 22 other companies and a chartered accountant for many years, he chose not to do <span class="font-italic">anything</span> at all. As correctly found by the District Judge:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">81.  As director, [the Appellant] had the duty to make inquiries in light of the various red flags ... It was incumbent that he ensured that WEL was compliant with the law. He should have also taken active steps to ensure that WEL did not receive and transfer stolen property ... the [Appellant] had done nothing and treated everything as business as usual. He could have, and should have asked Nadia and Sima questions. Even when he did so on the rare occasion, he did not press for a response when none was forthcoming. He could have taken steps to strike off WEL. He could have alerted the authority. Yet he did none of these things.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Each of the steps outlined above were within the scope of the Appellant’s functions as a local resident director, even though he was a non-executive director and was uninvolved in the day-to-day operations of WEL (assuming such operations even existed). Being the only local director, he was required to exercise reasonable diligence to ensure that the company was not engaging in any acts in contravention of the law in Singapore, especially where he had notice of sufficient facts before him to raise alarm bells as to the propriety of WEL’s activities. This failure to take any active steps whatsoever which was his duty to take in the circumstances is what renders the Appellant’s conduct negligent. It is precisely such conduct that s 59(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the CDSA is meant to prohibit and deter. In fact, the evidence reveals that the Appellant simply did not care what WEL did, as demonstrated by the completely cavalier fashion in which he acted despite the state of his knowledge of the facts and circumstances that clearly called for him to take action. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Before I leave this point, I find myself compelled to make a brief observation regarding the conclusion made by the District Judge that the Appellant was “wilfully blind to the fact or at least had reason to believe that WEL was involved in the receipt of stolen monies”.

</div>
</div> This is not the relevant inquiry for the purposes of the offences committed by the Appellant. Since the Prosecution has chosen to specify s 47(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) as opposed to s 47(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the CDSA (see above at [49]) as the predicate offence in the CDSA charges faced by the Appellant, there is no need for there to be a finding of fact that WEL knew or had reason to believe that the properties were stolen. This finding of fact only has to be made where the charge is under s 47(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) which requires the offender to “[know] or [have] reasonable grounds to believe” that the property is or represents another person’s benefits from criminal conduct. In contrast, for a conviction under s 47(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the CDSA (transfer of benefits of one’s <span class="font-italic">own</span> criminal conduct, here WEL’s criminal conduct), which is what is specified in the CDSA charges, such a finding need not be made. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 As I have described above, all that is required for convicting the Appellant of the six CDSA charges is that he <span class="font-italic">ought to have known</span> that WEL was dealing with stolen properties. No other <span class="font-italic">mens rea</span> is required. In any event, I have some reservations as to whether the Appellant can be said to have been “wilfully blind” or to have “had reason to believe” that WEL was dealing with stolen properties in respect of <span class="font-italic">all</span> the six CDSA charges as opposed to only some of these charges. Since my conclusion on this point goes only to the question of sentence for the different CDSA offences and has no impact on the conviction on these charges, I will elaborate on this point below in the context of the Appellant’s sentences for the CDSA offences. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Proper interpretation of “attributable to”</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Since the Appellant was negligent in relation to the offences committed by WEL, the next issue is whether these offences were <span class="font-italic">attribut</span><span class="font-italic">able</span> <span class="font-italic">to</span> his neglect. There are several possible interpretations that can be accorded to the words “attributable to” in s 59(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the CDSA:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) primary causation;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) “but for” causation; or</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) mere simple causation, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, one of the reasons for the eventuality.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 The case of <span class="font-italic">Wotherspoon </span>preferred the interpretation of a mere simple causation (at 78):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the words “attributable to” … are not qualified in the subsection or the statute by such words as “wholly or mainly” or in any other way. In our opinion any degree of attributability will suffice and in that sense it is evident that the commission of a relevant offence by a body corporate may well be found to be attributable to failure on the part of each of a number of directors, managers or other officers to take certain steps which he could and should have taken in the discharge of the particular functions of his particular office.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 For the reasons given by the court in <span class="font-italic">Wotherspoon</span>, I agree that any degree of attribution will be sufficient to make out the charge. What matters is whether the officer could and should have taken steps to prevent the offence; not whether any steps if taken by the officer will more likely than not or most definitely have prevented the commission of the offence. In my view, this interpretation is in line with Parliament’s intent of holding officers criminally liable for the actions of corporate bodies that they manage or control. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Were the offences committed by WEL attributable to the Appellant’s neglect?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 On the facts of this case, I agree with the District Judge that the offences committed by WEL were attributable to the Appellant’s neglect. In view of the points made above, it does not have to be conclusively shown that if the Appellant had taken active steps such as alerting the relevant authorities and the bank, or making a police report, the offences would not have materialised. All that the Prosecution has to show is that if the Appellant had not been negligent, the offence <span class="font-italic">may</span> have been prevented. This is clearly proven on the facts of this case given that if the Appellant had for instance made a police report in February 2012, it is entirely possible that WEL’s account could have been frozen before the money laundering transactions took place between April and May 2012. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 On this point, it leaves me now to address the Appellant’s argument (at [55] above) that the Appellant could not have stopped the six withdrawals because he was not a signatory of WEL’s account and he only knew of most of the deposits through the recall notices after these monies had already been withdrawn. Even if I accept the factual accuracy of this argument, this argument entirely misses the point as to when the necessary steps should have been taken by the Appellant. As I have alluded to above (see [64]–[71] above), the Appellant should have already taken these steps as early as February 2012, two months before he received the first recall notice. If he had done so, it is possible that the offences <span class="font-italic">may</span> been prevented. Accordingly, the offences committed by WEL are attributable to the Appellant’s neglect.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 For these reasons, I dismiss the Appellant’s appeal against conviction on all the six CDSA charges.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Reasonable diligence under s 157(1) CA </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 The Appellant also appeals against the conviction in respect of the CA charge.

However, the standard is “not fixed but a continuum” depending on various factors such as the individual’s role in the company, the experience or skills that the director held himself out to possess in support of his appointment to the office, and the size and business of the company (see <span class="font-italic">Lim Weng Kee</span> at [28]; approving of the decision in <span class="font-italic">Daniels v Anderson</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[1995] 118 FLR 248 at 310).

</div> The directors in that case were similarly appointed to fulfil the statutory requirement that a Singapore-incorporated company must have a local resident director. In this vein, the Appellant relies on the following observations in <span class="font-italic">Prima Bulkship</span>:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">45 … As the Companies were incorporated in Singapore, they are statutorily required to appoint a director ordinarily resident in Singapore (the Purchasers were non-Singaporeans and RP Capital and RP Ventures were Malaysian companies). Thus, the Defendant Directors were approached to take up this role at a rate of S$2,000 per annum. This is a common practice in the industry. Such directors typically do not play an active or executive role in the company, and their main function is to ensure that the company complies with the statutory requirements of local resident director. They also do not engage in or shoulder responsibility for commercial decision making, discharging the role of a director more in form than in substance. Hence, the use of the term “nominee” director to describe them.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">49 First, it is important to emphasise the role of the Defendant Directors in the Companies. They were appointed merely to fulfil the statutory requirement that the Companies appoint a local resident director. As mentioned above at [45], this is a practice that is prevalent. Such directors often do not have the relevant skills and/or expertise in the subject matter the company’s business pertained to. Their main role is to ensure that the company complies with its statutory obligations and are rarely expected to participate in the commercial decisions of the company. These decisions and the management of the company are typically left to other more qualified persons (usually the parties who incorporated the company and intend to do business through the company). While this does not mean that the Defendant Directors are relieved of their duties of care, skill and diligence, it does impact the extent to which they are expected to be informed of the Companies’ affairs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 In my view, the Appellant’s reliance on <span class="font-italic">Prima Bulkship</span> is taken out of its context in the present case. Ramesh JC’s observations were directed at the issue of civil liability of directors for losses suffered by their company. In <span class="font-italic">Prima Bulkshi</span><span class="font-italic">p</span>, the local resident directors had simply acted on the directions of the shareholders in approving directors’ resolutions in connection with the purchase of a ship. This contract to purchase eventually caused losses to the company in the form of damages payable to the seller of the ship. The company was subsequently placed under creditors’ voluntary liquidation and the liquidator brought an action against these directors for breach of their directors’ duties to act with reasonable diligence.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 In such a case, it might very well be that local resident directors should not be held liable for breach of their duties of diligence in connection with <span class="font-italic">commercial</span> decisions made by the company; this is because it is not the role and purpose of non-executive local resident directors to make such decisions given that these <span class="font-italic">legitimate</span> business decisions are usually spearheaded by the executive directors. In stark contrast, however, a local resident director, cannot simply be a “dummy director” who approves, ignores, or is nonchalant as to whether the company is engaging in any <span class="font-italic">illegal</span> activities. If it were otherwise, it would make an utter mockery out of the statutory requirement to have a local resident director because all a foreign company needs to do to circumvent any external supervision is to employ a dummy resident director and pay him enough money to keep his mouth sealed in order for the corporate shield of the company to be used for nefarious or illegal purposes. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 Additionally, the Appellant (relying again on <span class="font-italic">Prima Bulkship</span>) also attempts to justify his inaction on the basis that the provision of such resident director services is a common practice in Singapore.

</div> Whilst I accept that it is indeed a prevalent practice to offer such services, I am hesitant to conclude that it is also prevalent for most resident directors to act in such a nonchalant and cavalier fashion in which the Appellant had acted in the face of such obvious “red flags”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Even if I were wrong and most resident directors conduct themselves in a similar fashion, this common practice is not a ground to exculpate the Appellant. As was found in the English case of <span class="font-italic">Re D’Jan of London Ltd </span>[1993] BCC 646 by Hoffmann LJ (as he then was), even if the act of breach was a common practice amongst directors, it would still be considered negligent (at 648). In that case, an insurance company repudiated liability for fire at a company’s premises on account of incorrect answers in an insurance proposal. In finding Mr D’Jan to be negligent and liable to the company because he failed to read the insurance proposal before signing it as a director of the company, Hoffman LJ opined thus at 648:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Nevertheless I think that in failing even to read the form, Mr <span style="color: rgba(37,37,37,1)">D'Jan</span><span class="font-weight-bold" style="color: rgba(37,37,37,1)"> </span>was negligent. Mr Russen said that the standard of care which directors owe to their companies is not very exacting and <span class="font-italic">signing forms without reading them is something a busy director might reasonably do</span>. <span class="font-italic">I accept that in real life, this often happens. But that does not mean that it is not negligent</span>. People often take risks in circumstances in which it was not necessary or reasonable to do so. If the risk materialises, they may have to pay a penalty. I do not say that a director must always read the whole of every document which he signs. If he signs an agreement running to 60 pages of turgid legal prose on the assurance of his solicitor that it accurately reflects the board's instructions, he may well be excused from reading it all himself. But this was an extremely simple document asking a few questions which Mr <span style="color: rgba(37,37,37,1)">D'Jan </span>was the best person to answer.

In other words, whether it is an individual (“A”) who commits the offence under s 47(1) of the CDSA, or a company that commits the predicate offence (“primary offender”) for which the director (“B”) is being held criminally liable (“secondary offender”), the maximum sentence that can be imposed is the same for both A and B, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, a fine of S$500,000 and ten years’ imprisonment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 However, it must be emphasised that in relation to a secondary offender, s 59(1) of the CDSA contemplates three distinct <span class="font-italic">mens rea</span>, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, “consent”, “connivance” as well as “neglect”. While the difference in culpability between “neglect” and “consent or connivance” is obvious, there is also a fine difference in culpability between “consent” and “connivance” under English law – consent requires more explicit an agreement for the illegal conduct to take place. In <span class="font-italic">Huckerby v Elliot </span>[1970] 1 All ER 189, although the Divisional Court was essentially concerned with whether the appellant had committed an offence by reason of her neglect, Ashworth J noted that a fellow director of the company had pleaded guilty to a charge under the “consent” limb. In this connection, he expressed his approval for the following remarks which had featured in the magistrate’s judgment from whose decision the appeal arose (at 194): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It would seem that where a director consents to the commission of an offence by his company, he is well aware of what is going on and agrees to it … Where he connives at the offence committed by the company he is equally well aware of what is going on but his agreement is tacit, not actively encouraging what happens but letting it continue and saying nothing about it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 In <span class="font-italic">Attorney General's Reference No 1 of 1995</span> [1996] 1 WLR 970, the English Court of Appeal was asked to answer the question as to what was required to be proved against a director to show “consent”. Lord Taylor of Gosforth CJ concluded that a director must be shown to have known the material facts that constituted the offence by the body corporate and to have agreed to its conduct of the business on the basis of those facts (at 981). Subsequently, Lord Hope in <span class="font-italic">Chargot</span> endorsed this test, adding that consent can be established by either inference or proof of an express agreement (at [34]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 It is clear from the above that the English cases distinguish between “consent” and “connivance”. However, since this matter does not arise for conclusive determination before me, I shall leave the position in Singapore open until a further court gets the opportunity to examine the precise difference between these two <span class="font-italic">mens rea</span> requirements. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 To add further complication, there is also the possibility of a fourth <span class="font-italic">mens rea</span>, that of recklessness, being encompassed within the rubric of “neglect”. Conceptually speaking, recklessness may be regarded as a more culpable form of neglect. If the essence of neglect lies in the failure to do something which the officer ought to have done, it stands to reason that an officer who fails to do so despite being aware of the risk is more culpable than one who failed to appreciate what these risks were in the first place. The concept of recklessness must thus be encompassed as part of “neglect” in order for the offence to cover all intermediate forms of <span class="font-italic">mens rea </span>on the spectrum leading up to “connivance” and “consent”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 Accordingly, these four distinct <span class="font-italic">mens rea</span> elements are subject to the same punishment provision in s 47(6) of the CDSA, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the maximum fine and maximum term of imprisonment are the same, even though the relevant culpability can vary greatly. This might make it difficult to determine the appropriate sentences in individual cases as the one-stop maximum sentence in s 47(6) is not a helpful end point to use as a scale for the less culpable <span class="font-italic">mens rea</span> of recklessness or negligence <span class="font-italic">simplic</span><span class="font-italic">iter</span>. Thus, with the aim of offering some guidance for future sentencing decisions, I shall determine the so-called invisible or notional upper limits as an aid in determining the appropriate sentence when faced with the different degrees of culpability for offenders who possess the different <span class="font-italic">mens rea</span> elements of consent, connivance, recklessness or negligence <span class="font-italic">simpliciter</span>, at the time the offences were committed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 I am of the view that under s 59(1) for the CDSA, for “<span class="font-underline">consent or connivance</span>”, the maximum term is <span class="font-weight-bold">ten</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> years’ imprisonment</span>; for “<span class="font-underline">recklessness</span>” which is generally lower in culpability than “consent or connivance”, the notional maximum may be treated as approximately <span class="font-weight-bold">four</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> years’ imprisonment</span>; for “<span class="font-underline">negligence</span> <span class="font-italic">simpliciter</span>” which is generally even lower in culpability than “recklessness”, the notional maximum may be treated as approximately <span class="font-weight-bold">two</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> years’ imprisonment</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 The maximum for “consent or connivance”, being the most culpable of the different possible <span class="font-italic">mens rea</span> for this offence, is naturally pegged to the maximum term of imprisonment provided under s 47(6) of the CDSA, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, ten years’ imprisonment. As for the two other broad possibilities of <span class="font-italic">mens rea</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>of recklessness and negligence <span class="font-italic">simpliciter</span>, I have determined these notional maximums based on a comparison of other criminal legislation in Singapore (reproduced for convenience in the Annex of this judgment). I have selected these provisions because Parliament has expressly indicated in these offences the respective maximum imprisonment terms that can be awarded for differing <span class="font-italic">mens rea</span>, <span class="font-italic">ie, </span>intentional/knowledge-based <span class="font-italic">mens rea</span> vis-à-vis recklessness vis-à-vis negligence. Thus, these statutes serve as a guide for me to stratify and calibrate the notional maximums since the CDSA itself does not stipulate the stratification.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 My analysis of these provisions leads me to conclude that there is often a <span class="font-italic">50%</span>–<span class="font-italic">60% reduction</span> in the maximum sentence when the offences concern recklessness as opposed to those committed with intention/knowledge and a further <span class="font-italic">50</span>–<span class="font-italic">60</span><span class="font-italic">% reduction</span> when the offences concern negligence as opposed to recklessness. I should caveat that the analysis does not reveal absolute consistency but rather just a broad consistency. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 I shall briefly highlight some of these provisions. First, reference may be made to the homicide offences in the Penal Code. Under s 304(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Penal Code, the maximum term of imprisonment is ten years where the act of causing death is committed with the knowledge that it is likely to cause death. Under s 304A of the Penal Code, the same act of causing death but through a rash or negligent act carries a maximum of five years’ imprisonment (50% discount from s 304(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)) and two years’ imprisonment (60% discount from rash act under s 304A(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)) respectively. A similar reduction of 50% is evident in s 66 of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 2004 Rev Ed) (“the RTA”) where causing death by reckless or dangerous driving carries a maximum of five years’ imprisonment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 Second, such an analysis is also evident in the case of hurt and grievous hurt offences. For simple hurt, the maximum custodial sentence for voluntarily causing hurt is two years’ imprisonment (s 323 of the Penal Code). However, where hurt is caused through a rash act, there is a 50% reduction to a maximum of one year’s imprisonment (s 337(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Penal Code) and where it is through a negligent act, there is a further 50% reduction to a maximum of six months’ imprisonment (s 337(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Penal Code). A similar trend is discernible in the case of grievous hurt under ss 325 and 338 of the Penal Code – the discount from voluntarily causing grievous hurt (s 325) to rashly causing grievous hurt (s 338(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)) is 60%, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, from a maximum imprisonment term of ten years to four years, whereas the discount from rashly causing grievous hurt to negligently causing grievous hurt (s 338(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)) is 50%, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, from a maximum of four years to two years’ imprisonment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 Third, there is also a discount of 50% on the maximum imprisonment term of six months for driving without due care or reasonable consideration (broadly speaking, negligent driving) under s 65 of the RTA when compared to the maximum imprisonment term of 12 months for reckless or dangerous driving under s 64(1) of the RTA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 Fourth, moving away from the offences of violence against persons, reference to the provisions in the Immigration Act (Cap 133, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the Immigration Act”) shows that such a trend is also discernible in regulatory offences. Under s 57 of the Immigration Act, the maximum term of imprisonment for knowingly or recklessly harbouring a person who has acted in contravention of the Immigration Act or its regulations is two years under s 57(1)(iv). As in the case of the offences above, there is a 50% reduction to a maximum term of imprisonment of one year where this offence is committed negligently instead (s 57(1)(v) of the Immigration Act). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 Fifth, as alluded to above, there are some anomalies. For instance, under the Electricity Act (Cap 89A, 2002 Rev Ed), the discount from a wilful act to a rash or negligent act in relation to electrical or supply installations under ss 83(2)–83(3) is from five years to three years, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 40% discount from wilful to rash, slightly lower than the 50–60% range found in the offences above, and no distinction made between rash and negligent acts. A more extreme anomaly is s 37A of the Civil Defence Act (Cap 42, 2001 Rev Ed), where the discount from a wilful act to a negligent act causing irrecoverable loss of service property is 33.3%. This is much lower than the usual discounts from intentional/knowledge-related <span class="font-italic">mens rea</span> to negligence. These differences can presumably be explained on the basis that both electricity and civil defence concern public goods, such that Parliament may not have been willing to give the usual discount rate with the aim of exceptionally deterring these offences. Thus, these anomalies do not justify departure from the general norm that I have found above. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Sentencing considerations for “neglect” limb </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Respective starting points </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 Having established the respective notional maximums for the different <span class="font-italic">mens rea</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>under s 59(1) of the CDSA, I shall turn now to consider the specific issue at hand: where the commission of an offence by a body corporate under the CDSA can be attributed to the neglect of an officer of the body corporate, what are the relevant sentencing considerations when sentencing the officer? </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 In summary, I am of the view that an offender charged under the “neglect” limb and found to be merely negligent should receive a fine as a starting point (in the absence of aggravating factors) whereas the starting points for the “consent” and “connivance” limbs should be a custodial sentence. Having said that, even where the offender is charged under the “neglect” limb, if the circumstances are such that he is found to have been reckless instead of being merely <span class="font-italic">negligent</span>, this would be an aggravating factor that justifies the starting point of a custodial sentence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 In support of a non-custodial sentence as the starting point for purely negligent conduct, I find helpful the submissions made by Mr Foo on the issue of when a custodial sentence should be imposed for a breach of the duty to exercise reasonable diligence under s 157(1) of the CA.

</div> Two of the reasons that he cites are equally relevant to justify why the custodial threshold should not ordinarily be crossed in relation to s 59(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the CDSA when the “neglect” is merely that of negligence <span class="font-italic">simpliciter</span>. First, there is an intuitive sense that an offender is less morally culpable when the offence is committed merely negligently as opposed to recklessly, knowingly or intentionally.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 Regarding the first reason, since negligence <span class="font-italic">simpliciter</span> is the least culpable <span class="font-italic">mens rea</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>in question, I am of the view that a custodial sentence should not ordinarily be imposed for purely negligent breaches of an officer’s or director’s duties. As astutely observed by Professor Brent Fisse in relation to the Austrian criminal justice system (cited with approval in Australia, Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, <span class="font-italic">Company Directors’</span><span class="font-italic"> Duties</span> (Parliamentary Paper, No 395 of 1989, November 1989) at para 13.11):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">... Generally speaking, the approach adopted in our system of criminal justice is to require proof of guilty intention, knowledge or recklessness, especially where the offence carries the possibility of a jail sentence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 Espousing the same view, the UK Law Commission said in <span class="font-italic">Criminal Liability in Regulatory Con</span><span class="font-italic">texts</span> (Consultation Paper No 195, 2010) at para 3.10:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">One way in which our overall approach to regulatory legislation can be exemplified is by the use of a hierarchy of offences, to capture an adequate range of wrongdoing.

MPH Rubin JC (as he then was) first explained in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor</span><span class="font-italic"> v Teo Poh Leng</span> [1991] 2 SLR(R) 541 at [7] (subsequently approved by Yong CJ in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor</span><span class="font-italic"> v Poh Teck Huat</span> [2003] 2 SLR 299 at [17]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">There is a distinction between a rash act and a negligent act. Criminal negligence is the gross and culpable neglect or failure to exercise that reasonable and proper care and precaution to guard against injury either to the public generally or to an individual in particular, which having regard to all the circumstances out of which the charge has arisen it was the imperative duty of the accused person to have adopted. Negligence is an omission to do something which a reasonable man, guided upon those considerations which ordinarily regulate the conduct of human affairs, would do, or doing something which a prudent and reasonable man would not do. A culpable rashness is acting with the consciousness that the mischievous and illegal consequences may follow, but with the hope that they will not, and often with the belief that the actor has taken sufficient precaution to prevent their happening. The imputability arises from acting despite the consciousness. Culpable negligence is acting without the consciousness, that the illegal and mischievous effect will follow, but in circumstances which show that the actor has not exercised the caution incumbent upon him and if he had he would have had the consciousness. The imputability arises from the neglect of the civic duty of circumspection. As between rashness and negligence, rashness is a graver offence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 Recently, Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Hue An Li</span> [2014] 4 SLR 661 (“<span class="font-italic">Hue An Li</span>”) also recognised the conceptual difference between rashness and negligence (at [45]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In our judgment, <span class="font-italic">awareness of the potential risks</span> that might arise from one’s conduct ought, in general, to be the dividing line between negligence and rashness. For both negligence and rashness, the offender would have fallen below the requisite objective standard of the reasonable person. The harsher sentencing regime for rashness is justified on the basis that the offender was <span class="font-italic">actually advertent to the potential risks which might arise from his conduct, but proceeded anyway despite such advertence</span>. This is essentially a restatement of the definitions of “rashness” and “negligence” enunciated in <span class="font-italic">Poh Teck Huat</span>, which, in our judgment, remain good law. In short, advertence to risk will <span class="font-italic">generally</span> be an <span class="font-italic">essential</span> element of rashness. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 These pronouncements make it clear that the distinction between rashness and negligence lies in the offender’s knowledge of the risks involved. Although the above pronouncements were made in the context of rashness, it applies equally for the purposes of the present inquiry to the <span class="font-italic">men rea</span> of recklessness as the state of knowledge for both rashness and recklessness is not materially different: see <span class="font-italic">Hue An Li</span> at [46]. When an individual acts rashly or recklessly, he is acting despite being aware of the risks involved, so a custodial sentence is more justifiable as compared to an individual who has no knowledge of such risks when acting negligently. In the context of s 59(1) of the CDSA, an officer of a body corporate would be found to have acted recklessly where he took no active steps despite actually being conscious of the strong likelihood that the body corporate was engaging in activities in contravention of the CDSA. Where he only <span class="font-italic">ought</span> to have been conscious of the likelihood that illegal activities were being perpetrated by the body corporate and did not exercise the caution expected of a person in his position, he would only be responsible for negligence <span class="font-italic">simpliciter</span>.

All he had was a reasonable suspicion that WEL (just like Kassar) might be involved in such illicit activities (see above at [67]–[69]) but he is unlikely to have believed that a strong likelihood existed. However, that does not mean that the Appellant was not negligent because his duty as local resident director obliged him to take steps to inquire into the dubious state of affairs (see above at [70]–[71]).

In this context, it is important to first appreciate the chronology of events that unfolded between the April 2012 to May 2012 in relation to WEL’s account:

Nevertheless, the recall notices are still significant (even if they were in respect of other deposits) because they would have alerted the Appellant to the strong likelihood that WEL was engaging in illicit money laundering activities. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 Based on these notices, the District Judge commented:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">65.  [The Appellant] had testified that he never had any problems with cheques which were wrongly issued, funds recall letter or any issues concerning fraudulent transfers, in all the other companies which he was local director of. Yet, other than acting as a post box ie emailing the scanned copies of the above funds recall letters to Nadia, he did nothing else. Any reasonable person in his position would have been increasingly suspicious with each fund recall notice received. He should have been placed on notice by these red flags. <span class="font-italic">Especially significant was the notice dated 30 Apr 12 where it explicitly made reference to fraud having been committed.</span> But [the Appellant] was not suspicious nor did he make inquiries. He sought to explain his inaction by saying that from experience, it was not unusual to receive funds recall notices although they were few and far in between. Firstly, this contradicted his earlier assertion that he had no such problems with all the other companies which he was a local director of. Secondly, seven funds recall notices in a space of two months was not “few and far in between”. Thirdly, the amounts involved in these seven notices were substantial.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 I agree with the District Judge that the fourth recall notice is a critical one. In my view, the receipt of the fourth recall notice, with its express reference to a fraudulent transaction, must have greatly strengthened the Appellant’s already existing suspicions regarding the companies introduced by Nadia (see above at [67]–[69]). This must have alerted the Appellant to the much higher likelihood of WEL engaging in illegal or fraudulent activities. Despite being aware of these grave risks, the Appellant did not take any appropriate action such as contacting the bank or alerting the authorities to freeze the account. Neither did he act when there was <span class="font-italic">absolute </span><span class="font-italic">silence</span> from Nadia (which would have been worrying to any director in the shoes of the Appellant who receives a notice from a bank of a fraudulent transaction in his company’s bank account) after he scanned and emailed the recall notices as and when he received them.

</div> Thus, despite being conscious of the risks of WEL’s account being used for fraudulent transactions by the time he was aware of the contents of the fourth recall notice, the Appellant still did not do anything differently. In the circumstances, I find such conduct to be reckless. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 This finding of recklessness on the part of the Appellant sometime after the receipt of the fourth recall notice dated 30 April 2012 would have an impact on the sentences for the 4th to 6th charges, since the corresponding fourth to sixth deposits and withdrawals came after the fourth recall notice (see table at [130]). Thus, the starting point of a custodial sentence is applicable to each of these charges. In determining the term of imprisonment, the relevant factors I consider are the quantum of the stolen properties and the Appellant’s level of awareness of the strong likelihood that WEL was engaging in money laundering. Naturally, the Appellant’s recklessness became more and more culpable as the days went by and with the receipt of further recall notices, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the fifth, sixth and seventh recall notices. With respect to the quantum, although the amounts reflected in the CDSA charges were the amounts which had been transferred out, I agree with the District Judge that the relevant quantum to consider would be the corresponding inward illicit deposits.

</div> This is to ensure that the Appellant would only be punished for the transfer of stolen properties deposited in WEL’s account instead of the amounts withdrawn (which also included other funds).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136  Accordingly, I sentence the Appellant to:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) eight months’ imprisonment on the 4th charge (having regard to the significant amount of stolen money, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, US$135,991.88, deposited and transferred out the following day, which was four days after the date of the fourth recall notice); </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) two months’ imprisonment on the 5th charge (having regard to a comparatively smaller amount of stolen money, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, US$28,377.50, deposited and transferred out the following day, which was nine days after the date of the fourth recall notice); and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) ten months’ imprisonment on the 6th charge (having regard to the moderately significant amount of stolen money, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, US$88,997.53, deposited and transferred out three days later, which came after three further recall notices and 28 days after the date of the fourth recall notice). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 I have used the notional maximum of four years’ imprisonment for “recklessness” to assist me in calibrating the appropriate quantum of imprisonment for the 4th to 6th charges to the different extent of culpability in relation to each of these charges.

The Appellant will accordingly be punished with an appropriate fine, even though I have notionally set the maximum imprisonment term for negligent acts to be two years. In ascertaining the quantum of the fine, I similarly take into consideration the amounts of stolen properties in question and the degree of negligence involved. I accordingly substitute the custodial sentences imposed on the Appellant in respect of these charges to a fine of S$10,000 on the 1st charge, S$10,000 on the 2nd charge and S$30,000 on the 3rd charge respectively. The 1st and 2nd charges concern relatively smaller amounts of stolen money and were committed by the Appellant after the first recall notice.  However, the 3rd charge involves a larger amount of stolen money and is for an offence committed after the second recall notice which should have further heightened his awareness to the likelihood of illegality of the banking transactions carried out in WEL’s account. I also note that the third withdrawal took place eight days after the second recall notice such that any active intervention from the Appellant could possibly have thwarted this transaction. For the higher degree of negligence and the larger amount of stolen property involved in the 3rd charge when compared to the 1st and 2nd charges, I impose a higher fine on the Appellant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 Overall, the Appellant’s sentences for the offences under the CDSA  are as follows:</div><table class="table table-sm table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">CDSA charges</span></div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">Sentence</span></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">1st charge</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">S$10,000 (in default (“i/d”) two weeks’ imprisonment)</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">2nd charge</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">S$10,000 (i/d two weeks’ imprisonment)</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">3rd charge</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">S$30,000 (i/d six weeks’ imprisonment)</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">4th charge</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">Eight months’ imprisonment (to run concurrently with the sentence for the 6th charge)</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">5th charge</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">Two months’ imprisonment (to run consecutively with the sentence for the 6th charge) </div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">6th charge </div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">Ten months’ imprisonment</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Misplaced analogy to “individual money mule” cases </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 It leaves me now to briefly comment on the analogy drawn by the District Judge with “individual money mule” cases.

</div>
</div> Individual money mule cases typically involve individuals whose personal bank accounts are used to receive and transfer funds. The transfers are also generally done by the individual themselves with knowledge or reason to believe that they are dealing with laundered funds – thus they are the primary offenders under s 47(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the CDSA. The Appellant, on the other hand, was only a secondary offender due to his negligence/recklessness under s 59(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the CDSA and he did not perform any of the transfers himself. In fact, the Appellant had no authority to close the bank account on his own accord unlike an individual money mule; Sima was the sole authorised signatory of WEL’s account.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 Just because the maximum sentence is the same for both the primary and secondary offenders (see above at [98]) does not mean that the culpability of the two offenders in question is the same.  It cannot have been the intention of the legislators for an individual money mule to have the same culpability as that of a director who was negligent/reckless in the context of his company’s bank accounts. Instead, it might be possible for this analogy to be drawn where the offence is one under s 59(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the CDSA instead, as it then involves the “consent or connivance” of the officer of the company. In stark contrast, the Appellant’s culpability (which is rooted in negligent/reckless failure to act) cannot be likened to the culpability of an individual money mule as it is only predicated on his <span class="font-italic">failure to take </span><span class="font-italic">action</span> and not the taking of any positive action or any other involvement in the offence. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Comparison with the case of Andrew Norman Barrell</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 Before I leave the issue on sentence in relation to the CDSA offences, a comparison should be made with a similar case that was concluded in the State Courts (without endorsing the leniency or otherwise of the sentence imposed in that case). Although the Appellant was the first to be sentenced under s 59(1) of the CDSA, by the time this appeal was heard, Andrew Norman Barrell (“Mr Barrell”) had pleaded guilty and was sentenced on 18 May 2016 to similar charges under the CDSA. Mr Barrell was sentenced to a global term of 24 months’ imprisonment (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, two months lower than the Appellant, as imposed by the District Judge in relation to the CDSA offences). A relative comparison of the culpabilities and the respective sentences received by Mr Barrell and the Appellant (as imposed by the District Judge) lends support to my decision to allow the Appellant’s appeal against sentence for the CDSA offences, although I note that Mr Barrell had pleaded guilty, which was a mitigating factor in his favour, while the Appellant had claimed trial. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 Mr Barrell was a director of the company known as SGS Consulting Pte Ltd (“SGS”). SGS was set up by Mr Barrell and he was the sole shareholder and <span class="font-italic">signatory</span> of SGS’s corporate bank account. Mr Barrell was introduced to one Graham Robert Etson (“Graham”), who sought the former’s assistance to set up businesses in Asia. Graham claimed to be working for a Spanish company known as “First Global Indemnity SI” (“FGI”). After some discussion, Mr Barrell reached an agreement with Graham, whereby Mr Barrell would set up a company in Singapore, which would enter into a contract with FGI (represented by Graham). Under this contract (a consulting agreement), SGS would:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) provide consulting services to FGI for the setting up of companies in Asia; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) receive funds from FGI and hold them on trust for FGI and (1) use the funds to cover any cost incurred by SGS in setting up companies for FGI; and (2) transfer the remainder as capital to these companies which were set up by FGI in Asia.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 For these two services, SGS would be paid a monthly fee calculated at 6% of the money which was being held on trust for FGI. Mr Barrell admitted that the service of holding funds on trust for FGI constituted 80–90% of the work done by SGS for FGI. Subsequently, numerous fraudulent payments were remitted by individuals to SGS’s corporate bank account, which was then transferred by Mr Barrell to Graham, despite having reason to believe that the funds received were stolen properties. In total, SGS had transferred approximately S$582,000 of stolen monies (which was more than the amount of US$321,954.51 (S$403,867.33)

</div> of fraudulent deposits that were transferred out together with other monies by WEL in the present case) and Mr Barrell had obtained for himself a commission of S$34,150. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 Arising from these facts, Mr Barrell pleaded guilty to 20 charges: 15 counts of transferring the benefits of criminal conduct under s 47(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) punishable under 47(6)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) read with s 59(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the CDSA and five counts of obtaining such benefits under s 47(3) punishable under s 47(6)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the CDSA. He also admitted to 79 other charges under the CDSA, which were taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 From a comparison of the facts in the present case to that involving Mr Barrell, it is immediately clear that Mr Barrell was certainly far more culpable than the Appellant in several ways. First and foremost, the charge faced by Mr Barrell was in relation to s 59(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the CDSA in that the transfers from SGS’s corporate bank accounts were done with the <span class="font-italic">consent</span> of Mr Barrell. In fact, Mr Barrell had performed these transactions <span class="font-italic">himself</span> unlike in the case of the Appellant where the transfers were all done by Sima as the sole signatory of WEL’s account. Second, Mr Barrell had received substantial amounts of financial gain, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, S$34,150, which was directly tied to the amounts of stolen properties SGS received (see above at [122(a)] for its relevance). Whilst the Appellant too has gained financially as a result of his acting as a local resident director for WEL, this benefit was not tied to his commission of the offences. In other words, he would have received the same fixed remuneration irrespective of whether WEL was engaging in any illegal activities and <span class="font-italic">a fortiori</span> irrespective of the quantum of the stolen funds. Third, the aggregate amount of stolen monies being transferred by Mr Barrell was more than the aggregate amount of stolen monies being transferred out of WEL’s account in the present case. Fourth, Mr Barrell was convicted of a far larger number of charges than the Appellant and 13 different victims were involved as compared to six victims in the present case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 Despite this marked difference in culpabilities, Mr Barrell received a lower custodial sentence than the Appellant. Whilst I acknowledge that Mr Barrell had pleaded guilty unlike the Appellant, that fact alone cannot possibly reduce Mr Barrell’s sentence by such a significant proportion. This is especially on account of the different maximum custodial sentence of ten years for the “consent” limb (under which Mr Barrell was charged) as opposed to the notional maximum custodial sentence for the reckless <span class="font-italic">mens rea</span> under the “neglect” limb, which I have set at four years as a guide for the purpose of sentencing under this less culpable limb. This is a further reason why I find that the sentences imposed by the District Judge on the Appellant for the CDSA offences are manifestly excessive, warranting appellate intervention. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">CA offence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 Turning to consider the Appellant’s appeal against sentence in relation to the CA offence, the District Judge determined that the custodial threshold had been crossed on the basis that the present case raised serious public policy considerations in affecting the wider financial system as a whole.

</div> First, the culpability of an offender, who does not breach the duty to exercise reasonable diligence intentionally, knowingly or recklessly, does not <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>warrant a custodial sentence. Second, the deterrence rationale resonates with less force when an offence is not committed intentionally, knowingly or recklessly. Third, considering the full range of sanctions at the courts’ disposal, a custodial sentence should <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>be reserved only for higher levels of an offender’s culpability. I broadly agree with Mr Foo on all three of these reasons and I shall briefly explain why. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">157 On the first reason, I have already elaborated on this at [114]–[120] in the context of the CDSA offences. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 The second reason speaks directly to one of the twin rationales under the CA, that of deterrence and its limited relevance in the case of a purely negligent breach of a directors’ duties. In a related vein, I find helpful the observations made by V K Rajah J (as he then was) in <span class="font-italic">Angliss </span><span class="font-italic">Singapore Pte Ltd v Public Prosecutor </span>[2006] 4 SLR(R) 653:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">29 I am conscious that s 88A of the [Administration of Muslim Law Act (Cap 3, 1999 Rev Ed)] is enacted as a strict liability offence.

In reality, meting out a sentence near the maximum allowable under the statute for an offence that barely even approximates the “worst type of cases falling within the prohibition” (<span class="font-italic">Bensegger v R</span> [1979] WAR 65, referred to in <span class="font-italic">Sim Gek Yong</span> at [12]-[13]) is <span class="font-italic">more likely to diminish rather than enhance any general deterrent value</span>.<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>If the difference in penalty between a serious and minor<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>breach of an offence is only marginal, it reduces the incentive (or<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>disincentive) to refrain from committing the more egregious offence.<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>In any event, even where general deterrence is applied as a sentencing<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>consideration, the principle of proportionality in relation to culpability,<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>the magnitude of the offence committed and the particular statutory scheme of punishment that Parliament has designed should not be<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>papered over in assessing the appropriate sentence for that particular case <span class="font-weight-bold">…</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">159 In a different context, Rajah J (as he then was) also commented as follows in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Law Aik Meng </span>[2007] 2 SLR(R) 814 (at [22]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Specific deterrence is usually appropriate in instances where the crime is premeditated: <span class="font-italic">Tan Fook Sum</span> ... at [18]. This is because deterrence probably works best where there is a <span class="font-italic">conscious </span>choice to commit crimes. Nigel Walker and Nicola Padfield in <span class="font-italic">Sentencing:</span><span class="font-italic"> Theory, Law and Practice</span> (Butterworths, 2nd Ed, 1996) … at p 99 explain the theory of ‘undeterribility’. Pathologically weak self-control, addictions, mental illnesses and compulsions are some of the elements that, if possessed by an offender, may constitute ‘undeterribility’, thus rendering deterrence futile. Such elements seem to involve some form of impulse or inability to make proper choices on the part of the offender, which, by definition, runs counter to the concept of premeditation. It should be pointed out here that this reasoning applies with equal cogency to <span class="font-italic">general</span> deterrence …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">160 These observations should not be interpreted, however, as saying that deterrence has no relevance in the case of negligence – imposing deterrent sentences will undeniably ensure that directors are more careful in the discharge of their duties. Thus, Rajah JA has commented in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v W</span><span class="font-italic">ang Ziyi Able</span> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 1082 in the context of the offence of making false statements under the Securities and Futures Act (Cap 289, 2006 Rev Ed) (at [29]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">... Where, for example, the false statement had been made negligently, <span class="font-italic">deterrence could arguably be a significantly less relevant consideration since the offence would have been committed without any reckless or dishonest intent</span>. That said, <span class="font-italic">in</span><span class="font-italic"> egregious cases, a custodial sentence (in addition to a fine) may be appropriate even when false statements are made negligently</span>. It is in the public interest that all types of irresponsible conduct be deterred through appropriate sanctions. The decision to impose fines in <span class="font-italic">PP v Wong Tai </span>… may be arguably justified on the basis that there<span class="font-italic"> </span>was no “intent” or “recklessness”, though I must confess to<span class="font-italic"> </span>entertaining serious reservations about the appropriateness of purely<span class="font-italic"> </span>pecuniary punishment in that case. Where materially false<span class="font-italic"> </span>information is disseminated with dishonest intent to induce other<span class="font-italic"> </span>persons to purchase or sell shares, a custodial sentence should (in<span class="font-italic"> </span>combination with fines) almost inevitably be imposed. This would<span class="font-italic"> </span>better address and redress the differing degrees of culpability in a<span class="font-italic"> </span>range of offences, serving to deter the appropriate class of<span class="font-italic"> </span>potential offenders without being excessively harsh to the<span class="font-italic"> </span>particular offender being convicted and sentenced.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">161 Thus, in appropriate cases, deterrence can still be relevant in the case of purely negligent actions where for instance, there are sufficient aggravating factors. Generally speaking, however, in view of the second rationale of not hampering commerce through over-criminalisation, deterrence ought to be given <span class="font-italic">lesser</span> importance in the case of purely negligent breaches of directors’ duties as compared to intentional, knowing or reckless breaches. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">162 The final reason is that custodial sentences should primarily<span class="font-italic"> </span>be reserved for intentional, knowing or reckless breaches because the courts have at their disposal other appropriate sanctions to deter purely negligent breaches of the duty to exercise reasonable diligence. In ascertaining the custodial threshold, this is a relevant consideration as it is possible that other available sanctions might be better suited or would be sufficient to achieve the goal of realising the intended principles of sentencing, whether it be deterrence, rehabilitation, prevention or retribution.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">163 This analysis is particularly significant in the case of a breach of directors’ duties under s 157(1) of the CA because a director potentially stands to face the following possible sanctions:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) termination of directorship by the company;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) civil liability and damages;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) criminal conviction;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) fine;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) disqualification order; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) imprisonment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">164 I do not need to belabour the point any further by going through the deterrent effect of each of these types of punishment except to make just two observations. First, I agree with the Appellant that the threat of a lengthy disqualification order under s 154(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the CA is likely to deter directors from failing in their duties of reasonable diligence (see <span class="font-italic">Ong Chow Hong</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [24]).

</div> However, in a situation where an offender's culpability <span class="font-italic">does not justify </span>a custodial sentence but warrants a fine higher than S$5,000 (if that were legislatively possible), it does not follow that the courts should automatically proceed, in the aim of achieving deterrence, to impose a custodial sentence. Indeed, where there is a gulf between the maximum statutory fine and the custodial sentence, the answer is not necessarily to impose a custodial sentence (in breach of the principle of proportionality) but for Parliament to revise the maximum fines (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Ngian Chin Boon v Public Prosecutor </span>[1998] 3 SLR(R) 655 at [16] and <span class="font-italic">Wong Tiew Yong</span><span class="font-italic"> and another v Public Prosecutor </span>[2003] 3 SLR(R) 325 at [66]–[68]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">166 For these reasons, I am of the view that the starting point for purely negligent breaches of the duty to exercise reasonable diligence is a fine (where there are no weighty aggravating factors) with custodial sentences being imposed where the director breaches this duty intentionally, knowingly or recklessly. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Respective maximums under s 157(1) CA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">167 Just as I have suggested the respective maximum terms of imprisonment in relation to the CDSA offences, I briefly propose to suggest the same for the different <span class="font-italic">mens rea</span> contemplated under s 157(1) of the CA.

He was however, recklessly in breach of his duty to exercise reasonable diligence in respect of the fourth, fifth and sixth deposits of stolen monies. However, the CA offence is different from the CDSA offences in that the Appellant’s failure to exercise reasonable diligence in relation to WEL’s receipt of stolen properties is in respect of one <span class="font-italic">single</span> offence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">172 In the circumstances, the single offence had a composite <span class="font-italic">mens rea</span> of both negligence and recklessness. Thus, I have to analyse which is the more predominant <span class="font-italic">mens rea</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>and I do so by analysing the relative quantum of deposits during the periods where the Appellant was negligent <span class="font-italic">simpliciter</span> and reckless respectively. On the present facts, the total deposits amounted to US$321,954.51, of which only US$68,587.60 (21.3%) were deposited when the <span class="font-italic">mens rea</span> of negligence <span class="font-italic">simpliciter</span> applied while 78.7% of the deposits took place when the <span class="font-italic">mens rea</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>of recklessness applied. Thus, the offence in question in relation to the Appellant’s failure to exercise reasonable diligence which resulted in WEL’s receipt of stolen properties is predominantly tainted with the <span class="font-italic">mens rea</span> of recklessness. Accordingly, sufficient grounds exist for me to hold that the custodial threshold is crossed. In the circumstances, I do not find the District Judge’s imposition of a short custodial sentence of four weeks to be manifestly excessive. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on the Appellant’s global sentence </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">173 I order the custodial sentences for the 5th and 6th charges under CDSA to run consecutively.

</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">179 Accordingly, the primary issue on this aspect of the appeal is whether the Appellant’s defence was conducted extravagantly and unnecessarily. Having considered the parties’ submissions and the notes of evidence of the trial that transpired below, I find that the District Judge ought not to have made the costs order because the requisite threshold for the imposition of costs on the Appellant is not satisfied. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The law on costs orders to the Prosecution</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">180 As a starting point, costs to the Prosecution are awarded only in the most exceptional of circumstances so as to ensure that accused persons can conduct their defence without the fear of a costs sanction. The rationale for typically eschewing costs orders in criminal proceedings was explained by Tan Siong Thye JC (as he then was) in <span class="font-italic">Arun Kaliamurthy</span><span class="font-italic"> and others v Public Prosecutor and another matter </span>[2014] 3 SLR 1023:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">17 … in criminal proceedings, costs orders are <span class="font-italic">usually not made</span>. Costs orders against the defence (“the Defence”) or the Prosecution are made only in very limited circumstances and are not premised upon who is the successful litigant. … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">18 The reason behind limiting ground for the award of costs in criminal proceedings is the public interest element in criminal litigation. … [T]he Defence acting honestly and reasonably must be encouraged to advance the cause of justice <span class="font-italic">without fear of financial prejudice</span>. Both the Prosecution and the Defence are discharging public functions in the interests of justice by securing convictions and acquittals of criminals and innocents respectively. Neither should be deterred from performing such public functions out of fear of a likely adverse costs order. As a result, adverse costs orders are only provided for in limited circumstances.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">181 In line with this high threshold, it is trite that the law does not compel an accused to plead guilty where the case for claiming trial would be a weak one. Every accused person has a right to claim trial and put the Prosecution to strict proof of his guilt even where the Prosecution has a strong case (<span class="font-italic">Jasbir Kaur v Mukhtiar Singh</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[1999] 1 SLR(R) 616 (“<span class="font-italic">Jasbir Kaur</span>”) at [39]). In a case where the Prosecution has an exceptionally strong case, the consequence may be that the accused may not be given the ordinary discount in sentence associated with pleading guilty but it should not, without more, be considered to be “an extravagant and unnecessary” conduct of the defence to expect the Prosecution to prove its case, warranting the imposition of a costs order (see <span class="font-italic">Jasbir Kaur</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [39]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">182 I also find helpful the observations made by the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Abex </span><span class="font-italic">Centre Pte Ltd v Public Prosecutor</span> [2000] 1 SLR(R) 598 in relation to s 401(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed), which was the predecessor to the current s 355(1) of the CPC and which did not provide for the unitary test of “extravagant and unnecessary” conduct: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">13  The principle governing the exercise of the court’s discretion under s 401(1) of the CPC was enunciated by this court in <span class="font-italic">Oh Cheng Hai v Ong</span> <span class="font-italic">Yong Yew </span>[1993] 3 SLR(R) 257 and affirmed in the recent case of <span class="font-italic">Arts Niche</span> <span class="font-italic">Cyber Distribution Pte Ltd v PP </span>[1999] 2 SLR(R) 936. The principle warrants repetition here. In <span class="font-italic">Arts Niche Distribution Pte Ltd v PP</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>… , it was said:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The court has a wide discretion to order costs under this section [s 401(1) of the CPC]. In exercising its discretion, the court is entitled to take all the circumstances into account, including the strength of the Prosecution’s case, the accused’s knowledge of this, and his conduct of his defence. In particular, where the accused loses his case and the court is of the view that his defence has been conducted ‘extravagantly and unnecessarily’, he may be ordered to pay some of the costs which he has caused the Prosecution to incur (<span class="font-italic">Oh Cheng Hai v Ong Yong Yew</span> [1993] 3 SLR(R) 257 at [28]). One way of determining whether the accused’s defence has been conducted ‘extravagantly and unnecessarily’ would be to consider whether the line of defence mounted has advanced his case: <span class="font-italic">Jasbir Kaur v Mukhtiar Singh </span>[1999] 1 SLR(R) 616. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">15  It should be emphasised that although the strength of the defence, whether at trial or on appeal, is a relevant factor to be considered by the court in awarding costs, it is by no means conclusive. The important test is whether the accused had conducted his defence or appeal “extravagantly and unnecessarily”. In applying this test, the facts of the case, the strength of the defence and course of conduct of the defence must be closely scrutinised.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Did the Appellant conduct his defence extravagantly or unnecessarily? </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">183 Applying these principles to the facts of this case, I do not find that the Appellant had conducted his defence extravagantly or unnecessarily. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Appellant’s concession in the CFD</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">184 Whilst I agree with the District Judge’s observation that the Appellant’s CFD did not expressly dispute the fact that the monies were stolen properties,

</div> it would have been inconsistent for him to admit to the fact that WEL was indeed involved in criminal activities. Given the way he had run his defence, he could not possibly have agreed to a fact which he had no knowledge of.  Accordingly, the Appellant’s conduct in not conceding that the moneys were in fact stolen properties and in requiring the Prosecution to prove that fact cannot in my view be regarded as extravagant or unnecessary. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Relevance of irrelevant cross-examination</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">190 In granting the costs order, the District Judge also took into account the irrelevant cross-examination conducted by Mr Dilip Kumar (“Mr Kumar”), the Appellant’s then counsel at the trial below, in relation to the victims of the stolen properties. After perusing the notes of evidence below, I accept the finding that the cross-examination by Mr Kumar did not particularly challenge the issue as to whether the funds transferred by the victims constituted “stolen properties” for the purposes of s 411 of the Penal Code. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">191 In my view, however, the cross-examination by Mr Kumar cannot be said to be extravagantly protracted or completely unnecessary. He spent an average of less than five minutes in the cross-examination of four of the victims, with the longest cross-examination lasting only seven minutes.

</div>
</div>
</div> Having said that, I acknowledge that these were not the issues for which these witnesses were called to testify. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">192  However, somewhat ironically, what I would consider to be an unnecessary conduct of defence would be if Mr Kumar had persisted in cross-examining the witnesses at length on the issue of “stolen properties” despite the strength of their testimony. After the examination-in-chief of a witness, where there is no inherent or credible weakness disclosed in the testimony, it will generally be completely unnecessary to undertake an extensive and lengthy cross-examination of the witness. Indeed, it will be artificial and counter-intuitive to expect the defence counsel to subsequently cross-examine at length on the relevant issue, just so as to avoid incurring costs payable to the other side.  Thus, I am of the view that whilst it is the right of every accused person to hear all the incriminating evidence against him, the cross-examination of the witness should be waived or kept brief when the accused person is in no position to dispute the evidence and is merely putting the Prosecution to strict proof. Otherwise, the accused may run the risk of having costs awarded against him under s 355(1) of the CPC. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">193 Further, the present case is very different from the previous cases where such costs have been awarded. For instance, in the private prosecution case of <span class="font-italic">Oh Cheng Hai v Ong Yong Yew </span>[1993] 3 SLR(R) 257 (“<span class="font-italic">Oh Cheng Hai</span>”), the High Court upheld the trial judge’s order of costs on the basis that “the defence had persisted in challenging peripheral issues and the genuineness of each exhibit, the latter causing ultimately an expert witness to be sent from Japan in spite of the fact that the defence was innocent possession” (at [27]). Thus, the court upheld the costs order because the defence’s case had almost nothing to do with its persistent challenge against the genuineness of the exhibits throughout the conduct of proceedings. Similarly, in <span class="font-italic">Arts Niche Cyber Distribution Pte Ltd v P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor</span> [1999] 2 SLR(R) 936, the High Court upheld the trial judge’s order of costs to the Prosecution because it was of the view that the Appellant’s defence was “spurious” (at [55]), “self-contradictory and inherently incredible” (at [51]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">194 In stark contrast, however, the Appellant did not even attempt a defence to begin with on the issue of “stolen properties”: all he asked was for the Prosecution to prove this issue, an important element of the CDSA offences faced by the Appellant. In fact, as I have alluded to earlier, the Appellant had to hear the testimony of the victims as the facts relating to the deposits were not within his personal knowledge. Thus, the present case is unique in that the Appellant could neither confirm nor deny whether the monies were stolen properties; the Prosecution had to prove this without an admission from him. The Appellant also cannot be said to have been aware of the strength of the Prosecution’s case before the victims testified (a relevant consideration in exercising the discretion to award costs to the Prosecution: <span class="font-italic">Oh Cheng Hai</span> at [28]). Furthermore, on the facts of this case, after the victims had testified, the Appellant no longer pursued any arguments at the trial below relating to the issue of “stolen properties” and was content to defend his conviction on the other elements.

</div>
</div>
</div> In the overall analysis, I thus find that the Appellant’s defence was neither conducted extravagantly nor unnecessarily. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">195 For these reasons, I allow the Appellant’s appeal against the imposition of the costs order granted by the District Judge. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">196 For the reasons I have stated, I dismiss the Appellant’s appeal against conviction but allow in part his appeal against sentence. I will reduce his sentence to an aggregate term of imprisonment of 12 months and impose an additional fine of S$50,000 (i/d ten weeks’ imprisonment). I also allow the Appellant’s appeal against the costs order. The disqualification order granted by the District Judge is to remain. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">197 At the end of the day, I have some sympathies for the Appellant, as he can be said to be in some sense a “victim” of the offences masterminded by Nadia and the clients she introduced. But it must not be forgotten that he got himself into this position owing to his gross neglect and recklessness in the discharge of his duties as a director of WEL. He has to bear the consequences for his actions. This case serves as a timely reminder that local resident directors must be vigilant as they go about providing their services to their clients as non-executive directors. Local resident directors do have important responsibilities and duties which they must discharge with reasonable due diligence.  </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Chan Seng Onn<br/>Judge</div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right"> Hamidul Haq, Muslim Albakri and Ho Jun Yi (Rajah &amp;
