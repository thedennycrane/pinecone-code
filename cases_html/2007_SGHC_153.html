<p class="Judg-author" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Kan Ting Chiu J:</font></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Background</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">1       This action has its origins in a US$100m Bridging Loan the first defendant, Deutsche Bank AG (“Deutsche Bank”) made to PT Asminco Bara Utama (“Asminco”), an Indonesian company, pursuant to a Bridge Facility Agreement dated 24 October 1997.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">2       The plaintiff, Beckkett Pte Ltd (“Beckkett”) is an investment-holding company incorporated in Singapore. Prior to February 2002, Beckkett owned approximately 74.2% of the issued share capital of an Indonesian company, PT Swabara Mining and Energy (“SME”). SME in turn owned 99.9% of the shares of Asminco.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">3       Prior to December 1997, Asminco owned 15% of the issued share capital of PT Adaro Indonesia (“Adaro”), which owned a coal mine in Kalimantan. At that time, Asminco also owned 20% of the issued share capital of PT Indonesia Bulk Terminal (“IBT”), which operated a bulk terminal which served Adaro’s mine. Beckkett, SME, Asminco, Adaro and IBT are referred to collectively as the Swabara Group of companies. Adaro’s coal mine in Kalimantan, which produces a low-ash, low-energy coal known as “Envirocoal”, was the “crown jewel” of the Swabara Group. Adaro and IBT are Indonesian companies.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">4       In 1997, Asminco had the opportunity to acquire a further 25% of the issued share capital of Adaro and 20% of the issued share capital of IBT for US$100m. Asminco was anxious to acquire the additional shares in these two companies, but it lacked the finances for that. It obtained a Bridging Loan of US$100m from Deutsche Bank under a Bridge Facility Agreement which was to be repaid in six months. Beckkett agreed to guarantee the punctual repayment of the Bridging Loan, and pledged all its shares in SME as security under a share pledge agreement governed by Indonesian law. SME and Asminco also provided security for the Bridging Loan. SME executed a guarantee in favour of Deutsche Bank and pledged all the shares it held in Asminco, while Asminco pledged all the shares it held in Adaro and IBT. (All the shares pledged will be referred to collectively as “the Pledged Shares”). With the funds from the Bridging Loan, Asminco acquired the additional shares in Adaro and IBT and became the holder of 40% of the issued shares of these two companies in December 1997.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">5       The original intention was that the Bridging Loan was to be a short-term facility which was to be replaced by long-term financing that was to be structured, but that did not materialise. By August 1998, Asminco was in default on the repayment of the Bridging Loan. Various proposals were made for the repayment of the loan, but no repayments were received. After Deutsche Bank was approached by the representatives of the second defendant, PT Dianlia Setyamukti (“DSM”) an Indonesian company, to buy the Pledged Shares, Deutsche Bank entered into a private sale by an agreement (“the share sale agreement”) on 21 November 2001. Deutsche Bank had not put the shares on sale previously, and did not have them valued in contemplation of a sale. Under the agreement, DSM acquired from Deutsche Bank all the Pledged Shares together with an assignment of all its rights under Beckkett’s guarantee and the Bridging Loan for a total consideration of US$46m. This agreement was governed by the laws of Singapore. When the sale was completed, the Adaro and IBT shares were transferred to DSM, and the SME shares and Asminco shares transferred to two nominees of DSM, namely PT Mulhendi Sentosa (“Mulhendi”) and PT Akabiluru (“Akabiluru”) respectively, but nothing turned on this.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">6       Beckkett did not receive notice of the sale from Deutsche Bank until it received a letter from Deutsche Bank’s Indonesian lawyers on 18 February 2002 informing it that Deutsche Bank had sold the pledged SME shares for US$800,000. That was followed on 14 March 2002 by a letter from Deutsche Bank’s Singapore solicitors demanding payment under the guarantee for payment of US$86,888,969.31 said to be owing by Asminco to Deutsche Bank as at 21 February 2002.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">7       Beckkett regarded the US$46m price for the Pledged Shares to be a gross undervalue. It drew support from documents discovered from Deutsche Bank including:</font></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(a)    internal valuation undertaken by Deutsche Capital Singapore for Deutsche Bank which put the price of Adaro and IBT as at August 1999 at US$689.3m;</font></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(b)    an offer from AG Rheinbraun (a reputable German company) made in October 1999 to purchase majority interests in Adaro and IBT on the basis that the combined enterprise value of the two companies was US$650m, with an indication that the figure could be increased by up to US$50m;</font></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(c)    an internal memo of Deutsche Bank dated 19 November 1999 with an attachment of a combined discounted cash flow enterprise (equity plus debt) valuation of Adaro and IBT at between US$568m and US $1,060m;</font><a href="#_ftn1" id="_ftnref1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 1]</font></span></span></a> and</p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(d)    a combined discounted cash flow valuation dated 28 December 2000 of the enterprise value of Adaro and IBT at US$785m and equity value at US$666.8m.</font><a href="#_ftn2" id="_ftnref2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 2]</font></span></span></a></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Its sense of grievance must have intensified when it learnt in January 2005 of a pending US$950m leveraged buy-out of Adaro and IBT by an international consortium.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Beckkett’s action</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">8       Instead of paying the outstanding loan, Beckkett sued Deutsche Bank and DSM. The action was initially taken out on 27 April 2004 against Deutsche Bank alone, and DSM was joined as the second defendant on 28 February 2005.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">9       Beckkett claimed that Deutsche Bank owed duties to it as pledgee/mortgagee of the SME shares and, as the creditor of the Bridging Loan secured by the guarantee executed by Beckkett, a duty to exercise its power of sale over the Pledged Shares by taking reasonable care to obtain a true value for the shares or to obtain the best price possible for them.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">10     Beckkett’s case against Deutsche Bank was that it failed:</font></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(a)    to obtain a proper and independent valuation of the Pledged Shares before selling them,</font></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(b)    to take any steps to seek alternative bids or publicise the sale of the Pledged Shares, and</font></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(c)    to use its power of sale for proper purposes and to act in good faith.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">11     Beckkett alleged that Deutsche Bank, as creditor under the Bridging Loan secured by the guarantee, was under a duty to Beckkett:</font></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(a)    to use its duties of sale of the Pledged Shares for proper purposes and in good faith,</font></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(b)    to take reasonable care to obtain the true values of the Pledged Shares by holding an auction or taking steps to obtain the best price obtainable when it exercised its power of sale over the Pledged Shares, and</font></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(c)    not to impair the value of the Pledged Shares.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">12     Beckkett alleged that Deutsche Bank had failed in its duties as a pledgee/mortgagee and as creditor in that it failed:</font></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(a)    to obtain proper valuations of the Pledged Shares before entering into an agreement to sell the Pledged Shares,</font></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(b)    to take any step to seek alternative bids for the shares or to properly publicise the sale, and</font></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(c)    to use its power of sale for proper purposes and in good faith.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">13     Beckkett alleged that the sale of the Pledged Shares by Deutsche Bank to DSM and its nominees was carried out in pursuance of a conspiracy between Deutsche Bank and DSM by unlawful means and/or with the predominant purpose to injure Beckkett by Deutsche Bank selling to DSM the Pledged Shares at an undervalue, and thereafter, to wind up Beckkett.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">14     The remedies Beckkett sought in this action were:</font></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(a)    a declaration that the sales of the Pledged Shares pursuant to the share sale agreement are invalid, null and void and that it be set aside,</font></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(b)    a declaration that the equity of redemption over the Pledged Shares be restored to Beckkett, SME and Asminco,</font></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(c)    an order that Deutsche Bank and DSM return the Pledged Shares to Beckkett, SME and Asminco and restore their percentage shareholdings in SME, Asminco, Adaro and IBT, and</font></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(d)    damages to be assessed.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">15     To get a better understanding of the case, we need to look at the make-up of Beckkett. Beckkett was a wholly owned subsidiary of Asian Mining Energy Corporation (“ASMEC”), a company incorporated in Mauritius. ASMEC was owned by three shareholder groups described as:</font></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(a)    the Metropolitan Investment Corporation or Tirtamas Group headed by Hashim Djojohadikusumo, a prominent Indonesian businessman,</font></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(b)    the Unigaruda Masabadi (“RGM”) Group headed by Sukanto Tanoto (“Sukanto”), another prominent Indonesian businessman;</font></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(these two groups, collectively described as the “Shareholder Group”, owned just over 58% of the shares of ASMEC between them), and</font></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(c)    the Management Group comprising persons involved in the management of SME, Asminco, Adaro and IBT, namely:</font></p>
<p class="Judg-3" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(i)     Graeme Robertson, Chairman, CEO and President Director of the Swabara group,</font></p>
<p class="Judg-3" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(ii)   Allan Buckler, Chief Operations Officer/Operations Director and Director of SME, Adaro and IBT,</font></p>
<p class="Judg-3" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(iii)  Terry Smith, Deputy Director of Operations and Commissioner of SME, Adaro and IBT, and</font></p>
<p class="Judg-3" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(iv)   Indra Aman, General Legal Counsel and Director of SME and Adaro and Commissioner of Asminco,</font></p>
<p class="Judg-3" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">which owned the balance of the ASMEC shares through three companies, Indopac Development Corporation Ltd (“Indopac”), Tim Ko Company Ltd (“Tim Ko”) and Jade Age International Corp (“Jade Age”).</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">16     Beckkett alleged that the Management Group had procured DSM to purchase the Pledged Shares from Deutsche Bank and to seek Deutsche Bank to wind up Beckkett with funds provided by DSM to prevent Beckkett from removing the Management Group from the boards of SME, Asminco, Adaro and IBT. Beckkett accused Deutsche Bank of agreeing to take action to wind up Beckkett although it had no legitimate interest in winding up Beckkett as the bank’s credit committee had resolved that the sale of the Pledged Shares was in full and final settlement of Asminco’s loan. (It was not made clear whether this resolution was binding and enforceable against Deutsche Bank, or whether it was a unilateral position adopted by Deutsche Bank.)</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">17     Beckkett contended that the sale agreement was invalid and void as its performance was unlawful under the laws of Indonesia, where the sale and purchase took place.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">18     On the basis of these assertions, Beckkett sought:</font></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(a)    a declaration that the sale agreement was invalid, null and void and that it be set aside,</font></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(b)    a declaration that the equity of redemption over the Pledged Shares be restored to Beckkett, SME and Asminco, or</font></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(c)    damages.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">The alleged involvement of the Management Group</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">19     Beckkett’s action against Deutsche Bank and DSM made reference to the Management Group. It was alleged that members of the group, namely Allan Buckler, Terry Smith and Indra Aman “participated in the negotiations and/or assisted” DSM in the purchase of the Pledged Shares from Deutsche Bank. Beckkett alleged that Deutsche Bank knew or ought to have known that by so doing these three persons were acting improperly and in breach of their duties to their companies.</font><a href="#_ftn3" id="_ftnref3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 3]</font></span></span></a></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">20     Beckkett also alleged that these three persons were using DSM as their corporate vehicle to purchase the Pledged Shares and that Deutsche Bank knew or should have known that.</font><a href="#_ftn4" id="_ftnref4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 4]</font></span></span></a></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Deutsche Bank’s defence and counterclaim</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">21     Deutsche Bank pleaded that after the loan was disbursed, Asminco defaulted on its repayments. Negotiations were held, but there was no resolution and Asminco remained in default.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">22     After the failure of the negotiations, Deutsche Bank received two unsolicited offers from third parties in 2001 to purchase the Pledged Shares. These offers, which were of less than US$46m, were rejected.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">23     Between September and November 2001, Deutsche Bank entered into negotiations with DSM following an unsolicited offer from DSM which led to an agreement in writing dated 21 November 2001 for DSM to purchase the Pledged Shares for US$46m. Deutsche Bank was not forthcoming in the discovery of documents. This led to repeated applications to the court for discovery, and when the orders were made, the discovery made was disappointing. No correspondence, memoranda, contact reports or discussions were produced by Deutsche Bank. Deutsche Bank’s case was that all the negotiations had been conducted orally, with no written notes or memoranda of those oral negotiations made or kept. The bank acknowledged that no valuation of the Pledged Shares was undertaken in preparation for the sale to DSM. DSM was similarly unhelpful on the ground that its records were damaged or lost.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">24     The sale agreement provided <i>inter alia</i> that:</font></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(a)    Deutsche Bank was to petition to the Jakarta court to obtain rulings on the legal issues concerning the enforcement of the banks’ rights, and that the petition was to be “a unilateral application and no other party is to be made a party to the action”, and</font></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(b)    DSM was to provide a valuation certificate supporting the purchase price of US$46m.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Ultimately, the Adaro and IBT shares were transferred to DSM, the SME shares were transferred to Mulhendi, and the Asminco shares to Akabiluru.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">25     On 16 January 2002, after the share sale agreement was signed, DSM, the purchaser, obtained a valuation on the Pledged Shares from Zulfikri &amp; Co, a firm of registered public accountants in Indonesia, that as at 31 December 2000:</font></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(a)    the value of the SME shares was negative;</font></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(b)    the value of the Adaro shares was US$37,999,242;</font></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(c)    the value of the Asminco shares was negative; and</font></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(d)    the value of the IBT shares was negative.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">26     On 11 December 2001, Deutsche Bank obtained a ruling from the District Court of South Jakarta that Deutsche Bank had the right and authority to sell all the SME shares pledged by Beckkett privately without going through a public auction. (Similar court rulings were also obtained by Deutsche Bank for the sale of the rest of the Pledged Shares).</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">27     On the strength of the Order of Court of 11 December 2001, Deutsche Bank entered into an agreement on 15 February 2002 with Mulhendi for the sale of Beckkett’s Pledged Shares in SME to Mulhendi for US$800,000, and on 19 February 2002, the sale was confirmed by the District Court of South Jakarta to be legal and in compliance with the law.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">28     On 21 February 2002, Deutsche Bank informed Asminco of the sale of the Pledged Shares and demanded payment of the balance of US$86,888,969.31. On 14 March 2002, Allen &amp; Gledhill, Deutsche Bank’s solicitors in Singapore wrote to Beckkett to demand payment of the US$86,888,969.31 under the terms of the guarantee it had given in respect of the Bridging Loan.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">29     Deutsche Bank’s defence was a denial of all of Beckkett’s allegations, and an assertion that in any event, Beckkett was not entitled to claim for any loss or damage which is reflective of the loss or damage suffered by SME, Asminco, Adaro and IBT. Further, Deutsche Bank counterclaimed against Beckkett as guarantor of the Bridging Loan of US$98,223,142.55 due and owing under that loan as at 28 May 2004.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">30     Deutsche Bank filed affidavits of evidence-in-chief of 14 persons who were expected to be its witnesses. Those persons were not called as witnesses. After Beckkett had called its witnesses and closed its case, Deutsche Bank elected not to enter its defence. It did not call any witnesses, although its counsel remained and participated in the proceedings when DSM called its witnesses.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">DSM’s defence</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">31     In its defence, DSM set out the payments made to Deutsche Bank for the Pledged Shares:</font></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(a)    US$800,000 for the SME shares which were transferred to Mulhendi as nominee for DSM,</font></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(b)    US$100 for the Asminco shares which were transferred to Akabiluru as nominee for DSM,</font></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(c)    US$44.2m for the Adaro shares which were transferred to DSM, and</font></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(d)    US$1m for the IBT shares which were transferred to DSM.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(These four sums add up to US$46,000,100, but there was no issue over the US$100 discrepancy.)</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">32     DSM pleaded that its purchase and transfer of the Pledged Shares were in accordance with advice from an Indonesian law firm Adams &amp; Co.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Beckkett’s defence to Deutsche Bank’s counterclaim</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">33     Beckkett denied the counterclaim. It disputed that there was a breakdown in the negotiations on 27 June 2001. More importantly, it disputed the legality of the sale of the Pledged Shares to DSM on the ground that the orders of the South Jakarta District Court:</font></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(a)    did not sanction the Zulfikri valuations or the sale price of the Pledged Shares,</font></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(b)    were not binding on Beckkett as they were obtained without notice to Beckkett, and</font></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(c)    were obtained without disclosure of the sale agreement between Deutsche Bank and DSM, coupled with the fact that the sale price was determined before the Zulfikri valuations were obtained.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Beckkett asserted that if Deutsche Bank had taken reasonable care in selling the Pledged Shares, the proceeds from the sale would have exceeded the amount outstanding under the Bridging Loan.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Beckkett’s case against Deutsche Bank as mortgagee</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">34     Beckkett’s main complaints were that:</font></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(a)    Deutsche Bank should have obtained independent valuations of the Pledged Shares,</font></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(b)    Deutsche Bank should have put the Pledged Shares on sale in a more open manner than it had done, and</font></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(c)    Deutsche Bank did not sell the Pledged Shares for proper purpose and in good faith.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">35     Beckkett made these complaints on the basis that a mortgagee exercising a power of sale has a duty to act in good faith and to take reasonable care to obtain the true market value or the proper price for the property. It relied on the Court of Appeal’s decision in <i>Lee Nyet Khiong v Lee Nyet Yun Janet</i> <nobr>[1997] 2 SLR 713</nobr> (“<i>Lee Nyet Khiong</i>”).</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">36     In <i>Lee Nyet Khiong</i>, the appellant made a loan to the respondent, for which the respondent executed a mortgage of her property in favour of the appellant as security. When the respondent failed to repay the loan, the appellant sold the property. The sale by tender was advertised in The Straits Times for one day. The advertisement only described the location, the land area and that it was a freehold property without giving any other particulars. The tender was to close in two weeks.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">37     The Court of Appeal declared that:</font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">34    It is well settled that a mortgagee, in exercising his power of sale, has a duty to act in good faith and also a duty to take reasonable care to obtain the true market value or the proper price of the mortgaged property at the date on which he decides to sell it. In <i>Cuckmere Brick Co Ltd v Mutual Finance Ltd</i> [1971] Ch 949 at p 966, Salmon LJ said:</font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-2" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">The proposition that the mortgagee owes both duties, in my judgment, represents the true view of the law.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">The first duty was accepted by the mortgagee, and only the second duty was then the issue. Salmon LJ having reviewed the various authorities came to the following conclusion, at pp 968–969:</font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-2" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">I accordingly conclude, both on principle and authority, that a mortgagee in exercising his power of sale does owe a duty to take reasonable precautions to obtain the true market value of the mortgaged property at the date on which he decides to sell it.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns="">This view has been endorsed by the Privy Council in <i>Tse Kwong Lam v Wong Chit Sen</i> [1983] 1 WLR 1349, which was an appeal from Hong Kong Court of Appeal, and has also been accepted by this court: see <i>Ng Mui Mui v Indian Overseas Bank Ltd</i> <a class="remove" href="http://agclwb.agc.gov.sg/main/cases/mlj/%5b1985%5d_MLJ_184.html"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times"><nobr>[1986] 1 MLJ 203</nobr></font></a>; <a class="remove" href="http://agclwb.agc.gov.sg/main/cases/judg/%5b1985%5d_SGCA_10.html"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times"><nobr>[1984-1985] SLR 286</nobr></font></a>, <i>How Seen Ghee v Development Bank of Singapore Ltd</i> <a class="remove" href="http://agclwb.agc.gov.sg/main/cases/judg/%5b1993%5d_SGCA_88.html"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times"><nobr>[1994] 1 SLR 526</nobr></font></a> and <i>Malayan Bank Bhd v Hwang Rose &amp; Ors</i> <nobr>[1997] 2 SLR 1</nobr>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">38     The Court of Appeal found that the appellant had failed to discharge his duty as mortgagee when he sold the property. The Court stated:</font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">37    On the facts of this case, we did not find that the appellant had discharged his duty. We turn first to the ‘efforts’ of the appellant, starting with the advertisement he placed in the newspaper for the sale of the property by tender. First, the advertisement gave but a bare minimum of the description of the property which was woefully inadequate. It set out merely the site or location, the nature of the tenure and the area of the land. It did not provide any information as to the state and condition of the house on the property. More particularly, it omitted to mention, among other things, that the house had recently been extensively renovated, that it is a two-storey bungalow with an attic level and a two-storey annexe building, and that it has a swimming pool, spacious entertainment area, central air-conditioning system and a large built-in area with a floor area of approximately 968 sq m excluding patio, garage, terraces and void areas. These details would have attracted a wider group of potential purchasers, particularly those who were interested in a luxurious lifestyle. There was probably a market for the sale of such property which could have been reached, if the adequate description of the property had been given.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">38    Secondly, the advertisement appeared only once, and the chances of potential purchasers missing the advertisement would be very high. Increasing the number of advertisements would in all probability have attracted a greater number of interested parties.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">39    Thirdly, a short period of only two weeks was allowed for tenders to be submitted. This, in our view, was wholly unreasonable in the circumstances. The property was (and is) worth a large sum of money. A prospective purchaser who is interested in tendering for it would have to make the necessary searches and investigations and organise his finances before embarking upon the purchase of such an expensive property. It is not a decision which can be taken lightly. By allowing only two weeks to receive the tenders, the appellant was further reducing the market for such a property, as some purchasers would not have been able to make such an important decision with such a short period of time.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(These facts compared favourably to the manner in which the Pledged Shares were sold by Deutsche Bank to DSM.)</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">39     Beckkett contended that this duty is not only owed to a mortgagor, but is also owed to a guarantor.   This was made clear in <i>The Bank of East Asia Ltd v Tan Chin Mong Holdings (S) Pte Ltd and Ors</i> <nobr>[2001] 2 SLR 193</nobr> where G P Selvam J stated (at [21]) that “the mortgagee owed the duty not only to the mortgagor but to the surety as well”, and in <i>Beckkett Pte Ltd v Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft Singapore Branch</i> <nobr>[2003] 1 SLR 321</nobr> (at [9]):</font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Where there is a guarantor, the duty extends to him as he has an interest in the sale as he is also liable for the debt remaining after the sale, see <i>Standard Chartered Bank Ltd v Walker</i> [1982] 3 All ER 938 [<i>“Walker”</i>], <i>American Express International Banking Corp v Hurley</i> [1985] 3 All ER 564 [<i>“Hurley”</i>], <i>The Bank of East Asia Ltd v Tan Chin Mong Holdings (S) Pte Ltd</i> <nobr>[2001] 2 SLR 193</nobr>, <i>Goh Chin Soon v Vickers Capital Ltd (formerly known as ST Capital Ltd)</i> <nobr>[2001] 1 SLR 728</nobr> and <i>Bank of Credit and Commerce International SA (Licensed Deposit Takers) v Aboody</i> (30 September 1987, Queen’s Bench Division, unreported).</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">40     In <i>Walker</i>, a decision of the Court of Appeal of England, Lord Denning MR held at 942:</font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">If it should appear that the mortgagee or the receiver have not used reasonable care to realise the assets to the best advantage, then the mortgagor, the company, and the guarantor are entitled in equity to an allowance. They should be given credit for the amount which the sale should have realised if reasonable care had been used. Their indebtedness is to be reduced accordingly.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">41     In <i>Hurley,</i> a decision of the English High Court, Mann J referred to <i>Walker</i> and affirmed at 571 the proposition of law that:</font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">The mortgagee when selling mortgaged property is under a duty to a guarantor of the mortgagor’s debt to take reasonable care in all the circumstances of the case to obtain the true market value of that property.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">In that case, the property mortgaged was specialised sound and lighting equipment used at pop concerts. The mortgagee’s guarantor was dissatisfied with the way in which the receiver sold the equipment. Mann J held at 574:</font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">In my judgment the receiver did not take reasonable care in all the circumstances of the case to obtain the true market value of the equipment. He had in his hands equipment which he knew had been valued at £193,323 and which he knew was of a specialist nature. In regard to the disposal of the equipment he did nothing. Although advised by Edward Symmons Ltd that he should look to the trade the receiver did not do so but was content that the trade should look to him. In my judgment the failure to take reasonable care is manifest in these forms: (i) a failure to take specialist advice from a person in the popular music industry; (ii) a failure to advertise in publications concerning the popular music industry. The receiver is liable in negligence to the guarantor.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(Applying the same reasoning to the present case, particular care should have been taken to get valuations from experts in the coal mining and transportation industry, and to make the availability of the shares known within the industry.)</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">42     There is a more recent decision of the High Court of England in <i>Barclays Bank Plc v Kingston</i> [2006] 2 Ll LR 59 at [16] to [18] where Burnton J stated:</font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">16.  … The duty to take reasonable care to obtain a proper price is owed to the principal debtor (assuming it is he whose asset constitutes the security), since his liability to the creditor should have been reduced by the full value of the security: <i>Cuckmere Brick Co v Mutual Finance</i> [1971] Ch 949.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">17.  A guarantor of the principal debtor’s liabilities is also interested in the security, in two respects. First, before realisation by the creditor, if he pays the amount owed by the principal debtor he will be entitled to the security by way of subrogation to the rights of the creditor. Secondly, his liability, like that of the principal debtor, falls to be extinguished or reduced by the amount realised by the creditor when he realises the security, assuming it to be sufficient. …</font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">18.  <i>It is because of the second of these interests of the guarantor that the creditor owes him, as well as the principal debtor, a duty</i>, if he realises a security for the liabilities of the principal debtor, to do so at a proper price.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[Emphasis added]</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">43     A further issue arose over the private sale of the Pledged Shares. The pledge agreement was governed by Indonesian law. Two articles of the Indonesian Civil Code (“ICC”) are of particular application when a pledgee seeks to sell pledged property, namely Art 1155 and Art 1156.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">44     Article 1155 sets out a pledgee’s general powers of sale:</font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">If the contracting parties do not agree otherwise, then if the debtor or pledgor do [sic] not fulfil his obligation, after the expiration of the agreed time period, or after the issuance of the summon demanding the fulfilment of the agreement in the event there is no specific provision regarding the time period, the creditor is entitled to sell the pledged goods through public auction in accordance with the local customary practices and the common prevailing requirements, with the objective that the debt together with interests and costs can be repaid from the proceeds of such sale.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">If the pledged goods consist of trade goods or securities that can be traded in a public exchange, then the sale can be conducted in such a place through the mediation of two professional brokers that are experts in such field.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">45     This provision does not prevent a pledgee from fulfilling his duties as pledgee as it entitles, but does not compel him to sell the pledged goods in the ways set out in the article.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">46     Article 1156 goes on to provide that:</font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">In any event, if the debtor or the pledgor defaults from its obligations, then the creditor can file a claim through a Court to have the pledged goods sold to repay the debts together with interests and costs in accordance with the procedures to be determined by the Judge, or for the Judge to permit the creditor to retain the pledged goods as a repayment of certain amount which will be determined by the Judge in a decision up to the amount of the debts, together with interests and costs.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">With respect to the transfer of the pledged goods contemplated in this article and the preceding article, the creditor is obliged to notify the pledgor, at the latest, on the next day if post or telegraph services are available every day, or, if it is not the case, with the next shipment of post. Notice sent by way of telegraph or registered mail shall be deemed to be an appropriate notice.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">But it is not a mandatory provision. It is there to be used, but a pledgee/vendor is not required to use it for every sale. It only enables the pledgee to apply to court for permission to sell the pledged property through other methods of sale if the pledgee chooses to do that.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">47     The official text of the ICC is the original Dutch text. There are published Bahasa Indonesia versions of the ICC and commentaries by distinguished writers which are generally regarded as authoritative, although there are variations in the text of the ICC they each adopted. When counsel referred to these provisions before me, they had to have them translated into English, and the translations they obtained and produced were also not entirely similar. The texts that I have set out were supplied by Beckkett’s witnesses. However, the differences are not material to the issue under consideration.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">48     Issue was taken over the fact that Deutsche Bank had applied for the orders <i>ex parte</i>, without notice to Beckkett. Beckkett contended that an application to the court under Art 1156 should be for a <i>putusan</i> which is obtained through an <i>ex parte</i> application, rather than a <i>penetapan</i>, which is an order obtained through an <i>inter partes</i> application.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">49     Deutsche Bank had obtained 16 <i>penetapans</i> from the South Jakarta District Court which authorised the bank to dispose of the Pledged Shares through a sale to DSM, Mulhendi and Akabiluru.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">50     Beckkett referred those orders back to the Indonesian courts. It applied to the Jakarta High Court, which issued a <i>penetapan</i> that the earlier orders of the South Jakarta District Court were null and void and were to be withdrawn, and those orders were revoked on 9 March 2005.</font><a href="#_ftn5" id="_ftnref5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 5]</font></span></span></a></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">51     The matter was then taken by Deutsche Bank, DSM, Mulhendi and Akabiluru to the Supreme Court. This resulted in a document dated 3 March 2006, which confirmed the ruling of the High Court. However, Deutsche Bank, DSM, Mulhendi and Akabiluru which brought the matter to the Supreme Court now dispute the status of the document and assert that it is not a decree of the Supreme Court.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">52     Two points should be noted in connection with the court orders. First, as Art 1156 is not a mandatory provision, Deutsche Bank was not compelled by law to obtain permission from the court to sell the Pledged Shares by a private sale. Since it was under a duty as pledgee of the shares to sell the shares in the open market, it should not have applied under Art 1156 for permission to sell the shares in a private sale, and it cannot rely on the orders of the South Jakarta District Court to answer Beckkett’s complaint.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">53     The second point is that as matters stand, the orders of the South Jakarta District Court which authorised the private sales have been revoked by the High Court. There was no issue over the validity of the order of revocation of the High Court. Consequently, whether or not the order of the High Court has been affirmed by a decree of the Supreme Court, the orders of the South Jakarta District Court which authorised the sale of the pledge shares through a private sale no longer exist.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Beckkett’s case on conspiracy</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">54     There was disharmony between the Passive Shareholders and the Management Group which had developed before the sale of the Pledged Shares. The Passive Shareholders felt that they were denied access to the management of the companies, and took action to have a more active role in the companies.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">55     In October 2001, the Passive Shareholders had three of their nominees appointed as directors of ASMEC. Indopac, Tim Ko and Jade Age, the shareholder companies of ASMEC which were controlled by the Management Group tried to obtain a court order to restrain the three directors from taking offices, but they failed to get the order. In November 2001, the Passive Shareholders also succeeded in having two of their nominees appointed to the board of directors of Beckkett to replace two incumbent directors. In November 2001, a shareholder company of SME controlled by Graeme Robertson obtained an injunction from the South Jakarta District Court to prevent SME from convening a meeting to change the board of directors of SME.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">56     Beckkett alleged that “DSM is not an independent third party as they allege, but is in fact a corporate vehicle used by the Management Group to acquire the Pledged Shares.”</font><a href="#_ftn6" id="_ftnref6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 6]</font></span></span></a></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">57     In support of the contention, it pointed out that neither Deutsche Bank nor DSM produced any correspondence, memorandum or contact report on the discussions and negotiations that took place between them.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">58     The documents produced revealed that Indra Aman, the General Legal Counsel and Director of SME and Adaro and Commissioner of Asminco, who did not hold any office in DSM, was actively engaged and took an active role in ensuring that the sale was completed.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">59     In an internal Deutsche Bank email from William Barin to Wolfgang Topp (both senior officers of Deutsche Bank) dated 29 October 2001, reporting on the progress of the sale of the Pledged Shares for US$46m, Indra Aman’s significant role is apparent:</font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">I conveyed to Indra, our agreement to accept USD46mn cash as full and final settlement, on the basis:</font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">- that we can finalise and settle by end of Dec 2001</font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">- DB receives cash up front (within 2 weeks) of USD4mn. I told him that we are prepared to confirm in writing that this amount will be applied towards the final settlement amount.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">- the cost of DB’s external legal counsel are to be borne by the company. I also told him that we would also part [sic] of the USD4mn cash to help fund our legal costs which would then have to be reimbursed at settlement by the company.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">On further enquiry, Indra confirmed that the way that they propose to proceed is for DB to act under its various security and deliver the pledged shares to a vehicle that the company will nominate. Indra mentioned that he envisaged taking legal action first in Singapore under the corporate guarantee and then moving down the security chain after that. But this is something that needs further refinement and consideration by the Company.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Indra said that one of the next steps is he would like to organise a meeting (either in JKT or Singapore) between – Alan, Wolfgang, Asminco’s “backers” in this proposal (he would not say who), he and I to move things forward. He will revert with some proposed dates for the meeting.</font><a href="#_ftn7" id="_ftnref7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 7]</font></span></span></a></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">60     The extent of Indra Aman’s involvement was also shown when as late as 13 November 2001, after Victor Sim Mong Seng (“Sim”), the legal counsel of Deutsche Bank at that time, had prepared a draft agreement</font><a href="#_ftn8" id="_ftnref8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 8]</font></span></span></a> for an unnamed party to provide a fund for the use by Deutsche Bank to enforce the guarantee against Beckkett and to take legal proceedings, which might include liquidation proceedings against Beckkett. Sim sent the draft to Indra Aman because Sim did not know the identity of the unnamed party. The term was incorporated in the share sale agreement signed between Deutsche Bank and DSM on 21 November 2001.<a href="#_ftn9" id="_ftnref9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 9]</font></span></span></a></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">61     Indra Aman’s involvement in the sale of the Pledged Shares was such that Sim emailed him on 22 November 2001, the day after the sale share agreement was signed, expressing his (Sim’s) intention to send a notice of demand to Asminco. In his email, Sim informed Indra Aman:</font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">I propose that DB Singapore send the attached demand letter to Asminco.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">…</font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">The reasons are:</font></p>

<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">He proceeded to give detailed instructions, which are set out in full here as they reveal the extent of Indra Aman’s control over the whole process:</font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">The scenario is basically as follows:</font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">18.01.2002 – Asminco responds to letters from DB as mentioned above. These letters contain monthly statement of overdue principal and unpaid interest plus correspondence on applicable interest rate and request for payment of interest payables. The letters provide Asminco with a reason to respond. The key points in Asminco’s response is as follows: It is unable to pay interest; It is dependent upon dividend flow from Adaro; The loan facility is not supported by a written dividend policy of Adaro; Existing management has fought hard to convince other shareholders to put into place a dividend policy; Existing management’s efforts finally come to fruition with the support of a new shareholder in Adaro (HII); Shareholders of Adaro (MEC, IC, Asminco and HII) have recently decided upon a dividend policy that should give some comfort to DB; Proposes meeting with DB to discuss refinancing or restructure of the debt with the support Asminco shareholders (SME and SBB); States that distributions for IBT may also come in the future.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">19.01.2002- DB responds to letter by proposing 23.01.2002 as the date of the meeting. It is believed that because DB’s letter is merely a response to Asminco’s letter to conduct a “harmless” meeting, Asminco’s management should not be deemed obligated to inform its shareholders of the letter nor the meeting and consequently should not forewarn adverse parties and trigger any preemptive action from them.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">20.01.2002 – Asminco confirms meeting to be held 23.01.2002 at 10:00am at Asminco’s office.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">20.01.2001 – (After receipt of Asminco’s confirmation) DB writes to each of SME and SBB to invite them to the same meeting with Asminco. DB shall specifically state that the invitation arises from Asminco’s letter of 18.01.2002 which is to be attached to the letters of invitation. As you can see in Asminco’s letter of 18.01.2002 both SME and SBB are on purpose specifically mentioned. Management can later argue that it thought the letter of invitation “harmless” due to the fact that Asminco was first to mention them and that DB invited SME and SBB merely to confirm the truth of their support since any subsequent refinancing or restructure of the debt would require approval from both SME and SBB as shareholders of Asminco. SME’s presence on Closing Date is required to set up the calling of an EGM by DSM, and SBB’s presence on Closing Date is required to convene an EGM of Asminco to confirm the transfer of the shares previously owned by SME and to replace all members of the Board of Directors and Commissioners of Asminco so that management control can be ascertained. Asminco’s presence is also crucial as this sets up a basis for confirmation from Asminco that the debt is due and payable and the exact amount of debt outstanding prior to the transfer of shares and after the transfer of shares. The residual amount of debt after the transfer of shares will be used by Singapore counsel to commence litigation against Beckkett to wind it up. A note on the calling of EGM of SME is warranted. Because 10% of SME is owned by Winfield controlled by an adverse party makes convening of an EGM without prior notice (as in the case of Asminco and Adaro explained below) not possible. Following normal procedures in the AoA of SME will take too much time giving opportunity for a preemptive strike action. SME’s presence (unlike in Asminco and Adaro EGMs) is to object to the calling of EGM because in the opinion of SME the transfer of shares in [sic] out of the ordinary. This provides the legal basis for the new shareholder to go to court and obtain special permission to convene an EGM on its own. It is anticipated that this procedure will take approximately 5 days to complete as opposed to the 21 days otherwise required.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">20.01.2001 – DB writes to Adaro and each of its shareholders to invite to a meeting to be held on 23 January 2002 at 1:00pm at Adaro’s office. Asminco’s letter of 18.01.2002 will again be attached to these letters of invitation. By attaching Asminco’s letter to the invitation will provide some logical explanation as to why the shareholders of Adaro have also been invited by DB. It is safe to assume that DB wants to meet with respect to the newly established dividend policy of Adaro and in particular to obtain confirmation from the shareholders that the policy is true and further to obtain a feel from Adaro and its shareholders an indication of the amounts involved. Adaro’s presence is required to make notations of the transfer of shares and to chair the EGM of shareholders requested by the new shareholders. The presence of the shareholders of Adaro is required so that an EGM without prior notice can be convened and a valid and binding resolution can be adopted including among others recognition of the transfer of shares that took place.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">20.01.2001 – DB writes to IBT to invite to a meeting to be held on 23 January 2002 at 2:00pm at IBT’s office. Asminco’s letter of 18.01.2002 will again be attached to the letter of invitation. In light of Asminco’s letter it is believed to be perfectly normal for DB to meet with IBT. IBT’s presence in the meeting on Closing Date is required to set up the calling of an EGM of IBT by DSM (same procedure would apply here as the procedure for the calling of an EGM of SME explained above).</font></p>

<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">67     Deutsche Bank had disclosed in the further and better particulars to its defence that its officers had negotiated with DSM’s representatives (Soeryadjaya on three occasions and Sandiaga Salahuddin Uno (“Uno”) on four occasions) in September-November 2001. This lent weight to Beckkett’s contention that Deutsche Bank knew that DSM was not the real purchaser, as DSM was controlled by Soeryadjaya and Uno, and was not related to Asminco.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">68     There was evidence to support Beckkett’s assertion that DSM might not be the real purchaser of the shares, and that the real purchaser was the party variously described as a key shareholder or certain existing shareholders, and a borrower-related entity. But the evidence did not go as far as to show that the true purchasers were the Management Group.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">69     The manner of financing for the purchase of the Pledged Shares also attracted the attention and criticism of Beckkett. The financier was a bank, Bank Mandiri, but the evidence did not come from the bank. The financial arrangements had to be gathered from the evidence of Soeryadjaya, Uno and Chia Ah Hoo, a director of Adaro.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">70     The broad picture that emerged was that Bank Mandiri was prepared to offer a US$40m loan to DSM in the form of a contract financing loan. For that purpose, it required DSM to enter into a direct coal transportation contract with Adaro, to transport Adaro’s coal (which it had been doing as a sub-contractor), and for Adaro to make a pre-payment of US$40m to DSM. Bank Mandiri was to make a loan to Adaro for Adaro to make the pre-payment.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">71     Under these arrangements, DSM obtained US$40m from Bank Mandiri to buy the shares. It was also able to repay Bank Mandiri with the US$40m pre-payment it received from Adaro under the coal transportation contract. However, the coal transportation contract was novated before it was carried out and no pre-payment was due from Adaro. Nevertheless, the pre-payment was not refunded, but was converted into an interest free loan from Adaro to DSM, leaving Adaro to service its loan from Bank Mandiri.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">72     Counsel for Beckkett was critical of the propriety of these transactions. He pointed out that several documents produced were backdated (and that was not acknowledged until it was detected and brought up by Beckkett’s counsel), and that effectively DSM had bought the Adaro and IBT shares with an interest-free loan from Adaro.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">73     But this was not really relevant to the case. However interesting the funding arrangements may be, they do not relate to issues of conspiracy before me. It was not Beckkett’s case that Deutsche Bank had any knowledge or role in these transactions, or that the transactions between DSM, Bank Mandiri and Adaro formed part of Beckkett’s case of conspiracy between Deutsche Bank and DSM.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Beckkett’s witnesses</font></p>

<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">75     I do not propose to set out these witnesses’ evidence and the disagreements that the defendants have with them. The issue over Art 1156 was simply whether applications should be made <i>ex parte</i> or <i>inter partes</i>. The issue of directors’ duties arose out of the allegation that Allan Buckler, Terry Smith and Indra Aman had breached their duties as directors by participating in or assisting in negotiations for the sale of the shares. As the exact nature of their alleged participation/assistance was not identified and the alleged breaches of duties were not described, there was simply no basis for saying that they had failed to discharge their duties as directors.</font></p>

<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">81     Counsel referred to two decisions of the Privy Council in <i>China and South Sea Bank v Tan Soon Gin George</i> [1990] 1 AC 536 and <i>Downsview Nominees Ltd v First City Corp Ltd</i> [1993] AC 295. In both cases, Lord Templeman did not accept that common law duty of care is imposed on a mortgagee exercising a power of sale. He held in the latter case at 315 that:</font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-AU"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">The general duty of care said to be owed by a mortgagee to subsequent encumbrancers and the mortgagor in negligence is inconsistent with the right of the mortgagee and the duties which the courts applying equitable principles have imposed on the mortgagee. If a mortgagee enters into possession he is liable to account for rent on the basis of wilful default; he must keep mortgage premises in repair; he is liable for waste. Those duties were imposed to ensure that a mortgagee is diligent in discharging his mortgage and returning the property to the mortgagor. If a mortgagee exercises his power of sale in good faith for the purpose of protecting his security, he is not liable to the mortgagor even though he might have obtained a higher price and even though the terms might be regarded as disadvantageous to the mortgagor. <i>Cuckmere Brick Co. Ltd. v. Mutual Finance Ltd.</i> [1971] Ch. 949 is Court of Appeal authority for the proposition that, if the mortgagee decides to sell, he must take reasonable care to obtain a proper price but is no authority for any wider proposition. A receiver exercising his power of sale also owes the same specific duties as the mortgagee. But that apart, the general duty of a receiver and manager appointed by a debenture holder, as defined by Jenkins L.J. in <i>In re B. Johnson &amp; Co. (Builders) Ltd.</i> [1955] Ch. 634, 661, leaves no room for the imposition of a general duty to use reasonable care in dealing with the assets of the company. The duties imposed by equity on a mortgagee and on a receiver and manager would be quite unnecessary if there existed a general duty in negligence to take reasonable care in the exercise of powers and to take reasonable care in dealing with the assets of the mortgagor company.</font><a href="#_ftn29" id="_ftnref29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-AU"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 29]</font></span></span></span></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">85     It appears to me that whether the basis of the duty be the common law or equity, the requirement that the mortgagee has the duty to take reasonable care, as stated by Nourse LJ in <i>AIB Finance v Debtors</i>, is eminently logical and correct, and this was stated in strong terms by Sir Richard Scott VC in <i>Medforth v Black</i> [2000] Ch 86 at 102:</font></p>

I do not, for my part, think it matters one jot whether the duty is expressed as a common law duty or as a duty in equity. The result is the same.

It submitted that:</span></font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">It is correct that prior to making payment under the guarantee, Beckkett is not entitled to do so. However, as stated in O’Donovan &amp; Phillips, [<i>The Modern Contract of Guarantee</i>, Sweet and Maxwell, 2003] (at paragraph [12-336]) “because the guarantor is, upon payment of the principal debt, entitled to be subrogated to all securities and remedies held by the creditor for the debt, the creditor is subject to an equitable duty to preserve these securities and remedies.</font><a href="#_ftn33" id="_ftnref33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 33]</font></span></span></a></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">and also referred to Andrews &amp; Millett’s <i>Law of Guarantees,</i> Sweet and Maxwell, 2000 at [11-018]:</font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">The surety’s right to be subrogated to all the creditor’s rights in respect of the guaranteed debt is traditionally said to arise at the moment he has paid in full all that he must pay to the creditor under the guarantee, unless he has waived the right. In fact, the strict position is that the rights of the surety to the benefit of a security given by the principal arise when the guarantee is entered into, rather than upon payment or performance of the guaranteed obligation. Thus the creditor owes an obligation to the surety to deal with securities in a reasonable and prudent manner, and may discharge the surety if he does not. Pending payment or performance, the surety can (following a demand by the creditor) have the securities marshalled in his favour. However, the surety’s right to enforce the right of subrogation by calling upon the creditor to transfer or assign to him the security to which he has become entitled does not arise until the surety has paid or performed the obligation guaranteed.</font><a href="#_ftn34" id="_ftnref34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 34]</font></span></span></a></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">87     Deutsche Bank as mortgagee owed a duty to Beckkett even if Beckkett did not repay the Bridging Loan. But it also bears remembering that the sale of those shares pledged by other parties would not give Beckkett an independent right of action against Deutsche Bank. Beckkett would suffer no loss or damage from the sale of those shares unless Deutsche Bank claimed against it under the guarantee for the shortfall between the outstanding loan and the sale proceeds. In this case, as Deutsche Bank did make such a claim in its counterclaim, Beckkett can raise in defence to the counterclaim Deutsche Bank’s failure to preserve and deal with those shares in a proper manner.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2" xmlns=""><strong><em><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(b) No breach of duties without undervalue</font></em></strong></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">88     In making this assertion, Deutsche Bank focused on Beckkett’s duties as claimant without considering its own duties as pledgee. Counsel stated:</font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Our primary submission is that all claims against a mortgagee are actionable only upon proof of damage. Proof of undervalue is therefore a necessary element of any claim against a mortgagee. Beckkett’s failure to prove the alleged undervalue is fatal to its entire case in respect of the Bank’s duty as mortgagee.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">In <i>Good Property Land Development Pte Ltd v Societe General</i> <nobr>[1989] SLR 229</nobr>, the learned Justice Chan Sek Keong (as he then was) held [at 237-238] that:</font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-2" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">In my view, the first and primary task of the court is to determine whether the price at which the mortgaged property was sold was the best price reasonably obtainable at the time of sale. It is only after the court has determined that the price was not the best price that the court will go on to decide whether this was due to fraud, bad faith or breach of duty (which, of course, includes negligence) on the part of the mortgagee. If the defendants are able to establish at the trial of the action that they have sold the mortgaged property at the proper price at the time of sale, these allegations must necessarily fall to the ground.</font><a href="#_ftn35" id="_ftnref35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 35]</font></span></span></a></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">89     That was not the effect of the decision. In an earlier part of the judgment Chan J held at 234 that:</font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">The basic question in these proceedings is the extent of the duties of the mortgagee vis-a-vis the mortgagor in exercising his power of sale. It is unnecessary for me to trace the historical development of the law relating to the duties of a mortgagee. As far as this court is concerned, the law is as stated in <i>Cuckmere Brick Co Ltd v Mutual Finance Ltd</i> [1971] Ch 949 where the Court of Appeal decided that a mortgagee had two duties: one to act in good faith and the other ‘to take reasonable precautions to obtain … the true market value of the mortgaged property at the date on which he decides to sell it’: per Salmon LJ at p 966.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Reading the two passages together, the mortgagee must inform itself of the value and the price obtainable for the property before it agrees to sell it to a purchaser. When that is established, then the enquiry moves to determine whether the price actually obtainable is a reasonable price in the circumstances. The onus was on Deutsche Bank as the pledgee/vendor of the shares to show that they were sold properly.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">90     The courts have not construed the law in the manner suggested by Deutsche Bank. One year after <i>Good Property</i> was decided, there was another decision touching on the duties of a mortgagor. In <i>Kian Choon Investments (Pte) Ltd v Societe Generale and Anor</i> <nobr>[1990] SLR 167</nobr>, L P Thean J referred to and affirmed the duties of a vendor-mortgagee set out in <i>Cuckmere</i> and reiterated that “a mortgagee in exercising the power of sale has two duties: the duty to act in good faith and the duty to take reasonable steps to obtain the best price available in the circumstances”. As the duty to obtain the best available price is on Deutsche Bank, it must show that it has discharged that duty.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">91     Counsel took the argument even further, that:</font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">If there is no undervalue, there can be no breach of a mortgagee’s duties.</font><a href="#_ftn36" id="_ftnref36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 36]</font></span></span></a></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">This argument does not stand up under examination. The starting point is that a mortgagee has a duty to act properly when it exercises its right of sale. To discharge that duty, the mortgagee must ensure that it sells the property at a proper price. Before Deutsche Bank agreed to sell the SME shares pledged by Beckkett for US$800,000 in a private sale, it had the duty to ensure that US$800,000 was the proper price for the shares, and that it had selected the proper mode of sale.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">92     Beckkett pleaded that:</font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Further, at the time of the offer from Rheinbraun, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant undertook a comparison of Rheinbraun’s offer with the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant’s own internal valuation of Adaro and IBT. The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant’s own internal enterprise (equity plus debt) valuation of Adaro and IBT ranged from US$568 million to US$1,060 million. From end 1999/early 2000 to end 2001, the macroeconomic and political situation in Indonesia improved, coal prices increased and Adaro’s annual coal production increased from 13.6 million tonnes in 1999 to 17.7 million tonnes in 2001. The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant undertook another internal enterprise (equity plus debt) valuation of Adaro and IBT as at 28 December 2000 which showed a sum of around US$785 million. Yet, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant decided to sell the shares in Adaro and IBT to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant on 21 November 2001 for a fraction of its own valuation of US$785 million in December 2000 and Rheinbraun’s offer of up to US$700 million less than two years earlier. The sale price to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant valued 100% of Adaro and IBT at about US$113 million as compared to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant’s own internal valuation range of US$568 million to US$1,060 million and Rheinbraun’s offer of up to US$700 million less than 2 years earlier, and the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant’s own internal valuation of US$785 million as at December 2000.</font><a href="#_ftn37" id="_ftnref37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 37]</font></span></span></a></p>

The analysis was made on the basis of specific assumptions and information that were set out. Beckkett was right to rely on the 2000 valuation rather than the 1999 valuation because it was made closer to the date the shares were contracted to be sold.</p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">94     Beckkett pleaded its case for damages in its Re-Amended Statement of Claim:</font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">47. … Based on the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant’s own internal enterprise valuation of approximately US$785 million as at December 2000 … The true value of SME on or about end 2001 was approximately US$181 million (after taking into account a full repayment of the Bridge Loan and accrued interest) and the value of the Plaintiff’s 74.2% stake in SME would be worth approximately US$134 million. The SME shares were sold at an undervalue of at least US$133 million as at the date of sale. The foregoing is based upon the Plaintiff’s state of knowledge and documents available to the Plaintiff before full and complete discovery by the Defendants. For the avoidance of doubt, the Plaintiff is claiming damages on the basis set out in paragraphs 48 and 48A below but reserves its right to claim damages on a different basis, or such other basis as may be determined by the Court.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">48. The Plaintiff contends that it is entitled to damages calculated based on the difference between the current market value of the SME shares and the price at which it was sold in or about November 2001.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">95     Beckkett also adduced evidence on the equity valuation of the 40% Adaro and IBT shares (but not the SME shares) in a report put up by its witness, Jugmans. That evidence was admitted into evidence over Deutsche Bank’s objections. Jugmans and also Alexander and Schaeffer whose reports Jugmans had relied on, were subject to rigorous cross-examination by counsel for Deutsche Bank, which showed up incorrect assumptions, information gaps and other deficiencies in their reports.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">96     Ultimately, Beckkett did not rely on those findings of its witnesses and reverted to the position that “Beckkett’s primary case on undervaluation is in fact based on Deutsche Bank’s own internal valuations”</font><a href="#_ftn41" id="_ftnref41" name="_ftnref41" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 41]</font></span></span></a> although those valuations did not include any valuation of the SME shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">97     Beckkett in its reply submissions relied exclusively on the valuations to arrive at the value of the SME shares at US$96.9m.</font><a href="#_ftn42" id="_ftnref42" name="_ftnref42" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 42]</font></span></span></a> In arriving at that figure, Beckkett appeared to have omitted a 10% deduction that was to be made because the 40% holdings were minority interests with limited rights of control over the companies. The calculations made on the same basis with the 10% deduction produce a figure of US$77.7m:</p>

<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">98     Deutsche Bank submitted that Beckkett’s methodology was flawed in that:</font></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(a)    The valuations of Adaro and IBT in December 2000 were not tested by cross-examination,</font><a href="#_ftn43" id="_ftnref43" name="_ftnref43" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 43]</font></span></span></a> and</p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(b)    Beckkett’s pro-rating approach was wrong in principle as it assumed that Asminco had the same value of its assets, ie the 40% Adaro and 40% IBT shares, and that SME had the same value of Asminco. This is wrong because the shareholders of a company have no beneficial interest in the assets of a company.</font><a href="#_ftn44" id="_ftnref44" name="_ftnref44" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 44]</font></span></span></a></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">99     Beckkett’s response to the first point was that if Deutsche Bank’s valuation was not tested by cross-examination, it was because Deutsche Bank, the source of the information, had elected not to call any witnesses. If Deutsche Bank wanted to question the reliability of its own valuation, it should adduce evidence to do that. It was ironic to have a situation where a party was prepared to rely on a bank’s valuation, and the bank was disputing the reliability of the valuation without explaining where the valuation had gone wrong, or what the proper valuation should be.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2" xmlns=""><strong><em><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(c) Beckkett has no claim for reflected loss from the sale of the Adaro and IBT shares</font></em></strong></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">100  This argument was grounded on the proposition that “(N)either the assets of a company nor its undertaking belong to the shareholders”</font><a href="#_ftn45" id="_ftnref45" name="_ftnref45" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 45]</font></span></span></a> and the fact that the pledged Adaro and IBT shares were owned by Asminco, and Beckkett was connected to them only because SME owned shares in Asminco, and Beckkett owned 74.2% of the share capital of SME.</p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">101  Deutsche Bank submitted that:</font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">… Any such loss claimed by Beckkett in these proceedings is barred by the “no reflective loss” principle, insofar as it reflects the loss suffered by the companies SME and Asminco.</font><a href="#_ftn46" id="_ftnref46" name="_ftnref46" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 46]</font></span></span></a></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">and</font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">The application of the ‘no reflective loss’ principle works on two levels here. Beckkett cannot claim for the loss suffered by SME in respect of the Asminco shares, if any. SME, as shareholder of Asminco, cannot claim for the loss suffered by Asminco in respect of the 40% Adaro and IBT shares. <i>A fortiori</i> the case here, where what Beckkett is seeking to do is to recover loss suffered by Asminco, which is the subsidiary of Beckkett’s subsidiary SME.</font><a href="#_ftn47" id="_ftnref47" name="_ftnref47" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 47]</font></span></span></a></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">102  As support for its argument in law, Deutsche Bank relied on the decision of the English Court of Appeal in <i>Gerber Garment Technology Inc v Lectra Systems Ltd</i> <nobr>[1997] RPC 443</nobr> (“<i>Gerber Garment</i>”) a case of patent infringement. The plaintiff/patentee sued the defendant for infringing patents owned by it, and claimed against the defendant loss arising from the infringement which were incurred by two of the plaintiffs’ wholly owned subsidiary companies. The trial judge awarded damages to the plaintiff on the basis that it is self-evident that every dollar lost to a wholly-owned subsidiary was a dollar lost to the parent company. On appeal, the Court of Appeal held by a majority that the trial judge was wrong. Hobhouse LJ held at 479:</font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">The root principle which must be adhered to is that each company is a separate legal entity. The property of one is not the property of another. The plaintiff must prove its own financial loss in its own pocket and quantify it. Any other approach is contrary to the decided authorities and the principle in <i>Saloman v A. Saloman &amp; Co Ltd</i> [[1897] AC 22]</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">103  The right of a shareholder to claim for loss to him resulting from loss or damage caused to a company has been examined at greater length by the House of Lords in <i>Johnson v Gore Wood &amp; Co</i> [2002] 2 AC 1 (“<i>Johnson</i>”). <i>Johnson</i> was in turn discussed by our Court of Appeal in <i>Townsing Henry George v Jenton Overseas Investment Pte Ltd (in liquidation)</i> <nobr>[2007] 2 SLR 597</nobr> (“<i>Townsing</i>”) where Chan Sek Keong CJ stated (at [69]):</font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">The principle of reflective loss has been considered and approved in a number of English cases, such as <i>Gerber Garment Technology Inc v Lectra Systems Ltd</i> <nobr>[1997] RPC 443</nobr> (“<i>Gerber</i>”), and was authoritatively discussed in the House of Lords in <i>Johnson v Gore Wood &amp; Co</i> [2002] 2 AC 1 (“<i>Johnson</i>”). Whilst there were various nuances between each of the judicial opinions expressed in <i>Johnson</i>, the general tenor of the majority of their Lordships’ <i>dicta</i> underscores the broad ambit which the “no reflective loss” principle generally encompasses: but <i>contra</i> <i>Johnson</i> at 42–48, <i>per</i> Lord Cooke of Thorndon. According to Lord Bingham of Cornhill (see <i>Johnson</i> at 35), this principle has the general effect of dictating that “[a] claim will not lie by a shareholder to make good a loss which would be made good if the company’s assets were replenished through action against the party responsible for the loss”. In a similar vein, Lord Millett (see <i>Johnson</i> at 66), with whom Lord Goff of Chieveley agreed, regarded recoverability as turning on the simple question of “whether … the shareholder’s loss is franked by that of the company”. Lord Hutton in turn chose to express the principle in a positive manner (see <i>Johnson</i> at 51) through the proposition that:</font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-2" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[A] shareholder … is not debarred from recovering damages because the defendant owed a separate and similar duty of care to the company, <i>provided that the loss suffered by the shareholder is separate and distinct from the loss suffered by the company</i>. [emphasis in original]</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">and he concluded (at [77]):</font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">In our view, there are sound and compelling reasons to support the English approach as expounded in <i>Prudential Assurance</i> [[1982] Ch 204] and <i>Gardner</i> [<i>Gardner v Parker</i> <nobr>[2004] 1 BCLC 417</nobr>]. In such cases, the apparent separability of a shareholder’s and his company’s losses is but a consequence of the artificial construct created by a company’s separate legal personality. The prohibition against reflective loss recognises the unity of economic interests which bind a shareholder and his company, and gives effect to the unique position which a shareholder stands in <i>vis-à-vis</i> his company. In the words of Lord Millett in <i>Johnson</i> at 66–67:</font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-2" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times"><i>In economic terms, the shareholder has two pockets, and cannot hold the defendant liable for his inability to transfer money from one pocket to the other</i>. In principle, the company and the shareholder cannot together recover more than the shareholder would have recovered if he had carried on business in his own name instead of through the medium of a company. [emphasis in original]</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">The Court did not apply the principle in that case because it had not been pleaded.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">104  In the present case, the no-reflective–loss defence was pleaded by Deutsche Bank. When that was pleaded, it was open to Beckkett to take measures to render the principle inapplicable by removing the risk of double recovery and prejudice to the other shareholders or creditors of Asminco and SME in allowing Beckkett to proceed with its claim, as suggested in <i>Townsing</i> (at [85]), but Beckkett did not do that.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">105  Strictly speaking, Deutsche Bank did not need to invoke the principle because there is a distinction between reflective loss suffered by a company and the under-valuation of the company’s shares. When Beckkett sued Deutsche Bank as pledgor its claim was that the SME shares it pledged were sold at an undervalue when they were sold for US$800,000, and not that it had suffered reflective loss from the sale of the Adaro and IBT shares. For that purpose, it was essential for Beckkett to show that the SME shares were worth more than US$800,000. Even if Beckkett could show that Asminco or SME or itself could claim the reflective loss, that would not show whether the SME shares that were sold for US$800,000 were sold at an undervalue because the value of the share of a company is not only determined by the value of its assets alone, but also by its liabilities, its prospects and other factors.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2" xmlns=""><strong><em><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(d) Beckkett had not proved undervalue of the SME shares</font></em></strong></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">106  Deutsche Bank made the point that even if the Adaro and IBT shares were sold at an undervalue, that did not mean that the SME shares were sold at an undervalue.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">107  Deutsche Bank pointed out that Beckkett had focused on the fair market value of the 40% Adaro and IBT shares without reference to the value of the pledged SME shares.</font><a href="#_ftn48" id="_ftnref48" name="_ftnref48" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 48]</font></span></span></a></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">108  Beckkett had argued that:</font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">This Honourable Court need not concern itself with Deutsche Bank’s misconceived contention that no undervalue of the SME shares has been shown. The undervalue of the pledged shares in Adaro and IBT exceeded US$200 million, a staggering sum by any yardstick. Whatever the value of SME is, it does not detract from the fact that Deutsche Bank is guilty of selling the Adaro and IBT shares at a gross undervalue. Nor can it help Deutsche Bank to avoid the ineluctable conclusion that they breached their mortgagee’s duty as Beckkett has contended.</font><a href="#_ftn49" id="_ftnref49" name="_ftnref49" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 49]</font></span></span></a></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">and</font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Beckkett as a shareholder of SME may not own SME’s assets including SME’s shares in Asminco (and in turn Asminco’s shares in Adaro and IBT), but the value of Beckkett’s SME shares represents a proportionate part of SME’s assets which included the Adaro and IBT shares.</font><a href="#_ftn50" id="_ftnref50" name="_ftnref50" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 50]</font></span></span></a></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">109  Although it is true that an under-valuation of the Adaro and IBT shares would depress the value of SME shares, Beckkett had conflated the depression of the value of SME shares with their being undervalued at US$800,000.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">110  It was common ground between Beckkett and Deutsche Bank that SME was a debt-laden company. SME’s consolidated financial statement for the period ended 31 December 2001</font><a href="#_ftn51" id="_ftnref51" name="_ftnref51" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 51]</font></span></span></a> showed that SME had a negative shareholders’ equity of US$19.8m, after taking into account the investments in the 40% holdings in Adaro and IBT at cost, at US$92.4m.</p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">111  Even if one takes the fair market value of those shares at US$96.9m, SME was still a company with a negative value. On that basis, the SME shares were not under-valued at US$800,000.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">112  However, the point is really that whatever the value of SME’s assets may be, the value of SME as a company can only be determined by taking into account all the relevant factors, including its assets and liabilities. The shares of a technically-insolvent company can be valuable, eg, because its assets are valued at cost and have actually appreciated in value, or because it may have good prospects of becoming profitable, or for other reasons. Consequently, one needs to look at more than the assets of a company, or its financial statements, to ascertain the market value of the company’s shares. Although Beckkett made reference to the values of the Adaro and IBT shares, it had not done enough to establish the value of SME, or the value of the SME shares Beckkett pledged to Deutsche Bank.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns="">1<font face1="Times New Roman, Times">13  The critical factor is the fair market value of the 74.2% SME shares Beckkett pledged and Deutsche Bank sold, and neither Beckkett nor Deutsche Bank had established that.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2" xmlns=""><strong><em><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(e) Beckkett had not proved that Deutsche Bank had the intention to injure necessary to support a claim of conspiracy</font></em></strong></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">114  The law recognises two types of conspiracy. The Court of Appeal explained in <i>Quah Kay Tee v Ong &amp; Co Pte Ltd</i> <nobr>[1997] 1 SLR 390</nobr> (at [45]) that:</font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">The tort of conspiracy comprises two types: conspiracy by unlawful means and conspiracy by lawful means. A conspiracy by unlawful means is constituted when two or more persons combine to commit an unlawful act with the intention of injuring or damaging the plaintiff, and the act is carried out and the intention achieved. In a conspiracy by lawful means, there need not be an unlawful act committed by the conspirators. But there is the additional requirement of proving a ‘predominant purpose’ by all the conspirators to cause injury or damage to the plaintiff, and the act is carried out and the purpose achieved.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">“Intention” and “purpose” are used interchangeably in this context.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">115  In <i>Kuwait Oil Tanker Co SAK &amp; Anor v Al Bader &amp; Ors</i> [2000] 2 All ER (Comm) 271, Nourse LJ made the distinction between the two types of conspiracy clearer (at [118]):</font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">in order to establish an unlawful means conspiracy, it is necessary to establish <i>an</i> <i>intention</i> to injure the claimant but not <i>a predominant</i> <i>intention</i> or purpose to do so.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[emphasis added]</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">In other words, for conspiracy by unlawful means, an intention, whether it is a predominant or subsidiary intention, will suffice, but for conspiracy by lawful means, the intention to injure must be a predominant intention.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">116  The “injure” element and the “intention” element need to be considered carefully. The “injure” element is causal, ie whether the parties have agreed to a course of action that would cause injury. The “intention” element relates to the parties’ states of mind with regard to the injury, and the recent decision of the House of Lords in <i>Douglas &amp; Ors v Hello! Ltd &amp; Ors</i> <nobr>[2007] UKHL 21</nobr> is instructive. Generally speaking, parties may engage in a course of action which causes injury without knowing or intending that the injury would be caused. Parties may also engage in a course of action knowing that injury would be caused by that action, and in such a situation, it is said that because of the knowledge, there was intention to cause injury. That knowledge will suffice when the course of action is unlawful. But if the course of action is lawful, something more is required, because the knowledge that injury will be caused <i>per se</i> will not constitute a predominant intention to cause the injury.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">117  The references to “intention” and “predominant intention” in the passages set out are in the singular, signifying a common or shared intention of the parties. Common does not mean identical. This is made clear by Lord Wright in <i>Crofter Hand Woven Harris Tweed Co Ltd v Veitch &amp; Anor</i> [1942] AC 435 at 479:</font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">I do not accept, as a general proposition, that there must be a complete <i>identity of interest</i> between parties to a combination. There must, however, be sufficient <i>identity of object</i>, though the advantage to be derived from that same object may not be the same.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[Emphasis added]</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">118  By “identity of object” Lord Wright was referring to common objective. To constitute the intention to injure by unlawful means, each party must have the objective to cause injury, although the objective may be driven by different interests. When it comes to conspiracy to injure by lawful means, the predominant intention of the parties must be to cause injury.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">119  Beckkett has founded its case on both forms of conspiracy. It submitted that:</font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[B]oth Deutsche Bank and DSM deliberately withheld notice of the intended enforcement from Beckkett, which inevitably prevented Beckkett from redeeming the pledged shares as guarantor of the Bridge Loan and pledgor of the SME shares. Deutsche Bank and DSM also conspired to sell the pledged shares at undervalue and thereafter wind-up Beckkett to prevent Beckkett from challenging the sale, thereby injuring Beckkett.</font><a href="#_ftn52" id="_ftnref52" name="_ftnref52" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 52]</font></span></span></a></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">120  Although Deutsche Bank and DSM had agreed to the sale of the Pledged Shares at US$46m, that <i>per se</i> is not conspiracy to injure Beckkett. To start with, there was no evidence that either of them believed that the price of US$46m was an undervalue. Secondly, whilst Deutsche Bank was under a duty to Beckkett to take proper care in selling the shares, DSM was not under such a duty, and it would not know and was under no duty to know what steps, if any, Deutsche Bank had taken to satisfy itself that US$46m was a proper price.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">121  If Deutsche Bank and DSM did not knowingly fix the price at an undervalue, there can be no agreement to cause Beckkett injury by transacting at an undervalue. Taking the argument a step further, even if DSM had known that US$46m was an undervalue, that is not evidence of a predominant intention on its part to injure Beckkett because its primary interest was to purchase the shares at the lowest possible price, and not to injure Beckkett, and it cannot be said that the predominant intention of the combination was to cause injury.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">122  Beckkett also relied on the agreement to seek court approval for the sale by the <i>penetapans</i> as evidence of a conspiracy to injure. <i>Prima facie</i>, the agreement to obtain the court approvals <i>ex parte</i> was to facilitate the transaction. There was no evidence that Deutsche Bank or DSM knew at that time that <i>penetapans</i> were inappropriate and that <i>putusans</i> were required. There can be no inference that they intended to do something unlawful. It would of course be different if they had agreed to do something they knew to be wrong, eg, to under-declare the sale price.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">123  Beckkett also took the agreement to wind up Beckkett after the sale as evidence of a conspiracy.   This issue should be examined from the stand point that when a creditor applies to wind up a debtor company, it is exercising its right under the law. Banks do that in the normal course of their business, and it cannot be said that the predominant intention for doing that is to injure the debtor companies.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">124  Beckkett also pointed to the agreement between Deutsche Bank and DSM that while Deutsche Bank was to apply to wind up Beckkett, DSM was to fund the application as evidence of a conspiracy between them. Why did DSM want to fund the application to wind up Beckkett when it had no debt to recover from it? The liquidation of Beckkett would undoubtedly be injurious to Beckkett, but was the predominant intention of the agreement to cause the injury? The agreement itself does not support an inference one way or the other, and DSM’s explanation, which I shall refer to later, must be taken into consideration.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2" xmlns=""><strong><em><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(f) Beckkett had not proved that unlawful means were employed</font></em></strong></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">125  This relates back to the <i>penetapan</i>/<i>putusan</i> question under Art 1156 of the ICC. There is no controversy that the private sale had to be approved by the Indonesian courts. The sale of the Pledged Shares was carried out after the <i>penetapans</i> were obtained from the South Jakarta District Court. However, those <i>penetapans</i> were set aside by the Jakarta High Court, and have not been re-instated.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">126  Under Indonesian law, the position must be that there were no valid approvals for the sale. It would follow that the sale was not carried out by lawful means, and was carried out by unlawful means as no valid court approval was obtained.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">127  This conclusion has different consequences for each defendant. This fixes liability on Deutsche Bank as it was a failure on its part as mortgagee to discharge its duties towards Beckkett. However, it does not attach liability on DSM unless they intended to injure Beckkett when they agreed that the application to court was to be made <i>ex parte</i>.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">DSM’s defence</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">128  DSM proceeded with its defence at the trial. It called 11 witnesses. The evidence of the first two witnesses, who were the directing minds of DSM in the purchase of the Pledged Shares from Deutsche Bank, is particularly relevant to the issue of whether DSM had engaged in a conspiracy with Deutsche Bank to injure Beckkett. The witnesses were:</font></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(a)    Edwin Soeryadjaya (“Soeryadjaya”), President Commissioner of DSM. He is a member of a prominent business family in Indonesia which controlled the Indonesian conglomerate PT Astra International (“Astra”). He is the principal person who decided that DSM should buy the Pledged Shares, and he agreed with Deutsche Bank on the price of US$46m. Astra was engaged indirectly as a mining contractor of the Adaro coal mines. When he came to know that the Adaro and IBT shares might be available, he was interested to acquire the shares, but was apprehensive over Sukanto’s indirect interest in the Pledged Shares, as Sukanto has a reputation for being an aggressive and difficult debtor;</font></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(b)    Sandiaga Salahuddin Uno (“Uno”), director of DSM and an associate of Soeryadjaya. He informed Soeryadjaya of the availability of the shares and made the first two offers for them at US$25 and US$40m. After the price was fixed at US$46m, he dealt with the structuring of the sale, with advice from Agus Soetopo (“Soetopo”), an Indonesian lawyer. (Soetopo deposed an affidavit of evidence-in-chief in these proceedings, but he subsequently decided not to attend court to give evidence). Uno also dealt with Indra Aman, who served as the contact person between Deutsche Bank and DSM. He also gave evidence on DSM’s financing for Bank Mandiri and the coal transportation contract between DSM and Adaro;</font></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(c)    Chia Ah Hoo, director of Adaro, whose evidence touched on the coal transportation contract with DSM and the reclassification of the US$40m paid by Adaro to DSM for advanced payment for coal transportation services to an interest-free loan after the coal transportation contract was novated;</font></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(d)    Budi Rachman, general manager of operations of DSM, who gave evidence on steps taken for the implementation of the coal transportation contract with Adaro, and the subsequent charges following the novation of the contract;</font></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(e)    Angelien Menokathy Jacob, Head of Accounting Section of DSM, who gave evidence on the posting of accounting entries relating to coal transportation services;</font></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(f)     Inghie Kwik, who gave evidence on the macroeconomic, social and political situation in Indonesia in 2001 when DSM acquired the Pledged Shares;</font></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(g)    Peh Yudie Prawira Paimanta, who gave evidence on tax issues and uncertainties brought about by Government Regulation No 144/2000 relating to Value Added Tax;</font></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(h)    Shiv Kumar Dave, who gave evidence on the results advanced by the Indonesia Bank Restructuring Agency in recovering the assets of banks declared by Bank Indonesia to be unsound;</font></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(i)     Fred B.G. Tumbuan, who gave evidence on Indonesian law, particularly the effect of Art 1156 of the ICC;</font></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(j)     Mohamed Idwan Ganie, who gave evidence on Indonesian law. His evidence touched on, <i>inter alia</i>, the duties of directors and commissioners, and a pledgee’s right to seek the return or restoration of pledged assets that had been sold; and</font></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(k)    Colin Victor Gubbins, who gave evidence on the price of Indonesian coal.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">129  At the close of the case, DSM filed extensive submissions. The array of issues raised in the submissions fell into main heads, that:</font></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(a)    DSM was a <i>bona fide</i> purchaser of the Adaro and IBT shares;</font><a href="#_ftn53" id="_ftnref53" name="_ftnref53" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 53]</font></span></span></a></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(b)    Beckkett’s claim on conspiracy must fail as it had failed to prove pecuniary loss;</font><a href="#_ftn54" id="_ftnref54" name="_ftnref54" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 54]</font></span></span></a></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(c)    Beckkett had failed to prove that there was a combination to injure it;</font><a href="#_ftn55" id="_ftnref55" name="_ftnref55" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 55]</font></span></span></a></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(d)    Beckkett cannot make any claim in relation to the Asminco, Adaro and IBT shares;</font><a href="#_ftn56" id="_ftnref56" name="_ftnref56" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 56]</font></span></span></a> and</p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(e)    the return of the Pledged Shares is not an appropriate remedy.</font><a href="#_ftn57" id="_ftnref57" name="_ftnref57" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 57]</font></span></span></a></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2" xmlns=""><strong><em><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(a) DSM was a bona fide purchaser of the Adaro and IBT shares</font></em></strong></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">130  Beckkett’s case that DSM was not a <i>bona fide</i> purchaser relied mainly on the references in Deutsche Bank’s internal documents referring to negotiations with a “key shareholder”, a “vehicle”, “certain existing shareholders” and “borrower-related entity” as well as Indra Aman’s active involvement in the sale.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">131  When I review the evidence, I find little basis for rejecting Soeryadjaya’s evidence that he had wanted to acquire the shares through DSM for its own benefit. Soeryadjaya has the business background and interest in the mining industry generally and Adaro specifically to put in place arrangements to acquire the shares. There were no persuasive reasons put up to show that Soeryadjaya allowed the Management Group to use him or DSM as a “front”.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">132  Although Beckkett alleged that DSM was buying the shares on behalf of the Management Group consisting of Graeme Robertson, Allan Buckler, Terry Smith and Indra Aman, Beckkett’s case was founded on their alleged participation and assistance in DSM’s purchase. However, except for Indra Aman’s input in the sale process, there were no particulars given of the involvement of the other persons.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">133  Indra Aman did not give evidence in the proceedings. If he had been a witness, Beckkett’s counsel would no doubt have questioned him on his involvement, but counsel did not have this opportunity. On the evidence, there were unanswered questions on his involvement in the sale. However, there was no basis to infer that he was acting on behalf of the Management Group, as he could also have acted out of self-interest and he could have represented other parties.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">134  I find that Beckkett had not proved that DSM bought the shares as a “front”, or that Deutsche Bank knew DSM was buying the shares on behalf of some party. Beckkett had therefore not proved that DSM was not a <i>bona fide</i> purchaser.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2" xmlns=""><strong><em><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(b) Beckkett’s claim in conspiracy must fail as it had failed to prove pecuniary loss</font></em></strong></p>
<p class="Judg-1-FirstPara" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">135  Counsel referred to Lord Diplock’s statement in <i>Lonrho Ltd and Another v Shell Petroleum Co Ltd and another (No.2)</i> [1982] AC 173 at 188 that “[t]he gist of the cause of action [of conspiracy] is damage to the plaintiff”. Counsel also referred to <i>Quinn v Leathem</i> [1901] AC 495, where Lord Brampton held at 528:</font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-AU"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">A conspiracy consists of an unlawful combination of two or more persons to do that which is contrary to law, or to do that which is wrongful and harmful towards another person. It may be punished criminally by indictment, or civilly by an action on the case in the nature of conspiracy if damage has been occasioned to the person against whom it is directed.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">136  Their Lordships referred to “damage” generally, and counsel did not explain and I do not find any need to narrow that to “pecuniary loss”.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">137  Beckkett’s response was that it had suffered loss in the deprivation of the equity of redemption of the Pledged Shares and loss from the sale of the Pledged Shares at an undervalue.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2" xmlns=""><strong><em><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(c) Beckkett had failed to prove that there was a combination to injure it</font></em></strong></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">138  I have found that there was no evidence that DSM or Deutsche Bank had knowingly fixed the price at an undervalue when they agreed on the US$46m. I have also found that there was no evidence that DSM or Deutsche Bank knew that the applications for court approvals should be <i>inter partes.</i></font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">139  The remaining issue was the agreement for DSM to provide the funding to wind up Beckkett after the sale. This was dealt with by Uno in [103] to [105] of his affidavit of evidence-in-chief when he referred to his concerns and the advice he obtained from Soetopo:</font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">103. … I asked Mr Soetopo again to do whatever that was necessary to fully comply with Indonesian Law and to ensure that our transaction was watertight. I told him that I wanted all angles covered, since this was our purchase of collaterals in a bank’s enforcement action. Also, I was still concerned about unwanted litigation and baseless challenges from troublemakers and I asked him again how best we could protect our investment subsequently from this. At that time, I had in mind, in particular, any sort of unwanted litigation that might be imaginatively started by Sukanto Tanoto, but that was in fact not the only unwanted litigation I was thinking of. I was also thinking of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant possibly bringing any sort of litigation subsequently – in my mind, technically speaking, Asminco itself would still owe an outstanding debt to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, and SME was liable to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant under a corporate guarantee.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">104   Mr Soetopo informed me that in our structure of the transaction as discussed, we had considered all the angles from the Indonesian Law perspective. We were, for the protection of the investment, looking to restructuring the group of companies and how best to “ring fence” against any unfounded litigation by troublemakers via Asminco and SME. However, he informed that if we wanted to cover all angles in terms of restructuring and protection, there was still a Singapore angle which we might want to look into with Singapore legal advisors. He informed me that there was a corporate guarantee given by the Plaintiff, a Singapore company, and that the Plaintiff was the pledgee of the shares in SME. He said that the Plaintiff owed the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant the remaining outstanding loan, which technically, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant could still claim from Asminco even after we bought over Asminco. Also, if the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant recovered any monies from the Plaintiff as corporate guarantor, the Plaintiff could claim against Asminco. Furthermore, the Plaintiff was the company up above SME, and that was the channel from which troublemakers or errant third parties might bring an unfounded litigation based on the SME shares that were pledged to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant and sold by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">105   I asked Mr Soetopo what he thought we should do. He pointed out that the Plaintiff had not paid the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant under the corporate guarantee all these years, and there was the option of asking the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant whether it was going to seek recovery on the outstanding debt from the Plaintiff under the corporate guarantee, and if the Plaintiff could not pay up, then proposing to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, in taking enforcement action in respect of the defaulted distress loan, to liquidate the Plaintiff. In this regard, Mr Soetopo said that he could not advise further as to how the matter would proceed as that would take place in Singapore under Singapore Law.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">140  From the explanation, DSM’s motive to have Beckkett wound up was defensive in nature, to avoid unnecessary litigation. The proposed means of securing that, by having Deutsche Bank to petition to have Beckkett wound up if it failed to discharge its obligations as guarantor, was a lawful means. Banks can and do wind up debtors with their own funds, perhaps in the hope of recovering something from the liquidation, or perhaps for tax or other purposes. All that DSM had done was to offer an incentive to Deutsche Bank to do something it was fully entitled to do on commercial and legal grounds.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">141  Consequently, I find that Beckkett had not proved that Deutsche Bank and DSM had combined with the intention to injure it. This finding disposes of Beckkett’s case on conspiracy against them.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2" xmlns=""><strong><em><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(d) Beckkett cannot make any claim to the Asminco, Adaro and IBT shares</font></em></strong></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">142  This is correct because Beckkett did not pledge any of these shares, and Beckkett did not repay the loan and cannot claim any right of subrogation.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2" xmlns=""><strong><em><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(e) The return of the Pledged Shares is not an appropriate remedy</font></em></strong></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">143  As I have found that DSM was a <i>bona fide</i> purchaser of the Adaro and IBT shares, and that DSM had not conspired to injure Beckkett, Beckkett is not entitled to any remedy from DSM.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">144  Even if Beckkett’s case against DSM was made out, I would not have ordered the shares to be returned as:</font></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(a)    Beckkett has no claim to the shares except for the SME shares it pledged,</font></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(b)    the shareholdings in Adaro and IBT have been transformed by the leveraged buy-out after the sale, and</font></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(c)    the value of the shares has been benefited from investments and developments made, as well as the sharp increase in coal prices that has taken place after the sale.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Measure of damages</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">145  Deutsche Bank was emphatic that the evidence of Jugmans, Alexander and Schaeffer was so flawed in theory and practice that no reliance could be placed on them. In the face of severe criticism of their evidence, Beckkett reverted to its reliance on Deutsche Bank’s own internal valuation of the equity values of Adaro and IBT shares as at 28 December 2000.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">146  In its closing submissions, Deutsche Bank has argued that there was a fatal shortcoming in Beckkett’s case in its failure to show undervalue in the sale of the SME shares.</font><a href="#_ftn58" id="_ftnref58" name="_ftnref58" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 58]</font></span></span></a> Insofar as Beckkett’s “primary case” was that the under-valuation is shown in Deutsche Bank’s internal valuation, that is correct because this valuation does not refer to the value of the SME shares directly.</p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">147  Beckkett however argued that:</font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">At this stage, it is not necessary to prove the exact loss in the value of SME shares. It would be sufficient to prove that any sale of the pledged shares in Adaro and IBT at an undervalue will <i>inevitably</i> cause a loss in the value of the shares in the companies upstream. This, Beckkett has amply proved.<span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><a href="#_ftn59" id="_ftnref59" name="_ftnref59" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[note: 59]</span></a></span></font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[Emphasis in the original]</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">148  There were two difficulties with this argument. First, the loss in value of the SME shares caused by the sale of the Adaro and IBT shares was not really in issue. The true issue was whether the SME shares were sold at an undervalue for US$800,000, and Deutsche Bank’s internal valuations of the Adaro and IBT shares did not show whether the SME shares were worth more than US$800,000.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">149  Second, the reference to “at this stage” and the implication that the presentation of the proof can, or is to be done at a later stage were misconceived. This trial of this action was not divided such that liability is to be determined at the first stage, to be followed by the assessment of damages in the second stage. There was an order for bifurcation made on 18 November 2006, but that was a limited and specific bifurcation. The order was necessary because of Beckkett’s claim for damages in respect of the pledged SME shares for damages “based on the difference between the current market value of the SME shares and the price at which it (sic) was sold in or about November 2001.”</font><a href="#_ftn60" id="_ftnref60" name="_ftnref60" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 60]</font></span></span></a> The order was that for the 2005 value the shares were to be determined at a later stage because the parties were not ready to deal with that at the trial. (It is not entirely clear why the 2005 value was considered important, as the action was filed in 2004, and the bifurcation order was sought and made in 2006.) As the proof of undervalue at the time of sale in November 2001 is an entirely separate matter from the 2005 valuation, the former was not deferred. Beckkett was therefore obliged to prove that at the hearing, or face the consequences. As it has not proved its loss, it is only entitled to nominal damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Deutsche Bank’s counterclaim</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">150  As Deutsche Bank elected not to call its witnesses, it did not prove its counterclaim. I should add that even if Deutsche Bank had proceeded with its counterclaim, it would have encountered difficulties. The difficulties arise from the fact that it did not have the Adaro, IBT and Asminco shares valued, and had sold them in a private sale without notice to other potential buyers. As I have stated earlier, Deutsche Bank as vendor-pledgee owes a primary duty to the pledgors, and it also owes a duty to any guarantor who may be liable for the shortfall between the outstanding loan and the proceeds from the sale of the shares.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">151  For this reason, although Beckkett has no independent right of action over the sale of the Adaro, IBT and Asminco shares, it is entitled to raise that as a defence to any claim from Deutsche Bank for the shortfall. The onus then is on Deutsche Bank to show that it had acted with due care when it sold those shares, and Deutsche Bank’s conduct fell short of that.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Conclusion</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">152  Having so reviewed the issues of law and fact raised by the parties, I find and order o<span class="Judg-list-1Char1">n the claims and the counterclaim that:</span></font></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(a)    Beckkett has made out a case that Deutsche Bank failed to discharge its duties as pledgee when it sold the SME shares, but has failed to show that Deutsche Bank had in fact sold those shares at an undervalue, so I award to Beckkett nominal damages of $1000;</font></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(b)    Beckkett’s claim for conspiracy against Deutsche Bank and DSM is dismissed; and</font></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(c)    Deutsche Bank’s counterclaim against Beckkett is dismissed.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">153  On costs, I order that:</font></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(a)    as Beckkett has established Deutsche Bank’s liability but failed to prove its loss in the claim against Deutsche Bank as pledgee, each party is to bear its own costs;</font></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(b)    Beckkett is to pay Deutsche Bank and DSM costs in the claim on conspiracy;</font></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(c)    Deutsche Bank is to pay Beckkett costs in the counterclaim; and</font></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(d)    all the costs to be paid are to be taxed for two counsel.</font></p>
