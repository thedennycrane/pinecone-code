The Defendant and his wife hold this property as joint tenants.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The crux of the Plaintiff’s application is whether a joint tenant’s interest in immovable property is exigible to a WSS. This issue has divided the courts and academics alike. Nevertheless, based on the submissions before me, I only needed to resolve two issues to determine the Plaintiff’s application: (a) whether Assistant Registrars are bound by the decisions of High Court Judges, and (b) whether there are conflicting decisions by different High Court Judges regarding the exigibility of a joint tenant’s interest in immovable property by means of a WSS, such that an Assistant Registrar would be free to decide this matter by preferring one precedent over another. As I held that the answer to the first question was “yes”, and the answer to the second was “no”, I considered myself bound by the decisions in <span class="font-italic">Malayan Banking Bhd v Focal Finance Ltd </span>[1998] 3 SLR(R) 1008<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">(“Focal Finance”)</span> and <span class="font-italic">Chan Lung Kien v Chan Shwe Ching </span>[2017] SGHC 136 (“<span class="font-italic">Chan Lung Kien</span>”) to hold that a joint tenant’s interest in immovable property is not exigible to a WSS. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 On 8 November 2017, I dismissed the Plaintiff’s application. The Plaintiff has appealed against my decision, and I now set out my full grounds below.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Brief Facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The Defendant and his wife are joint tenants of a condominium at 10 Pasir Ris Link (the “Property”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The Plaintiff is a law firm that represented the Defendant in two High Court Suits – Suit No 244 of 2013 and Suit No 733 of 2014 (the “HC Suits”). On 24 October 2016, the Plaintiff ceased to act for the Defendant in the HC Suits.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The Defendant did not pay the Plaintiff’s legal fees for work done in the HC Suits. On 2 March 2017, the Plaintiff commenced Suit No 194 of 2017 (“Suit 194”) to recover outstanding legal fees of $394,254.14 from the Defendant. The Defendant did not enter an appearance in Suit 194, and on 9 June 2017, the Plaintiff entered judgment in default of appearance against the Defendant for the sum of $394,254.14 plus interest and costs.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 The judgment debt in Suit 194 remains wholly unsatisfied. As a result, the Plaintiff applied under O 47 r 4 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“the Rules”) for an order that the Defendant’s interest in the Property be attached and taken in execution under a WSS.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Plaintiff’s Case </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 The Plaintiff’s case is that a joint tenant’s interest in immovable property can be attached and taken in execution under a WSS. The Plaintiff relies on the decision in <span class="font-italic">Chan Shwe Ching v Leong Lai Yee </span>[2015] 5 SLR 295 (“<span class="font-italic">Chan Shwe Ching</span>”), where Edmund Leow JC made an <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> order that one joint tenant’s interest in immovable property be attached and taken in execution under a WSS.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 The Plaintiff pointed out that the decision in <span class="font-italic">Chan Shwe Ching </span>was in conflict with two other decisions by High Court Judges, namely, <span class="font-italic">F</span><span class="font-italic">ocal Finance</span> by Tay Yong Kwang JC (as he then was) and <span class="font-italic">Chan Lung Kien </span>by Chua Lee Ming J. Both decisions held that a joint tenant’s interest in immovable property cannot be taken in execution under a WSS. The Plaintiff submitted that in light of this seeming conflict in the authorities, I was not bound by any of the aforementioned three decisions, and was free to rely on the decision in <span class="font-italic">Chan Shwe Ching</span>.<span class="font-italic"> </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 The Plaintiff urged me to follow Leow JC’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Chan Shwe Ching</span> as (a) it was consistent with the legal position in the jurisdictions of Australia, England, and Canada, and (b) there were strong public policy reasons in favour of finding that a joint tenant’s interest in immovable property can be taken in execution under a WSS. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 At the first hearing before me, I raised a concern that the authorities were not in fact in conflict. This is because the <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> order granted by Leow JC in <span class="font-italic">Chan Shwe Ching</span> was set aside by Chua J in <span class="font-italic">Chan Lung Kien</span> after an <span class="font-italic">inter </span><span class="font-italic">partes </span>hearing and therefore ceased, for the purposes of the doctrine of <span class="font-italic">stare decisis</span>, to have any precedential effect.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 In response, the Plaintiff’s counsel acknowledged that the setting aside of Leow JC’s order is “a potential problem” to the Plaintiff’s position. He then submitted that I ought to adopt the approach by the court in <span class="font-italic">Chan Yat Chun v Sng Jin Chye &amp; Anor </span>[2016] SGHCR 4 (“<span class="font-italic">Chan Yat Chun</span>”), where the learned Assistant Registrar stated in <span class="font-italic">obiter </span>that Assistant Registrars are not bound by the decisions of High Court Judges. In short, the Plaintiff’s alternative submission at the time was that even if <span class="font-italic">Chan Shwe Ching </span>ceased to have precedential effect, on the authority of <span class="font-italic">Chan Yat Chun</span>, I was not bound by either <span class="font-italic">Focal Finance</span> or <span class="font-italic">Chan Lung Kien</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>anyway, and he urged me to find that the Defendant’s interest (as joint tenant) in the Property can be taken in execution under a WSS.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 It subsequently came to my attention that there was another decision by an Assistant Registrar, namely <span class="font-italic">Actis Excalibur Ltd v KS Distribution Pte Ltd </span>[2016] SGHCR 11 (“<span class="font-italic">Actis </span><span class="font-italic">Excalibur</span>”), where the court found that Assistant Registrars are bound by the decisions of High Court Judges. I then invited the Plaintiff’s counsel to address me on <span class="font-italic">Actis Excalibur</span>. At the second hearing before me, he submitted that the decision in <span class="font-italic">Actis </span><span class="font-italic">Excalibur </span>is correct and that Assistant Registrars are bound by the decisions of High Court Judges. However, the Plaintiff’s counsel maintained that I was not bound by <span class="font-italic">Focal Finance</span> or <span class="font-italic">Chan Lung Kien</span> as there was conflict in the authorities. In short, he argued that Chua J (as one High Court Judge) could not overrule the decision of another High Court Judge (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Leow JC), and that I was free to rely on the decision in <span class="font-italic">Chan Shwe Ching</span>.<span class="font-italic"> </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-justify font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issues</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 As highlighted in the introduction, there are two issues which I needed to resolve to determine the Plaintiff’s application. I propose to first deal with the issue of whether Assistant Registrars are bound by the decisions of High Court Judges, before considering if I am bound by any High Court decision on the execution against a joint tenant’s interest in immovable property by means of a WSS. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-justify font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 1: </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Stare Decisis</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> between High Court Judges and Assistant Registrars</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 In 2016, two Assistant Registrars reached different conclusions on the issue of whether Assistant Registrars are bound by the decisions of High Court Judges.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 In the first decision of <span class="font-italic">Chan Yat Chun</span>, Assistant Registrar Zhuang WenXiong (“AR Zhuang”) observed that Assistant Registrars are not bound by the decisions of High Court Judges because (a) the doctrine of horizontal <span class="font-italic">stare decisis</span> does not prevail in Singapore and the High Court is not bound by its previous decisions, and (b) O 32 r 9 of the Rules provides that an Assistant Registrar has the same powers and jurisdiction as a Judge in Chambers (see [11]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 AR Zhuang’s views were considered by Assistant Registrar Colin Seow (“AR Seow”) in <span class="font-italic">Actis Excalibur</span>. In short, AR Seow disagreed with AR Zhuang’s views for two reasons. First, he held that the authorities cited by AR Zhuang, namely <span class="font-italic">Attorney-General v Shadrake Alan </span>[2010] SGHC 327 and <span class="font-italic">Attorney-General v Chee Soon Juan </span>[2006] 2 SLR(R) 650,  were distinguishable and did not deal specifically with whether Assistant Registrars were bound by the decisions of High Court Judges (see [15]). Second, Assistant Registrars are conferred with powers and jurisdiction to carry out certain functions <span class="font-italic">on behalf of</span> High Court Judges as a matter of the internal organisation of judicial work in the High Court, and is therefore juridically ancillary to a High Court Judge in the judicial hierarchy (see [18]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 In my view, the different conclusions reached in <span class="font-italic">Chan Yat Chun </span>and <span class="font-italic">Actis Excalibur</span> is explicable on how the respective courts approached the issue of the <span class="font-italic">place or statu</span><span class="font-italic">s of an Assistant Registrar in the judicial hierarchy</span>. While the court in <span class="font-italic">Chan Yat Chun</span> assumed that Assistant Registrars and High Court Judges are co-ordinate in the judicial hierarchy (see <span class="font-italic">Chan Yat Chun </span>at [11]), the court in <span class="font-italic">Actis Excalibur</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>found that Assistant Registrars are in fact subordinate to High Court Judges in the judicial hierarchy (see <span class="font-italic">Actis Excalibur </span>at [16]–[18]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Hence, the proper characterisation of the place of Assistant Registrars in the judicial hierarchy is key to unlocking the issue of whether Assistant Registrars are bound by the decisions of High Court Judges. In approaching this issue, it will be helpful to briefly consider the doctrine of <span class="font-italic">stare decisis</span>, and the jurisdiction and powers of the Assistant Registrar, which I now turn to. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Stare Decisis</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 In essence, <span class="font-italic">s</span><span class="font-italic">tare decisis</span>, or the doctrine of binding precedent, consists of rules of practice which guide the courts on the manner of adjudication with reference to decided cases. <span class="font-italic">Stare decisis</span> can operate between courts at different levels in the judicial hierarchy (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, vertical <span class="font-italic">stare decisis</span>) and between courts at the same level in the judicial hierarchy (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, horizontal <span class="font-italic">stare decisis</span>). For present purposes, I am only concerned with vertical <span class="font-italic">stare decisis</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>in Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 <span class="font-italic"> </span>Vertical <span class="font-italic">stare decisis</span> simply means that a Judge is constrained to follow a decision of the courts above him in the judicial hierarchy if the case before him cannot be distinguished from the prior case (see Walter Woon, “The Doctrine of Judicial Precedent” in <span class="font-italic">The Singapore Legal System </span>(Kevin YL Tan ed) (Singapore University Press, 1999) (“Woon”) at 298). Under the rules of <span class="font-italic">s</span><span class="font-italic">tare decisis</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>only the <span class="font-italic">ratio decidendi</span> of the decision is binding (see Woon at 298). In other words, only the rule of law which was expressly or impliedly treated by the Judge as a necessary step in reaching his or her conclusion is binding (see <span class="font-italic">Indo Commercial Society (Pte) Ltd v Ebrahim and another </span>[1992] 2 SLR(R) 667 at [14]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 There can be no dispute that vertical <span class="font-italic">stare decisis </span>applies in our judicial system. Applied to the present case, if I find that High Court Judges are above Assistant Registrars in the judicial hierarchy (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, like AR Seow in <span class="font-italic">Actis Excalibur</span>), it follows that vertical <span class="font-italic">stare decisis</span> applies between Assistant Registrars and High Court Judges.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Powers and Jurisdiction of Assistant Registrars</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 The Registrar and the Assistant Registrars of the High Court exercise delegated<span class="font-italic"> </span>jurisdiction which is devolved from that vested in a High Court Judge in Chambers (see the Court of Appeal decision in <span class="font-italic">Tan Boon Heng v Lau Pang Cheng </span>[2013] 4 SLR 718 (“<span class="font-italic">Lau Pang Cheng</span>”) at [13]–[16]). This is clear from s 62(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) read with O 32 r 9(1) of the Rules, which provide that the powers conferred on a High Court Judge in Chambers is exercisable by the Registrar unless the Chief Justice directs otherwise (for an example of such a direction, see para 42(1) of the Supreme Court Practice Directions, where it is stated that the Chief Justice has directed that applications for <span class="font-italic">Mareva </span>injunctions and search orders shall be heard by High Court Judges but all other <span class="font-italic">ex parte </span>applications for interim injunctions may be heard by the Registrar and the Assistant Registrars of the High Court). The Registrar, and by extension Assistant Registrars, are delegated such powers, authority and jurisdiction as a matter of <span class="font-italic">administrative convenience</span>, to save the time of High Court Judges (see <span class="font-italic">Lau Pang Cheng</span> at [14]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 All decisions of an Assistant Registrar (whether interlocutory or final) are appealable to a High Court Judge in Chambers under O 56 r 1(1) of the Rules. A Judge in Chambers who hears a Registrar’s Appeal is not exercising appellate jurisdiction but <span class="font-italic">confirmatory </span>jurisdiction, and is entitled to exercise his or her discretion afresh (see <span class="font-italic">Lau Pang Cheng</span> at [16] and [21]). This stems from the fact that the Assistant Registrar and the Judge in Chambers exercise the same powers and jurisdiction. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">My Decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 With respect, I do not find the decision in <span class="font-italic">Chan Yat Chun </span>persuasive for two reasons.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, I agree with AR Seow that the authorities relied on in <span class="font-italic">Chan Yat Chun </span>are distinguishable and did not specifically consider whether Assistant Registrars are bound by the decisions of High Court Judges (see [17] above), or where Assistant Registrars stand in the judicial hierarchy. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, the decision in <span class="font-italic">Chan Yat Chun</span> concerned an execution against a tenant-in-common’s interest in immovable property by means of a WSS. AR Zhuang had accepted as “trite” that a tenant-in-common owns a distinct and identifiable interest in immovable property (at [6]), and would have found, either on the authority of <span class="font-italic">Focal Finance</span> or <span class="font-italic">Chan Shwe Ching</span>, that the interest of a tenant-in-common is exigible to a WSS (see [33] and [34] below). It was for this reason that the issue of whether Assistant Registrars are bound by decisions of High Court Judges was not argued before AR Zhuang and he did not have the benefit of hearing submissions on the matter.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Instead, I prefer the conclusion reached in <span class="font-italic">Actis Excalibur</span>. In my view, it must be the case that High Court Judges occupy a higher position than Assistant Registrars in the judicial hierarchy such that the doctrine of vertical <span class="font-italic">stare decisis </span>prevails between Assistant Registrars and High Court Judges. I say so for three reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 First, all decisions of Assistant Registrars are appealable to a High Court Judge in Chambers as of right. In a hierarchical system of courts like ours, this right of appeal is indicative of (a) the lower standing of the Assistant Registrar <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis </span>the High Court Judge in the judicial hierarchy, and (b) the existence of vertical <span class="font-italic">stare decisis</span> between Assistant Registrars and High Court Judges. As explained by Professor Walter Woon, vertical <span class="font-italic">stare decisis</span> naturally follows from the power of one court to reverse the decision of another court. Professor Woon says (see <span class="font-italic">Woon </span>at 306):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Vertical <span class="font-italic">stare decisis </span>is <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">concomitant of the power of a court to reverse the decision of a lower </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">court</span>.<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> If there is a right of appeal from court A to court B, then court A should treat court B’s decisions as binding. </span>Otherwise, if court A departs from such decisions it is likely to be reversed on appeal. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Thus a court should be bound by the decisions of a court to which appeals lie</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span>… [emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The same reason was expressed by the High Court of Australia in <span class="font-italic">Viro v R </span>(1978) 18 ALR 257, where it was held that the High Court of Australia was no longer bound by the decisions of the Privy Council following the abolition of appeals from the High Court of Australia to the Privy Council. Barwick CJ explained that “[t]he <span class="font-italic">essential basis</span> for the observance of a decision of a tribunal by way of binding precedent is that that <span class="font-italic">tribunal can correct the decisions of the court which it is said so to be bound</span>” [emphasis added] (at 260). Similarly, Stephen J stated that “[t]he sanction implicit in the doctrine of precedent is simple and effective: if an inferior court fails to observe the doctrine the superior court will correct its decision on appeal. <span class="font-italic">Thus the existence of an appeal is inherent in and essential to the doctrine</span>” [emphasis added] (at 289).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The second reason, which is related to the first, is the unfettered<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span>standard of review by High Court Judges in Registrar’s Appeals on interlocutory applications. In such applications, the Registrar’s Appeal operates as an actual <span class="font-italic">rehearing</span> of the application, and the High Court Judge treats the matter afresh as though it has come before him or her for the first time (see <span class="font-italic">Herbs and Spices Trading Post Pte Ltd v Deo Silver (Pte) Ltd </span>[1990] 2 SLR(R) 685 at [12]). The fact that the High Court Judge need not consider how the Assistant Registrar exercised his or her discretion is strongly indicative that High Court Judges stand above Assistant Registrars in the judicial hierarchy.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The third reason relates to the delegated nature of the jurisdiction exercised by Assistant Registrars. Assistant Registrars are delegated certain powers, authority and jurisdiction of High Court Judges <span class="font-italic">for</span><span class="font-italic"> administrative convenience</span> (see [23] above). This must mean that Assistant Registrars are not co-ordinate with High Court Judges in the judicial hierarchy. As such, there is much force to AR Seow’s remark in <span class="font-italic">Actis Excalibur</span> that Assistant Registrars “are necessarily obliged in the discharge of [certain judicial functions on behalf of High Court Judges] not to overreach the very premise upon which such powers, authority and jurisdiction are derived” (see [18]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 To conclude on this issue, I find Assistant Registrars are bound by the <span class="font-italic">ratio decidendi</span> of the decisions of High Court Judges if the case before him or her cannot be distinguished. The Plaintiff has rightly conceded that the decision in <span class="font-italic">Actis Excalibur</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>ought to be preferred to that in <span class="font-italic">Chan Yat Chun</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 2: Conflicting Decisions on WSS of Joint Tenant’s Interest? </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 At the outset, I accept the proposition that an Assistant Registrar is not bound to follow the decision of any one High Court Judge where that decision conflicts with another decision by a High Court Judge (see <span class="font-italic">Actis Excalibur </span>at [19]; <span class="font-italic">Chan Yat Chun </span>at [10]). The issue here is whether there exists a state of conflict in the authorities. There are three decisions by High Court Judges (cited by the Plaintiff) that have a bearing on this determination.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 In the first decision of <span class="font-italic">Focal Finance</span>, Tay JC held that a joint tenant’s interest in immovable property cannot be taken in execution under a WSS because the interests of the joint tenants are not distinct and identifiable, and therefore not capable of being attached under a WSS (at [15]–[18]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 In the second decision of <span class="font-italic">Chan Shwe Ching</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>which was decided <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span>, Leow JC held that a WSS can be issued against a joint tenant’s interest in immovable property because severance of the joint tenant’s interest (to create a tenancy-in-common) will occur when the Sheriff decides to sell the immovable property under the WSS (at [13] and [20]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 In the third decision of <span class="font-italic">Chan Lung Kien</span>, which was decided <span class="font-italic">inter partes</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>Chua J followed Tay JC’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Focal Finance</span>. Chua J gave three reasons for this (at [29]–[35]). First, there is nothing for the WSS to bite onto at the point when the court makes an order for a WSS to be issued. Each joint tenant’s interest in the property is indistinguishable, and the issuance of the WSS does not sever the joint tenancy to create a tenancy-in-common. Second, if there is nothing for the WSS to bite onto at the point when the court makes an order for a WSS to be issued, it cannot be an answer to say that the joint tenant’s interest will <span class="font-italic">su</span><span class="font-italic">bsequently</span> be converted into the interest of a tenant-in-common which would be capable of being seized. Third, Leow JC’s reasoning in <span class="font-italic">Chan Shwe Ching</span> is premised on the ability to sell the property following a seizure of a debtor’s interest. However, the seizure of a joint tenant’s interest under a WSS (even assuming this can be done) is not the same thing as a seizure of the property itself, and the Sheriff cannot sell the property without the agreement of all the joint tenants.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 When considering these three authorities, it must be remembered that the latter two concerned the <span class="font-italic">same legal claim</span> and considered <span class="font-italic">the same legal question</span>. Leow JC in <span class="font-italic">Chan Shwe Ching</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>made an <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> order that the interest of one joint tenant (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the defendant, Leong Lai Yee) in the property at 9 Jalan Tanah Rata be attached and taken in execution under a WSS. In the later case of <span class="font-italic">Chan Lung Kien</span>, Chua J, upon the application of a creditor of Leong Lai Yee (<span class="font-italic">ie,</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>a non-party to the proceedings in <span class="font-italic">Chan Shwe Ching</span>), set aside Leow JC’s order <span class="font-italic">inter partes</span> under O 32 r 6 of the Rules. In setting aside Leow JC’s <span class="font-italic">ex parte </span>order, Chua J emphasized that the application under O 32 r 6 is not an appeal (see <span class="font-italic">Chan Lung Kien </span>at [18]). O 32 r 6 of the Rules permits an <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> order to be set aside as it recognises that <span class="font-italic">ex parte </span>orders are <span class="font-italic">provisional </span>in nature and made upon the hearing of one party only (see <span class="font-italic">Chan Lung Kien </span>at [18]). In the words of Sir Donaldson MR, in <span class="font-italic">WEA Records Ltd v Visions Channel 4 Ltd </span>[1983] 1 WLR 721 at 727:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… ex parte orders are <span class="font-italic">essentially provisional in nature</span>. They are made by the judge on the basis of evidence and submissions emanating from one side only. Despite the fact that the applicant is under a duty to make full and frank disclosure of all relevant information in his possession, whether or not it assists his application, <span class="font-italic">there is no basis for making a definitive order and every judge knows this</span>. He expects at a later stage <span class="font-italic">to be given an opportunity to review his provisional order in light of evidence and argument adduced by the other side and, in so </span><span class="font-italic">doing, he is not hearing an appeal from himself and in no way feels inhibited from discharging or varying his original order.</span>  [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 In my view, the provisional nature of an <span class="font-italic">ex parte </span>order is the very reason why the decision in <span class="font-italic">Chan Shwe Ching</span> ceased to have precedential force once it was set aside <span class="font-italic">inter partes</span>. An <span class="font-italic">ex parte </span>order is not a definitive order, and may be discharged or varied in light of evidence and argument from the other side. If a court discharges an <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> order after considering the same legal question(s) further on an <span class="font-italic">inter partes</span> basis, it must necessarily follow that the decision initially made ex parte is no longer authoritative. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 In <span class="font-italic">Chan Lung Kien</span>, Chua J set aside Leow JC’s <span class="font-italic">ex parte </span>order as he arrived at a different conclusion from Leow JC on whether a joint tenant’s interest in immovable property is exigible to a WSS. Pursuant to the setting aside, the <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> decision in <span class="font-italic">Chan Shwe Ching</span> is no longer authoritative. This must be correct, because if it were otherwise, <span class="font-italic">inter partes </span>decisions made to set aside <span class="font-italic">ex parte </span>orders would <span class="font-italic">never </span>be binding on the lower courts, because the <span class="font-italic">inter partes </span>decision differs from the <span class="font-italic">ex parte </span>one. In my respectful view, this would be a perverse outcome. Even though the circumstances surrounding <span class="font-italic">Chan Shwe Ching </span>and <span class="font-italic">Chan Lung Kien </span>are a little unique in that (a) different Judges issued the <span class="font-italic">ex parte </span>decision and the <span class="font-italic">inter partes </span>decision, and (b) the <span class="font-italic">inter partes </span>hearing was argued by a non-party (instead of the defendant), this does not change the analysis.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 In the circumstances, only the decisions in <span class="font-italic">Focal Finance </span>and <span class="font-italic">Chan Lung Kien</span> are binding on me. On the facts before me, <span class="font-italic">Focal Finance </span>and <span class="font-italic">Chan Lung Kien</span> cannot be distinguished (and indeed the Plaintiff does not take such a position). Consequently, I am bound to find that the Defendant’s interest in the Property cannot be taken in execution under a WSS as the interest of a joint tenant is not distinct and identifiable.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 In closing, I thank the Plaintiff’s counsel for his submissions. Despite his best efforts, I am bound to so find that the Defendant’s interest in the Property cannot be attached and taken in execution under a WSS. The Plaintiff’s application is therefore dismissed.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Navin Anand<br/>Assistant Registrar  </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Tang Hang Wu (Instructed), Choo Zheng Xi, Raj Mannar and Elaine Low (Peter Low &amp; Choo LLC) for the Plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
