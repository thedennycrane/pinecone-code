The creditor opposing the proposed 3rd VA is OUE Lippo Healthcare Limited (“OUELH”). The nominee is Mr Andre Arul, a lawyer from Arul Chew &amp; Partners (“the Nominee”). This appeal concerns whether the Nominee had rightly admitted and adjudicated the claims of three Indonesian creditors (“the Indon Entities”) and the evidence that can be relied on for this purpose. </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 In 2016, Aathar applied for the first voluntary arrangement (“1st VA”). The 1st VA was approved at a creditors’ meeting, but it was revoked by an AR on the application of various creditors who were dissatisfied with the outcome of the meeting. The AR found no evidence of the huge debts that were purportedly owed to the creditors and found material irregularities arising from Aathar’s lack of candour in his statement of affairs and the nominee’s failure to scrutinise it. The AR then decided that no further meeting should be sanctioned.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 Aathar then filed a second application for voluntary arrangement (“VA”) in September 2017 (“2nd VA”). Again, the approval for the 2nd VA was revoked by the High Court for material irregularities. In relation to the Indon Entities, namely “Berkah”, “Fajar” and “Entete”, the court found as follows. The manner of review of their claims by the nominee left much to be desired. The supporting documents which the nominee claimed were given to him for these claims were neither explained nor exhibited in any affidavit, and the nominee had reviewed the supporting documents cursorily. Also, in light of the large sums claimed by the Indon Entities, and the circumstances surrounding the previous proposal for a VA, the nominee should have scrutinised the claims more closely in his independent and quasi-judicial role. Aathar’s appeal to the Court of Appeal on the 2nd VA was dismissed (see <span class="font-italic">Aathar</span><span class="font-italic"> Ah Kong Andrew v CIMB Securities (Singapore) Pte Ltd and other appeals and another matter</span> [2019] 2 SLR 164 (“<span class="font-italic">Aathar</span><span class="font-italic"> CA</span>”)).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 Before the Court of Appeal heard Aathar’s appeal on the 2nd VA, Aathar filed his third VA application on 24 January 2019 (“3rd VA”) and proposed that some $2.5 million, funded by one PT Cahaya, be distributed among his purported liabilities of over $596 million.

The AR found that the Nominee’s inclusion of the Indon Entities’ claims under the SCG Deeds of $65 million on an “objected to” basis was a material irregularity. The Nominee had relied on documents adduced <span class="font-italic">after</span> the Creditors’ Meeting to justify his admission and adjudication of the Indon Entities’ claims. There was insufficient evidence, whether before or after the Creditors’ Meeting, for these claims to be included in the adjudication. This is because REL’s guarantee obligation under the SCG Deeds was a secondary liability, in that, if an Indon Entity defaulted on the primary obligation to its creditor (“Creditor” or “Creditors” as the case may be), REL may be called upon to pay the sum.

</div> There was no need for the Creditors to call upon the SCG Deeds for Aathar’s liability to the Indon Entities to be triggered. The Creditors were not parties to the SCG Deeds and could not have legally called on them. Moreover, there were invoices and demands from the Creditors to the Indon Entities, and the Indon Entities had sent demand letters to REL to fulfil its obligations under the SCG Deeds, which REL failed to do. Thus, the Indon Entities were entitled to call on the guarantee given by Aathar. Next, the Nominee was entitled to rely on evidence adduced by the Indon Entities after the Creditors’ Meeting to determine the disputes concerning his adjudication of their claims.

He allowed the Indon Entities to vote on the maximum limit in the SCG Deeds although their claims <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> exceeded the same. There was also evidence that the respective Indon Entities had called upon the guarantee given by Aathar. The Creditors did not have to, and could not, call upon the guarantees given by REL, as the guarantees were obligations owed by Aathar or REL to the Indon Entities and the Creditors were not privy to the SCG Deeds.

</div> If no Creditor had called upon the guarantees, Aathar’s liability would not be triggered.

A material irregularity can occur at several stages in a proposed VA, and the court is concerned to look at the whole process: <span class="font-italic">Aathar</span><span class="font-italic"> CA</span> ([3] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [40]. An irregularity is “material” if it would likely have made a material difference in the way the creditors would have considered and assessed the terms of the proposed VA if, objectively assessed, the procedure had been carried out correctly (or certain facts truthfully told): <span class="font-italic">Aathar</span><span class="font-italic"> CA </span>at [41]. An irregularity may still be “material” even if the numbers in respect of the irregularity do not at first blush appear capable of changing the outcome of the creditors’ meeting. This depends on the nature of the irregularity and the circumstances of the meeting. A creditor may well be capable of bringing forth “strong evidence to establish that [he] would have had a reasonable prospect of persuading other creditors to change their minds”: <span class="font-italic">Aathar</span><span class="font-italic"> CA</span> at [71].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 The Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Aathar</span><span class="font-italic"> CA</span> shows that there are at least three primary ways by which a material irregularity may arise, namely: (a) a breach of the procedural requirements for the creditors’ meeting; (b) a breach by the debtor of his duty of candour and full disclosure; and (c) a breach by the nominee of his duty of objectivity and scrutiny (see <span class="font-italic">Aathar</span><span class="font-italic"> CA</span> at [71] and [85]–[86]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issues</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 In determining whether there was any material irregularity at or in relation to the Creditors’ Meeting, I consider the following issues.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) How the SCG Deeds are to be interpreted.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Whether the Nominee can rely on evidence produced to him after the Creditors’ Meeting and, if so, for what purpose.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The veracity of the Indon Entities’ claims or proofs of debts, and whether the claims should have been admitted for the purposes of voting.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Whether the Nominee discharged his duty of independence and scrutiny.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Whether Aathar discharged his duty of candour and full disclosure.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-justify font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Degree of scrutiny required of the Nominee and evidence in support</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The “objected to” procedure under r 84(6) of the Bankruptcy Rules (Cap 20, R 1, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the Rules”) is a fallback position where the nominee is in real doubt as to what decision to make; but he “should <span class="font-italic">consider the merits of the debt first</span> as there is no reason for [him] to abdicate his responsibility to make a decision as to admissibility” [emphasis added] (<span class="font-italic">Aathar</span><span class="font-italic"> CA</span> at [53]).

</div> It is clear from the SCG Deeds that the principal debtor or primary obligor to the Creditors are the Indon Entities. The preamble to the SCG Deeds states that the Creditors are “creditors to” Berkah, Fajar or Entete (as the case may be). The term “creditors” is defined as a party “which [an Indon Entity] owes” liabilities, with “liabilities” defined in clause 1 (see [29(b)] above). Further, clause 2.5 of the SCG Deeds states that REL’s shares charged to an Indon Entity cannot be transferred to a Creditor until the Indon Entity uses its own assets to repay the Creditor. It is also inconsistent for Aathar and the Nominee to claim that REL and Aathar are the principal debtors to the Creditors whilst also maintaining that it is the Indon Entities who are contractually liable to their Creditors, that REL and Aathar are guarantors, and that REL and Aathar’s guarantee obligations are triggered only if an Indon Entity’s liability to its Creditor is first triggered. The fact that REL and Aathar are only guarantors is also acknowledged by the Indon Entities.

Thus, REL’s obligation is not as a guarantor to the Indon Entities, but as a guarantor of the Indon Entities’ liabilities by providing a guarantee to the Creditors that the Creditors may enforce. As the Indon Entity is the principal debtor to its Creditor, this would accord with how a guarantee operates. Further, clause 2.1 of the SCG Deed states that REL agrees to guarantee the Indon Entity’s liabilities to the Creditors (up to $20 million each for Fajar and Berkah and $25 million for Entete). This supports the interpretation that REL is to provide a guarantee to the Creditors, and the clause sets the “Limit of Guarantee” of REL on a “joint and several basis” with the Indon Entity.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 I turn to the evidence of the Indon Entities and the Creditors – in particular, the subsequent agreements executed between them which involved REL as a guarantor. I note that the Court of Appeal has not provided a definitive ruling on the admissibility and relevance of evidence of subsequent conduct in contractual interpretation. While there is no absolute prohibition against admitting evidence of subsequent conduct in interpreting a contract, such evidence, if it were to be admitted, must be relevant, reasonably available to all the contracting parties, and relate to a clear and obvious context. The principle of objectively ascertaining contractual intention remains paramount, so the subsequent conduct must go toward proof of what the parties, from an objective viewpoint, ultimately agreed upon. However, where the evidence of subsequent conduct “does no more than echo what were the objectively ascertained intentions of the parties illuminated by the contextual evidence at the time of the contract”, the evidence of subsequent conduct would be “superfluous”: <span class="font-italic">MCH International Pte Ltd and others v YG Group Pte Ltd and others and other appeals</span> [2019] 2 SLR 837 at [18]–[22].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 As the text of the SCG Deeds clearly stipulates that REL’s obligation is to “provide” guarantees “to” the Creditors, recourse to extraneous evidence to interpret the SCG Deeds is unnecessary. Nevertheless, the subsequent agreements between the Indon Entities and their Creditors provide cogent evidence of the parties’ agreement at the time when the SCG Deeds were executed (<span class="font-italic">Centre for Laser and Aesthetic Medicine Pte Ltd v GPK Clinic (Orchard) Pte Ltd and others and another appeal</span> [2018] 1 SLR 180 at [51]) and would confirm this interpretation of the SCG Deeds.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Jo Candra (“Candra”), Entete’s general manager, explained REL’s role <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> Entete, where Entete secured contracts with its Creditors. Candra stated that REL’s obligation was to “contribute in a timely manner the necessary assets and or its guarantees to secure financing facilities for payment of the contractual obligations [of Entete] and or <span class="font-italic">provide guarantees to contracting parties with [</span><span class="font-italic">Entete]</span> in relation to the mining concession operations” [emphasis added].

</div> Although Candra had attested on this after the execution of the SCG Deed, he was attesting to how REL’s guarantee (as subsequently embodied in the SCG Deed) would come about. Indeed, in a subsequent contract between Entete and PT Batubara Kalimantan (“BBK”) (which Entete claims is its Creditor and relies on this contract for its claim against REL and Aathar under the SCG Deed – see further [56] to [59] below), Entete was to obtain a guarantee from REL and the guarantee is to be satisfactory to BBK (pursuant to article 4.4 of that contract). Following from that contract, <span class="font-italic">BBK</span> had notified Entete that Entete <span class="font-italic">and REL</span> had failed to fulfil their contractual obligation.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) In a cooperation agreement dated 21 August 2014 between Fajar and its Creditor (one PT Indokal or “Indokal”) pertaining to coal mining (“Cooperation Agreement”), REL was a party to the Cooperation Agreement as guarantor (see [52] and [54] below). The Cooperation Agreement was relied on by Aathar and the Nominee to support Fajar’s claims under the SCG Deed and showed that Fajar and Indokal had intended to treat REL as a guarantor to Indokal (the Creditor). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Hence, REL’s obligation as a guarantor is to <span class="font-italic">pay the Creditor</span>. It would not make sense if REL’s guarantee obligation is to be discharged by paying the Indon Entities, as this would amount to REL indemnifying the Indon Entities for their liabilities to the Creditors. A guarantor has a right to be indemnified or reimbursed by the principal debtor after the guarantor makes payment to the creditor: see Poh Chu Chai, <span class="font-italic">Guarantees and Performance Bonds </span>(LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2017) (“Poh Chu Chai”) at [11.1.5]; <span class="font-italic">Anson v Anson</span> [1953] 1 WLR 573; and <span class="font-italic">Autocal</span><span class="font-italic"> Holdings Ltd v Jeffery </span>[2017] EWHC 807 (Ch) at [54]. As such, it would be odd if REL’s obligation as guarantor is to pay the Indon Entity, given that REL would be entitled to seek reimbursement from it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Additionally, REL’s guarantee would be triggered only when an Indon Entity has defaulted on its obligation to pay its Creditor<span class="font-italic">.</span> If the principal debtor has paid its debt to the creditor, the guarantor’s obligation – which is secondary and contingent on the principal debtor’s default – is discharged (Geraldine Andrews and Richard Millett, <span class="font-italic">Law of Guarantees</span> (Sweet and Maxwell, 7th Ed, 2015) at 9-002), and the principal debtor cannot seek contribution from the guarantor for the paid debt (Poh Chu Chai at [12.2.3], citing <span class="font-italic">Craythorne</span><span class="font-italic"> v Swinburne</span> (1807) 14 Ves Jun 160).  There is no liability on the guarantor’s part if the underlying obligation ceases to exist (<span class="font-italic">American Home Assurance Co v Hong Lam Marine Pte Ltd</span> [1999] 2 SLR(R) 992 at [40]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 I turn then to consider Aathar’s role as a guarantor. Aathar’s obligation under the SCG Deed is to guarantee “to” the Indon Entity (who is the principal debtor of the Creditor) the “performance of [REL] in accordance to [the SCG Deed]”. REL’s “performance” is to provide guarantees to the Creditors and pay a Creditor where an Indon Entity is in default. Hence, if REL defaults on its guarantee obligation, the Indon Entity can look to Aathar to fulfil his guarantee obligation by Aathar paying the Creditor, or, assuming that Aathar’s obligation is to pay the Indon Entity (which is Aathar’s and the Nominee’s position), by Aathar compensating the Indon Entity for any loss or damage that it has suffered because of REL’s default to pay the Creditor. As will be seen later, regardless of which position is adopted, it would not make a difference to my findings in relation to the veracity of the Indon Entities’ claims and the underlying debts and whether the Nominee has discharged his duty of independence and scrutiny.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The question is what scrutiny the Nominee should have carried out in coming to his decision to mark the Indon Entities’ votes as “objected to” and to the value of $65 million purportedly owed by Aathar to them. In my view, it was incumbent on the Nominee to seek supporting evidence to show that: (a) an Indon Entity owed an outstanding debt or liability to its Creditor (which the Indon Entity had defaulted payment on) and the amount of it; (b) REL was called on (by the Creditor) to satisfy its guarantee to <span class="font-italic">pay the Creditor</span> for the outstanding debt; and (c) the Indon Entity had called on Aathar to fulfil his guarantee obligation because REL had failed to perform its guarantee obligation – and this is for Aathar to either pay the Creditor, or (as per Aathar’s and the Nominee’s case) to compensate the Indon Entity for loss and damage to it as a result of REL’s failure to perform (“the requisite degree of proof” or “chain of demands”). Aathar’s obligation would be triggered only if the Creditor <span class="font-italic">has not been paid</span> (see [37] above). Hence, if an Indon Entity or REL has discharged the debt owed to the Creditor, the Indon Entity cannot seek contribution from Aathar in respect of that debt. In relation to the requisite degree of proof, where a claim is marked “objected to”, the court may determine, on a balance of probabilities, whether the claim is established and the amount of such claim: <span class="font-italic">Re a Company (No 4539 of 1993) </span>[1995] 1 BCLC 459 (“<span class="font-italic">Re a Company</span>”) at 466.

</div> On 13 July 2015, Indokal wrote to Fajar to confirm that Fajar would pay a balance of US$9 million in instalments from 30 June 2015 to 31 January 2016. Then, on 2 December 2015, Indokal demanded from Fajar payment within 7 days of US$6 million in mining costs and US$36 million as “minimum TFF” costs. On 3 December 2015, Indokal issued an invoice of US$6 million to Fajar, and on 4 December 2015, Indokal wrote to Fajar setting out a revised claim for the TFF costs (which was reduced to US$23,760,000), and for a further sum of US$3.96 million. On 5 December 2015, Fajar informed REL of the default notice from Indokal. On 16 December 2015, Fajar wrote to REL (addressing Aathar) to demand payment for all three Indon Entities – in particular, Fajar stated that the amount owing to it (as at 31 December 2015) was $31 million. On 21 December 2015, Indokal confirmed receipt of payment of US$6 million from Fajar. On 5 January 2016, Indokal sent an invoice of US$6 million to Fajar, and on 20 January 2016 it wrote to Fajar setting out a payment of another $6 million. On 4 February 2016, Indokal wrote to Fajar confirming receipt of US$6 million. Finally, on 7 March 2016, Fajar informed Aathar that he owed Fajar $31 million under the SCG Deed, and reiterated the claim in its letter on 27 September 2017 to Aathar.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Likewise, I find the documents cast doubts on the veracity of Fajar’s claim against Aathar. Again, it is odd that Fajar demanded payment from REL for all three Indon Entities. Pertinently, REL was a party to the Cooperation Agreement and by article 2.4 of that agreement, REL was to guarantee “the performance of [Fajar] and will pay all money owed by [Fajar] to [Indokal] if [Fajar] does not pay the amount owed to [Indokal]”. Hence, REL’s obligation was to pay <span class="font-italic">Indokal</span> what Fajar owed and failed to pay Indokal. If so, a demand to REL should have been a demand to pay Indokal, of which there was none.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 In any event, it is unclear how much Fajar owed Indokal in total, particularly after it had paid Indokal US$15 million. Fajar’s letters to REL and Aathar in December 2015 to demand $31 million preceded Fajar’s two payments of US$6 million each in December 2015 and February 2016. After Indokal’s letter of 4 February 2016 to Fajar to confirm receipt of US$6 million from Fajar, there was no evidence of the outstanding amount that Fajar still owed Indokal, before Fajar sent its 7 March 2016 letter to Aathar to state his liability was $31 million. There was also no evidence that anyone had asked REL to discharge the guarantee, which REL failed to do, before Aathar was called upon to pay $31 million. Indeed, Fajar’s demand from Aathar in March 2016 of $31 million was the same amount that it demanded from REL/Aathar in December 2015, although Fajar had paid Indokal US$12 million in the interim.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Entete</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Entete’s only purported Creditor is BBK, and this pertains to a 5 September 2014 agreement for management and distribution of business results between BBK and Entete (“Management Agreement”).

</div> A perusal of the Table revealed inconsistencies in the Nominee’s and Aathar’s positions in relation to Entete’s liability to its Creditors. First, Entete claimed $83 million under the SCG Deed which comprised moneys owed to BBK “as a result of failure of [REL’s] performance” <span class="font-italic">and “other 3</span><span class="font-italic">rd party claims”</span>. This is inconsistent with Aathar’s position before me that Entete had only one Creditor, namely BBK.

</div> If the “other 3rd party claims” were disregarded, the amount purportedly owing to BBK pursuant to the Table was some $42,713,472. Second, the Table showed Entete claiming against REL 50% of the $83 million, on the basis that REL’s liability was “joint and several”, presumably with Entete. If that were the case, 50% of the amount owing to BBK would be about $21,356,736, which is lower than Entete’s claim submitted to the Nominee of about $30.8 million and also lower than the maximum guaranteed limit of $25 million that the Nominee had placed on its claim for the purposes of voting (see [11] above). When queried on all these figures that did not tally, the Nominee agreed that he did not know the basis for the figures and how Entete arrived at its claim of about $30.8 million submitted to him.

</div> The Table was merely one page with no explanation of how the figures were derived.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Hence, I find the veracity of Entete’s claim against Aathar to be doubtful.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 In the round, the documents which the Nominee had sight of before the Creditors’ Meeting, and even after the meeting but before the Chairman’s Report was prepared, did not show how REL’s and Aathar’s obligations had been triggered or how the quantum of each of the Indon Entities’ claims had been derived. The documents adduced after the Chairman’s Report also cast doubt on the Indon Entities’ outstanding liabilities to their Creditors, particularly when they had made payments to their Creditors.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Pertinently, a demand by an Indon Entity against REL to pay <span class="font-italic">the </span><span class="font-italic">Indon Entity</span> would have been inconsistent with REL’s obligation as a guarantor to the Creditor. I agree with the AR that there were no documents to show that a Creditor had called upon the guarantees given by REL. As for Aathar’s obligation, assuming the underlying debts were genuine, there was no evidence that Aathar was asked to pay the Creditor or what loss or damage the Indon Entity had suffered as a result of REL’s default to pay the Creditor and for which the Indon Entity had demanded that Aathar make good (see [38] and [39] above). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-justify font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether materials adduced after a creditors’ meeting may be used to justify a nominee’s adjudication of claims</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The next issue is whether the evidence obtained by the Nominee after the Creditors’ Meeting (“post-meeting evidence”) can be used to justify his adjudication or decision for the purposes of voting at the Creditors’ Meeting, as Aathar and the Nominee submitted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Rule 84(2) of the Rules states that creditors’ votes shall be calculated according to the amount of debt as “at the date of the meeting”. Thus, that date is a reference point for a creditor’s <span class="font-italic">quantum</span> of debt, and not for the <span class="font-italic">evidence</span> to prove that quantum. There is nothing in the BA or the Rules to suggest that post-meeting evidence as to the quantum of debt <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> a creditor cannot be considered by the court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 In <span class="font-italic">Re a </span><span class="font-italic">Company </span>([39] <span class="font-italic">supr</span><span class="font-italic">a</span>), the issue was whether the official receiver, who had presided over a creditors’ meeting, was right in admitting SBP Ltd’s claim as “objected to” and allowing it to vote at the meeting. The court held that the task of the court on an appeal under r 4.70(4) of the Insolvency Rules 1986 (UK) (substantially similar to r 84(7) of the Rules) is “simply to examine the evidence placed before it on the matter and come to a conclusion whether, on balance, the claim against the company is established and, if so, in what amount” and that, in considering the matter, “the court is not confined to the evidence that was before the chairman at the time that he made his decision but is entitled to consider whatever admissible evidence on the issue the parties to the appeal choose to place before the court”. The court found that the evidence before him showed that SBP Ltd – whose claim was for damages against the debtor company – had abandoned that claim prior to the company being wound up. Thus, it was not entitled to be admitted to vote at the creditors’ meeting. Consequently, while the official receiver’s decision to admit SBP Ltd’s claim was correct on the information then available to him, that decision was no longer correct and was reversed by the court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 In <span class="font-italic">Re a debtor (No 574 of 1995)</span> [1998] BCLC 124 (“<span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">A Debtor</span>”) the issue was whether approval for a VA entered into by Mr Scher should be revoked, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, on the ground of material irregularity. NWB, the applicant creditor, submitted that the votes of certain creditors were counted in favour of the proposal when the existence and enforceability of their debts were not established, whether on the material available to the chairman of the meeting or to the court. The court held that <span class="font-italic">Re a Company </span>was applicable to a challenge to a chairman’s decision under r 5.17 of the Insolvency Rules 1986 (UK) (substantially the same as r 84(6) of the Rules). The court was thus not confined to the evidence that was before the chairman but was entitled to consider further admissible evidence placed before it. The court took into account documents and an affirmation by Mr Scher made after the creditors’ meeting and found that the debts were incurred as genuine obligations of Mr Scher, and that they were thus “properly to be considered as debts for the purpose of voting”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Likewise, in <span class="font-italic">Revenue and Customs</span><span class="font-italic"> Commissioners v Maxwell </span>[2010] EWCA Civ 1379 at [61], relating to a creditors’ meeting in administration proceedings, the Court of Appeal held that whilst the quantification and characterization of a debt is to be assessed at the date of administration (based on the interpretation of the Insolvency Rules 1986 (UK)), the court was not restricted to the evidence that was available as at that date for the purposes of ascertaining the figures of the debt.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Thus, evidence that comes to the attention of a nominee or the court after the nominee had adjudicated on the debt and even after the creditors’ meeting held for the purposes of voting (whether or not such evidence was available before or after that time) may be considered by the court for the purposes of determining, on balance, if the claim is established and the quantum of the claim for the purposes of the claimant’s entitlement to vote at the meeting.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 However, the authorities do not stand for the broad proposition that evidence adduced subsequent to a creditors’ meeting can always be considered by the court in determining whether a material irregularity existed at or in relation to the creditors’ meeting. The relevance of post-meeting evidence would depend on the nature of the evidence and the purpose for adducing it. Where the issue is whether the nominee has discharged his duty of independence and scrutiny in determining whether a claim should be admitted for the purposes of voting, it is the nominee’s state of mind and conduct at or before the creditors’ meeting (for the purposes of voting) which is material, and hence one must look at what was actually<span class="font-italic"> </span>presented to the nominee at or before the creditors’ meeting. Likewise, whether a debtor has discharged his duty of full disclosure and candour must be based on his conduct (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, what he had disclosed or revealed) at the time he should have made the disclosure. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether there were any material irregularities</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 I turn then to examine the central issue of whether there were material irregularities at or in relation to the Creditors’ Meeting and in relation to the adjudication of the Indon Entities’ claims (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the veracity and amount of debt). I am satisfied that there were. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Adjudication of the Indon Entities’ claims for the purposes of voting</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 The Nominee had admitted the Indon Entities’ claims on an “objected to” basis and adjudicated the quantum of the claims at the respective maximum guaranteed values. The “objected to” procedure is not an excuse for a nominee to admit all alleged claims by a creditor. A nominee must discharge his duty of independence and scrutiny and <span class="font-italic">satisfy himself</span> that a creditor’s alleged claim is credible. As the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Aathar</span><span class="font-italic"> CA</span> ([3] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) stated at [53]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The “objected to” procedure under r 84(6) of the Rules is a “fallback position where [the nominee] is in [real] doubt as to what decision to make, but [the nominee] should consider the merits of the debt first [as] there is no reason for the [nominee] to abdicate his responsibility to make a decision as to admissibility”: see <span class="font-italic">Personal Insolvency</span>, at para 6.193.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 The Nominee had to scrutinise the Indon Entities’ claims to see if they were supported by objective evidence, before admitting the claims for the purposes of voting. He had to satisfy himself that he had “received adequate information that goes to the veracity of the debts” and to cast a “critical eye” on the debtor’s statement of assets and liabilities (<span class="font-italic">Aathar</span><span class="font-italic"> CA</span> at [89]). This is especially when serious doubts had been raised as to the veracity of the Indon Entities’ claims in the previous VAs, of which the Nominee was aware. The Nominee therefore had a heightened duty of scrutiny in the present case. It is no excuse for him to say that OUELH could have inspected the documents before the Creditors’ Meeting (see <span class="font-italic">Aathar</span><span class="font-italic"> CA</span> at [88]).

</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 In order to consider if the Indon Entities’ debts are genuine and of the value claimed against Aathar, the court can look at the post-meeting evidence. Prior to the Creditors’ Meeting, the Nominee did not have sight of supporting documents to show the requisite chain of demands. Likewise, the post-meeting evidence did not on balance establish the Indon Entities’ claims against Aathar and the amount thereof. There were doubts on the veracity and quantum of the outstanding claims of the Creditors <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> the respective Indon Entity; any demand against REL should have been a demand to pay a Creditor; and any debt owed by Aathar is owed to a Creditor or, if owed to an Indon Entity, the Indon Entity had to show the loss or damage to it because of REL’s failure to discharge its guarantee to pay a Creditor. I repeat the analysis and findings at [32]–[62] above. The Nominee should have rejected the Indon Entities’ claims, instead of marking them as “objected to”, and disallowed them from voting.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Allowing a person who is not entitled to vote to do so amounts to a material irregularity at or in relation to the creditors’ meeting (<span class="font-italic">Re A Debtor</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([66] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at 127). The case of <span class="font-italic">Andrew Fender v The Commissioners of Inland Revenue </span>[2003] EWHC 3543 (Ch) (“<span class="font-italic">Andrew Fender</span>”) is instructive. The debtor seeking a VA was one Lloyd. The nominee and chairman of the creditors’ meeting was Fender.  The vote of one Greville, a key creditor, was challenged. Lloyd’s debt to Greville had allegedly come about through a guarantee for rugby tickets that “the Debtor” had bought. Fender had admitted Greville to vote for £141,000 based on a personal guarantee in respect of tickets Greville sold to ALP (Lloyd’s creditor) and a draft balance sheet produced by Lloyd’s accountants. The guarantee did not identify the party whose obligation was being guaranteed, there was no supporting invoice in respect of any supply by Greville to anyone, and the balance sheet did not show any liability to Greville.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 The English High Court held that the original approval for Lloyd’s VA was obtained by the wrongful admission of Greville’s vote. The Court highlighted the principle that “[l]iability does not arise under a guarantee <span class="font-italic">until the principal obligor has made default</span>” [emphasis added]. Lloyd’s liability was not dependent on the making of a demand on him by Greville, but dependent on the principal obligor’s (ALP’s) failure to perform. The liability under the guarantee was a contingent liability for an unascertained sum. Hence, Fender “should have excluded the Greville vote unless he agreed to put an estimated <span class="font-italic">minimum </span>value on the debt”, but there was “no basis on which he could properly put a <span class="font-italic">minimum</span> value of £141,000”. The draft balance sheet did not show that Greville claimed that sum from ALP, and ALP’s financial statements showed that it might not have received any rugby tickets and hence there was no evidence that the primary obligation had arisen. Thus, to say that the minimum value of Greville’s claim was £141,000 demonstrated “a serious falling short of the standards to be expected of a competent insolvency practitioner”. The Court upheld the decision of the District Judge to revoke the approval given of the VA and ordered that no further creditors’ meeting should be convened. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 In the present case, I am not satisfied that, on balance, the Indon Entities’ claims against Aathar were established. As in <span class="font-italic">Andrew Fender</span>, it was incumbent on the Nominee to check and ask for the supporting documents to prove the chain of demands, particularly as this is Aathar’s <span class="font-italic">third</span> attempt at a VA. As the Indon Entities were also part of the previous proposed VAs, there is simply no excuse for them to <span class="font-italic">still</span> be unable to provide the underlying supporting documents to the Nominee at or before the Creditors’ Meeting. This is particularly when all the documents (including the post-meeting documents) would have been in existence since <span class="font-italic">2017 and before, many of them even in existence since the proposed 1</span><span class="font-italic">st and 2nd VAs and well before Aathar filed his third VA application in 2019</span>. As such, I find that there is a material irregularity in admitting the Indon Entities’ claims and at the maximum guaranteed value under the SCG Deeds (even if marked as “objected” to) and allowing the Indon Entities to vote on that basis.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Nominee’s duty of independence and scrutiny</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 I also find that the Nominee has failed to discharge his duty of independence and scrutiny, which amounted to a material irregularity. In this regard, the post-meeting evidence could not, in my view, be taken into account (see [63]–[69] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 First, the Nominee admitted the Indon Entities’ claims and allowed them to vote up to the maximum guaranteed value under the SCG Deeds, even though he did not see any supporting documents to prove the requisite chain of demands. This is despite the fact that the Nominee was well aware of the decision in <span class="font-italic">Aathar</span><span class="font-italic"> CA </span>([3] <span class="font-italic">s</span><span class="font-italic">upra</span>) that it was <span class="font-italic">already</span> incumbent on the nominee in the proposed 2nd VA to be “circumspect” about “the veracity of the explanations put forth” by Aathar and the creditors, given the various doubts that had already<span class="font-italic"> </span>arisen during his proposed 1st VA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 Next, the Nominee then informed the creditors, at the start of the Creditors’ Meeting, that the purpose of the meeting was “not to discuss the adjudication of debts or details of the same” but to discuss the amended proposal.

</div> As the Final Adjudication was circulated to the creditors only one day before the Creditors’ Meeting, it would not be unreasonable for the creditors to raise objections, regarding the Nominee’s adjudication of the debts, only at that meeting. Yet, the Nominee had forbade the creditors from doing so. This suggests that he was not acting objectively or independently from the get-go. Indeed, the Nominee had previously represented to the AR on 30 April 2019 (at a hearing pertaining to the application for a creditors’ meeting to be called) that he would adjudicate the specific quantum of the debts, and <span class="font-italic">hear </span><span class="font-italic">representations on the proper values to be attributed to the claims</span> at the creditors’ meeting if the court were to approve it to be called.

This can also be seen from the way the Nominee conducted the process and his manner of adjudication. The Nominee’s approach towards the Indon Entities’ claims was inconsistent with his approach to the Litigation Claims. He had applied a 90% discount to the Litigation Claims, on the basis that they were contingent claims dependent on the outcome of the litigation and that they had not crystallised at the time of the Creditors’ Meeting.

This is especially given that no one, including the Nominee, had appealed against the AR’s decision on the Crest Entities’ claims. Also, the Crest Entities were not notified of these proceedings even though the Nominee agrees that they should be given an opportunity to be heard pertaining to any consideration of the merits of their claims (particularly where the Nominee is arguing for a downward revision of those claims).

</div> Nevertheless, as to whether the Crest Entities’ claims should be reduced, I will return to this cursorily (as I do not think it is appropriate to deal with it), to show that the Nominee’s argument (and Aathar’s argument in the same vein) would fail (see [90] to [93] below).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 I also add that, in relation to the Golden Cliff claim, Litigation Claims and Enterprise Fund II claim which the Nominee had adjudicated and included for the Creditors’ Meeting, the AR had found no material irregularities in the adjudication or inclusion and the AR’s decision pertaining to these claims were not appealed against. Aathar’s appeal before me is only in respect of the AR’s decision that there was a material irregularity in including the Indon Entities’ claims of $65 million and the revocation of the approval given at the Creditors’ Meeting.

A debtor who puts forward a proposed voluntary arrangement should not only be honest, but should also take care to put all relevant facts before the creditors, and the onus is on him to be forthcoming to his creditors (<span class="font-italic">Aathar</span><span class="font-italic"> CA</span> ([3] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [76]). Aathar had failed to provide full and frank disclosure of the Indon Entities’ claims, by failing to provide supporting documents to prove the chain of demands at or before the Creditors’ Meeting. This is despite the fact that this is his third attempt at a VA, the Indon Creditors have been claiming the debts since the proposed 1st VA, and the documents which could have shown the chain of demands would have been available since 2017 if not earlier. Any documents to show a Creditor calling on REL to discharge its obligation to the Creditor, if it existed, would have been within the ability of Aathar (who owned REL) to provide, well before the Nominee had adjudicated the Indon Entities’ claims and before the Creditors’ Meeting. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 Further, the slow and piecemeal manner in which the evidence and documents came about (including those mentioned at [35] above produced only after the Chairman’s Report) suggests that the Indon Entities and Aathar/REL have been slow to give a complete picture in relation to the SCG Deeds, the Creditors and the outstanding amounts owed to them by the Indon Entities.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 I also find that Aathar has been less than honest in relation to the funding provided by PT Cahaya for the proposed 3rd VA. In Aathar’s amended proposal for the 3rd VA dated 5 April 2019 prepared for the purpose of recommending a creditors’ meeting to be called, he proposed that $2.5 million be set aside to pay the creditors over four years from the approval of the VA, and that, out of this sum, the Nominee’s remuneration would be paid in priority. The $2.5 million to be provided by PT Cahaya would be in exchange for Aathar’s services as an “exclusive consultant” to it for five years.

</div> Herman (PT Cahaya’s representative) had attested, shortly before the Creditors’ Meeting (and whose affidavit was placed before the creditors only on the day of the Creditors’ Meeting), that PT Cahaya had agreed to contribute the $2.5 million “to be paid via the Nominee to [Aathar’s] creditors” in instalments with the first instalment to be paid within two months after approval under s 51(1) of the BA is obtained. Interestingly, Herman further attested that PT Cahaya had “already advanced S$100,000 out of the S$2,500,000 to help [Aathar] in his IVA legal fees”.

Before me, Aathar’s counsel, Mr Goh, clarified that the present appeal pertains only to the Indon Entities’ claims, and when asked why the Crest Entities’ claims were being raised in the present appeal, Mr Goh stated that he had “no idea” and that Aathar was not challenging the Nominee’s adjudication of these claims.

</div> As such (and given Aathar’s about-turn), it would not be appropriate for me to consider the merits of the Crest Entities’ claims.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 Nevertheless, for completeness, I would have been unable to accept Aathar’s submission in any event. Rule 84(2) of the Rules provides that votes shall be calculated according to the amount of the debt “as at the date of the meeting”. Hence, there is no basis for recalculating the value ascribed to the debt on the basis of a change in the value occurring after the creditors’ meeting. To allow otherwise would mean that the decision of the creditors whether to approve a VA could potentially be reopened whenever a contingent creditor’s claim is crystallised, modified or extinguished after the meeting. Even if the point that Aathar (and the Nominee) wishes to make is that the court should take this into account to allow a further creditors’ meeting to be convened, I would not have allowed this (see [95] to [96] below).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 In conclusion, I agree with the AR that the approval given at the Creditors’ Meeting should be revoked. There were several material irregularities in Aathar’s proposed 3rd VA, and the Indon Entities’ claims totalling $65 million should have been disregarded for the purposes of voting.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 In <span class="font-italic">Andrew Fender</span> ([74] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), the English High Court, in determining that no further creditors’ meeting should be convened, stated at [31]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Mr Fender has shown a serious lack of competence both in his assessment of the Greville claim and in the expression of an opinion which he did not hold … The only point of a further meeting would be to enable Mr Fender to exercise the power conferred by Rule 5.17(3) as to the assessment of the minimum value of the Greville claim. <span class="font-italic">Having regard to the way in which he and Mr Lloyd approached the task in the past I do not think it fair to the creditors as a whole that he should be invited to exercise the power again</span>. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 I am of the view that the same applies to the present facts. The material irregularities go beyond mere procedural breaches that can be rectified by summoning another creditors’ meeting, and relate to the Nominee’s abject failure to fulfil his duty of independence and scrutiny and Aathar’s failure to discharge his duty of candour and disclosure. There is no assurance that directing the Nominee to summon another creditors’ meeting will rectify the issue. In any event, having discounted the Indon Entities’ claims of $65 million, the value in support of Aathar’s proposed 3rd VA would be about 74.12% in value (see [18] above), which would fall below the 75% threshold. I reiterate: the Nominee and Aathar were well aware of the previous court decisions pertaining to the 1st and 2nd VAs. It was thus incumbent on the Nominee to exercise a greater degree of scrutiny and care in assessing the proposed 3rd VA and to ensure that he discharged his duty of independence and objectivity. It was also incumbent on Aathar to fulfil his duty of candour and honesty and to put forth all relevant facts and material before the creditors. The documents that were put forth after the Creditors’ Meeting and Chairman’s Report were in existence since 2017 or earlier (based on the dates of the documents), yet they were not disclosed before the Creditors’ Meeting.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 I thus dismiss the appeal.
