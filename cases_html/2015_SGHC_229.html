<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This case concerns an order of court that was
                    sought by the plaintiff-executors (“the Plaintiffs”) for the sale
                    of a plot of land at Coronation Road (“the Property”), originally
                    bought in 1966, co-owned by the deceased persons and the surviving parties. This
                    application for an order for sale followed from an earlier action involving
                    them. In the earlier action, the 1st Defendant, Quek Hung Heong, sought to
                    establish that he was the sole beneficial owner of the Property. While one of
                    the other co-owners did not contest this, the 1st Defendant failed against the
                    rest. Given the state of relations and the impracticability of dividing the
                    Property, the Plaintiffs thus sought the sale of the Property in the present
                    proceedings. The 1st Defendant however resisted this by raising a number of
                    arguments, including that he was entitled to exclusive possession, that the
                    Plaintiffs were estopped from claiming the Property, and that he had obtained
                    adverse possession. I found that he did not succeed on any of these points, and
                    that the Property should be sold with the proceeds divided. I also found that he
                    could not raise the claim in proprietary estoppel as this should have been
                    raised in the earlier proceedings. The 1st Defendant has appealed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       In 1966, the Quek family purchased the Property
                        (<em>ie</em>, a plot of land at Coronation Road), upon
                    which a bungalow presently stands. The Quek family members held the Property as
                    tenants-in-common in equal shares. The registered proprietors are:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_a"></a>(a)     Quek Cher Choi, the father. He passed
                        away in 1981.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_b"></a>(b)     Heng Sai Kee, the mother. She passed away in 1986.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_c"></a>(c)     Kwek Hann Song, the oldest child. He
                        passed away in 2006.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_d"></a>(d)     Quek Yang Eng, the middle child; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_e"></a>(e)     Quek Hung Heong, the youngest
                    child.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The Plaintiffs are the estates of the
                        parents. They seek an order against the other owners or their respective
                        estates for the sale of the Property. As noted, the 1st Defendant is Quek
                        Hun Heong. The 2nd Defendant is Quek Yang Eng and the 3rd and 4th Defendants
                        are the executor and executrix of Kwek Hann Song. None of the other
                        Defendants aside from the 1st Defendant took an active part in these
                        proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The 1st Defendant had actually launched an
                    action, <em>Quek Hung Heong v Tan Bee Hoon (executrix for estate
                        of Quek Cher Choi, deceased) and others and another suit</em> [2014]
                    SGHC 17 (“S 722”), against the other four owners, claiming the
                    whole beneficial interest in the Property and seeking its transfer to him. He
                    founded his claim on various equitable bases including a resulting trust, a
                    constructive trust and proprietary estoppel. Quek Yang Eng consented to judgment
                    in favour of the 1st Defendant. The suit was dismissed by Coomaraswamy J, who
                    found that the other owners beneficially owned their own share.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Following the conclusion of S 722, the
                    Plaintiffs sought sale in lieu of partition. The 3rd and 4th Defendants
                    supported the position of the Plaintiffs; the 2nd Defendant, Quek Yang Eng, was
                    only a nominal defendant. The 1st Defendant resisted the Plaintiffs’
                    application.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Additional arguments invited</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       After hearing arguments, and reserving judgment,
                    I invited additional arguments on the following questions:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_a"></a>(a)     Whether proprietary estoppel, as
                        opposed to promissory estoppel, can be used to acquire new rights and can
                        thus operate as a cause of action? See for example, <em>Thorner v Major and others</em> [2009] UKHL 18 (“<em>Thorner v Major</em>”). If a proprietary estoppel
                        is found to arise, the remedy awarded by the Court is at the Court’s
                        discretion: <em>Low Heng Leon Andy v Low Kian Beng Lawrence
                            (administrator of the estate of Tan Ah Kng, deceased)</em> [2013]
                        3 SLR 710.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_b"></a>(b)     On
                        this basis, is the 1st Defendant barred from raising proprietary estoppel by
                        the rule in <em>Henderson v Henderson</em> [1843-1860]
                        All ER Rep 378 (“<em>Henderson v
                        Henderson</em>”), <em>ie</em>, the rule
                        against abuse of process, also known as the expanded <em>res
                            judicata</em> doctrine? See <em>Goh Nellie v Goh
                            Lian Teck and others</em> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 453 (“<em>Goh Nellie</em>”). In particular, are there
                            <em>bona fide</em> reasons why the proprietary
                        estoppel claimed here, and the other grounds raised by the 1st Defendant,
                        such as the claim in ‘adverse possession’, were not raised in S
                        722?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_c"></a>(c)     As the
                        remedy is discretionary, does the rejection in S 722 of a proprietary
                        estoppel claim giving rise to a beneficial interest bar, whether on
                            <em>Henderson v Henderson</em>, <em>res judicata</em> or issue estoppel grounds, the present
                        proprietary estoppel claim of exclusive possession for his lifetime? That
                        is, could the 1st Defendant, (who was the plaintiff in S 722), have asked
                        the court there to award exclusive possession for his lifetime, and did his
                        omission then prevent him from raising this in the present
                        proceedings?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Plaintiffs’ Case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The Plaintiffs argued that the Property should
                    be subject to sale in lieu of partition. Sale was necessary, expedient and more
                    appropriate. Partition would be impractical and unworkable. Sale on the other
                    hand would allow the value of the Property to be realised. As to the arguments
                    made by the 1st Defendant in resisting the sale, it was argued that the
                    Plaintiffs’ actions were neither time barred by adverse possession, or by
                    the doctrine of laches. The latter in particular was not applicable as the
                    Plaintiffs’ claim was legal and not equitable. Neither was there any
                    proprietary estoppel, nor issue estoppel against the Plaintiffs. In the
                    circumstances, sale should be ordered without any crediting for the value of
                    improvements or consequential orders sought by the 1st Defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       As to the questions raised by the Court, the
                    Plaintiffs argued that the 1st Defendant’s arguments on proprietary
                    estoppel and adverse possession were indeed an abuse of process, infringing the
                    rule in <em>Henderson v Henderson</em>. In particular, the
                    1st Defendant’s claims in the present case were a collateral attack on the
                    decision in S 722, and the 1st Defendant relied essentially on the same facts as
                    in S 722. The claims in the present application should have been raised in the
                    earlier proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The 1st Defendant’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The 1st Defendant resisted the application,
                    seeking to have exclusive possession of the Property, during his lifetime. The
                    1st Defendant argued that the claim by the Plaintiffs for sale was time barred
                    under the Limitation Act (Cap 163, Rev Ed 1996) (“the Limitation
                    Act”) and by the adverse possession of the Property by the 1st Defendant.
                    The claim of adverse possession was not an assertion of title, and therefore the
                    Land Titles Act (Cap 157, Rev Ed 2004) (“the LTA”) did not come
                    into play. There was also laches and/or acquiescence against the
                    Plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The Plaintiffs were estopped, through a
                    representation and reliance – no action was taken to dispossess the 1st
                    Defendant, and he suffered detriment in the form of expenditure on the Property,
                    as well as losing the opportunity of having his own property. Alternatively, the
                    others had obtained a benefit and gained – this is sufficient to establish
                    promissory estoppel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     As for the sale of the Property, this was
                    neither necessary nor expedient. No urgency was shown. In any event, even if
                    sale should be ordered, time should be given for the 1st Defendant to find
                    alternative accommodation. The 1st Defendant also counterclaimed under O 28 r 7
                    of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R5, Rev Ed 2014) for improvements made by him
                    relating to improvements made on the Property, property taxes paid by him and
                    the freeing in 1981 of an encumbrance over the Property. As against the 3rd and
                    4th Defendants, <em>res judicata</em>
                applied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     No issue estoppel arises in the present case.
                    Neither was the issue at hand fundamental to the previous decision in S 722.
                    That earlier suit did not investigate the 1st Defendant’s right of
                    exclusive possession. The rule in <em>Henderson v
                        Henderson</em> was not engaged either: the 1st Defendant was not
                    required to raise the issue of exclusive possession earlier. Only the beneficial
                    interest was a live issue in S 722. There was no abuse of process. In
                    particular, he did not seek to challenge any of the conclusions in the earlier
                    suit. If anything, the abuse of process argument would also apply to the
                    Plaintiffs in their claim for possession or sale.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>I found that the Plaintiffs’ application for sale should be
                    granted. The various grounds relied upon by the 1st Defendant in resisting the
                    application were not made out.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     I concluded that the 1st Defendant was
                        precluded from raising proprietary estoppel on the basis of the letters as
                        that was a matter he should reasonably have raised in the earlier suit: in
                        other words, it was an abuse of process for him to raise proprietary
                        estoppel in the present proceedings. On the other hand, neither cause of
                        action nor issue estoppel operated against him. In any event, even if the
                        1st Defendant was not barred from raising proprietary estoppel in the
                        present case, this was not made out. Neither was adverse possession nor
                        promissory estoppel made out. Given this, there was nothing to stand in the
                        way of the Plaintiffs’ application for partition or sale in lieu of
                        partition. Sale was preferable in the circumstances of the case. However,
                        some of the expenditure incurred by the 1st Defendant had to be taken into
                        account, and this was reflected in my order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     As a preliminary point, it should be noted
                    that these grounds deal with estoppel in three main guises:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_a"></a>(a)     Estoppel in respect of past
                        decisions in the form of cause of action estoppel and issue
                    estoppel;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_b"></a>(b)     Proprietary estoppel; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_c"></a>(c)     Promissory estoppel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Care has to be taken to ensure that the requirements of each use are borne
                        in mind; inadvertent eliding of the differences is to be avoided. The
                        distinction is most marked between (a) on the one hand, with (b) and (c) on
                        the other. In (a), the estoppel is in the ability of the parties to avoid
                        the binding effect of previous judicial determination. In the latter, the
                        estoppel is concerned with whether one party can move away from a particular
                        position that it had held out to the other. Proprietary estoppel operates to
                        give effect to what is held out even to the extent of affecting the
                        proprietary rights of the implicated party. Promissory estoppel protects an
                        expectation of forbearance in an existing relationship. It may be that the
                        lines between promissory estoppel and proprietary estoppel may blur further
                        in future, but that is outside the scope of these
                grounds.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The 1st Defendant’s submissions
                    interweaved the discussion of proprietary estoppel and promissory estoppel.
                    While the requirements of representation, reliance and detriment overlap, to my
                    mind, it is inadvisable to combine any discussion of the two doctrines in this
                    way – there remain significant differences between them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     I should also note that acquiescence was
                    considered in the proceedings in two senses: as an aspect of representation in
                    proprietary estoppel, and as a defence in equity. The latter will be discussed
                    briefly towards the end of these grounds.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Abuse of Process</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     I found that the 1st Defendant was precluded
                    from asserting proprietary estoppel as a basis of resisting the application by
                    the Plaintiffs. As noted above, the earlier proceedings involved a claim by the
                    1st Defendant against the Plaintiffs and the other present Defendants that the
                    Property was held in trust for him, and that they should transfer their
                    respective shares to him. The primary basis was that this reflected a family
                    arrangement made by the parties. In the course of his decision on the claim,
                    Coomaraswamy J found that proprietary estoppel based on that family arrangement
                    was not made out: at [122]. As proprietary estoppel and indeed the assertion of
                    a full beneficial interest was raised in the earlier suit, S 722, the invocation
                    by the 1st Defendant of proprietary estoppel in the present case was an abuse of
                    process since it should have reasonably been raised in S 722, and. he did not
                    give adequate reason why this was not done.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The 1st Defendant argued that in the earlier
                    proceedings, the only live issue was the beneficial interest claimed by the 1st
                    Defendant. It was not unreasonable therefore for the 1st Defendant not to have
                    addressed the exclusive possession claim in that case. No abusive element arose
                    from the circumstances of the case. It was said that it never occurred to him
                    nor was it in his contemplation to assert proprietary estoppel in order to
                    assert exclusive possession. It was further argued that the Plaintiffs should
                    have been under an obligation to raise their present claim in the earlier
                    proceedings as well. The 1st Defendant contended that in the earlier
                    proceedings, parties were only concerned with the beneficial interest. I found
                    that none of these arguments could hold.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The statement of the rule in Henderson v Henderson</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The rule in <em>Henderson v
                        Henderson</em> essentially states that a party will not be allowed to
                    raise an issue which could have been raised and determined in earlier
                    proceedings: <em>Barrow v Bankside Members Agency Ltd</em>
                    [1996] 1 All ER 981. This may be an assertion of the general inherent
                    jurisdiction of the court: Professor Zuckerman in <em>Principles
                        of Civil Procedure</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2nd Ed, 2006)
                        (“<em>Principles of Civil
                    Procedure</em>”) para 25.101. The scope of the rule has been much
                    considered and refined since its first pronouncement in <em>Henderson v Henderson</em>. In certain circumstances, abuse of
                    process would be committed by a party arguing a point in current proceedings
                    which could have been raised in earlier proceedings. The rule is essentially
                    founded on a need to protect the administration of justice, by preventing
                    relitigation. In broad terms, it helps protect against a party having multiple
                    bites at the cherry.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The rule was considered in <em>Goh Nellie</em>. Citing <em>Hunter v Chief Constable
                        of the West Midlands Police</em> [1982] AC 529 (“<em>Hunter</em>”), and after referring to the local cases
                    of <em>Kwa Ban Cheong v Kuah Boon Sek</em> [2003] 3 SLR(R)
                    644 (“<em>Kwa Ban Cheong</em>”) and <em>Lai Swee Lin Linda v AG</em> [2006] 2 SLR(R) 565
                        (“<em>Linda Lai</em>”), Sundaresh Menon
                    JC stated at [53] :</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… a court should determine whether there is an abuse of process by
                        looking at all the circumstances of the case, including whether the later
                        proceedings in substance is nothing more than a collateral attack upon the
                        previous decision; whether there is fresh evidence that might warrant
                        re-litigation; whether there are <em>bona fide</em>
                        reasons why an issue that ought to have been raised in the earlier action
                        was not; and whether there are some other special circumstances that might
                        justify allowing the case to proceed. The absence or existence of these
                        enumerated factors (which are not intended to be exhaustive) is not
                        decisive.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Menon JC emphasised that in determining whether abuse of
                        process arose, there should be consideration of the balance between allowing
                        a litigant his day in court, and the undue oppression that would result to
                        the defendant because of repeated litigation. What needed to be determined
                        was whether, considering the circumstances of the earlier proceedings, the
                        issue ought really to have been raised at that time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     As noted by Professor Zuckerman in <em>Principles of Civil Procedure</em> at para 25.105:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [T]here is no hard and fast rule in this regard. Whether a party
                        would be prevented from advancing a claim or an issue he could have advanced
                        in previous proceedings will depend on the circumstances of the case. In
                        determining whether to allow a party to advance such cause or issue the
                        court will consider whether it was reasonable or desirable to advance the
                        cause or issue in previous proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">From this, it can be derived that the fact that an issue was not raised in
                        earlier litigation does not by itself bar raising it subsequently. There
                        must be something in the nature of an abuse.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Situations where no abuse arises</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Cases in which the rule in <em>Henderson v Henderson</em> were not held to apply can generally be
                    seen as involving reasonable grounds for not having raised the issue earlier.
                    This explains the cases cited by the 1st Defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_a"></a>(a)     Consequential matters. A number of
                        these cases were concerned with the second action coming as a consequence of
                        the first. Where the latter proceedings flowed out of the earlier, to deal
                        with consequential matters or to effect a remedy contemplated in the earlier
                        proceedings, there would not be any abuse of process. The case of <em>Lee Hiok Tng v Lee Hiok Tng</em> [2001] 1 SLR(R) 771
                        concerned a second action following on as a consequence of the first. There
                        is also <em>Ng Chee Chong and another v Toh Kouw and
                            another</em> [1999] 2 SLR(R) 909, which concerned an earlier
                        action for a deposit, and a later action for wrongful
                    repudiation.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_b"></a>(b)     New
                        circumstances. Another instance in which no abuse would be found would be
                        where new circumstances arise. So for instance in the case of <em>Ching Mun Fong (executrix of the estate of Tan Geok Tee,
                            deceased) v Liu Cho Chit and another appeal</em> [2000] 1 SLR(R)
                        53, the mistake of law was not known in the earlier
                    proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_c"></a>(c)     Impecuniosity or other explanation for initial inaction. A category of
                        situations in which reasonableness was shown would include the case of
                            <em>Bradford &amp; Bingley Building Society v
                            Seddon</em> [1999] 1 WLR 1482, in which claims were not sought
                        initially because of impecuniosity. As for the case of <em>Low Heng Leon Andy v Low Kian Beng Lawrence (administrator of the
                            estate of Tan Ah Kng, deceased)</em> [2013] 3 SLR 710, the earlier
                        proceedings were terminated by consent order, which presents a different
                        context: the circumstances giving rise to a consent order, especially the
                        facts that may have been the basis of the consent order, have to be
                        carefully considered by the court. In some cases, there may be a distinct
                        difference in the facts as understood, and facts subsequently uncovered. It
                        may be that subsequent proceedings should more readily be allowed
                        then.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_d"></a>(d)     Reasonable grounds. A broader class where the rule is not applicable
                        encompasses situations where it is reasonable that the issue or argument was
                        not raised. The case of <em>Goh Nellie</em> illustrates
                        this. On the facts of that case, it was found that the rule was not engaged.
                        That case concerned the devise of two properties by the deceased there to
                        her children. One of the children, R, applied for and obtained in
                        Originating Summons No 618 of 2005 (“OS 618/2005”) an order
                        that she could reside in one of the properties rent free and that it could
                        not be sold without her consent. Subsequently, an order for sale for the
                        property was sought by some of the other beneficiaries in Originating
                        Summons No 950 of 2006 (“OS 950/2006”). An application was
                        thus made under the Trustees Act to sanction the sale. Menon JC found that
                        the order made in OS 618/2005 related only to R’s right of residence
                        and was not similar or identical to her right of veto of sale in OS
                        950/2006. There was thus no abuse of process.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     In comparison, cases where the rule was
                    properly invoked are as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_a"></a>(a)     Those in which it is clear that
                        there is nothing more than re-litigation and an attack on a prior decision.
                            <em>Kwa Ban Cheong</em> and <em>Linda Lai</em> are examples of this. And in <em>Kwa Ban Cheong</em>, Belinda Ang J noted that re-litigation could
                        arise even if different plaintiffs were involved; in that case, it was held
                        that it was an abuse of process for the plaintiff to seek adjudication on
                        the title to shares when this had been already decided in previous
                        proceedings. And in <em>Linda Lai</em>, the plaintiff
                        was barred from raising judicial review in her claim as that had already
                        been determined earlier, albeit against a different formal party. She was
                        additionally barred from raising matters which should have been raised in
                        the earlier proceedings. The Court of Appeal additionally found that despite
                        a difference in the remedies claimed, it would have been abuse of process
                        for her to proceed.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_b"></a>(b)     Those in which it is clear that the issue would have readily refuted
                        the initial claim. This is illustrated by the Privy Council decision of
                            <em>Yat Tung Investment Co Ltd v Dao Heng Bank
                            Ltd</em> [1975] AC 581 (“<em>Yat
                            Tung</em>”). In that case, the initial proceedings involved
                        a claim by the appellant that a mortgage supposedly given over its property
                        to a bank was a nullity. The counterclaim by a bank for a mortgage balance
                        was allowed. In that case, no question was raised by the customer of the
                        bank about the power of sale exercised by the bank. Subsequently, the
                        customer sought a declaration that the sale by the bank was fraudulent. The
                        Privy Council held that the second proceedings were an abuse of process
                        because the issue of fraud should have been raised in the initial
                        proceedings. While the remarks on what constituted abuse of process given by
                        Lord Kilbrandon in the advice of the Privy Council have been rejected in
                            <em>Johnson v Gore Wood &amp; Co</em> [2002] 2 AC
                        1, the actual result has not. What is common between <em>Yat
                            Tung</em> and the present application was that the issue raised
                        the second time around in both cases was something that could have been
                        readily refuted in the initial claim; where such an issue is not raised
                        until later, it is clearly an abuse of process. Another instance is found in
                        the case of <em>Talbot v Berkshire County Council</em>
                        [1994] QB 290. A claim for injuries was made following an earlier claim for
                        contribution for an accident. The claim of injuries was
                    barred.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Much depends on an appreciation of the overall
                    justice of the case. It is unlikely that any definitive rule could be developed.
                    In <em>De Crittenden v Bayliss</em> [2005] EWCA Civ 1425
                        (“<em>De Crittenden</em>”), the English
                    Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal against the decision of the judge at first
                    instance finding that the action should be dismissed as the claim made should
                    have been raised in earlier proceedings. In this case, much turned on the
                    inability of the court to fully inquire into the matter because the main
                    protagonists had passed away. The complexity of the earlier action may also be
                    material: <em>Aldi Stores Limited v WSP Group PLC and
                        Ors</em> [2007] EWCA Civ 1260. That case concerned complex commercial
                    litigation resulting from building damage to a supermarket, involving the
                    operators of the supermarket, builders, and specialist consultants. In essence,
                    the plaintiff was faced by an argument that it was barred from proceeding in the
                    action as it should have raised its claim in its actions against one Holmes
                    (“H”) as H would have in turn joined the defendants. The English
                    Court of Appeal found that there was no abuse as the decision made by the
                    plaintiff was reasonable in view of the complexity of the litigation there. The
                    case of <em>Booth v Booth</em> [2010] EWCA Civ 27 is also
                    probably best seen as an illustration of a holistic assessment: it would seem
                    that in that case the English Court of Appeal would have been inclined to allow
                    a striking out on the basis of abuse of process as the issues had been raised in
                    earlier litigation, but did not do so as the point was not taken up till
                    substantial rights had been determined in the second litigation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Application to the present case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In the present case, the assertion of
                    proprietary estoppel did amount to an abuse of process given that this was
                    claimed, albeit on a different basis, in S 722. It was in effect an attack on
                    the previous action in S 722, in which the Court there found that the claim made
                    by the present 1st Defendant in proprietary estoppel on the basis of the family
                    arrangements was not made out? The basis of the judge’s finding was that
                    there was no family arrangement on the evidence, as there were internal
                    inconsistencies in the 1st Defendant’s evidence, there was no support from
                    relevant accounts or documents, and subsequent actions were inconsistent with
                    any family arrangements.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     I did not accept the 1st Defendant’s
                    arguments. The 1st Defendant argued that there was no abuse: firstly, <em>bona fide</em> reasons existed why exclusive possession was
                    not raised in S 722, as the 1st Defendant’s focus was on beneficial
                    ownership and the proprietary estoppel claim was on the basis of inaction over
                    the years, particularly after letters had been sent by lawyers acting for the
                    parents and Kwek Hann Song; and secondly, , if <em>Henderson v
                        Henderson</em> should apply to the 1st Defendant, it should also apply
                    to the Plaintiffs in respect of their claim</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">Proprietary estoppel was to the same effect</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     As noted above, the 1st Defendant sought to
                    invoke proprietary estoppel as a property right to defeat or at least modify the
                    Plaintiffs’ claim. The assertion of this property right here was just a
                    mirror image of the claim that the 1st Defendant launched against the other
                    co-owners in S 722: what was raised here was a defence, while what was raised in
                    S 722 was a cause of action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     As will be considered below, proprietary
                    estoppel is a broad and discretionary doctrine that aims to vindicate
                    representations or promises made, which are supported by detrimental reliance by
                    the claimant. In dealing with the possibility of abuse of process in the context
                    of a proprietary estoppel claim, one must look at a broad factual substratum:
                    there can be variation in representations and reliance that are easily raised or
                    invoked. This is not to say that there can only be one shot at making out
                    proprietary estoppel, but there must be a markedly different set of
                    circumstances relied upon, and an entirely different proprietary remedy sought.
                    A party cannot finesse the representation relied on: given the broad nature of
                    the doctrine, almost any statement, action or omission could theoretically be
                    the basis of a claim of representation. While it is true that the
                    representations were on the surface different, this did not bring the present
                    case out of the rule. One was founded on the family arrangements. The other on
                    inaction. Had they been the same, either <em>res
                        judicata</em> or issue estoppel would have applied. However, even with
                    this surface difference, the basis of the 1st Defendant’s assertion that
                    the Plaintiffs were bound by a representation made by them, causing the 1st
                    Defendant to incur detrimental reliance, was the same in both s 722 and the
                    present case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     It is also pertinent that in the present case
                    what is at stake is the Plaintiffs’ assertion of rights flowing from
                    ownership recognised and vindicated in S 722. The 1st Defendant was attacking
                    the result and determination in that case: he sought to assert a larger interest
                    than his acknowledged share, by way of a property right derived from proprietary
                    estoppel after it had been decided that the 1st Defendant had only an equal
                    share alongside the other co-owners. The fact of the matter is that the 1st
                    Defendant raised the point that he had a beneficial interest in the earlier
                    proceedings, invoking multiple grounds as a basis. It would have been reasonable
                    for him to have raised his current proprietary estoppel claim then. While the
                    present claim is for a proprietary estoppel founded on a different basis and a
                    different specific remedy, it is of the same broad nature as his previous
                    claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     In addition, while the remedy sought differs
                    in that the 1st Defendant now asks for an equity to be recognised for his
                    exclusive possession of the Property during his life time, rather than a sole
                    beneficial interest, it was a claim that he could have made earlier as well in S
                    722. The fact that the specific remedies may be different does not mean that
                    abuse would not arise. What matters is whether the issue was indeed raised in
                    the earlier proceedings. <em>Linda Lai</em> illustrates
                    this point. The Court of Appeal there gave short shrift to the appellant’s
                    argument that abuse or <em>res judicata</em> did not arise
                    because she had sought a quashing order previously, as opposed to her instant
                    claim of a declaration: see <em>Linda Lai</em> at [56] to
                    [61].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In the present case, it is significant that
                    the remedy that may be ordered is at the discretion of the Court. The Court
                    aims, when a proprietary estoppel claim is made out, to craft a remedy or equity
                    that vindicates the representation or promise giving rise to the proprietary
                    estoppel. This may thus take various forms. Conceivably, it may even involve the
                    payment of a sum of money. At the other end of the spectrum would be the
                    granting of a full beneficial interest in the Property. As the remedy is
                    discretionary, conceivably, the previous action founded on proprietary estoppel
                    could have resulted in the 1st Defendant’s success in that case by way of
                    an order for exclusive possession. A party cannot invoke variations on the theme
                    of the proprietary remedy that is claimed. Permitting this would again be too
                    loose, resulting in a never ending series of different proprietary estoppel
                    claims.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The 1st Defendant argued that what was at
                    stake in the first action was a claim for the whole beneficial interest, while
                    what was claimed here was just a right to exclusive possession. But the
                    essential effect was the same in either case – the other co-owners (save
                    for his sister who had conceded his claim earlier) would not be able to enjoy
                    the Property – they would not be able to exercise their right to dispose
                    of it, or even to enter and use it. Ownership entails the right to enjoy
                    exclusive possession or its fruits; exclusive possession is the prime benefit of
                    ownership. These two rights are sides of the same coin. The fact of the matter
                    is that the 1st Defendant argued in the earlier case for a whole interest. That
                    should encapsulate any lesser interest. Otherwise, it would lead to the opposing
                    side suffering delay by a thousand different cuts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     This is illustrated by <em>De
                        Crittenden</em>, where the English Court of Appeal found that it was
                    an abuse of process for the plaintiff there to pursue an action founded on
                    fiduciary duties, when he had already pursued against the defendant an action
                    based on an agreement between them. The English Court of Appeal agreed with the
                    finding by the trial judge in the second action that the plaintiff could and
                    should have framed the fiduciary claim as an alternative. As the business
                    relationship between the parties was in issue in the first action, the plaintiff
                    there should have brought his entire case then.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     There was thus nothing raised in the present
                    proceedings to show that the present proprietary estoppel claim was founded on
                    evidence that was newly discovered or which could not have been used in the
                    earlier proceedings. All in all, there was no sufficient explanation given as to
                    why this claim could not have been raised earlier.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">Fact that the 1st Defendant initiated the earlier action is
                immaterial</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The fact that that the 1st Defendant was the
                    plaintiff in the other action cannot be a material consideration. If it were
                    otherwise, the operation of the rule would just be a tactical matter. Whether
                    the rule applied or not would be the result of the vagaries of who commenced
                    proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     It is true that English Court of Appeal in
                        <em>Henley v Bloom</em> [2010] 1 WLR 1770
                        (“<em>Henley v Bloom</em>”) stated at
                    [33] that where a second action is brought by the party who was the defendant in
                    the earlier action, it is more difficult to argue that an abuse arises, as
                    compared to where the claimant is the same in both actions. This observation did
                    not raise an absolute bar to abuse being found in situations where the role of
                    the parties are reversed between the first and second actions. The English Court
                    of Appeal in <em>Henley v Bloom</em> took pains to note
                    that their observation was not one of principle. To my mind, it is certainly
                    easier for a party who is the defendant in both actions to make out abuse
                    – harassment for instance would be more readily made out, as the defendant
                    would be at the receiving end in both instances; it would also be easier to find
                    overlap between causes of action founded on the same facts. However, there is
                    nothing in principle that requires the court to not apply the <em>Henderson v Henderson</em> rule where parties switch roles in
                    litigation, whether the party committing abuse moves from plaintiff to
                    defendant, or vice versa.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">No special circumstances</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     No special circumstances exist in the present
                    case that would justify a departure from the effect of the rule in <em>Henderson v Henderson</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The present case differed from <em>Goh Nellie</em>. It is pertinent that the legal basis in each
                    of the <em>Goh Nellie</em> actions was different. In the
                    first action there, what was in issue was the right to stay on the property. The
                    second action concerned the right of veto of sale conferred on a beneficiary: at
                    [45] of <em>Goh Nellie</em>. In the present case however,
                    the 1st Defendant made a claim of proprietary estoppel giving him an interest in
                    the Property in both S 722 and the present application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The case of <em>Henley v
                        Bloom</em> discussed above may be thought of as contrary authority. In
                    the first action, Mr Henley had an action brought against him by Mrs Bloom for
                    possession of a rental flat occupied by Mr Henley. Mr Henley initially resisted
                    it on grounds that it was not just and equitable, as required by the relevant
                    legislation in the United Kingdom, for an order of possession to be made against
                    him. Eventually, a consent order was recorded in which Mr Henley gave up
                    possession in good and tenantable repair and condition in return for various
                    payments by Mrs Bloom. Subsequently, in a second action, after obtaining an
                    expert’s assessment of the condition of the flat, Mr Henley then brought
                    an action against Mrs Bloom for breach of obligations to repair and quiet
                    enjoyment, claiming damages. Mrs Bloom not unexpectedly raised abuse of process.
                    The District Judge held in favour of Mrs Bloom. On appeal to the County Court,
                    the appeal was dismissed on the basis that the condition of the flat was raised
                    in the submissions and was subject to the consent order. On further appeal to
                    the English Court of Appeal, it was found that there was no abuse of process as
                    the issues were distinct. In the view of the Court of Appeal, the possession
                    claim did not involve any issue about the state of repair. That alone makes
                        <em>Henley v Bloom</em> distinguishable from the
                    present case: here, the proprietary estoppel would establish a right excluding
                    and depriving the co-owners of their legal title, just as much as the finding of
                    beneficial interest in S 722 would have excluded them as well. Additionally, the
                    position in <em>Henley v Bloom</em> was also reached
                    because of the non-availability of the expert report on the condition of the
                    flat in the earlier proceedings: see <em>Henley v
                        Bloom</em> at [34]. <em>Henley v Bloom</em>
                    should also then be seen as a case where no abuse arose because of new evidence
                    or circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Cause of Action and Issue Estoppel</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The requirements of cause of action and issue
                    estoppel were not met in the present case. Cause of action estoppel did not
                    arise as the cause of action was not the same in both the earlier and subsequent
                    proceedings; the comparison of the two causes of action differ from the
                    comparison undertaken in the <em>Henderson v Henderson</em>
                    analysis. As the claim in the earlier proceedings was one for the Property by
                    the 1st Defendant and the current proceedings relate to his assertion of a
                    property right to resist the application for sale, the causes of action cannot
                    be said to be the same at all.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Issue estoppel was not available as there was
                    insufficient identity of subject matter. The requirements of issue estoppel are
                    that (see <em>Lee Tat Development Pte Ltd v Management
                        Corporation Strata Title Plan No 301)</em> [2005] 3 SLR (R)
                    157):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_a"></a>(a)     There be a final and conclusive
                        judgment on the merits;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_b"></a>(b)     The judgment must be by a court of competent
                        jurisdiction;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_c"></a>(c)     There is identity of parties; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_d"></a>(d)     Identity of subject matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Identity of parties is not viewed narrowly: <em>Goh
                            Nellie</em>. However, no issue turns on that in the present case.
                        What was crucial here was identity of subject matter, which is weighed
                        taking into account the factual matrix in the earlier decision: <em>Goh Nellie.</em> Menon JC noted in <em>Goh
                            Nellie</em> at [34]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… the issues must be identical in the sense that the prior decision
                        must traverse the same ground as the subsequent proceeding’s and the
                        facts and circumstances giving rise to the earlier decision must not have
                        changed or should be incapable of change.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Menon J considered other decisions, such as <em>Richards v Richards</em> [1953] P 36 and <em>Mills
                            v Cooper</em> [1967] 2 QB 459, illustrating that differences in
                        the facts, or changes, even potential changes, in facts, would mean that the
                        subject matter is different.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     In the present case, in S 722, the
                    determination of the court was that there was no proprietary estoppel. The claim
                    of proprietary estoppel was founded on a family arrangement arising out of a
                    family meeting convened in 1966. In addition, the claim of proprietary estoppel
                    in S 722 was geared towards establishing a full beneficial interest. Strictly
                    speaking then, the ambit of the issue in S 722 was different from that in the
                    present proceedings, though the legal category was the same. Issue estoppel
                    could not thus be made out.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Proprietary Estoppel</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Even if it was not barred by the previous suit
                    from being presently argued, proprietary estoppel was not made out by the 1st
                    Defendant. The 1st Defendant could not establish any of the elements of
                    proprietary estoppel. These were that there was a representation (or assurance,
                    as is sometimes preferred), reliance and detriment; the exact formulation may
                    differ in the cases and texts, but nothing to my mind turns on this in the
                    present case. I should note also that there are local cases such as <em>Chng Bee Kheng and another (executrixes and trustees of the estate
                        of Fock Poh Kum, deceased) v Chng Eng Chye</em> [2013] 2 SLR 715, in
                    which estoppel by acquiescence was considered as a separate concept from
                    proprietary estoppel. The elements are traditionally listed slightly differently
                    from proprietary estoppel. I am of the view, however, that estoppel by
                    acquiescence is really a species of proprietary estoppel and its analysis should
                    proceed with the same elements.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     What is required for proprietary estoppel has
                    been the subject of further consideration in England. In <em>Thorner v Major</em>, Lord Walker reiterated that proprietary
                    estoppel is based on the elements: representation or assurance, reliance by the
                    claimant and detriment because of reasonable reliance. However, there remains a
                    live concern among some commentators that a distinction be maintained between
                    different standards of the doctrine. These have been identified as an
                    acquiescence-based principle, a representation based-one and a promise-based
                    principle, with differences as to how the elements are satisfied in each
                    instance, and what remedies may be available: see <em>Snell’s Equity</em> (John McGhee gen. ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell,
                    33rd Ed, 2015) (“<em>Snell’s
                    Equity</em>”) at paras 12-032 to 12-037 and Ben McFarlane’s
                        <em>The Law of Proprietary Estoppel</em> (Oxford
                    University Press, 2014) at para 1.05. While there may be some force in this
                    argument in favour of a segregated analysis, especially when one considers the
                    historical development of the doctrine, my inclination would be to see these as
                    aspects of a single doctrine, protecting against unconscionable conduct. Some
                    distinction may need to be drawn depending on how the representation is made and
                    also between a representation <em>simpliciter</em>,
                    acquiescence, or promise, but they are at the heart different manifestations of
                    the same concept. There has to be some cause emanating from the Plaintiffs
                    leading to the 1st Defendant’s detrimental reliance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     It may be that this issue would merit further
                    consideration in and guidance by a higher court, but I did not call for
                    arguments on these points as I did not think that even on the application of
                    segregated as opposed to a unified analysis, the result here would be different.
                    As it is, the development of the doctrine and its local application up to 2007
                    has been amply considered by Menon JC in <em>Hong Leong Singapore
                        Finance Ltd v United Overseas Bank Ltd</em> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 292
                        (“<em>Hong Leong Finance</em>”). I will
                    thus consider the issue that there be:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_a"></a>(a)     A representation, whether by way of
                        a representation in its conventional sense, encouragement, by a promise, or
                        by acquiescence;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_b"></a>(b)     reliance; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_c"></a>(c)     detriment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     I note that in some discussions, reliance and
                    detriment are considered together. The editors of <em>Tan Sook
                        Yee’s Principles of Singapore Land Law</em> (S Y Tan, H W Tang
                    &amp; K Low eds) (LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2009) (“<em>Tan Sook
                        Yee</em>”) analyse ‘detrimental reliance’
                    compositely. This may allow for more efficient exposition. I have not however
                    adopted that approach in the present case simply because the submissions and
                    authorities cited use the three-fold set of requirements.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Representation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     No representation was made out. There was no
                    express promise invoked in the present case. To put the 1st Defendant’s
                    case at its best, the 1st Defendant relied upon the inaction of the Plaintiffs
                    or the deceased persons, all the years he was allowed to remain on the Property,
                    as well as specifically, the inaction after letters of demand were sent by the
                    Plaintiffs in 1979 and 1980. That would not be sufficient. The required
                    representation must be one that the claimant had an interest or right to the
                    land. The letters themselves could not be taken as representations that rights
                    or claims would be recognised. The letters asked for the Property to be vacated.
                    That is entirely incompatible with the existence of a right to occupy. Further,
                    the letters themselves asserted a right by the Plaintiffs’ predecessors in
                    title that was contrary to the 1st Defendant’s assertion of his interest.
                    The inaction thereafter could be construed in many ways – it was not
                    unequivocally an acceptance of the 1st Defendant’s claim on the Property.
                    There was nothing more that was required for the Plaintiffs, who were not under
                    an obligation to reassert the same point continuously, or to assert the claim on
                    a frequent, regular basis. The inaction over the decades could have been borne
                    out of inertia, confusion, or ignorance. Any inaction alone does not amount to a
                    representation that a right or claim is recognised or admitted. Inaction could
                    simply be unequivocal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Further, as noted by Menon JC in <em>Hong Leong Finance</em> at [194] silence can only amount to
                    sufficient representation if there is a duty to speak. This recognises that
                    silence can be attributed to many reasons, which may not at all be connected
                    with recognition or acceptance of a right or interest in the Property or a
                    representation, even in the form of acquiescence. There is certainly no duty to
                    speak imposed on the Plaintiffs; the mere passage of time could not create such
                    a duty.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Reliance </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     There was no reliance in the present
                    case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The test for reliance has been described in
                    several ways. Again, it has been posited that there should be a differentiation
                    depending on the type of proprietary estoppel in question: <em>Snell’s Equity</em>, para 12-042. I am again doubtful that
                    there should be such granularity. It suffices to note that what mattered was
                    showing that the 1st Defendant acted on the basis of the content of the
                    representation or promise made. The various formulations, conveniently
                    summarised in <em>Snell</em>’s <em>Equity</em> at para 12-042, include:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_49-p2_a"></a>(a)     Whether the 1st Defendant would have
                        acted any differently apart from the representation. <em>Taylors Fashions Ltd v Liverpool Victoria Trustees Co Ltd</em>
                        [1982] QB 133 at 156,.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_49-p2_b"></a>(b)     Whether the representation was a significant factor:
                            <em>Steria Ltd v Hutchison</em> [2006] EWCA Civ
                        1551; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_49-p2_c"></a>(c)     The
                        existence of a sufficient causal link: <em>Gillett v
                            Holt</em> [2001] Ch 210 (“<em>Gillett v
                            Holt</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     I was satisfied that on any of these, the 1st
                    Defendant had not made out his case. In any event, I would be inclined to the
                    view that the various formulations require linkage only; I am doubtful that the
                    various cases consciously adopted different formulations because of the
                    different strands of proprietary estoppel as identified in <em>Snell’s Equity.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     There is some controversy on the burden of
                    showing reliance. The more common view is that the burden is taken to have
                    shifted to the party denying reliance once representation and detriment is made
                    out: <em>Hong Leong Finance</em> at [207] citing <em>Greasley v Cooke</em> [1980] 3 All ER 710. This shifting is
                    of the evidential burden and has on occasion been characterised as a
                    presumption: see <em>Snell’s Equity</em> at para
                    12-042. <em>Snell’s Equity</em> takes the view that
                    there is no actual shift, but simply an inference of reliance from
                    representation and detriment. The High Court of Australia has taken a different
                    view that the burden lies on the claimant: <em>Sidhu v Van
                        Dyke</em> [2014] HCA 19 at [57]. I do not think that in the present
                    case the issue is material, though I am sympathetic to the view expressed in
                        <em>Snell’s Equity</em> and am of the view that
                    the burden always lies on the party claiming the estoppel, but that in some
                    factual situations, reliance is readily inferable once representation and
                    detriment is made out.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     In the present case, the 1st Defendant’s
                    actions on the Property are referable instead to his maintenance of the Property
                    while he was in sole occupation of it. The 1st Defendant relied upon the fact
                    that the 1st Defendant did not purchase another property that he could have
                    built his life with; that he was deprived of the possibility of accretion to
                    such other property that he could have obtained; that he is now old and would
                    suffer if he moved out; and that he had paid for property taxes, discharged a
                    mortgage and made other payments maintaining the Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     None of these could be linked or connected
                    directly with the representation that the 1st Defendant relied on. Most of the
                    expenses on the Property could be explained as being part of the necessary
                    expenditure of someone who was in actual occupation of the Property and went to
                    his enjoyment of that Property. There was nothing that was referable to the
                    representation or promise – there had to be something more than what a
                    co-owner occupying the Property would have to do. It may be that if there had
                    been an express quid pro quo between the parties, something of a promise to him
                    that in return for his expenditure that he would obtain a greater interest, the
                    kind of expenditure he incurred would be sufficient. But that would have
                    required a different kind of representation other than mere silence or inaction
                    as the 1st Defendant relied on in the present case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Detriment</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     In assessing detriment, the court does not
                    take a narrow view: <em>Gillett v Holt</em>. The fact that
                    benefit may be obtained is relevant, and may outweigh the need to vindicate the
                    claimant’s reliance on a representation. Here, what the 1st Defendant
                    referred to as detriment were largely expenses that would be expected of any
                    co-owner seeking to continue his enjoyment of the Property. The 1st Defendant
                    obtained the occupation, use and enjoyment of the Property all these years.
                    Aside from the payment made to discharge a mortgage, he did not show that there
                    was anything that would have gone beyond the normal expenditure of a co-owner in
                    actual occupation. Spending what one would need to even in the absence of any
                    right larger than the legal ownership that one has is not detriment by any
                    means. It may be that he may have some right to reimbursement or accounting
                        <em>inter se</em> for such expenditure, but that is a
                    separate issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     As for the discharge of the mortgage or
                    encumbrance, in S 722, this was found to be payment of a debt which did not
                    arise in respect of the purchase of the Property, but freeing an encumbrance
                    arising from an overdraft granted to him and his brother, Kwek Hann Song, for
                    share trading: see the judgment in S 722 at [110]-[111]. This raises at least an
                    issue estoppel against the 1st Defendant on this point: there was commonality of
                    identity of subject matter and parties, as well as a final conclusive judgment
                    on the merits. Given that the payment was not in respect of the Property, and
                    not in respect of all the co-owners, this could not count as
                detriment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Promissory estoppel</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     The 1st Defendant invoked promissory estoppel.
                    This was not barred as an abuse of process as it could not have been asserted as
                    a basis for the 1st Defendant’s claim in S 722. But for the same reasons
                    as that in respect of proprietary estoppel, there was no representation or
                    promise that would have been a foundation for the estoppel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     For promissory estoppel to be established
                    there must be (<em>B P Exploration (Libya) v Hunt (No.
                        2)</em> [1979] 1 WLR 783 at 812):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_57-p2_a"></a>(a)     A legal relationship giving rights
                        and duties between the parties;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_57-p2_b"></a>(b)     A representation from one party to the other that he will
                        not enforce his strict legal rights arising out of that relationship;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_57-p2_c"></a>(c)     Reliance by
                        the other party on that representation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>In addition, it must also be inequitable for the representing party to go
                        back on that representation: <em>Nippon Yusen Kaisha v
                            Pacifica Navegacion SA (The Ion)</em> [1980] 2 Lloyd’s Rep
                        245. This is usually supplied by detriment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     The same points can be made here as were made
                    in respect of representation and reliance in the context of proprietary
                    estoppel. As noted above, silence could be explained in many ways, and cannot
                    generally be taken as assent or in this case forbearance giving up enforceable
                    rights. I do accept, as argued by the 1st Defendant, that <em>Lam
                        Chi Kin David v Deutsche Bank AG</em> [2011] 1 SLR 800 has adopted a
                    broader notion of detriment: it would be sufficient for an advantage to be
                    gained by the promisor. However, in this case, there was no such advantage. If
                    anything, in this case it was the 1st Defendant who secured an advantage in the
                    intervening years – namely his use of the Property. Neither could benefit
                    to the Plaintiffs be seen in the expenditure incurred by the 1st Defendant for
                    the reasons given above.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The adverse possession argument</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     The next argument raised asserting a property
                    interest countervailing the Plaintiffs’ rights as co-owner was adverse
                    possession. I also rejected the 1st Defendant’s invocation of adverse
                    possession as a sufficient basis to resist the order for sale. In respect of
                    Torrens land in Singapore, adverse possession is but an assertion of the
                    operation of a limitation period barring the erstwhile land owner from asserting
                    title better than that of the claimant in possession of that land.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     The 1st Defendant did not comply with ss
                    174(7) or (8) of the LTA, which required him to lodge applications for
                    possessory title. The Plaintiffs made this omission the primary plank of their
                    argument against the 1st Defendant’s reliance on adverse
                    possession.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     The 1st Defendant tried to argue that his
                    position was preserved by the predecessor to the current version of the LTA. He
                    had a right under the predecessor version of the LTA, namely, the 1985 edition
                    of the LTA (“the 1985 LTA”), to either lodge a caveat claiming
                    adverse possession when qualified title was issued, or to claim adverse
                    possession 12 years after the qualified tile was issued.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     No caveat was in fact lodged, but the 1st
                    Defendant contended that his interest had crystallised 12 years after qualified
                    title had been issued. The problem faced by the 1st Defendant was that the 1985
                    LTA was replaced by the 1994 version of the LTA. Section 174(4) of the LTA
                    preserves the position of a claimant relying on adverse possession for claims of
                    adverse possession before 1st March 1994, provided the claimant had lodged an
                    application under the previous LTA, and such application was pending. Section
                    174(8) of the LTA preserved a claim arising before that date but for which no
                    application had yet been made: such application had however to be made within
                    six months of 1<sup>st</sup> March 1994. As noted by the
                    Plaintiffs, in <em>TSM Development Pte ltd v Leonard Stephanie
                        Celine nee Pereira</em> [2005] 2 SLR(R) 371, the court highlighted
                    that the aim of the LTA was to abolish adverse possession subject to savings for
                    claims crystallised by 1st March 1994. In the present case, however, the 1st
                    Defendant could not bring himself within the LTA, as there was nothing to show
                    that he had made any such application. The 1st Defendant argued that the
                    provisions of the LTA could not operate retrospectively from before 1994. The
                    answer to this simply that s 174 of the LTA clearly and unequivocally dealt with
                    time periods before 1994. It was intended to, did and still does operate
                    retrospectively from 1994.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     The 1st Defendant’s other line of
                    argument was that the authorities on adverse possession in the context of the
                    LTA were distinguishable as they concerned disputes between adjacent land. It
                    was argued that this was supported by the legislative debates in which it was
                    clear that the focus of the legislation was disputes between plots. It is clear
                    though that while such disputes would perhaps commonly involve adjacent plots
                    that would not be the only factual scenario throwing up issues of adverse
                    possession. The classical situation would involve squatters claiming possession
                    against an absent landowner. I could not see anything in either the legislation
                    or the parliamentary debates that would narrow the scope of the provisions of
                    the LTA to claims on adjacent plots. The relevant LTA provision is sufficiently
                    broad to cover such situations. Section 50 reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Except as provided in section 174(7) and (8), no title to land adverse in
                        or in derogation of the tile of a proprietor of registered land shall be
                        acquired by any length of possession by virtue of the Limitation Act (Cap
                        163) or otherwise, nor shall the title of any operator of registered land be
                        extinguished by the operation of that Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The section is worded expansively.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     The 1st Defendant’s arguments about the
                    non-application of Torrens legislation also goes against the scheme of the LTA.
                    Torrens systems require certainty and compliance with the statutory provisions
                    – some interests that are not specifically provided for may of course be
                    protected by caveats, but adverse possession is dealt with specially under the
                    LTA, and there should thus be strict compliance with it. The LTA is clear that
                    the requirement had to be met that there had to be registration that was at
                    least pending before 1st March 1994. The land was converted to the Torrens
                    system in 1967, and had been unqualified by 2003.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     The 1st Defendant however went beyond this
                    line of argument and referred to dispossession of the Plaintiffs and their
                    parents, and referred to their failure to take action until after 12 years. As I
                    understood the eventual argument, a strand of the 1st Defendant’s position
                    is that the Plaintiffs’ claim should be defeated because the adverse
                    possession created an independent basis, that it is a property right in itself,
                    even if does not become perfected through registration under the statute. The
                    issue of non-compliance with the LTA was therefore, on the 1st Defendant’s
                    argument, beside the point.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     I could not accept the 1st Defendant’s
                    argument. Adverse possession is an aspect of limitation: <em>Tan
                        Sook Yee</em>, p 822. It operates in the context of the concept of
                    relativity of title and a contest between titles or claims to title. And in that
                    context of relativity of title, there has to be compliance with the LTA as that
                    statute controls all aspects of title and its perfection in respect of Torrens
                    land in Singapore. In other words, the land register is absolute and registered
                    title is indefeasible: <em>Gibbs v Messer</em> [1891] AC
                    248; and <em>Wong Kok Chin v Mah Ten Kui Joseph</em> [1992]
                    1 SLR(R) 894. In the words of the editors of <em>Tan Sook
                        Yee</em> at para 13.5:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…Title is passed only by registration. Second, once the title is
                        registered, it is indefeasible except by other interest as provided in the
                        statute itself.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Certainly, it does not operate as an independent equitable
                        right that goes to the conscience of the other party, unlike proprietary
                        estoppel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Furthermore, the characteristics of the 1st
                    Defendant’s line of argument here makes this novel adverse possession
                    claim seem similar to proprietary estoppel – the 1st Defendant claims a
                    right against the other legal owners, based on the passage of time, defeating
                    those other rights. However, no representation or detrimental reliance needs to
                    be shown. There is no authority for a right of this nature.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     It was also doubtful that even if adverse
                    possession was at all a viable argument, that it should have been raised in this
                    way in opposition for an order for partition or sale. Properly speaking, if the
                    assertion by the 1st Defendant was to the legal title, and not just the
                    equitable title, he should have sought rectification of the land register; that
                    would have put paid to the Plaintiffs’ claim if it were
                successful.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Miscellaneous grounds raised against the application</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Several other issues were also raised, which
                    may be addressed briefly.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     There was an argument based on limitation
                    raised by the 1st Defendant, citing the Limitation Act. This argument was
                    misconceived. The orders sought by the Plaintiffs was for partition or sale: it
                    is not an action for recovery of land subject to the Limitation Act. An order
                    for sale or partition is simply an order giving effect of the legal ownership
                    that is already vested in the co-owners. There is no recovery of land at all:
                    the land in question was and is theirs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     The 1st Defendant invoked laches and
                    acquiescence. Acquiescence here may be synonymous with a form of waiver or
                    laches properly speaking, <em>ie</em>, delay with
                    prejudice: see Meagher, Gummow and Lehane's <em>Equity: Doctrine
                        and Remedies</em> (LexisNexis Butterworths, 5th Ed, 2015) at para
                    38-010. Where laches arise, equitable relief will be refused: <em>Lindsay Petroleum Company, The v Prosper Armstrong Hurd, Abram Farewell,
                        and John Kemp</em> (1874) LR 5 PC 221. As noted by the Plaintiffs, in
                        <em>Tan Yong San v Neo Kok Eng</em> [2011] SGHC 30, Loh
                    JC stated that laches would be a defence to a claim for equitable relief, but
                    not a legal one. The Plaintiffs’ claim was founded on a legal right not an
                    equitable one. It was an order giving effect to their legal title as
                    co-owners.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     The 1st Defendant indicated that he wished to
                    challenge the validity of the will of 1980. This was a separate matter from the
                    present proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Sale of the Property</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     The 1st Defendant failed to show that he had
                    any competing rights that would bar the sale by the Plaintiffs. As to the sale
                    of the Property, I found that there were no reasons that would stand in the way
                    of a sale. I rejected the arguments against the sale that were founded on
                    proprietary estoppel, promissory estoppel, and other grounds. I was satisfied
                    that sale should be ordered under paragraph 2 of the First Schedule and s 18(2)
                    of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, Rev Ed 2007) (“the
                    SCJA”). As noted by the Plaintiffs, the power to order a sale has been
                    recognised, even where other co-owners object: <em>Toh Tian Sze v
                        Han Kim Wah</em> [2012] 3 SLR 682 (“<em>Toh Tian
                        Sze</em>”). The Plaintiffs argued that impracticability of
                    partition was a relevant consideration. Such impracticability could be due to
                    the size of the property, absence of planning permission, and the inability of
                    the co-owners to cooperate to partition. In addition, the Plaintiffs further
                    contended that it would be relevant to consider whether sale may be more
                    advantageous for all the co-owners, and whether there would be any serious
                    injustice to objecting co-owners.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     The controlling authority in this area is
                        <em>Abdul Razak Valibhoy and another v Abdul Rahim Valibhoy
                        and others</em> [1995] 1 SLR(R) 441. That decision noted that the
                    Court would take into account all relevant considerations. In particular, it was
                    highlighted in that case that at first instance, proposals for partition had
                    been explored; impracticabilities and difficulties in doing so were
                    demonstrated, and that it was found that partition was not practicable or
                    feasible on a just and equitable basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     As noted by the parties, various factors have
                    been taken into account by the Courts in determining whether a sale is necessary
                    or expedient. Section 18(2) of the SCJA states that the High Court will have in
                    addition to powers vested under sub-section (1), the powers set out in the First
                    Schedule. Paragraph 2 of the First Schedule reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Partition and sale in lieu of
                        partition</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2. Power to partition land and to direct a sale instead of partition in
                        any action for partition of land; and in any cause or matter relating to
                        land, where it appears necessary or expedient, to order the land or any part
                        of it to be sold, and to give all necessary and consequential
                        directions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>I agree with the views expressed in <em>Tan
                            Sook Yee</em>, at para 9.65 that the requirements of necessity and
                        expediency strictly apply only to situations other than a direct application
                        for sale or partition. Nonetheless, I consider these requirements as
                        possibly relevant factors in the determination by the
                court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     In exercising the discretion, the courts have
                    looked at the question of injustice and impact on the parties: <em>Chiam Heng Luan and others v Chiam Heng Hsien and others</em>
                    [2007] 4 SLR(R) 305. The inquiry is thus broad ranging. Probably little will be
                    gained by any attempt to exhaustively define the scope of the Court’s
                    survey. As recognised in <em>Toh Tian Sze</em> and
                        <em>Abu Bakar v Jawahir and others</em> [1993] 1 SLR(R)
                    865, a co-owner has the right to seek partition. The Court may consider sale as
                    an alternative, which would probably be the more attractive option to the
                    applicant anyway.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     I accepted the Plaintiffs’ arguments
                    that there were impracticalities in partitioning, given the state of the
                    relationship of the parties. The various co-owners have had little contact
                    between themselves. There was also the previous litigation to take into account.
                    In view of the clearly strained relationship, it would be too optimistic to
                    require the parties to work together. Partitioning land would require
                    negotiation, trade-offs and compromise. None of these were likely to be
                    forthcoming here. Partition would also run into difficulties here given the
                    location and shape of the Property: the road frontage for the partitioned plots,
                    as well as the fact that building on the Property straddled the land, would mean
                    that any partition would be awkward. It may be that gerrymandering the Property
                    to preserve the building may yet be topologically possible, but would likely
                    have resulted in a diminished commercial value of the partitioned plots. These
                    difficulties would also probably mean that planning permission would be
                    difficult to obtain.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     I found that there was no injustice on the
                    facts. The 1st Defendant contended that he had been deprived of the opportunity
                    to have purchased another property. He also referred to the emotional attachment
                    he had, the inaction by the Plaintiffs, his health conditions and the
                    difficulties he would face finding another property at his age. None of these to
                    my mind were sufficient to bar the sale of the Property. Attachment to a
                    particular plot is not a determining factor. It may be relevant in some
                    circumstances, but it cannot normally be determinative when other co-owners wish
                    to partition or sell. Their property rights, including the rights of disposal,
                    would have to be given due weight. Similarly, difficulties in finding
                    alternative property, or health problems, could not normally deprive co-owners
                    of their property rights unless it was of such a significant degree that
                    movement out of the property was near impossible. As to being deprived of the
                    opportunity to purchase another property, that was simply outweighed by the 1st
                    Defendant’s enjoyment of the Property all these years.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The division of the proceeds</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     The division took into account the relevant
                    contributions made by the 1st Defendant and which were the subject of his
                    counterclaim. The 1st Defendant argued that he had spent money on maintaining
                    the Property. The Plaintiffs disputed this. I was of the view that the
                    counterclaim made by the 1st Defendant for expenses incurred by him did not
                    succeed except for one part.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     As argued by the Plaintiffs, there was little
                    by way of documentary evidence for most of the claims. Additionally, the various
                    expenses made by him were largely for his own benefit in the years of
                    occupation, and were not such as to create an obligation for repayment by the
                    other owners in the present circumstances. There may be expenses incurred which
                    may be necessary to preserve the Property, and such expenses may be the subject
                    of reimbursement; however, enjoyment of the Property by the claiming party can
                    be taken into account: <em>Tan Chui Lian v Neo Liew
                        Eng</em> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 265.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     The 1st Defendant also claimed that he had
                    paid off a mortgage over the Property. However, as argued by the Plaintiffs,
                    this was found in S 722 to have been in respect of a share trading account and
                    had no link to the Property. Aside from the issue estoppel that would have
                    arisen, I found on the evidence before me in this application that there was no
                    evidence anyway that there was any mortgage over the Property that was
                    discharged by the 1st Defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     There was however one category that should be
                    taken into account, namely the taxes that were due on the Property. These
                    payments would have had to be made by the owners, and were not just for the
                    benefit of the 1st Defendant in his enjoyment of the occupation of the Property,
                    so there should be accounting <em>inter se</em>. An
                    adjustment was thus made to the amount due here.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Orders made</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     I ordered a sale in lieu of partition.
                    However, no sale was to take place until six months after the date of the order,
                    with a sum representing the property tax to be shared by the other co-owners to
                    be reimbursed to the 1st Defendant from the proceeds of sale. Subsequently, on
                    the 1st Defendant’s application, I granted a stay of execution pending the
                    appeal filed by him. I also fixed costs in favour of the Plaintiffs payable by
                    the 1st Defendant.</p>
