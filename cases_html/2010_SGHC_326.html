<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       These two appeals arose out of a District
                    Judge’s decision to strike out a counterclaim on the ground that the
                    District Court did not have jurisdiction over the counterclaim. The appellants
                    filed a notice of appeal by way of Registrar’s Appeal No 161 of 2009
                    (“RAS 161/2009”) (“the First Appeal”) against that
                    decision. However, the appellants failed to serve the First Appeal on the
                    respondent within the time required under the Rules of Court (Cap 322,
                    R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) (the “Rules of Court”). The respondent then
                    applied for the First Appeal to be struck out while the appellants applied for
                    an extension of time to serve the First Appeal. The same District Judge
                    dismissed the appellants’ application for extension of time to serve the
                    First Appeal and struck out the First Appeal on the ground that it was not
                    served on time. The appellants then filed a notice of appeal by way of
                    Registrar’s Appeal No 62 of 2010 (“RAS 62/2010”)
                    (“the Second Appeal”) against the decision to dismiss the
                    application for extension of time to serve the First Appeal and to strike out
                    the First Appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Both appeals came before me. I allowed the
                    appeals. I now give my grounds of decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The respondent is the management corporation for
                    a building known as LW TECHNOCENTRE (“the Building”), which is
                    located at 31 Toh Guan Road East, Singapore 608608.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Tham Keng Mun and Sum Yuet Leng, respectively
                    the first and second appellants, are subsidiary proprietors of unit #02-05 at
                    the Building. The third appellant, Eltron Engineering Pte Ltd, is the tenant of
                    the Unit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The appellants placed objects on a driveway
                    outside the Unit (“the Driveway”). The Driveway is part of the
                    common property of the Building.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       On 27 July 2006, the respondent commenced
                    an action against the appellants in the District Court for occupying the
                    Driveway without obtaining the respondent’s license, authorisation or
                    approval. The respondent claimed for, <em>inter alia</em>,
                    an order that the appellants remove all objects from the Driveway, possession of
                    the Driveway and for damages, including <em>mesne</em>
                    profits.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       On 15 August 2006, the appellants filed a
                    defence and counterclaim. In their counterclaim (“the
                    Counterclaim”), the appellants made the following averments:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_a"></a>(a)     the respondent breached its
                        “duty of care in law to the subsidiary proprietors” to ensure
                        that the common property, including the Driveway, was not obstructed to
                        partially deprive the subsidiary proprietors of use of the common property;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_b"></a>(b)     by
                        commencing action against the appellants, the respondent “arbitrarily
                        exercised [its] powers in bad faith with the intention to cause loss and
                        damage” to the appellants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The appellants claimed
                    an order that the respondent procure and ensure that all objects placed on the
                    common property be removed and for damages for the loss of use of the common
                    property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       On 4 September 2009, in the course of
                    hearing interlocutory appeals, Tan May Tee DJ (“the District
                    Judge”) asked for submissions on whether the District Court had
                    jurisdiction over the respondent’s claim and the
                Counterclaim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On 8 December 2009, after hearing
                    submissions, the District Judge held that the District Court did not have
                    jurisdiction over the Counterclaim and so she struck out the Counterclaim
                    (“the First Decision”). The District Judge did not give any
                    grounds for the First Decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On 21 December 2009, the appellants filed
                    the First Appeal. The Subordinate Courts Registry issued it on 30 December
                    2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The appellants served the notice of appeal on
                    the respondent on 20 January 2010 via a fax transmission. The appellants
                    also served the notice of appeal on the respondent by hand on 22 January
                    2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     On 22 February 2010, the respondent
                    applied via Summons No 2843 of 2010 (“SUM 2843/2010”) to
                    strike out the First Appeal on the ground that it was not served on the
                    respondent within seven days of it being issued, as provided under O 55C,
                    r 1(4) Rules of Court. The following day, on 23 February 2010, the
                    appellants applied via Summons No 2944 of 2010 (“SUM
                    2944/2010”) for an extension of time for the service of the First Appeal.
                    The Subordinate Courts Registry fixed both summons before the High Court,
                    together with another appeal in the same case on discovery and further and
                    better particulars.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     On 3 March 2010, Kan Ting Chiu J
                    directed that both SUM 2843/2010 and SUM 2944/2010 were to be heard together in
                    the Subordinate Courts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     On 7 April 2010, the District Judge
                    dismissed the application for extension of time and struck out the First Appeal
                    (“the Second Decision”). The District Judge did not give any
                    grounds for the Second Decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     On 21 April 2010, the appellants filed
                    the Second Appeal. The Second Appeal was duly served on the respondent within
                    the time required under the Rules of Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Both the First Appeal and the Second Appeal
                    came before me.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Second Appeal (RAS 62/2010)</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The law on extension of time for service of a notice of appeal </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The factors that the court considers in
                    determining whether to extend time for the filing or service of a notice of
                    appeal are well established and were recently concisely stated by the Court of
                    Appeal in <em>Anwar Siraj and another v Ting Kang
                        Chung</em> [2010] 1 SLR 1026 (CA) (“<em>Anwar Siraj</em>”) in the following manner (at
                    [29]-[30]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Considerations in exercising discretion to extend time</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">29 The principles which apply to determine whether the court should
                        exercise its discretion to extend time to file a notice of appeal or to
                        serve a notice out of time are well established in case law. The modern
                        approach taken by this court to this question may be found in its decision
                        in <em>Pearson v Chen Chien Wen Edwin</em> [1991]
                        2 SLR(R) 260 . There are four factors which the court would
                        consider in determining how the discretion should be exercised. These are:
                        (a) the length of the delay; (b) the reasons for the delay; (c) the chances
                        of the appeal succeeding if time for appealing is extended; and (d) the
                        degree of prejudice to the would-be respondent if the application is
                        granted. But we would emphasise that this is not a numbers game. The
                        significance of each factor must depend on its facts and circumstances of
                        the case. In the final analysis, the applicant for an extension of time must
                        show grounds sufficient to persuade the court to extend its sympathy to
                        him.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">30 While these are the factors which are relevant to the court in
                        determining how its discretion should be exercised, there are two other
                        considerations which should nevertheless not be disregarded. In <em>Linda Lai</em> ([25] <em>supra</em>)
                        at [45], relying on the Privy Council decision in <em>Thamboo
                            Ratnam v Thamboo Cumarasamy and Cumarasamy Ariamany d/o
                            Kumarasa</em> [1965] 1 WLR 8 at 12, this court held that
                        when applying these factors, the court should nevertheless bear in mind the
                        fact that the overriding consideration was that the ROC must <em>prima facie</em> be obeyed, with reasonable diligence
                        being exercised. Second, in <em>The Melati</em> [2004]
                        4 SLR(R) 7 at [37], this court underscored the point that the need
                        for finality was a "paramount consideration".</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     I will elaborate on each factor
                below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">My Decision on the Second Appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The length of the delay</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The first factor requires the court to
                    consider the length of the delay in serving the notice of appeal. If the delay
                    were <em>de minimis</em>, it might be excused without the
                    court having to consider the reasons for the delay in detail (see <em>Lee Hsien Loong v Singapore Democratic Party and others and another
                        suit</em> [2008] 1 SLR(R) 757 at [21] (“<em>Lee Hsien Loong</em>”)). However, if the delay were
                    more substantial, the court should consider the reasons for the delay in detail
                    (see <em>Lee Hsien Loong</em> at [22]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     As provided by O 55C, r 1(4) Rules of
                    Court, the appellants should have served the notice of appeal on the respondent
                    within seven days of it being issued. The notice of appeal was issued on
                    30 December 2009. Under O 3, r 2(5) Rules of Court, if a period
                    of time fixed for the doing of an act is a period of seven days or less, a day
                    other than a working day should be excluded in the reckoning of the period of
                    time. Since 31 December 2009, 1 January 2010, 2 January 2010,
                    9 January 2010 and 10 January 2010 were not working days, the
                    appellants should have served the notice of appeal by 11 January
                    2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The appellants’ solicitors only served
                    the notice of appeal on the respondent’s solicitors on 20 January
                    2010 via a fax transmission. The notice of appeal was also served by hand on
                    22 January 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     It was necessary for me to determine whether
                    service was effected on 20 January 2010 or 22 January 2010.
                    Order 62, r 6 of the Rules of Court governs the mode of service for
                    documents for which personal service is not required. The relevant provisions of
                    that rule are as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1)    Service of any document, not being a document
                            which by virtue of any provision of these Rules is required to be served
                            personally, may be effected —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    by leaving the document at the proper address of
                            the person to be served;</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(c)    by FAX <em>in accordance with
                                paragraph (3)</em>;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(d)    in such other manner as may be agreed between the
                            party serving and the party to be served; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(e)    in such other manner as the Court may
                            direct.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3)    Service by FAX may be effected where
                            —</p>

<p class="Judg-1">The respondent’s solicitors’ letter head indicates the
                    firm’s fax number and does not indicate that the firm does not accept
                    service of documents via fax. Accordingly, I considered that service of the
                    notice of appeal was effected by fax on 20 January 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Since the appellants served the notice of
                    appeal on 20 January 2010, the length of the delay in service was nine
                    days.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Although a delay of nine days was relatively
                    shorter than the delay in some other cases, I was of the view that the delay was
                    not <em>de minimis</em>. As a comparison, the delay in
                        <em>AD v AE</em> [2004] 2 SLR(R) 505
                        (“<em>AD v AE</em>”), which, like the
                    present case, concerned an appeal from the District Judge in chambers, was 49
                    days (<em>AD v AE</em> at [11]). The delay in <em>Denko-HLB Sdn Bhd v Fagerdala Singapore Pte Ltd</em> [2002]
                    2 SLR(R) 336 (“<em>Denko</em>”),
                    which concerned a delay in making an application for further arguments under
                    s 34(1)(c) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev
                    Ed) (“SCJA”), was 14 days (<em>Denko</em> at
                    [12]). The Court of Appeal in <em>Denko</em> considered
                    that the 14 days delay was substantial given that the period allowed under SCJA
                    for applying for further arguments was seven days (<em>Denko</em> at [12]). In both cases, the Court of Appeal refused to
                    grant an extension of time after considering all the four factors (<em>AD v AE</em> at [15] and <em>Denko</em>
                    at [18]). Accordingly, it was necessary for me to consider the reasons for the
                    appellant’s delay.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The reasons for the delay</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     It is not sufficient for a party to simply
                    allege that the delay was due to an oversight on the part of his solicitor or
                    his solicitor’s clerk (<em>AD v AE</em> at [11];
                        <em>Denko</em> at [14]). However, oversight on the part
                    of a solicitor could be an adequate reason if the reasons for the
                    solicitor’s oversight are explained (<em>Perdigao
                        Agroindustrial SA v Barilla GER Fratelli-Societa Per Azioni</em>
                    [2009] SGHC 210 (“<em>Perdigao</em>”) at [43]) or if there are extenuating circumstances
                        (<em>Nomura Regionalisation Venture Fund Ltd v Ethical
                        Investments Ltd</em> [2000] 2 SLR(R) 926 at [28]). For
                    example, the High Court in <em>Perdigao</em> distinguished
                    cases such as <em>AD v AE</em> on the basis that the
                    appellant was able to explain that the solicitor’s oversight was
                    “contributed to by the relocation of the plaintiff’s
                    solicitor’s firm” (<em>Perdigao</em> at [43]).
                    As for extenuating circumstances, the Court of Appeal in <em>Nomura</em> offered as an illustration two English cases where
                    extenuating circumstances were present. In both cases, the solicitor had given
                    notice to the other side of the appeal within the required time and the
                    solicitor’s mistake was “understandable and not gross”
                        (<em>Nomura</em> at [28]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In the present case, counsel for the
                    appellants, Mr David Liew (“Mr Liew”), offered the
                    following reasons for the delay in service:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_a"></a>(a)     The appellants withheld serving the
                        notice of appeal until 5 January 2010 because they were not certain if
                        leave from the District Court was required to make the First Appeal. The
                        appellants applied to the District Court via Summons No. 21498 of 2009
                        (“SUM 21498/2009”) for leave to appeal. SUM 21498/2009 was
                        fixed for hearing on 5 January 2010 before the District Judge. The
                        District Judge held that leave was not required.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_b"></a>(b)     From 9 January 2010 to
                        11 January 2010, Mr Liew’s law firm moved its offices. The
                        law firm’s files, including the appellants’ files in this
                        matter, were packed and sealed in boxes for the move. Mr Liew did not
                        explain when the appellants’ files were packed and sealed.
                        Mr Liew retrieved the appellants’ files on 19 January 2010.
                        He then gave instructions to his staff to immediately serve the notice of
                        appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_c"></a>(c)     Mr Liew offered three further explanations for his oversight. First,
                        Mr Liew explained that he was in charge of his law firm’s move to
                        its new offices. Second, Mr Liew was also in charge of the renovations
                        to his law firm’s new offices. Renovations commenced on 8 January
                        2010 and lasted for 3 weeks. Third, Mr Liew explained that he was
                        attending Court in the midst of the move and
                renovations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     I did not find the reasons for the delay
                    entirely satisfactory. Mr Liew did not offer any reason why he did not
                    serve the notice of appeal immediately after the hearing of SUM 21498/2009 on
                    5 January 2010. The respondent’s counsel attended the hearing.
                    Mr Liew could have served the notice of appeal on the respondent’s
                    counsel once the District Judge ruled that leave to appeal was not required.
                    Also, no reason was offered for the failure to serve the notice of appeal
                    between 5 January 2010 and 9 January 2010, which was the day when
                    Mr Liew’s law firm started to move to its new office.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     I then proceeded to consider the third
                    factor.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The chances of the appeal succeeding</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The third factor only requires the court to
                    consider whether the appeal is hopeless (<em>Anwar
                        Siraj</em> at [37]; <em>Lee Hsien Loong</em> at
                    [19]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     My view was that the appeal was not hopeless.
                    Indeed the prospects of success were quite good. As explained below under my
                    decision for the First Appeal, the civil jurisdiction of the District Court is
                    limited to certain categories of cases. The Counterclaim discloses a cause of
                    action for breach of statutory duty. An action for breach of statutory duty
                    falls within the jurisdiction of the District Court (see below at
                    [64]-[67]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The degree of prejudice to the would-be respondent if time were
                extended</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The fourth factor is concerned with the
                    prejudice that the respondent would suffer if the extension of time were
                    granted. The prejudice must be tangible (<em>Lee Hsien
                        Loong</em> at [25]). It is not sufficient for the respondent to argue
                    that its prejudice is that the appeal would be heard if the extension of time
                    were granted (<em>Aberdeen Asset Management Asia v Fraser &amp;
                        Neave Ltd</em> [2001] 3 SLR(R) 355 at [14]
                        (“<em>Aberdeen Asset Management
                    Asia</em>”); <em>S3 Building Services Pte Ltd v Sky
                        Technology Pte Ltd</em> [2001] SGHC 87 at [67]). An example
                    of prejudice that would be relevant is if the respondent changed its position by
                    relying on the judgment below (<em>Aberdeen Asset Management
                        Asia</em> at [44]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The respondent was not able to substantiate
                    its bare assertion that it was prejudiced by the appellants’ delay.
                    Mr Seng Jock Lee Alvin, the Senior Property Manager of the
                    respondent’s managing agent, deposed the following in his affidavit dated
                    23 March 2010:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4.    Paragraph 16 of the Affidavit of
                            “LTY” is denied. The Plaintiffs suffered substantial
                            prejudice herein.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5.    We thought that the Defendants were abandoning the
                            appeal against the learned District Judge’s decision. We thought
                            so because we did not receive any news of appeal after my lawyers were
                            verbally informed that the Defendants had filed an appeal during the
                            hearing of an application by the Defendants for leave to appeal. This
                            application for leave was withdrawn by the Defendants when the District
                            Judge informed the Defendant’s counsel that no leave to appeal was
                            required. My lawyer then told the Court that the Defendants were out of
                            time to file the Notice of Appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The respondent did not elaborate on the
                    prejudice that it suffered apart from stating that it “thought that the
                    [appellants] were abandoning the appeal”. I did not consider that simply
                    being led to think that an appellant is abandoning its appeal amounts to
                    prejudice.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Conclusion on the Second Appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The court is required to balance all four
                    factors in coming to a conclusion as to whether an extension of time should be
                    granted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     I reached the conclusion that I should grant
                    an extension of time even though the delay of nine days was not <em>de minimis</em> and the appellants’ reasons for the
                    delay were not entirely satisfactory. This was because of the high likelihood
                    that the appellants would succeed in the First Appeal and the absence of any
                    relevant prejudice that the respondent would suffer if time were extended. In
                    this regard, I found the following comments of Andrew Ang J in <em>Perdigao</em> persuasive:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">46 Here, the defendant acknowledged that the appeal was not hopeless.
                        Since little more is known about the strength of the plaintiff’s case,
                        all we can conclude is that the third factor does not operate against the
                        plaintiff. However, I venture to suggest in passing that, <em>in a case where without the court having to go into a thorough
                            examination the prospects of the applicant succeeding in the appeal are
                            patent, the third factor could assume greater importance</em>.
                            <em>In an appropriate case, absent any prejudice to the
                            would-be respondent, the ties of justice might militate against a denial
                            of the application even if the length of delay might be substantial or
                            the reason for the delay might not be entirely cogent</em>. This
                        harks back to the need to balance the competing demands of procedural and
                        substantive justice summed up in the insightful remarks of Andrew Phang Boon
                        Leong JC in <em>United Overseas Bank Ltd v Ng Huat
                            Foundations Pte Ltd</em> ([28] <em>supra</em>) and V K Rajah JA in <em>Lee Chee
                            Wei</em> ([29] <em>supra</em>). I hasten to
                        add that this is not to say that the third factor will inevitably trump the
                        first and second factors. Each case must be decided on its own facts,
                        balancing all four factors. It is in this light that the remarks of the
                        learned Chao Hick Tin JA in <em>Nomura
                            Regionalisation</em> ([38] <em>supra</em>) at
                        [28] ought to be understood where he characterised <em>Stansfield</em> as “a case of oversight simpliciter, with
                        no other extenuating circumstances, although the merits of the case were
                        strong”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Accordingly, I allowed the Second
                    Appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The First Appeal (RAS 161/2009)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     To recapitulate, the First Appeal concerned
                    the District Judge’s decision to strike out the Counterclaim on the ground
                    that the District Court did not have jurisdiction over the
                Counterclaim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     This appeal raised two issues:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_i"></a>(i)     whether the civil jurisdiction of

                        (“SCA”); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     if so, whether the Counterclaim raised a cause of action

                    jurisdiction of the District Court. For example, s 20(1) SCA provides that
                    the District Court has jurisdiction “to hear and try any action founded
                    on contract or tort”. Section 21(1) SCA provides that the District Court
                    has jurisdiction “to hear and try any action for the recovery of a sum
                    which is recoverable under any written law” if certain conditions are
                    satisfied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     It was necessary for me to consider whether
                    the jurisdiction of the District Court is limited to actions falling within the
                    Subject Matter Jurisdiction Provisions in Part IV SCA. The District
                    Judge’s decision to strike out the Counterclaim would have no basis if the
                    District Courts’ jurisdiction was not limited by the Subject Matter
                    Jurisdiction Provisions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Case Law on the Civil Jurisdiction of the District Courts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The first case of relevance is <em>Lim Kim Cheong v Lee Johnson</em> [1992]
                    2 SLR(R) 688 (“<em>Lim Kim
                    Cheong</em>”). In <em>Lim Kim Cheong</em>,
                    Michael Hwang JC held that the District Court did not have the jurisdiction
                    to grant a declaration that a transfer of a car was null and void. Hwang JC
                    considered that the District Court’s power to grant a declaration was
                    limited to actions falling within the Subject Matter Jurisdiction Provisions in
                    SCA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Hwang JC compared the provisions on
                    declaratory relief in SCA’s predecessor, the Courts Ordinance (Cap 3,
                    1955 Rev Ed) (“Courts Ordinance”), and the equivalent provisions
                    in SCA. Hwang JC noted that the Courts Ordinance also provided subject
                    matter jurisdiction restrictions. He then relied on the “presumption that
                    a statute does not create new jurisdictions or enlarge existing ones”
                        (<em>Lim Kim Cheong</em> at [45]). Hwang JC
                    considered that SCA in fact introduced more restrictive subject matter
                    restrictions, thereby suggesting that the presumption should be
                stronger.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     In <em>The Redwood Tree Pte Ltd
                        v CPL Trading Pte Ltd</em> [2009] SGDC 204
                        (“<em>The Redwood Tree</em>”), the
                    District Court also held that the jurisdiction of the District Court is strictly
                    limited to the causes of action specified in the Subject Matter Jurisdiction
                    Provisions. <em>The Redwood Tree</em> concerned an action
                    for restitution of a deposit paid to secure a tenancy. The District Court held
                    that it did not have jurisdiction because an action for restitution did not fall
                    within the Subject Matter Jurisdiction Provisions (<em>The
                        Redwood Tree</em> at [31]-[41]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">My decision on the First Issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     My view was that the District Court’s
                    civil jurisdiction is indeed restricted to the causes of action specified in the
                    Subject Matter Jurisdiction Provisions. Any other reading of the SCA would not
                    adequately account for s 19(2) SCA, which provides that the District Court
                    has the jurisdiction conferred by the sections in Part IV SCA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     I also found support for my view in the
                        <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius</em> maxim of
                    construction. That maxim provides that if a series of matters are expressly
                    stated in a statute, it is presumed that the drafter intended to exclude matters
                    that are not expressly stated (see F.A.R. Bennion, <em>Bennion on
                        Statutory Interpretation</em> (LexisNexis,
                        5<sup>th</sup> Ed, 2008) at p 1250). Applying the
                    maxim, given that Part IV SCA specifically provides for the causes of action for
                    which the District Court has civil jurisdiction, it should be presumed that the
                    drafter of SCA did not intend for the District Court to have jurisdiction over
                    causes of action not specifically mentioned.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     I should also mention that a bill to amend SCA
                    was presented to Parliament for a first reading on 15 September 2010.
                    Significantly, clause 2 of the Subordinate Courts (Amendment) Bill (Bill 26 of
                    2010) (“the Bill”) proposes to amend s 19 SCA in the
                    following manner:</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     I also noted that the Explanatory Statement
                    accompanying the Bill states as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This Bill seeks to <em>amend</em> the Subordinate
                        Courts Act (Cap. 321) for the following main purposes:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    to <em>reform</em> the law
                            relating to the jurisdiction and powers of the District Court and the
                            Magistrate’s Court;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Clause 2 <em>amends</em> section 19 to confer on a
                        District Court all the jurisdiction of the High Court to hear and try any
                        action in personam where the defendant is served with a writ of summons or
                        any other originating process in the manner prescribed by the Rules of
                        Court, or the defendant submits to the jurisdiction of a District Court.
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Explanatory Statement shows, therefore, that the amendment
                    described above is intended to <em>amend</em> SCA and not
                    to clarify ambiguities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The proposed amendment is significant because
                    it removes the restriction of the civil jurisdiction of the District Courts to
                    specified causes of action. If the Bill were passed, the District Court would
                    have the jurisdiction of the High Court, subject to the District Court’s
                    monetary limit. Clause 3 of the Bill also repeals ss 20 and 21 SCA, which are
                    Subject Matter Jurisdiction Provisions, as a consequence of the amendment to
                    s 19. Other Subject Matter Jurisdiction Provisions are amended to provide
                    that they are “without prejudice to the generality of section 19”
                    (see clauses 6-8 of the Bill).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     I was of the view that the Bill supported my
                    conclusion that SCA <em>currently</em> limits the civil
                    jurisdiction of the District Court to the causes of action specified under the
                    Subject Matter Jurisdiction Provisions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Second Issue</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Since I held that the District Court’s
                    jurisdiction is limited by the Subject Matter Jurisdiction Provisions, it was
                    necessary for me to consider whether the Counterclaim raised causes of action
                    that fell within one or more of the Subject Matter Jurisdiction
                    Provisions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The parties’ arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     The appellants argued that the Counterclaim
                    raised the following causes of action which fall within the Subject Matter
                    Jurisdiction Provisions:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_52-p2_a"></a>(a)     The appellants argued that the
                        District Court has the jurisdiction to try the Counterclaim under
                        s 19(3)(b) SCA because the respondent has submitted to the jurisdiction
                        of the District Court by filing its Defence to the
                    Counterclaim.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_52-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
                        Counterclaim raises a cause of action “founded on contract”
                        within the meaning of s 20, SCA because, according to the appellants,
                        the Counterclaim alleges that the respondent breached its obligations under
                        a statutory contract with the appellants under the Building Management and
                        Strata Management Act (Cap 30C, Rev Ed 2008) (“BMSMA”).
                        BMSMA imposes a duty on the respondent to manage and administer the common
                        property for the benefit of all the subsidiary proprietors, tenants and
                        licensees.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_52-p2_c"></a>(c)     The
                        Counterclaim raises two causes of action “founded on tort”
                        within the meaning of s 20 SCA. The first cause of action was the
                        respondent’s breaching of its statutory duties in allowing some
                        subsidiary proprietors to encroach, occupy, obstruct and illegally use the
                        common property. The second cause of action was the respondent’s
                        commission of the tort of trespass by allowing the other subsidiary
                        proprietors to encroach, occupy, obstruct and illegally use the common
                        property.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_52-p2_d"></a>(d)     The
                        appellants referred to ss 32(10), 32(11) and 88 BMSMA. The appellants
                        argued that those sections confer the District Court with jurisdiction to
                        hear the claims that they raised in the Counterclaim. In this regard, the
                        appellants rely on s 19(6) SCA, which provides that “the
                        District Court shall have such jurisdiction as is vested in it by any other
                        written law”.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_52-p2_e"></a>(e)     The counterclaim raises an action “for the recovery of
                        immovable property” within the meaning of s 25
                    SCA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The respondent raised the following
                    arguments:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_53-p2_a"></a>(a)     Neither a breach of statutory duty
                        nor a breach of BMSMA comes within any of the Subject Matter Jurisdiction
                        Provisions.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_53-p2_b"></a>(b)     There could be no trespass by the respondent as the appellants are not in
                        possession of common property. Indeed, it is the respondent who is in
                        possession of the same.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_53-p2_c"></a>(c)     The Counterclaim “is doomed to fail”
                        because the appellants are claiming for both damages and an injunction even
                        though s 88 BMSMA provides that a subsidiary proprietor claiming for a
                        breach of any of the provisions Part V BMSMA can only seek either damages
                            <em>or</em> an order to restrain the breach of the
                        provision.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_53-p2_d"></a>(d)     Section 124 BMSMA provides that every application to court under BMSMA must
                        be by originating summons.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">My decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   The nature of the inquiry at this stage of the
                proceedings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     The respondent seemed to have misunderstood
                    the nature of the inquiry at this stage of the proceedings when it argued that
                    the Counterclaim was “doomed to fail”. I was not required to
                    determine whether there were merits to the Counterclaim. My role was limited to
                    determining whether the District Court had <em>jurisdiction</em> to hear the claims that the appellants’ have
                    raised in the Counterclaim. Accordingly, it was not necessary for me to consider
                    the respondent’s arguments based on ss 88 and 124
                BMSMA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     I observed, however, that the
                    respondent’s arguments on those provisions were not persuasive. As for the
                    use of the word “or” in s 88 BMSMA, I would have thought that
                    it is not <em>necessarily</em> impermissible to seek both
                    damages and an injunction in a claim. For example, it might be consistent with
                    s 88 BMSMA for a plaintiff to seek damages for past breaches <em>and</em> an injunction to restrain future breaches. Section
                    88 BMSMA would not appear to be infringed if such claims were made because the
                    claims would relate to different time frames.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     As for the argument on s 124 BMSMA, I
                    considered that the section did not apply to the action for breach of statutory
                    duty, which, as will be seen below, was the only action that was adequately
                    pleaded (see below at [61]). Section 124 BMSMA applies to “[e]very
                        <em>application</em> to the court under <em>this Act</em>” (emphasis added). As will be seen below
                    (see below at [64]-[67]), an action for breach of statutory duty is an action in
                    tort. The claim is not brought under BMSMA as such. Rather, the action is
                    brought as a common law claim. A similar approach was taken by the Court of
                    Appeal in <em>Management Corporation Strata Title Plan
                        No 980 v Yat Yuen Hong Co Pte Ltd and another</em> [1992]
                    3 SLR(R) 219 (“<em>Yat Yuen
                    Hong</em>”). In that case, the Court of Appeal was concerned,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, with whether proper notice of a
                    meeting of a management corporation was given. One of the arguments raised on
                    appeal was that the proceedings in the High Court were a nullity because the
                    proceedings were commenced by way of originating summons and not by way of a
                    summons in chambers. Section 46(1) Land Titles (Strata) Act (Cap 158, 1985
                    Rev Ed) (“LTSA”) required “every application to court under
                    [LTSA]” to be by summons in chambers. The Court of Appeal held that the
                    proceedings in the High Court did not concern an <em>application
                        under</em> the LTSA, even though LTSA provisions were “touched
                    on” in the course of proceedings (<em>Yat Yuen
                        Hong</em> at [35]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">35 We would now deal with the second issue in this appeal. The respondents
                        submitted that the entire proceedings below, which were begun by originating
                        summons, were a nullity because s 46(1) of the Act provides that "...
                        every application to court under this Act shall be by summons in chambers".
                        This submission is without substance. No question as to the
                        jurisdiction of the High Court arises in this connection. The proceedings in
                        the High Court dealt with issues which touched on the provisions of the Act.
                        They were not an application under the Act. At any rate, both parties had
                        proceeded under this originating process and it would be quite wrong to
                        allow the respondents to invalidate the entire proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Likewise, I thought that the appellant’s claim for a breach of
                    statutory duty was not an application under BMSMA, even though the provisions of
                    that Act might have to be referred to in the proceedings to determine the
                    content of the respondent’s statutory duty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Even if I was wrong on this point, as both
                    parties had come some way in the present action, I was of the view that it would
                    not be right to allow the respondent to invalidate the entire proceedings just
                    because the appellants’ counterclaim was not begun by originating
                    summons.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   My approach</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     It was relevant for me to consider, as a
                    preliminary issue, whether the claims that the appellants said were raised in
                    the Counterclaim were adequately pleaded. If the claims were not pleaded, it
                    would not be open to the appellants to raise those claims in support of their
                    argument that the District Court has jurisdiction over the Counterclaim, unless
                    the appellants obtain leave to amend the Counterclaim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Therefore my approach was to, first, consider
                    whether the claims that the appellants argue were raised in the Counterclaim
                    were adequately pleaded. Secondly, if those claims were adequately pleaded, I
                    had to consider whether they fell within any of the Subject Matter Jurisdiction
                    Provisions in SCA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(3)   Were the claims that the appellants allege were raised in
                the Counterclaim adequately pleaded?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     The Counterclaim repeats paragraphs 4 to 9 of
                    the appellants’ defence. Those paragraphs elaborate on the
                    appellants’ assertion that the respondent allowed other subsidiary
                    proprietors to place equipment, objects and other items on the common property.
                    The Counterclaim then states that the respondent breached its “duty of
                    care in law” to the subsidiary proprietors to ensure that the common
                    property was not obstructed. The Counterclaim also states that the respondent
                    has “arbitrarily exercised its powers in bad faith” by commencing
                    this action against the appellants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     Pleadings must contain material facts (see O
                    18, r 7(1) Rules of Court). Material facts for this purpose are those facts
                    which are necessary to form a complete cause of action in the sense that the
                    omission of such a fact would make the statement of claim bad (see <em>First Link Energy Pte Ltd v Creanovate Pte Ltd and another
                        action</em> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 1050 at [37]; <em>Multi-Pak Singapore Pte Ltd (in receivership) v Intraco Ltd and
                        others</em> [1992] 2 SLR(R) 382 at [29]; both cases referred
                    to <em>Bruce v Odhams Press Ltd</em> [1936]
                    1 KB 697 at 712).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     My view was that the only cause of action that
                    the appellants have adequately pleaded is the action for breach of statutory
                    duty. I did not find that the cause of action for breach of contract was
                    adequately pleaded. The relevant contract, here the by-laws, was not
                    specifically pleaded. It is true that the conduct constituting breach (<em>viz</em>. the respondent’s alleged failure to ensure
                    that the common property was not obstructed to deprive the subsidiary
                    proprietors of its use) was adequately pleaded. However, it is necessary for a
                    party to also plead the terms of the contract (see <em>Singapore
                        Court Practice 2009</em> (Jeffrey Pinsler , SC gen ed) (LexisNexis,
                    2003) at para 18/7/3).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     The cause of action for trespass was also not
                    adequately pleaded. It is true that only the material facts supporting the cause
                    of action for trespass need to be pleaded. The pleadings need not specifically
                    state the legal conclusion that the material facts constituted trespass (see
                        <em>Drane v Evangelou</em> [1978] 1 WLR 455
                    at 458). However, the facts pleaded in the Counterclaim do not support a cause
                    of action for trespass on the part of the <em>respondent</em>. At most, the Counterclaim has sufficient facts to
                    form an allegation that the <em>other subsidiary
                        proprietors</em> trespassed on the common property. I should add that
                    I am not deciding as to whether it is possible for a subsidiary proprietor to
                    commit a trespass on the common property, although it seemed to me (without my
                    deciding the point) that the respondent could not itself trespass on the common
                    property as it is the very body that is charged with managing the common
                    property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Similarly, the cause of action for the
                    recovery of immovable property was not adequately pleaded. The Counterclaim does
                    not assert sufficient facts to support an allegation that the appellants were
                    seeking recovery of the common property from the <em>respondent</em>. Likewise, it seemed to me (without my deciding the
                    point) that the appellants could not as a matter of law recover common property
                    from the respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(4)   Does an action for a breach of statutory duty fall within
                any of the Subject Matter Jurisdiction Provisions?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     My view was that an action for a breach of
                    statutory duty fell under s 20 SCA because it is an action founded on a
                    tort.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     A breach of statutory duty is a tort. The
                    editors of <em>Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Tort</em> (Sweet
                    &amp; Maxwell, 19th Ed, 2006) state the following at para 9-01:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A person who has suffered damage as a result of a breach of a statutory
                        duty <b><em>may</em></b> have an action <em>in
                            tort</em>, classified by Lord Browne-Wilkinson in X (Minors) v
                        Bedfordshire County Council as an “action for breach of statutory
                        duty simpliciter”. In English law this is a specific common law
                        action which is distinct from the tort of negligence, even where the
                        negligence action is based on a common law duty of care arising either from
                        the imposition of a statutory duty or from the performance of
                        it…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added; emphasis in original in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     There is also English Court of Appeal
                    authority that a breach of statutory duty is an action founded on tort for the
                    purpose of the County Courts Act 1959 (c 22) (UK) (“County Courts
                    Act”). In <em>Thornton v Kirlees Metropolitan Borough
                        Council</em> [1979] 1 QB 626 (“<em>Thornton</em>”), the English Court of Appeal had to consider
                    whether a claim for a mandatory injunction to order a statutory authority to
                    perform its statutory duty under the Housing (Homeless Persons) Act 1977
                    (c 48) (UK) was within the jurisdiction of the County Court. The County
                    Court decided that the claimant’s pleadings did not raise a cause of
                    action because the claimant was not entitled to sue the statutory authority for
                    breach of statutory duty and so the County Court did not have jurisdiction over
                    the case. On appeal, Megaw LJ noted that, in principle, an action for breach of
                    statutory duty would fall within the County Court’s jurisdiction because
                    it was an action for tort (at 634F-G):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The reason why Judge Hurwitz struck out the particulars of claim and
                        dismissed the action was that, in his judgment, no action lay against the
                        council for damages for any breach which they might have committed of that
                        statutory duty under section 3 (4) of the Act of 1977. Thus, the cause of
                        action pleaded was not within the jurisdiction of the county court. For this
                        purpose <em>an action based on an allegation of a breach of a
                            statutory duty</em>, with an allegation that damage has been
                        caused thereby to the plaintiff, can, the plaintiff asserts, be treated as
                            <em>being an action for tort</em> for the purpose
                        of section 39 of the County Courts Act 1959. The council do not assert the
                        contrary. <em>Thus, such an action, if it lies at all, would
                            be within the jurisdiction of the county court</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">I should add that s 39(1) of the County Courts Act 1959 is

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     Indeed, Ms Carolyn Tan, counsel for the
                    respondent, eventually conceded that a breach of a statutory duty is a tort for
                    present purposes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     As I have said, the action for breach of the
                    by-laws was not adequately pleaded. It is therefore not necessary for me to
                    decide whether such an action fell under the Subject Matter Jurisdiction
                    Provisions. I observed, however, that an action for breach of the by-laws could,
                    in principle, constitute an action founded on contract under s 20(1) SCA.
                    The BMSMA provides that the by-laws for common property are binding on the
                    subsidiary proprietors and the management corporation to the same extent as if
                    the by-laws were signed and sealed by the management corporation and each

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     Two High Court decisions have taken the view
                    that the by-laws constitute a statutory contract. In <em>Choo Kok

                    stated as follows (at [23]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">23 Since <em>the by-laws are statutorily constituted
                            contracts</em> between the management corporation and the

                        would appear logical to hold that the by-laws cannot take effect until these

                            under the by-laws and causes loss to another, the innocent party is
                            entitled to seek redress from the defaulter. The other features of a
                            contractual relationship will follow, and I shall deal with the time bar
                            issue later.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     Importantly, Kan J held that an action
                    for a breach of the by-laws is an action in contract for the purposes of the
                    Limitation Act (Cap. 163) (<em>Chia Sok Kheng
                        Kathleen</em> at [63]). I was of the opinion (without deciding on the
                    point) that Kan J’s view could be extended to the context of
                    characterising the cause of action for the purpose of subject matter
                    jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     I also observed that the action for breach of
                    the by-laws could fall under s 19(6) SCA, which provides that the District
                    Court has “such jurisdiction as is vested in it by any other written
                    law”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     Section 32(10) BMSMA provides as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(10)  The management corporation or subsidiary
                            proprietor, mortgagee in possession, lessee or occupier of a lot shall
                            be entitled to apply to <em>the court</em>
                            —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    for an order to enforce the performance of or
                            restrain the breach of any by-law by; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    to recover damages for any loss or injury to
                            person or property arising out of the breach of any by-law
                        from,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">any person bound to comply therewith, the management corporation or the
                        managing agent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     BMSMA does not define the court to which an
                    application may be made. However, s 2(1) Interpretation Act (Cap 1,
                    Rev Ed 2002), defines the word “court” as meaning “any
                    court of competent jurisdiction in Singapore”. The High Court has held
                    that the Subordinate Courts fall within this definition (<em>Public Prosecutor v D'Crus L Edward Epiphany</em>
                    [1993] 1 SLR(R) 128 at [7]). Accordingly, I was of the view that
                    the District Court has jurisdiction over an action for breach of the by-laws on
                    the basis of s 32(10) BMSMA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(5)   The argument based on s 19(3)(b) SCA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     Counsel for the appellants argued that the
                    District Court had jurisdiction under s 19(3)(b) SCA because the respondent
                    had submitted to the District Court’s jurisdiction by taking steps in the
                    proceedings. I found this argument to be wholly devoid of merit. Section
                    19(3)(b) SCA is, by its own terms, subject to the Subject Matter Jurisdiction
                    Provisions:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3)    A District Court shall have the jurisdiction
                                <em>in sections 20, 21, 25, 26 and 29
                                where</em> —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    the defendant is served with a writ or other
                            originating process —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(i)    in Singapore in the manner prescribed by Rules of
                            Court; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(ii)  outside Singapore in the circumstances authorised
                            by and in the manner prescribed by Rules of Court; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    the <em>defendant submits to the
                                jurisdiction of a District Court</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Section 19(3) SCA provides that the District Court has the
                    jurisdiction <em>in ss 20, 21, 25, 26 and 29</em> if either
                    ss 19(3)(a) or 19(3)(b) SCA is satisfied. Even if the respondent submitted
                    to the jurisdiction of the District Court, it is necessary to consider whether
                    the causes of action raised by the appellants fell within the Subject Matter
                    Jurisdiction Provisions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Conclusion on the First Appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     Since the appellants have raised a cause of
                    action that fell within the Subject Matter Jurisdiction Provisions, the District
                    Court had jurisdiction over the Counterclaim. Accordingly, I allowed the First
                    Appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Costs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     I decided that the appellants should have
                    costs for the First Appeal. In view of the appellants’ default in serving
                    the notice of appeal within the time required, I decided that the respondent
                    should have costs for the Second Appeal even though I allowed that appeal. The
                    quantum of each set of costs was to be the same and set-off against each
                    other.</p>
