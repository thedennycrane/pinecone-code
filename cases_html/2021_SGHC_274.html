This letter stated that the plaintiffs were in possession of a copy of a police report filed by this unnamed witness which raised “certain allegations of discrimination targeted at the Malays during the investigation process”. The letter further stated that the witness was “concerned that he may face the risk of action taken against him by the Attorney-General on behalf of the State for giving evidence in relation to the extent of discrimination targeted at the Malays during the investigation process”, but that “no such risks would occur if he [was] giving evidence under an Order of Court or if he [was] being subpoenaed”.

Nevertheless, the issue at hand was not what Mr Zuhairi had already said – which would be irrelevant for the reasons explained above – but what Mr Zuhairi <span class="font-italic">knew</span>.

An amendment to the originating summons to add an additional prayer under O 20 r 7 read with O 20 r 5(1) of the ROC should enable the real questions or issues in controversy between the parties to be determined: <span class="font-italic">Review Publishing </span><span class="font-italic">Co Ltd and another v Lee Hsien Loong and another appeal</span> [2010] 1 SLR 52 at [113]. This threshold was not met here. The real questions or issues in controversy between the parties in OS 825 are whether the plaintiffs’ rights under Art 9(1) and Art 12(1) of the Constitution were breached, and whether the AG had acted unlawfully, either through bias or by taking into account irrelevant considerations in prosecuting them under the MDA. Far from enabling these core questions to be determined, allowing the alleged disciplinary breaches of rr 15 and/or 29 of the PCR to be subsumed within OS 825 would distract the parties and the court from the determination of these core questions by introducing unrelated matters into the proceedings. Indeed, the alleged breach of r 29 of the PCR related to the duties owed by the State Counsel to <span class="font-italic">Mr Ravi </span>in his personal capacity as a legal practitioner, and OS 825 was not the appropriate platform to ventilate these complaints. The plaintiffs’ vague submission that these allegations cast doubt on the State Counsel’s impartiality and the plaintiffs’ right to a fair hearing was speculative and unsupported by any particulars.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 Further, OS 825 was not the proper forum to determine issues of disciplinary breach. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 In <span class="font-italic">Then </span><span class="font-italic">Khek Khoon and another v Arjun Permanand Samtani and another </span>[2012] 2 SLR 451 at [22], Quentin Loh J (as he then was) stated:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It … seems to me that <span class="font-italic">where one is concerned only with </span><span class="font-italic">breaches of the LPPCR, which do not trigger any concurrent breach of legal obligations owed by the counsel to the court or the client at Common Law, </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the proper forum for investigation and determination of the breach is the Law Society rather than the court</span>.

In ordering that Mr Ravi was personally liable to pay costs to the Prosecution, the Court of Appeal found that he had acted improperly in several respects. An example was where he made baseless allegations against the applicant’s previous counsel and “failed to abide by his professional duty to give counsel whose conduct he was criticising in court an opportunity to respond”, and had thereby breached r 29 of the PCR (see <span class="font-italic">Syed Suhail (</span><span class="font-italic">Costs) </span>at [28]–[40], and in particular at [36] and [38]). The Court of Appeal therefore held that Mr Ravi’s improper conduct had led to the incurring of unnecessary costs by the Prosecution and that it was just to make a personal costs order against him (<span class="font-italic">Syed Suhail (</span><span class="font-italic">Costs) </span>at [49] and [51]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) In <span class="font-italic">Miya </span><span class="font-italic">Manik</span>, the Court of Appeal found that there were “numerous aspects” of that case which, “taken together, suggested that Mr Thuraisingam may have been in breach of one or more of his duties” (<span class="font-italic">Miya </span><span class="font-italic">Manik</span> at [83]). It found Mr Thuraisingam’s conduct of the matter to be “wholly unsatisfactory” as he had “encumbered the court with a patently unmeritorious application which wasted the court’s time” (<span class="font-italic">Miya </span><span class="font-italic">Manik </span>at [85]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) In <span class="font-italic">Imran bin Mohd </span><span class="font-italic">Arip </span>at [97]–[98], the Court of Appeal found that Mr Thuraisingam’s conduct, in informing his client’s former counsel of the allegations made against them on the same day that the allegations were made known to the court, was conduct “in contravention of Rule 29 of the [PCR]” and “[fell] far short of the standards that are expected of counsel”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Based on these cases, Mr Ravi contended that the AG was wrong to argue that the court lacked jurisdiction and power to grant the declaration sought.

A prayer for a declaration is a not a necessary condition for it to do so, and neither was such a prayer in issue in the three cases where the Court of Appeal commented on Mr Ravi and Mr Thuraisingam’s conduct.

The plaintiffs are simply attempting to delay the execution of their proper legal punishment and re-open their own long-concluded criminal cases, and they have failed to provide any logical explanation for commencing OS 825 instead of filing a review application under Division 1B of Part XX of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“the CPC”).

The first proposition that Malay drug offenders facing capital charges are less able (despite interpretation services and assigned counsel) to express themselves articulately or appear credible compared to drug offenders of other ethnicities is wholly unfounded. The assertion was made without any rationale or evidence in support. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 As for the second proposed reason, I note preliminarily that the prayers in OS 825 refer only to the actions of the “Defendant” (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the AG) in “prosecuting” the plaintiffs. OS 825 does not include any prayers for declarations in respect of the actions of the <span class="font-italic">CNB </span>in investigating the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs explained in their Joint Affidavit that “[r]eferences to the CNB are references to the Defendant in its capacity as the appropriate party to civil proceedings under s 19(3) of the [GPA]”.

</div> but this submission is also wholly unsubstantiated. Importantly, the plaintiffs do not allege that the AG prosecutes Malay persons for capital offences when there are in fact <span class="font-italic">no grounds</span> for doing so. Instead, the plaintiffs’ case seems to be that, as between two offenders whom the AG has <span class="font-italic">similarly strong </span><span class="font-italic">grounds</span> for prosecuting for capital drug offences, the AG is more likely to prosecute the Malay offender than the offender of another ethnicity. However, the plaintiffs’ statistical data does not support this proposition. The plaintiffs have provided no statistical or other evidence of, for example, Chinese offenders in comparable positions escaping prosecution or being offered reduced charges while their Malay counterparts are charged with capital offences. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The plaintiffs also concede that there is no discrimination in the AG’s issue of CSAs. They explain that they omitted from their statistics cases where offenders were convicted on capital charges at first instance, but no death sentence was imposed, because there was no material disparity between the proportion of offenders of each ethnicity who received CSAs, and the AG’s issue of CSAs is therefore not responsible for the disproportionate number of Malay persons facing death sentences.

While there are no local cases developing the concept of indirect discrimination, I agree with the plaintiffs’ submission that the wording of Art 12(1) is broad enough to prohibit both direct discrimination and indirect discrimination. I would add that while there are no doubt differences across various jurisdictions on indirect discrimination, I consider it appropriate in this case to analyse the plaintiffs’ legal position on the basis of the arguments made and cases cited before me.

</div>
</div>
</div> This is in substance an allegation of direct discrimination, in that the AG’s policies, criteria and practices have allowed individual prosecutors to treat Malay suspects less favourably than other suspects <span class="font-italic">because of their ethnicity</span><span class="font-italic">.</span> But such direct discrimination “expressly requires a causal link between the less favourable treatment and the protected characteristic” (see <span class="font-italic">Essop</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [25], quoted at [61] above), and the plaintiffs’ statistical evidence provides no basis for the court to infer such a causal link between the AG’s decisions to prosecute Malay suspects and their ethnicity. Indeed, as the AG argues (see [34] above), there are many individual, case-specific factors which could break the causal connection the plaintiffs seek to draw between Malay ethnicity on one end, and the less favourable treatment on the other. The statistical evidence the plaintiffs rely on in this case is, analytically, not itself sufficient to establish such a causal connection. Absent such a causal link to show <span class="font-italic">direct </span>discrimination, the plaintiffs would have to adduce specific evidence that some indiscriminately applied policy, criteria or practice of the AG’s has put Malay ethnicities at a particular disadvantage in order to support a claim of <span class="font-italic">indirect </span>discrimination. This, however, is not their case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 I return, then, to the first step of the test set out in <span class="font-italic">Syed Suhail (Leave)</span>, which requires the plaintiffs to show that they were treated differently from other equally situated persons. The notion of being equally situated is “an analytical tool used to isolate the <span class="font-italic">purported rationale</span> for differential treatment, so that its legitimacy may then be assessed properly” [emphasis added] (<span class="font-italic">Syed Suhail (Leave) </span>at [62]). In this case, the plaintiffs argue that the alleged differential treatment is evidenced by the fact that Malay persons are disproportionately represented in the group of offenders prosecuted for capital drug offences and are less likely than offenders of other ethnicities to have their charges reduced below the death penalty threshold. The plaintiffs further argue that the purported rationale for this differential treatment is simply the fact that an individual is of Malay ethnicity.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 However, as the Privy Council explained in <span class="font-italic">Ong Ah Chuan and another v Public Prosecutor </span>[1979–1980] SLR(R) 710 (“<span class="font-italic">Ong Ah Chuan</span>”) at [35], the right to equal protection requires that “like should be compared with like”, and individuals should be accorded “equal treatment with other individuals in similar circumstances”. In <span class="font-italic">Ong Ah Chuan </span>at [35], the Privy Council also noted (albeit in the context of considering whether <span class="font-italic">legislation </span>breached Art 12(1)) that Art 12(1) “does not forbid discrimination in punitive treatment between one class of individuals and another class in relation to which there is <span class="font-italic">some difference in the circumstances of the offence that has been committed</span>” [emphasis added]. For example, in <span class="font-italic">Syed Suhail (Leave)</span>, prisoners were regarded as being equally situated after clemency had been denied and before their executions had been scheduled. Prior to the denial of clemency, the time it takes for a prisoner’s proceedings to come to a conclusion “turns on the circumstances of each individual case, and it is therefore difficult to make any meaningful comparison between prisoners” (<span class="font-italic">Syed Suhail (Leave) </span>at [64]–[66]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 In the present case, the plaintiffs’ arguments are premised on the<span class="font-italic"> </span>entire class of offenders who are suspected of having committed capital drug offences being regarded as equally situated persons. The plaintiffs contend that the fact that Malay offenders within that class are more likely to be sentenced to death than offenders of other ethnicities, constitutes differential treatment which calls for justification by the AG.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Decisions to charge offenders within this class must turn on the precise circumstances of the offence committed in each case. As the Court of Appeal observed in <span class="font-italic">Ramalingam </span>at [24] in relation to the exercise of prosecutorial discretion, the AG is “entitled and obliged to take into account many factors” in deciding what offences two offenders involved in the same criminal conduct should be charged with, if any. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Ramalingam </span>went on to list some relevant factors at [24] and [63]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Relevant factors for the Prosecution’s consideration in making prosecutorial decisions include the available evidence, public interest considerations, the personal circumstances of the offender, the offender’s degree of culpability, <span class="font-italic">etc.</span> Where these factors apply differently to different offenders, this would justify differential treatment between them.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[I]n the context of the prosecutorial power, the Prosecution is obliged to consider, in addition to the legal guilt of the offender, his moral blameworthiness, the gravity of the harm caused to the public welfare by his criminal activity, and a myriad of other factors, including whether there is sufficient evidence against a particular offender, whether the offender is willing to co-operate with the law enforcement authorities in providing intelligence, whether one offender is willing to testify against his co-offenders, and so on – up to and including the possibility of showing some degree of compassion in certain cases.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Similarly, in <span class="font-italic">Quek </span><span class="font-italic">Hock Lye v Public Prosecutor </span>[2012] 2 SLR 1012 (“<span class="font-italic">Quek Hock Lye</span>”) at [24], the Court of Appeal found that even divergent consequences faced by accused persons involved in the <span class="font-italic">same criminal enterprise</span>, arising<span class="font-italic"> </span>from the prescribed punishments flowing from their respective charges by the AG, were not <span class="font-italic">per se </span>sufficient to found a successful Art 12(1) challenge. This was because, as the court explained, the different prosecutorial charging decisions may have been made for legitimate reasons, including the considerations outlined in <span class="font-italic">Ramalingam </span>at [63]. Even more legitimate considerations would be in play in cases that do <span class="font-italic">not</span> involve the same criminal conduct or enterprise, as the circumstances of the offences and the offenders themselves would differ. These considerations would provide legitimate reasons for differential treatment at the second step of the two-step test in <span class="font-italic">Syed Suhail (Leave)</span>. However, they are also relevant at the <span class="font-italic">first </span>step of the test in illustrating the rich diversity of circumstances that render it illogical to regard the<span class="font-italic"> </span>entire class of offenders who are suspected of having committed capital drug offences as equally situated persons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 The importance of precisely and correctly identifying the group of equally situated persons is illustrated by the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Muhammad </span><span class="font-italic">Ridzuan bin Mohd Ali v Attorney-General </span>[2015] 5 SLR 1222 (“<span class="font-italic">Ridzuan</span>”). Here, the AG had granted a CSA under s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the MDA to the applicant’s co-offender, but not to the applicant, who was given the mandatory death sentence. The applicant alleged that the AG’s decision declining to grant him a CSA was made in breach of Art 12. The Court of Appeal held that the applicant had to show two things in order to discharge his evidentiary burden: first, that his level of involvement in the offence and the consequent knowledge he acquired of the drug syndicate he was dealing with was practically identical to his co-offender’s level of involvement and the knowledge his co-offender could have acquired; and, secondly and more importantly, that he and his co-offender had provided practically the same information to the CNB, yet only his co-offender had been given the CSA (<span class="font-italic">Ridzuan</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [51]). On the facts, the Court of Appeal found that the applicant’s involvement in the crime was “clearly not identical” to that of his co-offender as they were involved in different capacities, with the applicant arranging the drug deliveries while his co-offender interacted first-hand with the drug courier (<span class="font-italic">Ridzuan</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [53]). The Court of Appeal also found that, as it was not privy to the full details of all the information that each offender gave the CNB, it “would be engaging in conjecture” if it concluded that the applicant and his co-offender had given practically identical information to the CNB (<span class="font-italic">Ridzuan</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [54]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 In <span class="font-italic">Ridzuan</span>, the Court of Appeal applied the test of “deliberate and arbitrary” discrimination (<span class="font-italic">Ridzuan</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [49]), which has since been superseded by the two-step test set out in <span class="font-italic">Syed Suhail (Leave)</span>. Nevertheless, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Syed Suhail (Leave) </span>at [61] considered that it would have been sufficient for the applicant in <span class="font-italic">Ridzuan</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>to discharge his evidential burden by showing that he could be considered to be equally situated with his co-offender, such that any differential treatment required justification. Based on the Court of Appeal’s analysis in <span class="font-italic">Ridzuan</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the applicant had not done so, and his Art 12(1) challenge would therefore have failed even under the two-step test in <span class="font-italic">Syed Suhail (Leave)</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Here, the plaintiffs have not provided any explanation for omitting to draw comparisons between themselves and the co-offenders in their own cases, which are the group with whom the plaintiffs would appear to be most closely situated. As the AG points out, five of these co-offenders had their charges reduced below the capital threshold by the Prosecution.

</div> This weakens the plaintiffs’ case considerably. Further, even if the plaintiffs’ statistical data is accepted as complete and accurate, the only variables reflected are the ethnic group and nationality of each offender.

The manner in which the plaintiffs’ statistics are presented therefore <span class="font-italic">presuppose</span><span class="font-italic">s</span> that all these offenders were equally situated and that the sole reason for differential treatment was their ethnicity, which are the very facts the plaintiffs bear the burden of showing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 The AG has deposed that the ethnicity of the plaintiffs was not a factor in making the decisions to prosecute them and that no policies or practices pertaining to the exercise of prosecutorial discretion that involve considerations of an offender’s ethnicity were applied in making those decisions.

</div> As <span class="font-italic">Ramalingam </span>and <span class="font-italic">Quek Hock Lye </span>make clear, there are a multitude of other factors based on which the AG could and should have legitimately differentiated between these offenders. The evidence adduced by the plaintiffs is therefore not sufficient to show even a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>breach of Art 12(1), as it does not show that the plaintiffs, as Malay persons, were accorded differential treatment from <span class="font-italic">other equally situated persons</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 A parallel can be drawn with <span class="font-italic">Syed Suhail (Leave)</span>, where the Court of Appeal held<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [41]–[42] that the mere fact that few or even no clemency petitions had been granted over a long period of time was insufficient to raise the suspicion that the Cabinet had adopted an unconstitutional blanket policy of disregarding clemency petitions in all drug-related cases. It was “entirely conceivable” that, over the course of many years, there had simply been few or no exceptional cases where the exercise of the clemency power was warranted. Similarly, in the present case, it may well be that from 2010 to 1 June 2021 there were, as a matter of fact, more cases against Malay offenders where the AG had grounds to prosecute the offender for a capital drug offence. These statistics alone do not raise the suspicion that the AG made the relevant prosecutorial decisions <span class="font-italic">because</span> the offender was of Malay ethnicity. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 This conclusion is buttressed by the presumptions of constitutionality and legality which provide, albeit only as a starting point, that the acts of those holding public office will not presumptively be treated as suspect: see <span class="font-italic">Syed Suhail (Leave)</span> at [63] and <span class="font-italic">Ramalingam </span>at [46]–[47] and [72]. The plaintiffs rely on the remarks of Quentin Loh J (as he then was) in <span class="font-italic">Lim Meng </span><span class="font-italic">Suang and another v Attorney-General </span>[2013] 3 SLR 118 at [107] cautioning a party seeking to uphold the constitutionality of an impugned legislative provision against a posture that he “need only sit back and see what the challenger puts forward”.

</div> Nevertheless, in the present case, in the AG’s exercise of his constitutional role, it is clear that a multitude of considerations may legitimately influence the AG’s exercise of his prosecutorial discretion given its highly fact-specific nature, and these surrounding circumstances provide an eminently reasonable basis for treating different offenders differently.

</div> This is a fundamental mischaracterisation of <span class="font-italic">Eng</span><span class="font-italic"> Foong Ho</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 <span class="font-italic">Eng Foong Ho </span>concerned the Jin Long Si Temple (“the Temple”) which was located next to the Ramakrishna Mission (“the Mission”) and the Bartley Christian Church (“the Church”). The Collector of Land Revenue had compulsorily acquired the Temple property, but not the land occupied by the Mission or the Church. The appellants, who were devotees of the Temple, applied for a declaration that the acquisition of the Temple property violated Art 12 of the Constitution. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 The appellants’ case was that the right to equal treatment in Art 12 required that if the property (or place of worship) of one religious group was compulsorily acquired by law in an area where other religious groups also had properties (or places of worship), all should be similarly dealt with at the same time: <span class="font-italic">Eng</span><span class="font-italic"> Foong Ho </span>at [24]. However, the appellants were not arguing that there ought to be equality of <span class="font-italic">result</span> in the application of the relevant law. This would lead to “absurd” outcomes. Instead, the Court of Appeal understood the appellants’ argument to be that “whilst there was, <span class="font-italic">factually</span> speaking, an inequality in <span class="font-italic">result</span>, this result came about because of a <span class="font-italic">normatively</span> defective <span class="font-italic">process of treatment</span> that had violated Art 12 of the Constitution”. To ascertain whether this was indeed the case, the court had to examine “the reasons why the State had chosen to acquire the [T]emple property and not those of the Mission and the Church, and whether the reasons show that there was any discrimination against the appellants as members of the Temple” (<span class="font-italic">Eng</span><span class="font-italic"> Foong Ho </span>at [25]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 On the facts, the Court of Appeal held that there had been no violation of Art 12, applying the threshold of “intentional and arbitrary discrimination” (<span class="font-italic">Eng</span><span class="font-italic"> Foong Ho </span>at [30]). As I have noted, this “deliberate and arbitrary” test is no longer the applicable test for a breach of Art 12(1) following <span class="font-italic">Syed Suhail (Leave)</span>. Nevertheless, in <span class="font-italic">Syed Suhail (Leave) </span>at [59], the Court of Appeal observed that it had not in fact applied the strict “deliberate and arbitrary” test in <span class="font-italic">Eng</span><span class="font-italic"> Foong Ho </span>as it had considered the reasons given by the officers overseeing the land acquisition for their decision and found it “plain” that the decision was justified by valid planning considerations (<span class="font-italic">Eng</span><span class="font-italic"> Foong Ho </span>at [32]–[37]). This suggests that the outcome<span class="font-italic"> </span>of <span class="font-italic">Eng</span><span class="font-italic"> Foong Ho </span>would be similar under the two-step test set out in <span class="font-italic">Syed Suhail (Leave)</span>. At the first step of the test, the court would have found that the Temple, the Mission and the Church were equally situated and yet the Temple was treated differently. However, at the second step of the test, the court would have found that this differential treatment was based on legitimate reasons – in this case, valid planning considerations that the Collector of Land Revenue was entitled to take into account in exercising his powers of compulsory acquisition. <span class="font-italic">Eng</span><span class="font-italic"> Foong Ho </span>therefore does not detract from the need for the plaintiffs to show that they were <span class="font-italic">treated differently from equally situated persons</span>, having regard to the different legal and evidential considerations (such as those outlined at [67] above) that would apply in different cases. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Foreign case law</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 The plaintiffs also rely on several discrimination cases from the US, the UK, the European Court of Human Rights (“the ECtHR”) and Canada, where statistical evidence was used to demonstrate the unequal effects of a law or policy.

A municipal ordinance provided that it was unlawful for any person to carry on a laundry business without first obtaining the consent of the board of supervisors of the building. The petitioners were found guilty of violating this ordinance and were imprisoned. The US Supreme Court held that, although the ordinance was “fair on its face and impartial in appearance”, it had been applied by the authorities in a discriminatory way. The petitioners had “complied with every requisite”, yet the consent of the supervisors of the building was withheld from them and 200 other Chinese nationals while 80 other non-Chinese individuals were permitted to carry on the same business under similar conditions. No reason for this discrimination was shown and the irresistible conclusion was that the only reason for it was “hostility to the race and nationality to which the petitioners belong[ed]”.

</div> the applicants, who were of Roma origin, had been placed in special schools for children with special needs, in contrast to ordinary primary schools. The applicants alleged that they had been discriminated against in the enjoyment of their right to education on account of their race or ethnic origin because the number of Roma children in special schools was disproportionately high. The ECtHR noted that “a difference in treatment may take the form of disproportionately prejudicial effects of a general policy or measure which, though couched in neutral terms, discriminates against a group”. Such a situation might amount to indirect discrimination, as that concept had been developed in European jurisprudence (<span class="font-italic">DH </span>at [184]). The issue was therefore whether the legislation on placements in special schools had been applied in a manner which resulted in a disproportionate number of Roma children, including the applicants, being placed in special schools without justification, and whether such children were thereby placed at a significant disadvantage (<span class="font-italic">DH </span>at [185]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 The ECtHR held that, in assessing the impact of a measure or practice on an individual or group, “statistics which appear on critical examination to be reliable and significant will be sufficient to constitute the <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>evidence the applicant is required to produce” (<span class="font-italic">DH </span>at [188]). In <span class="font-italic">DH</span>, the statistical data relied on by the applicants was obtained from questionnaires sent out to the head teachers of special and primary schools in the town in question in 1999. While the ECtHR accepted that these statistics might not be entirely reliable as no official information on the ethnic origin of the pupils existed, the ECtHR nevertheless considered that these figures revealed a dominant trend, confirmed both by the respondent State (the Czech Republic) and independent supervisory bodies, which showed that the number of Roma children in special schools was disproportionately high. Thus, despite being couched in neutral terms, the relevant statutory provisions “had considerably more impact in practice on Roma children than on non-Roma children” (<span class="font-italic">DH </span>at [193]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 The statistical evidence was “sufficiently reliable and significant to give rise to a strong presumption of indirect discrimination”, and the burden of proof therefore shifted to the Government to show that the difference in the impact of the legislation was the result of objective factors unrelated to ethnic origin (<span class="font-italic">DH </span>at [195]). The Government failed to do so. The ECtHR found that the Government could not rely on the tests used to assess children’s learning abilities or difficulties to justify the impugned difference in treatment because these tests were “conceived for the majority population and did not take Roma specifics into consideration”, and there was at least “a danger that the tests were biased and that the results were not analysed in the light of the particularities and special characteristics of the Roma children who sat them” (<span class="font-italic">DH </span>at [199]–[201]). On this basis, the ECtHR ultimately concluded that there had been a violation of Art 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights (which provides that the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms in the Convention “shall be secured without discrimination on any ground”), read in conjunction with Art 2 of Protocol No 1 of the same (which protects the right to education) (<span class="font-italic">DH </span>at [210]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 Second, in <span class="font-italic">R v Secretary of State for Employment, ex </span><span class="font-italic">parte Seymour-Smith and another </span>[2000] 1 All ER 857 (“<span class="font-italic">Seymour-Smith</span>”),

</div> the applicants were female employees who were dismissed before they had completed the qualifying period (two years of continuous employment) for compensation for unfair dismissal. They applied for judicial review of the legislation which had increased the qualifying period from one year to two years, contending that it was indirectly discriminatory against women as fewer women than men were able to comply with it. The UK House of Lords found that the evidence showed a persistent and constant disparity over a long period between the proportions of men and women able to satisfy the qualifying period, so as to amount to indirect discrimination for the purposes of Art 119 of the Treaty Establishing the European Community (which enshrined the right to equal pay for equal work as between men and women), unless shown to be justified by objective factors unrelated to any discrimination based on sex. However, the House of Lords went on to find that the legislation in question was a reasonable response to a legitimate aim unrelated to any discrimination based on sex, and that it was therefore objectively justified.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 Third, in <span class="font-italic">Fraser v Canada (Attorney General) </span>[2020] SCJ No 28 (“<span class="font-italic">Fraser</span>”),

</div> the claimants were three women who were retired members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (“RCMP”). After taking maternity leave, they faced difficulties in combining their work obligations with their childcare responsibilities, and the RCMP did not permit regular members to work part-time. Consequently, they enrolled for a job-sharing programme in which members could split the duties and responsibilities of one full-time position. The claimants were later informed that they would not be able to purchase full-time pension credit for their job-sharing service. The claimants argued that the pension consequences of job-sharing had a discriminatory impact on women contrary to s 15(1) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which provides that “[e]very individual is equal before and under the law and has the right to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination”, and in particular without discrimination based on certain protected characteristics (including sex). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 A majority of the Supreme Court of Canada allowed the claimants’ claim on the basis of “adverse impact discrimination”, which occurs when “a seemingly neutral law has a disproportionate impact on members of groups protected on the basis of an enumerated or analogous ground” (<span class="font-italic">Fraser </span>at [30]). This is a similar concept to indirect discrimination, as defined at [61] above. The Court held that full-time RCMP members who job-shared had to sacrifice pension benefits because of a temporary reduction in working hours, and that this arrangement had a disproportionate impact on women and perpetuated their historical disadvantage (<span class="font-italic">Fraser </span>at [6]). More precisely, the use of an RCMP member’s temporary reduction in working hours as a basis to impose less favourable pension consequences plainly had a disproportionate adverse impact on women, as the evidence showed that: (a) RCMP members who worked reduced hours in the job-sharing programme were predominantly women with young children; and (b) from 2010 to 2014, 100% of members working reduced hours through job-sharing were women, and most of them cited childcare as their reason for doing so (<span class="font-italic">Fraser </span>at [97] and [106]). While there was “no universal measure for what level of statistical disparity is necessary to demonstrate that there is a disproportionate impact”, the goal of statistical evidence was ultimately to establish “a disparate pattern of exclusion or harm that is statistically significant and not simply the result of chance”, and the weight given to statistics would depend on factors such as their quality and methodology (<span class="font-italic">Fraser </span>at [59]). Further, the statistics used in this case were bolstered by “compelling evidence about the disadvantages women face as a group in balancing professional and domestic work” (<span class="font-italic">Fraser </span>at [98]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 Fourth, in <span class="font-italic">Essop</span>, the claimants were employees of the UK Home Office who were all subject to the requirement to pass a core skills assessment as a prerequisite for promotion to certain civil service grades. A report commissioned by the Home Office from a firm of occupational psychologists revealed that candidates from Black and Minority Ethnic groups and older candidates had lower pass rates for the assessment than White and younger candidates, although the reason for this disparity was unknown (see <span class="font-italic">Essop</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [9]). The core skills assessment requirement was found to be indirectly discriminatory as it particularly disadvantaged the group to which the claimants belonged. It was in this context that the UK Supreme Court said at [28] of <span class="font-italic">Essop</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>that it was “commonplace for the disparate impact, or particular disadvantage, to be established on the basis of statistical evidence”.

As outlined at [67] above, the AG is entitled and obliged to take into account a range of factors in exercising his prosecutorial discretion under Art 35(8) of the Constitution. While the plaintiffs did make an assertion that Malay offenders are less able to express themselves articulately or appear credible when giving evidence in court because of their generally lower socio-economic and educational status in Singapore, this assertion was unsubstantiated (as I have explained at [45] above). Aside from this assertion, the plaintiffs’ case is not based on any particular disadvantage suffered by Malay suspects as a group such that they are less able to meet requirements (for example, the requirements for the exercise of prosecutorial discretion not to charge a suspect with a capital drug offence) that are applied <span class="font-italic">indiscriminately</span> to suspects of all ethnicities. There is no evidence, in any event, that persons of the other ethnicities who have been charged with similar offences are not of the same socio-economic and educational status as the plaintiffs. Further, the plaintiffs “categorically reject” the suggestion that Malay persons are more likely to commit capital drug offences than persons of other ethnicities.

</div> is wholly misconceived. As the Court of Appeal explained in <span class="font-italic">Yong </span><span class="font-italic">Vui Kong </span>at [91], the rule against bias is distinct from the constitutional prohibition against discrimination in Art 12. What the rule against bias prohibits is “a person acting as a judge in his own cause in any matter where there is an <span class="font-italic">actual or potential conflict of interest</span>” [emphasis added], so as to protect the integrity of the decision-making process. Thus, in <span class="font-italic">Yong </span><span class="font-italic">Vui Kong </span>at [112], the Court of Appeal held that it was conceptually possible for the President or one or more members of the Cabinet to be placed in a conflict of interest <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis </span>clemency decisions – for example, if the President was related to the offender in question – and for those decisions to then be challenged on the ground of bias. In so far as the plaintiffs are arguing that the statistical disparity in the treatment of Malay capital drug offenders gives rise to an unlawful <span class="font-italic">appearance </span><span class="font-italic">of</span> <span class="font-italic">discrimination</span> against Malay offenders, the rule against bias is not properly invoked and adds nothing to the plaintiffs’ arguments on Art 12(1) in this case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 I therefore find that there is no basis for the court to grant the third declaration sought by the plaintiffs. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Abuse of process</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 I turn finally to consider the AG’s submission that OS 825 is an abuse of process as the plaintiffs are merely attempting to launch another collateral attack against their previously concluded criminal appeals and to delay the execution of their proper legal punishment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 In this context, OS 825 is part of a series of unsuccessful post-appeal challenges started by one or more of the plaintiffs. It is also the second constitutional challenge based on Arts 9 and 12 that one or more of the plaintiffs have filed. On 16 September 2020, Mr Suhail applied for a prohibiting order against the Singapore Prison Service (“SPS”) to stay his impending execution on the ground that his right to equality under Art 12(1) was violated by the differential treatment effected by the SPS between foreigners and Singaporeans in carrying out the death sentence, more specifically, because the order of execution did not follow the order of sentencing. He also argued that his right to life under Art 9(1) was violated because the clemency power under Art 22P of the Constitution had been extinguished owing to disuse.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 The AG contends that the plaintiffs ought properly to have raised the matters they are now relying on in their criminal cases, or to have filed a review application under Division 1B of Part XX of the CPC, instead of commencing civil proceedings <span class="font-italic">via </span>OS 825. The AG suggests that the plaintiffs did not do so because they would not have been able to obtain leave to make a review application under s 394H of the CPC as they would have first had to satisfy the stringent conditions in s 394J of the CPC. Moreover, their solicitors would have had to make an affidavit in accordance with the requirements in r 11(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Criminal Procedure Rules 2018, which would have required them to show, among other things, that there is “good reason why the material could not have been adduced in court earlier, at any stage of the proceedings in the criminal matter in respect of which the earlier decision was made”.

On the other hand, different remedies exist under criminal and civil procedure for a variety of reasons. The anticipated unavailability of recourse under one cannot, as a matter of course, lead to an assumption that there is abuse in the use of another. In this regard, I note the plaintiffs’ clarification that they seek only declaratory orders in OS 825, and that they understand that they would have to make a separate review application under s 394J of the CPC should they wish to overturn their criminal convictions.

</div> I am also cognisant of the fact that the plaintiffs’ case in OS 825 is based in part on the outcomes<span class="font-italic"> </span>of their criminal cases; and that their allegations of differential treatment against them collectively, as persons of Malay ethnicity,<span class="font-italic"> </span>involve rather different considerations from those relevant to criminal conviction and sentencing.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 Nevertheless, it is well established that proceedings which are manifestly groundless or without foundation are an abuse of the process of the court: <span class="font-italic">Miya </span><span class="font-italic">Manik </span>at [64]. It is in light of the speculative nature of this case that I consider the argument on abuse of process. First, an analysis of the statistical basis of the plaintiffs’ case reveals that the premise of their case is logically flawed. The plaintiffs sought to argue that statistical disparities, without more, may suffice to establish a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case of discrimination. This causal link is obscure. They have, in essence, asked the court to act on conjecture. Second, the plaintiffs have made no genuine effort to consider or explain how the legal requirements for the grant of declaratory relief, as well as for each of the three declarations sought, are met. Instead, they have baldly mischaracterised <span class="font-italic">Eng</span><span class="font-italic"> Foong Ho</span> and cited foreign cases without any responsible attempt to argue how the reasoning in these cases applies within the legal framework set out in our local jurisprudence on the relevant provisions of our Constitution. And, prior to the hearing of OS 825, I dealt with two interlocutory applications which were also patently groundless (see [5]–[23] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 In the multi-cultural setting that forms the background to this application, serious allegations concerning ethnicity and equality ought not to be made without due care and diligence, particularly in cases where life and liberty are at stake. Judicial processes furnish specific remedies to plaintiffs who seek recourse premised on specific evidence of unlawfulness. The court exists as a forum for the assessment of facts, inferences to be drawn from facts, and the grant of particular relief within the framework laid down by existing case law and statute. The law develops in the specific context of the evidence adduced in each case by the parties before the court. It is disrespectful to the court process to bring before the court speculative assertions, conjecture cloaked in general interest, and cases that a cursory reading would show to be irrelevant. Fundamental to such misuse of the court’s process is the diversion of valuable public resources away from the deserving litigants whom the court exists to serve. Public resources are finite: the cost of manifestly unmeritorious claims is borne by the community as a whole. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 In light of the history of this matter, the evidence adduced and the legal arguments made, I find that OS 825 is an abuse of the process of the court.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 In conclusion, I decline to grant any of the declarations sought by the plaintiffs and accordingly dismiss OS 825. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 I shall hear the parties on costs. In this context, I note that various contentions were made in respect of conduct on both sides in relation to the interlocutory applications and OS 825.
