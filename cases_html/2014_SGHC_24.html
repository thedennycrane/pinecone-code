<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The
plaintiff, Alpha Bank S.A. (“the Bank”), applied as mortgagees on 20
December 2013 <em>vide</em> Summons No 6520
of 2013 (“SUM 6520”) for the vessel, <em>Sea Urchin</em>,
of the port of Limassol, Cyprus (“the Vessel”) to be sold <em>pendente lite</em> to a named buyer and at
a stated price (<em>ie</em>, prayer 2 of
SUM 6520). As an alternative to a direct judicial sale, the Bank’s
fall-back application was for the Vessel to be sold <em>pendente
lite</em> by the Sheriff in the usual way by public auction
or private treaty (<em>ie</em>, prayer 2a
of SUM 6520).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       In
this case, the Bank arrested the Vessel fully laden with a cargo
of soya beans in bulk. At the time of the arrest, the Vessel was
in Singapore for bunkers en route to Qingdao, China where the cargo
was to be discharged and delivered to receivers. The purpose of
the direct sale <em>pendente lite</em> was for
the Vessel under new ownership to carry and discharge the cargo
in Qingdao. The question to be decided is whether the facts of this
case constitute special circumstances to warrant a direct judicial
sale to a named buyer at a specified price (see <em>The </em><em>Turtle Bay</em> [2013] 4 SLR 615 (“<em>The Turtle Bay</em>”) at [29]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Chronology of proceedings leading
to the application for a direct sale</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The
Vessel, a bulk carrier fully laden with a cargo of soya beans, was arrested
by the Bank on 30 October 2013 after the defendant shipowner, Keel
Marine Company Limited (“the Defendant”), a company incorporated under
the laws of Cyprus, defaulted on a loan agreement that was secured by
a first priority mortgage of the Vessel. The Defendant entered an appearance
to the Bank’s <em>in rem</em> action on 31
October 2013. On 18 November 2013, the Defendant applied <em>vide</em> Summons No 5874 of 2013 to, <em>inter alia</em>, (a) set aside the warrant
of arrest; and (b) stay the action in favour of the Greek courts,
including a temporary release of the Vessel to enable her to continue
her voyage to China and to discharge the cargo on board. By the
time the Bank’s application in SUM 6520 was listed for hearing on
6 January 2014, the Defendant had reached a private arrangement
with the Bank. Mr Lawrence Teh for the Defendant thus informed the
court that the Defendant was not opposing the Bank’s application
for a direct sale. Before this court, the Defendant was no longer
challenging the propriety of the Bank’s claim or the arrest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       There
were three other interested parties supporting the Bank’s application
for a direct sale. It was made known at the outset by counsel representing
those interests that their support did not extend to prayer 2a in SUM
6520. Mr Kelly Yap (“Mr Yap”) represented the intervener, Qingdao Bohi
Agricultural Development Co Ltd (“the Intervener”), which was granted
leave to intervene in these proceedings on 6 January 2014, and entered
an appearance on 17 January 2014.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Ms
Wendy Tan (“Ms Tan”) represented Pacific Bulk Shipping (Cayman)
Ltd (“Pacific Bulk”) which trip-chartered the Vessel from Swissmarine
Services S.A. (“Swissmarine”), the time charterers of the Vessel.
Pacific Bulk in turn sub-chartered the Vessel to the Intervener.
The Intervener is asserting rights of ownership to the cargo of
soya beans. Pacific Bulk claims ownership of the bunkers on board.
Swissmarine was represented by Mr K Muralitherapany (“Mr Murali”).
Mr Edmund Koh stood in for Mr Murali at the adjourned hearing on
27 January 2014. For convenience, Pacific Bulk and Swissmarine are
collectively referred to as “the Charterers”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The
Charterers had not intervened but through their counsel undertook
to do so on 27 January 2014.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">
<em>The Turtle
Bay</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       As
prayer 2 is for a direct judicial sale, I begin with <em>The </em><em>Turtle </em><em>Bay</em> where it was observed that a direct
judicial sale at a pre-determined price to a named person is generally
not the accepted way to sell a vessel under arrest. A direct judicial
sale represents a departure from the normal order that the Sheriff
sells a vessel under arrest by appraisement, advertisement, and
inviting bids to purchase the vessel: see O 70 of the Rules of Court
(Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the Rules of Court”). More often than
not, an application for a court-sanctioned private sale is advanced
for the applicant’s own purpose and benefit and is <em>prima
facie</em> unfair (<em>The Turtle Bay</em> at
[23]). In <em>The Turtle Bay</em> I referred
to <em>Bank of Scotland plc v The Owners of the
MV Union Gold and others</em> [2013] EWHC 1696 (Admlty) (“<em>The Union Gold</em>”) where Teare J held at
[20] that as a matter of general principle the court should not
order a sale to a buyer found by the arresting party at a pre-determined
price.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Basically,
an admiralty judicial sale confers on the purchaser clean title
of the vessel by transferring existing maritime claims of all <em>in rem</em> claimants against the vessel to
the sale proceeds of the vessel. I explained in <em>The </em><em>Turtle Bay</em> at [15] that “this concomitant
transfer of maritime claims (and priority) from the vessel to the
proceeds of sale in court is the <em>raison d’etre</em> of
the principle that a judicial sale is for the protection and benefit
of all persons interested in the <em>res</em>;
it is not only for the interest of the arresting party alone”. At
[17]–[18], I went on to explain the procedural safeguards in the
sale process in the following manner:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">17    To
protect the interests of all persons with <em>in
rem</em> claims against the vessel including the defendant
shipowner, the court has to have entire control over the sale process
thereby safeguarding the propriety and integrity of the sale process
and, ultimately, instilling confidence and standing of the judicial sale
from this jurisdiction. To this end, there are comprehensive procedures in
O 70 for a court-ordered judicial sale to be carried out by the
Sheriff pursuant to a commission for appraisement to ascertain the
value of the vessel, by the placement of advertisements and invitation
to submit bids for the purchase of the vessel.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">18    Once the Sheriff is commissioned to
appraise and sell the vessel, he is under a duty to first appraise
the vessel to ascertain the value. The Sheriff would be assisted
by professional and experienced appraisers who as court-appointed
appraisers have to act faithfully and impartially. The amount of
the appraised value is kept confidential so as not to affect the
price at which bids are received. Ordinarily, the Sheriff would
accept the highest bid price unless it is below the appraised value.
When the court is asked to exercise its discretion to approve a
judicial sale where the highest bid price is below the appraised
value, the Sheriff hands over the confidential appraisement report of
the court-appointed appraiser in a sealed envelope for the court’s consideration.
At no point in time would the amount of the appraisal be revealed
to the public. In doing so, the integrity of the judicial sale process
is preserved.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       With
regard to the importance of placing advertisements, I further held
at [20] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">20    The
placing of advertisements not only publicise the sale to a wider audience
interested in bidding for the vessel to obtain the best possible
bid price, but they also serve to notify the sale to all others
interested in the vessel so that they can come forward and establish
their maritime claims. These interested parties include other claimants
that may not have issued <em>in rem</em> writs
or filed caveats against release but have an interest in the vessel
and sale.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     In <em>The Turtle Bay</em>, I concluded that a direct
sale may be allowed in special circumstances. The applicant for
a direct sale must identify the existence of “powerful special features”
or ‘special circumstances” before the court will be prepared to
order a direct sale to a named buyer at a pre-determined price (<em>The </em><em>Turtle Bay</em> at
[29]). Needless to say, such an application for a direct sale will
be scrutinised carefully.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Arguments advanced for a direct
sale <em>pendente lite</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     I
begin with the Bank’s arguments for a direct sale of the Vessel <em>pendente lite</em> to a named buyer at a specified
price. As stated, the purpose of the direct sale <em>pendente
lite</em> was for the Vessel under new ownership to carry the
cargo to China.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The
application was premised on several factors that were advanced by
the Bank, the Intervener, and the Charterers. First, there was a
named buyer of the Vessel, Okeanos Shipping Inc. (“Okeanos”), a
company incorporated in the Marshall Islands, whose offer price
of US$17.5m was US$1.5m more that the value of the Vessel, which
the Bank claimed to be US$16m. In addition, Okeanos, a subsidiary
company of a customer of the Bank, was willing to purchase the Vessel
and carry the cargo to China for delivery to the Intervener. In
that connection, the Intervener and the Charterers had entered into
an undated agreement with Okeanos. When queried on when that agreement
was concluded, Mr Murali informed the court that Swissmarine had
signed the undated agreement on 20 December 2013. It was also pointed
out that Okeanos was prepared to sign on the existing crew members
under new ownership for the voyage to China.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Other
factors strenuously emphasised by Mr Yap acting for the Intervener
were that the cargo was worth US$40m and that it was slowly but
surely losing commercial value with each day of delay. Mr Yap also relied
on a report of Mr Eric Mullen, the Regional Director of Dr J Burgoyne
&amp; Partners (International) Ltd, a practice of consultant scientists and
engineers specialising in forensic investigations of fires, explosions, engineering
failures and other incidents, to show that the cargo on board had
started to deteriorate.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> It
was also pointed out by the Intervener and the Charterers that a
direct judicial sale to the named buyer was the best option for
a variety of reasons. First, the cargo could not be landed in Singapore
as there were no storage facilities available for such a huge quantity
of cargo, even on a temporary basis. Second, whilst it was not impossible
to tranship the cargo, there had been difficulties finding a suitable
transhipment vessel in December 2013, resulting in the inability
to meet the schedule given by the terminal (presumably Jurong Port)
for the transhipment vessel and the Vessel to berth alongside for
transhipment.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> Further
delays occasioned by transhipping the cargo would adversely affect the
condition of the cargo and, hence, its value. Third, the costs of transhipment
were estimated to be US$700,000.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> Finally,
the costs of discharge, estimated to be in the region of S$2.28m<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>, would
be high and this expenditure would eat into the sale proceeds of
the Vessel, thereby reducing the pool of sale proceeds available
to potential <em>in rem</em> creditors.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> In
summary, it was submitted that all these factors collectively constituted special
circumstances warranting a sale <em>pendente lite</em> of
the Vessel to the named buyer at the stated price of US$17.5m.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Mr
Winston Kwek (“Mr Kwek”) acting for the Bank relied on the Canadian
case of <em>Bank of Scotland v “Nel” (The)</em> (1997)
140 FTR 271 (“<em>The Nel</em>”) in support
of its application for a direct sale. Mr Yap and Mr Murali also
relied on <em>The Nel</em> and <em>The Union Gold</em> (see [7] above). These
cases were discussed in my earlier decision of <em>The
Turtle Bay</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Discussion on the alleged special
circumstances</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Value of the Vessel and the
pre-determined price</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     In
this application, the Bank submitted that Okeanos had offered to buy
the Vessel at US$17.5m which was US$1.5m above her market value
of US$16m. The Bank produced the valuation certificate of a Greek shipbroker
known as Golden Destiny. Relying on Golden Destiny’s valuation certificate,
Mr Kwek, Mr Yap, Mr Murali and Ms Tan collectively emphasised that
the direct sale to Okeanos would be above the valuation of US$16m.
On the other hand, Assistant Registrar Ms Jacqueline Lee (“AR Lee”)
acting on behalf of the Sheriff contended that Golden Destiny’s valuation
certificate addressed to the Bank was so qualified that it had little or
no evidential value.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     I
agree with AR Lee that the valuation certificate issued by Golden Destiny
was unsatisfactory and that the absence of a satisfactory valuation undermined
the Bank’s application. Significantly, Golden Destiny expressly stated
in its valuation certificate that the value of US$16m was specifically for
10 December 2013 and that it was not expressing an opinion on the Vessel’s
value for any other date. It is helpful to set out the relevant
parts of Golden Destiny’s valuation certificate:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Having examined the particulars given and
on the assumption that the vessel is without any latent defects
or any class recommendations, we would estimate the market value
of [the Vessel], basis prompt charter free delivery, between willing
Buyers and willing Sellers, for cash payment on normal sale terms
to be: <b>About U.S.$16,000,000 (Sixteen Million
United States Dollars).</b></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>The figure mentioned
above [US$16m] relates solely to our opinion of the market value
as at </em>
<b><em>10<sup>th</sup> December
2013 </em></b>
<em>and should not be taken to
apply at any other date. Further, we can give no assurance that
such value will be maintained at any subsequent date or is realizable
in actual transactions.</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We should make clear that we have not made
a physical inspection of the Vessel, nor we have inspected the Vessel’s
classification records, but we have assumed for the purposes of
this Valuation, that the Vessel is in good and seaworthy condition
with her class fully maintained free of recommendations, with reasonably
good survey status and that she conforms in all respects with the
requirements of her Registry.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We believe that the above valuation is
reasonably accurate, but all statements made above are statements
of opinion and are not to be taken as representations of fact. Any
person who is contemplating entering a transaction, or other legal
process relative to this Vessel or her value, should satisfy himself,
by inspection of the Vessel or any other appropriate means, as to
the correctness of the statements and assumptions which the valuation contains.
Any variation from the above factors could substantially affect
the value.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This Valuation has been provided in good
faith solely for the private use of the person who commissioned
it, and is not for publication and/or circulation. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original in bold; emphasis
added in italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Mr
Yap in his written submissions also mentioned that the court had an
independent valuation of the Vessel. This submission is misguided. Throughout
the proceedings, the parties had relied on US$16m as the value of
the Vessel. This figure came from Mr Kwek’s affidavit and was purportedly
supported by Golden Destiny’s certification. There was no other
independent valuation disclosed to the court. Mr Kwek had applied for
an order to appraise the Vessel but this was soon after the court
had indicated on 6 January 2014 that it was going to adjourn SUM
6520. As far as this court was concerned, the appointment of Insight
Marine Services Pte Ltd (“Insight”) was made in connection with
prayer 3 of SUM 6520 and was being sought early in the event the
Bank’s application for a direct sale was not allowed, and the sale
was to be made by public auction or private treaty pursuant to O
70 of the Rules of Court. It is well known to maritime law practitioners
that the Sheriff only consults the appraiser’s valuation after all sealed
bids have been received following an order to advertise and sell
the vessel. Until then, the appraiser’s valuation, which is received
by the Sheriff in a sealed envelope, would not be opened. As was
the case here, Insight’s valuation which the Sheriff received was
in a sealed envelope was unopened. As I previously held in <em>The </em><em>Turtle Bay</em> at
[18], the amount of the appraisal would not be revealed to the public
in order to preserve the integrity of the judicial sale process.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The
evidential gap arising from Golden Destiny’s valuation certificate as
stated in [16] above effectively undermined the Bank’s application
for a sale <em>pendente lite</em>. Evidence
of the expenses of maintaining a vessel under arrest and the value
of the vessel must be present before the court. In the absence of
such evidence, the court cannot decide if the vessel under arrest is
or is likely to be a wasting asset if it is not sold before judgment
is obtained against the shipowner. Mr Kwek identified ongoing expenses
such as the crew wages of the 21 Filipino crew at US$13,673.75 per
week, port charges and guard charges incurred for the period of
30 October 2013 to 20 December 2013 amounting to S$144,070.60 and
S$25,680 respectively, and the usual port charges of S$4,477.87
and security guard charges of S$513.60 which are being incurred
daily. However, the evidence before the court remains incomplete
without a proper valuation of the Vessel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In
addition, I agree with AR Lee that there was nothing in writing from
Okeanos stating its willingness or readiness to purchase the Vessel
at US$17.5m and on the Sheriff’s terms and conditions. The affidavit
in support of the direct sale which was deposed by Mr Kwek stated
that Okeanos would “apply to purchase the Vessel” directly from
the Sheriff.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> In another
paragraph, Mr Kwek deposed that Okeanos had offered to purchase
the Vessel at a price of US$17.5m.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> There
was no indication at all as to whom the offer was made, which is
an important consideration seeing that SUM 6520 was the Bank’s application
for an order that Okeanos buys the Vessel in a direct judicial sale
from the Sheriff at US$17.5m. Evidentially speaking, the purported
buyer’s offer itself and the terms of the offer were uncertain.
It was not clear whether there was a buyer ready and willing to commit
to a purchase of the Vessel on the usual Sheriff’s terms and conditions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     I
also note that the inspiration to find a buyer prepared to carry
the cargo to China started from a conversation Mr Kwek had with
the representative of Swissmarine’s P&amp;I Club. Okeanos is the
subsidiary of a customer of the Bank. There was no evidence and
it was not the Bank’s case that it had casted the net wider in search
of more interested parties to attract the best price for the Vessel
(see [8]–[9]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Nel</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The
Bank, the Intervener and the Charterers relied on <em>The
Nel</em> to persuade the court to depart from the normal course
of commissioning the Sheriff to appraise and sell the vessel because
of the existence of “powerful special features” or “special circumstances”
(see <em>The Turtle Bay</em> at [29]). In <em>The </em><em>Nel</em>,
the arrested vessel had a cargo of sulphur on board that was shipped
from Vancouver on a voyage to Tunisa. The mortgagee had US$12m secured
on the vessel. The cost of off-loading the sulphur on board at Vancouver
was estimated to be US$1.3m. As an alternative, the mortgagee sought
to privately sell the vessel for US$5m to a buyer who was willing
to carry the cargo to its destination. The mortgagee obtained valuations
of US$4m and US$3.75m for the vessel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     What
was extraordinary in <em>The Nel</em> was
the cargo of sulphur. When sulphur comes into contact with moisture,
a chemical reaction is triggered resulting in the potentially devastating
(and dangerous) effect of corroding the steel of a vessel. On the
facts, the court found that there was a real likelihood of the vessel
being corroded (<em>The Nel</em> at [10]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">10    …
In addition to the sulphur being aboard the vessel for some six weeks
here at Vancouver with, as I have said, warmer than usual temperatures,
she still had to complete her voyage. A usual voyage from Vancouver
to Tunisia, not taking into account delays at the Panama Canal and
delays in discharge at Tunisia, would take about 26 days assuming
a speed of 15 knots. Taking into account that most of the voyage
from Vancouver, through the Panama Canal and to Tunisia would take
place in sub-tropical and tropical climates, the concern of a corrosive
reaction, between steel plate and wet sulphur, was a real and valid
concern. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The
court in <em>The Nel</em> observed that should
there be corrosion the vessel’s seaworthiness would be affected,
thus making it difficult to sell at a good price (at [15]). In that
case, there was evidence that the vessel “could well, within weeks
and certainly within months, become unsaleable except as scrap or
at a minimal speculative price” (<em>The Nel</em> at
[16]). The consequence of that was the likelihood of a smaller pool
of sale proceeds available for distribution to <em>in
rem</em> creditors. In light of the very special circumstances,
the court granted the sale <em>pendente lite</em> to
a buyer who was prepared to carry the cargo to its destination.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The
other point in <em>The Nel</em> related to
the high costs of discharging the cargo. This same feature was raised
by the Intervener and the Charterers. Mr Yap submitted that the
cost of discharging the cargo in this case would be substantial,
thereby reducing the sale proceeds available to <em>in
rem</em> creditors. Mr Kwek relied on <em>The
Nel</em> at [21] which stated as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… To deny a sale at this point would result
in substantial expenses to remove cargo and/or the certainty, in
the future, of a substantially lower sale price of a ship suspect
of sulphur corrosion damage. <em>In either event</em> the
proceeds available to <em>in rem</em> creditors
would be smaller. This result is contrary to the objective of any
court ordered sale, that of obtaining the best fair price for the ship
in order to protect creditors. Thus the approval of the private
sale of the “<em>Nel</em>” by way of an order
and a commission for sale. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     It
appears that in granting the application, Prothonotary Hargrave
J in <em>The Nel</em> considered the costs
of discharging the cargo from the arrested vessel as part of the
Sheriff’s expenses to be paid out of the proceeds of the sale of
the vessel. I will go on to show that — in the present case at least
— this proposition appears to be inaccurate in that the costs of
discharging the cargo is not part of Sheriff’s expenses and as such
the high costs of discharge is not a relevant factor to allow a
direct sale.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Interestingly,
Prothonotary Hargrave J in a subsequent decision of <em>Royal
Bank of Scotland plc. v. Kimisis III </em><em>(The)</em> [1999]
F.C.J. No. 300 (“<em>Kimisis III</em>”),
held in <em>obiter dicta</em> that the Canadian
position as to whether such expenses should fall upon the cargo
interests or the Sheriff was actually still open to debate:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">13    While
the affidavit of Mr. Leo Murphy does perhaps raise a question as to
whether the Plaintiff is taking any undue advantage by indicating
to a potential purchaser of the Kimisis III that it was not possible
to arrange a sale of the vessel with cargo aboard and that it was
not interested in such a transaction, there may well be another
side to the proposal of Curzon Maritime Ltd. to purchase the Kimisis
III and carry Noga’s cargo to its destination. It would be best
for all concerned if that possibility were dealt with further, certainly
by the Plaintiff and perhaps also by Noga, if it is able to develop
further material given more time. <em>However,
I do not need to make a finding, at this point, as to whether the
cost of discharging cargo should fall upon the cargo owner, the
general rule under English law, or whether the cost of discharge
of cargo should be a Marshall’s expense in getting the ship ready for
sale, the American approach, or whether equitable considerations,
as suggested by Mr. Justice Cons in The Mingren Development, ought
to apply.</em> [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Since
then, the Federal Court of Canada in <em>Cameco
Corp. v. “MCP Altona” (The)</em> (2013) 225 A.C.W.S. (3d)
292 (“<em>MCP Altona</em>”) held that the costs
of discharge fall on the cargo owner and was not a Marshal’s expense. Sean
Harrington J reviewed a number of decisions including the English cases
(which adopt the position that such costs are to be borne by cargo interests),
American cases (which adopt the position that such costs are to be
paid out of the proceeds of sale), and the previous Federal Court
of Canada decision of <em>Kimisis III</em>,
before arriving at the following conclusion (at [44]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">44    I
am more persuaded by the English and Hong Kong authorities and hold
that the cost of discharging the cargo of uranium and cleaning the
ship, assuming the contract was frustrated due to a breach of contract
on the part of the carrier, forms part of Cameco’s cargo claim,
and is not to be equated with marshal’s expenses. This is not to
say that in this particular case the exercise of equitable discretion
might not give Cameco priority over the mortgage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     As
alluded to in <em>Kimisis III</em> and <em>MCP Altona</em>, English law places the burden
of such costs on the cargo interests for the following reasons observed
by Sheen J in <em>The Jogoo</em> [1981] 1
WLR 1376 (“<em>The Jogoo</em>”) at 1380:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">At the forefront of Mr. Mance’s submissions
on behalf of the mortgagees he invited me to consider the contractual
relationship between the cargo-owners and the ship-owners. The cargo
was carried in <em>Jogoo</em> under a contract
of carriage, one of the terms of which was that freight was pre-paid
at Mombasa. When freight is paid in advance the cargo-owners accept
the commercial risk that the voyage will not be completed for whatever
reason. If the contract is frustrated the cargo-owners bear the
loss because the Law Reform (Frustrated Contracts) Act 1943 does
not apply to contracts for the carriage of goods by sea: see section
2 (5)(<em>a</em>). The ship-owners repudiated
the contract of carriage by failing to pay their creditors or put
up security in order to obtain the release from arrest of their
vessel, with the result that the cargo-owners now have claims for
damages against them. The cargo-owners have a right to remove their
cargo from the ship, or they may abandon it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     For
similar reasons, the Supreme Court of Hong Kong adopted the English
position in <em>Dharamdas &amp; Co. (Nigeria) Ltd.
and another v. The Owners of the Ship or Vessel “Mingren Development” </em><em>and Panasia Realty &amp; Finance Ltd</em> [1979]
HKCU 19 (“<em>Mingren Development</em>”).
I find it useful to recite the following passage by Cons J:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It seems to me that the English position
derives from the old common law doctrine of frustration. American
courts have approached from a different direction. They appear to
look at it this way, that from the moment of its arrest a ship is
a common fund administered by the court for the common benefit of
all those interested in the fund and that any expenses incurred
in the administration of that fund should be borne by the fund itself
as an “expense of justice”. These may include wharf dues: <em>The Poznan</em> [1927] AMC 723 or the cost
of discharging cargo to make a vessel more easily disposed of by
sale: <em>The Emilia</em> [1963] AMC 1447.
However this approach has not been without its critics: <em>Gilmore and Black Admiralty Law</em>, 2nd edition,
p. 603. Obviously there is no perfect solution. Financial disaster,
like any other disaster at sea, is likely to cause suffering to
the innocent. The argument that the suffering should fall primarily
upon the mortgagee I find largely emotional. It is true that he
may sometimes have a free choice of when and where he arrest the
ship and may thus be able to lessen the impact on others. But so
sometimes do other claimants. And no one can, as a general rule,
be blamed for exercising his rights at such time as he thinks most
propitious to himself. If he takes undue advantage in any particular
circumstance the court may take that into account against him when
exercising its discretion. The present position is of long standing.
As I see it the position was confirmed in 1943 when contracts for
the carriage of goods by sea were deliberately excluded from the
operation of the Law Reform (Frustrated Contracts) Act. I am not
persuaded that the American approach is so much more just or that conditions
now are so different from those in 1943 that I should take it on myself
to make a general change.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In
the present case, the Vessel, and not its cargo, was under arrest. The
intervener who asserts rights over the cargo would have to off-load
the cargo at its expense, and not at the Sheriff’s expense. This
would be the position unless the equities of the case justify treating
the costs of discharge as Sheriff’s expenses (see <em>The
“Nagasaki Spirit”</em> [1994] 2 SLR(R) 165 at [30]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     It
bears mentioning that courts in <em>The Jogoo</em> and <em>Mingren Development</em> appeared to be largely
persuaded by their respective Law Reform (Frustrated Contracts)
Act which expressly excluded contracts for carriage of goods by
sea. I note parenthetically that the position in Singapore under
the Frustrated Contracts Act (Cap 115, 1985 Rev Ed) (“the Act”)
is no different, as s 3(5)(<em>a</em>) expressly
provides that the Act does not apply to “any charterparty, except
a time charterparty or a charterparty by way of demise, or to any
contract (other than a charterparty) for the carriage of goods by
sea”. However, since this point was not argued by any of the counsel,
and is likely to arise on another occasion, I will say no more in
this decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     For
now, the assertion that the costs of discharging the cargo would eat
into the eventual sale proceeds as argued by counsel is irrelevant
to the determination of whether to grant a direct sale <em>pendente lite</em> for the reasons stated above.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Other factors</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Mr
Yap also referred to the impossibility of landing the cargo in Singapore
and that transhipping the cargo would be slow and costly. The issues
of scheduling and timing of the transhipment vessel (assuming one was
available) and deterioration of the cargo were raised. He therefore contended
that the Bank’s application for direct judicial sale would be in
the best interests of everyone concerned.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In
many cases of arrest of cargo-laden vessels, the voyage is typically abandoned
when the owner of the arrested vessel does not or is unable financially
to put up security to lift the arrest. Cargo interests would have
to step forward to recover possession of the cargo from the owner
of the vessel. In this case, as stated above at [30], it is the
Vessel that was under arrest and not its cargo. The alleged “special
circumstances” are in reality a typical consequence of an arrest
of a cargo-laden vessel. Just as the costs of discharge of cargo
do not fall automatically under Sheriff’s expenses, transhipment
expenses for the same reasons stated above should not be treated
as Sheriff’s expenses to be paid out from the sale proceeds. In
the final analysis, such costs are, in principle, claims for breach
of the contract of carriage against the vessel owners and/or the
charterers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The
facts in <em>The </em><em>Union
Gold</em> are also different from the facts of the present
case. In <em>The Union Gold</em>, Teare J
sanctioned the direct sale of “an elderly vessel” built in 1984
which was “unlikely to attract many buyers” (at [24]). The vessel
in question was valued at only €315,000. The court there found it
compelling that the proposed buyer in that case offered to buy the vessel
because it was in a position whereby he was able to retain and operate a
long term contract which provides business for her (and other vessels).
If that contract was lost, the proposed buyer would not be willing
to buy the vessel. The court also took into consideration the fact
that the jobs of 21 crew members would be lost. In those unique
circumstances, the court came to the conclusion that the vessel
would probably fetch a higher price through a direct private sale
than it would through a public auction. In the present case, while
Okeanos has offered to employ the crew members of the Vessel, that
by itself does not constitute a “special circumstance”. Unlike <em>The Union Gold</em>, the present case by no
means concerns a very old vessel. The Vessel was built in 2001.
The Defendant’s forecast to the Bank in June 2013 stated that the
Vessel was capable of trading until December 2017. There was no
urgency to recoup whatever value remaining in the Vessel.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     For
the reasons stated, prayer 2 of the Bank’s application for the direct sale
of the Vessel <em>pendente lite</em> was
dismissed. Without satisfactory evidence as to her value, the Bank’s
assertion that the value of the security represented by the Vessel
would be progressively reduced by the costs of maintaining her under
arrest was not made out. I therefore did not grant prayer 2a for
a sale <em>pendente lite</em>.</p>
