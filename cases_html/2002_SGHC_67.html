</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font color="#800000"><strong><u>GROUNDS OF DECISION</u></strong></font></p>
<b xmlns=""><font size="4">
<p align="justify"></p></font>Background</b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">1. This is a claim for damages arising out of allegedly negligent work

done in respect of the engine of the plaintiffs’ vessel.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">2. In March 1995, the plaintiffs (‘the owners’), were the

owners of a marine tanker called <i>Nur Marina</i> (‘the vessel’). They arranged

for the vessel to be dry-docked at the premises of Pan United Shipyard in Singapore in

order that it could undergo the special maintenance survey required by its classification

society, the American Bureau of Shipping (‘ABS’), every five years. As part of

the survey, the ABS surveyor had to inspect certain engine parts and for this purpose, the

owners employed the defendants (‘the repairers’) who were carrying on business

in partnership as ship repairers, to open up the main engine, take out and overhaul

certain parts and thereafter reinstate these parts and close the engine.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3. Initially the scope of work undertaken by the repairers was as

follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(1) to disconnect and remove the six cylinder heads and to service

  them;</p>
<p align="justify">(2) to dismantle, take out and service two pistons and two journal

  bearings and prepare them for inspection by the ABS surveyor;</p>
<p align="justify">(3) to open up two piston crowns for survey and to decarbonise the

  pistons, the rings and ring grooves;</p>
<p align="justify">(4) to dismantle two main bearings for survey;</p>
<p align="justify">(5) to clean the main engine lubricating oil sump; </p>
<p align="justify">(6) to reassemble all the abovementioned items and reinstate them to

  their original positions in good order. </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">In the course of the works, the original scope insofar as it involved

the main engine was expanded to include the servicing of main bearing units nos. 2 and 6

for the surveyor’s inspection, the withdrawal of piston nos. 2, 3, 4 and 5 for the

surveyor’s inspection and the overhaul of fuel injectors and fuel pumps.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4. The vessel entered the dry-dock at the beginning of March. In the

course of the works, the lubricating oil in the main engine was pumped out and placed in

oil drums on the vessel’s deck. It was originally intended to entirely replace the

lubricating oil once the works were completed. The new stock of oil did not arrive by the

time the vessel was ready for its mooring and sea trials and the owners were anxious to

complete these so that the vessel could be loaded with a cargo bound for Haiphong. The

decision was therefore made to reuse the old lubricating oil and this was re-pumped into

the engine. The mooring trials and sea trials took place successfully on 17 March 1995. No

engine problems were experienced.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5. The vessel then proceeded for loading. She commenced her voyage to

Haiphong on 20 March 1995 at about 0600 hours. At about 0100 hours the next day, the main

engine broke down. The initial inspection by the chief engineer found that the no. 3

piston and crankpin had sustained severe damage. The vessel then deviated to Kuantan for

emergency repairs. She arrived in Kuantan on 22 March at 1940 hours. After the repairs

were carried out, the vessel left for Haiphong at about 1024 hours on 25 March. One and a

half-hours later, the engine was stopped again due to the presence of loud knocking

noises. Investigation showed that the nos. 2, 5 and 6 crankpin bearings were excessively

worn and the no. 6 piston and piston liner showed signs of seizure. Emergency repairs were

effected and the vessel returned to Kuantan again.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6. Subsequently, representatives from the engine manufacturers,

Wartsila Diesel (Singapore) Pte Ltd (‘Wartsila’) went to Kuantan to investigate.

They concluded that the main engine could not be used and many parts required replacement.

The vessel was then towed to Singapore for permanent repair. These repairs were carried

out by Wartsila. The owners are now claiming from the repairers the costs they incurred

for these repairs, for towage fees and for extra crew payments that they had to make.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

The dispute</p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7. The owners’ case is that the repairers were negligent in

carrying out the contracted overhaul work and repairs to the main engine of the vessel

and/or failed to carry out the overhaul and repairs properly, with due diligence, care and

such standards as may have been reasonably expected of a professional ship repairer. They

asserted that the damage to the main engine had been caused by the improper fitting of the

connecting bolts or bearings during the works carried out by the repairers.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8. The repairers contended that they had carried out their works

properly and that the loss or damage, if any, sustained by the owners was wholly due to

the conduct or default of the owners or their agents or employees. They asserted that the

main engine of the vessel had not been maintained in a good and operational condition.

Prior to commencement of the works, the vessel had overheating problems. When the works

commenced, it was found that the lubricating oil was watery and dark in colour and

contained debris. The piston crowns of unit nos. 1 and 6 were found to be badly choked

with accumulated hardened surfaces which prevented or made it difficult for the

lubricating oil to reach the cooling system; the white metal bearing and crankpins were

scratched and the exteriors of the piston crowns had grooves.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9. The repairers asserted that they had recommended to the owners’

representative, one Mr Chan Kok Onn (‘KO Chan’), that the other four piston

crowns should also be opened for servicing but no instruction to do so was given to them.

Further, they and the classification surveyor had advised KO Chan to change the

lubricating oil but this had not been done. Instead, the vessel had reused the old oil for

its mooring and sea trials and had not changed it before the vessel left Singapore

en-route to Haiphong. As the evidence developed, it became apparent that the reuse of the

old lubricating oil was the main plank of the repairers’ theory of how the damage had

arisen.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

The evidence : (1) General</p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10. The vessel <i>Nur Marina</i> was from 1990 until 1995 classed with

ABS. As WH Chan, a surveyor with ABS since 1981 confirmed, the primary purpose of ABS is

to determine the structural and mechanical fitness of ships and other marine structures

for their intended purposes. It does this through a procedure known as classification. An

owner seeking the classification of a ship in accordance with the rules of ABS must submit

the ship for periodic inspection by ABS surveyors to verify that the ship is constructed,

operated and maintained in accordance with those rules.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">11. Annual surveys of the vessel were carried out in accordance with

the Classification Rules of ABS in 1991, 1992, 1993 and 1994 and the vessel maintained her

ABS classification. A special survey was due in March 1995 for the purpose of, among other

things, checking on the main engine and its major components and ascertaining whether

these would be in proper running order for the next five years.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">12. The main engine was a stork Werkspoor diesel engine manufactured by

Wartsila. It had sustained major damage in 1992 due to a sudden change in propeller

direction. In July 1992, Wartsila had carried out repairs to the main engine and one of

the issues that arose was whether a change of lubricating oil had been effected at that

time. Mr Khoo Chin Yew who was the fleet manager of Maritime Consortium Management Sdn Bhd

(‘MCM’) took the position that there had been a change of lubricating oil. The

basis of his assertion was that the repairs that Wartsila had carried out had involved

replacement of part of the lubricating system and thus the oil must necessarily have been

changed as well. Mr Khoo inferred the change of oil from the invoices he produced showing

what work Wartsila had done. He conceded, upon cross-examination, that he had no invoice

directly showing the supply of oil to the vessel in July 1992.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">13. The owners were not able to produce the vessel’s engine

logbooks to substantiate their assertion of the change of oil as the vessel had been sold

and the logbooks were missing. The only records that were produced in court were extracts

from the logbooks for the period between January 1994 and March 1995 made by Richards Hogg

International (Asia) Pte Ltd when they investigated the engine breakdown of March 1995.

These extracts did not disclose any change of oil during the period from January 1994 up

to 21 March 1995. According to Mr Khoo, however, no problems were experienced with the

main engine between the repairs in 1992 and the survey in March 1995.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">14. In February 1995, Mr Khoo was looking for a ship repair firm to

open up the main engine for the purpose of the special survey. He asked KO Chan, then

MCM’s technical manager, to find such a firm. Subsequently Mr Khoo was introduced by

KO Chan to Mr Chan Fook Choon (‘FC Chan’), the managing partner of the

repairers’ firm. After discussions between Mr Khoo and FC Chan, the repairers gave a

quotation for the work and this was subsequently accepted after an amendment to it was

made on 2 March 1995.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">15. The vessel arrived at the Pan United Shipyard and was dry-docked

some time in early March 1995. Mr Khoo deputed KO Chan to attend at the shipyard on behalf

of the owners to facilitate the survey and liase with the repairers, the shipyard and the

surveyor from ABS. WH Chan attended at the shipyard and on board the vessel as the ABS

surveyor in charge of the special survey. The work was done by the repairers’ workmen

in the presence of the chief engineer of the vessel.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">16. The work commenced on 4 March 1995. The vessel moved out of

dry-dock on 10 March 1995 and left the shipyard altogether on 17 March 1995. Between 10

March and 17 March, work continued on the vessel whilst it was moored alongside the wharf.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">17. In the course of the works, the lubricating oil was pumped out of

the main engine and stored in drums on the deck of the vessel. The oil was not checked at

the time it was pumped out and no sample was taken from it for analysis. At some stage

during the works, it was decided to replace the lubricating oil. The repairers’

position was that this decision was made at the very beginning and that is why the oil was

put in the drums without being subjected to testing. Mr Khoo, however, testified that the

decision to change the oil was made somewhat later and for convenience since the vessel

was undergoing repair. He said that there was no pressing need to change the oil in March

1995 as the vessel had only put in 3119 running hours since the last oil change and the

engine maker’s specifications required a change of oil only after 12,000 hours. It

should be noted here that the engine maker also recommended that the oil be analysed every

1000 hours in order to ascertain its condition and suitability for use. Whilst in

cross-examination Mr Khoo maintained that there was a practice of regularly analysing

lubricating oil on vessels managed by MCM, he did not have any records to show the results

of such analysis for the oil on board the <i>Nur Marina</i>. Also it was common ground

that the lubricating oil on board the vessel at the time of its dry-docking was not

analysed prior to it being re-pumped into the main engine.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">18. The question of whether the lubricating oil had needed to be

changed drew some attention. The ABS surveyor testified that he had no comment on whether

the lubricating oil needed to be changed. He did not check its condition since there was

nothing in the rules that required him to make any recommendation as to the oil. He did

notice that during the inspection the oil had been removed from the sump and that the sump

was clean. He did not have any expectation that, simply because the sump had been cleaned,

the oil would be changed. He agreed that it was not good marine practice to use

‘old’ oil but clarified that by this he meant using oil for beyond the length of

time recommended by the manufacturer. ABS did not have any rule requiring owners to change

the oil every time the engine was opened and it was up to the owners to keep track of how

long the oil had been used for in any particular case.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">19. As stated above, there was no direct evidence of when the previous

change of oil had taken place. Michael Thompson, who was the surveyor appointed to

investigate the cause of the damage to the main engine by the vessel’s insurers,

stated in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief that the main engine’s running hours

from October 1992 up to the time when the vessel was dry-docked in March 1995 amounted to

3119 hours whilst 18 running hours lapsed between the time the vessel left the dry-dock to

the time the main engine broke down. When he was asked about this in cross-examination, he

explained that he had got the figure of 3119 hours during discussions with the

owner’s representative and the chief engineer. He had either been told the figure or

had been shown a record book. He confirmed that he had looked at the current logbook of

the vessel and that it was standard practice for the chief engineer to update the running

hours periodically. Thus the latest logbook would always show the vessel’s current

running hours.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">20. Mr Thompson confirmed that he had no doubts about the running hours

given to him and there was no reason to suspect that the figure was incorrect. It was

pointed out to him that while in the notes he had made at the time of survey he had jotted

down that the total running hours of the engine were ‘3119 from 10/92’ he had

also noted that the oil had been renewed at the last overhaul. It was put to Mr Thompson

that by this he meant that the oil had been changed in March 1995. Mr Thompson denied

this. He asserted that he had been told that there was no oil change in March 1995 and

that it had been his mistake to use the words ‘last overhaul’. What he had

actually meant was that the oil had been renewed during the previous overhaul that took

place in 1992.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">21. FC Chan gave evidence to the effect that during the course of the

works he had recommended to the chief engineer and to KO Chan that they should change the

lubricating oil. This was because the oil appeared to him to be dirty and possibly

overused. He was also concerned that water and sediment could have corrupted the oil as

the oil separator was not working and appeared to have been out of order for some time.

During cross-examination, FC Chan asserted that he was able to tell what the condition of

the lubricating oil was simply by looking at it. In this case, the oil was very dark and

had contained a lot of debris. On further questioning, however, he agreed that the actual

condition of the oil and whether it was suitable for further use could only be ascertained

by analysis. Mr Chan also testified that when he learnt that the owners were going to

reuse the old oil, he had protested to KO Chan and told the latter that he was taking a

big risk in reusing the old oil. This protest had not, however, been put in writing.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">22. KO Chan, who gave evidence for the repairers, corroborated, in his

affidavit of evidence-in-chief, the repairers’ assertion that it was FC Chan who had

recommended that the lubricating oil be changed as the oil separator had been out of

order. He had accordingly, requested MCM to supply new lubricating oil. Pending the supply

of the new oil, the mooring and sea trials were deferred for about a day or two. The new

oil did not arrive, however, and the trials were eventually carried out without a change

of lubricating oil. In court KO Chan said that it had been the intention to throw away the

oil from the beginning and that since it was to be discarded, he had not paid much

attention to the condition of the drums into which it had been pumped. He also did not

check the condition of the oil because he knew it was to be disposed of. When I asked why

he had wanted to dispose of the oil, the reply was that they were going to clean the sump

tank and wanted to put fresh oil back into the clean sump.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">23. In cross-examination, it was put to KO Chan that he had not made

any arrangements to dispose of the oil. He disagreed and said that he had made such

arrangements. These consisted of arranging for the empty drums to be supplied and for the

old oil to be pumped into the drums. It was then put to him that he did not write to the

shipyard to tell it that he would be giving it 20 drums of oil to dispose of. KO

Chan’s only reply to this was that he could not remember whether he had done so or

not. In re-examination, he said that the oil was not filtered before it was pumped back

into the sump. He was also asked in re-examination whether he was concerned when the

decision to reuse the old oil was made. His reply was that he was a bit concerned because

it was used oil but he did not know the exact condition of the oil. He did not ask for

tests to be carried on the oil because during that period, the top management was pushing

the ship to go on charter. He was not extremely worried about the oil situation. When I

asked him why not, he then said that he was worried but the decision came from the top

management to get the vessel moving and the new oil did not come so he had no choice about

the matter. When asked whether he had made the decision that it was safe for the voyage to

Haiphong to proceed without a change of oil, his reply was that that the top management

had made decision and he had not discussed safety concerns with the top management. No

analysis of the safety situation had been made. When it was put to him that in that case

he could not have been that worried, his reply was ‘No, I was a bit worried, not

extremely worried.’</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">24. It should also be noted that whilst KO Chan had made an affidavit

for the repairers on 6 December 2001, he had also made and signed a statement at the

request of the owners’ lawyers some seven days later. In 18 of this statement, he

said that ordinarily lubricating oil would be renewed when a vessel is dry-docked to take

advantage of the facilities available at the repair yard. Likewise, in this case, he had

ordered fresh lubricating oil but the same did not arrive before 20 March 1995. He then

decided that it was absolutely safe for the vessel to carry out her voyage to Haiphong

without a change of oil and to change the oil when she returned to Singapore. He based his

decision on the following:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(1) the engine maker’s recommendation that the oil be changed

  after 12,000 hours and the fact that, as at 20 March 1995, the engine had only run for

  3119 hours; and</p>
<p align="justify">(2) the lubricating oil did not appear to be dirty. If it was dirty it

  would have damaged the bearings and the surveyor from ABS would have requested him to

  change them. The ABS surveyor after inspection here had found the bearings to be in

  satisfactory condition and suitable for reuse.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Thus, in 18 KO Chan made three statements that were at variance with

his testimony in court, to wit:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(a) that he had been the person who had decided that it was absolutely

  safe for the vessel to proceed on her voyage without an oil change;</p>
<p align="justify">(b) that as at 30 March 1995, the engine had run for only 3119 hours;

  and</p>
<p align="justify">(c) that the lubricating oil did not appear to be dirty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">25. When KO Chan testified he was asked whether the matters in 18 of

his statement were true. He replied that he could not confirm the truth of the contents of

that paragraph. He was asked why he had signed the statement without correcting the

inaccuracies and he replied that he was under pressure from the lawyers who had kept

asking him to make another affidavit. Subsequently Mr Chan said ‘I signed it because

I assumed it was only a statement and not to be brought forward to the court. I thought it

was only for their own investigation’.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">26. There was also conflicting evidence on the issue of the oil

separator. FC Chan said that this was not working. He also stated that during the trials

he observed the purifier was not functioning and that the lubricating oil had been

bypassed through a filter and an oil cooler and then sent back to the main engine sump

tank. He had not brought up this matter of the non-functioning of the oil separator to the

ABS surveyor, KO Chan or the chief engineer because the oil separator was not part of the

repairers’ scope of work. FC Chan’s position on the oil separator was echoed by

KO Chan in the latter’s affidavit. The statement he made had, however, contained

nothing about the oil separator. In court he repeated that the oil separator was not

functioning during the mooring trials. In cross-examination, however, he admitted that he

did not personally check the oil separator. He had said that it was not working because as

far as he knew when the vessel went into the yard, the component was not functioning. KO

Chan agreed that since the vessel was in dry-dock there was an opportunity to repair the

oil separator and asserted that attempts to carry out these repairs had not been

successful due to the non availability of spare parts. He was then asked how he could be

sure that the separator was not repaired while the vessel was in the yard and his reply

was that he could not be sure of this. KO Chan could not remember whether he had checked

up on this point with the chief engineer.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">27. The other witness who gave evidence on the condition of the oil

separator was WH Chan, the class surveyor. His testimony was that it was working

throughout the period that he was on board the vessel. Mr Chan pointed to an item in his

survey report entitled ‘Lube Oil Purifier(s)’ and the fact that he had marked a

cross alongside this item thus indicating that he had examined it as part of his survey.

He testified that some of the components had had to be examined in an open state and the

oil separator was one such component. His examination of the opened up separator had

revealed there was nothing abnormal about it. Mr Chan testified that in all cases where a

component had to be examined in an opened up state, it had to undergo a function test

after re-assembly as well. The oil separator had been tested after re-assembly and it had

run.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">28. In the course of the works, the crowns of pistons nos. 1 and 6 were

removed and dismantled for survey. According to FC Chan, on dismantling, the crowns were

found to be heavily layered with carbon which the workers had some difficulty in removing.

He also asserted that the condition of the piston crowns was drawn to the attention of the

chief engineer but the repairers were not asked to dismantle or examine the other four

piston crowns. Under cross-examination FC Chan agreed that he had not put his observation

about the condition of the two crowns in writing. He maintained, however, that he had

recommended a dismantling of the other four crowns but that this recommendation had not

been accepted.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">29. All witnesses agreed that the mooring and sea trials had passed

without incident. The position taken by FC Chan with which the class surveyor agreed was

that if the repairers had made a mistake in the tightening of the bolts securing the

cylinder heads, the main bearings and the connecting rod (sometimes also referred to as

the ‘con-rod’) assembly, the problem would have become noticeable during the

trials. He asserted that it was improbable that the engine could have undergone the

mooring and sea trials successfully if any part of the engine had not been properly

re-assembled.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">30. The ABS survey was completed by 20 March 1995. The vessel retained

its classification status. The finding of the surveyor was that the main engine and its

parts were in satisfactory condition. Although certain recommendations were made regarding

matters of maintenance which the owners were advised to attend to, these did not impinge

on the satisfactory condition of the main engine.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

(ii) The breakdown and the damage</p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">31. The chief engineer filed a breakdown report on 7 April 1995 in

which he detailed what had happened during the vessel’s voyage. Mr Thompson also

included an account of the breakdowns in his original survey report dated 3 May 1995. From

these accounts, it appears that the following was what happened.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">32. At about 0110 hours on 21 March 1995, the crew heard heavy knocking

sounds coming from the engine room. The chief engineer immediately stopped the main engine

from the wheelhouse and proceeded to the engine room to stop the engine. He found that the

push rods of the no. 3 piston were bent. He then dismantled the cylinder head of no. 3

piston and found that the liner has scratched. The piston crown was found to have detached

from its skirt and the crankpin bearing was damaged. The crew then blanked off the no. 3

piston. They restarted the engine at 2015 hours on the same day and run at an idling speed

with five cylinders for about one hour. They found the engine to be in satisfactory

condition and departed for the Kuantan outside port anchorage at 2315 hours.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">33. The vessel arrived at the anchorage outside Kuantan at 1940 hours

on 22 March. A spare piston assembly was delivered on board and refitted into the no. 3

cylinder. The piston rings were set and the con rod bearings and push rods, taffet and

fuel racks were readjusted. The main engine was tested at idling speed for one hour. All

appeared to be normal and the vessel then departed for Haiphong again at 1024 hours on 25

March 1995.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">34. At 1155 hours the same day, a loud noise was heard in the main

engine crankpin and a subsequent inspection revealed that the no. 2, 5 and 6 crankpin

bearings were damaged. The crew replaced the nos. 2 and 5 crankpin bearings, removed the

no. 6 piston and connecting rod that were also damaged and blanked off the no. 6 cylinder.

They then started the main engine with the other five pistons and returned to Kuantan

anchorage.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">35. The main engine was inspected by Wartsila and also by Mr Thompson.

He found the following damage to have occurred:</p>

(iii) Technical evidence<i></i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(i) The plaintiffs’ expert</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">36 There were two expert witnesses, one called by each side. The

owners’ expert witness was Mr Michael Thompson. He has been employed as a surveyor by

The Salvage Association since 1989. Previously he had worked as a chief engineer, engineer

superintendent and fleet manager. In regard to this incident, The Salvage Association was

appointed by the hull underwriters of the vessel to investigate the cause of the damage to

its main engine in March 1995. Mr Thompson was assigned the job.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">37. According to Mr Thompson’s affidavit, he first went on board

the vessel on 8 April 1995 after it arrived in Singapore. He inspected the vessel’s

main engine to ascertain the extent of the damage and reviewed the vessel’s documents

including the logbooks and the statement made by the chief engineer. He also interviewed

the chief engineer and KO Chan.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">38. Wartsila had been instructed by the owners to carry out repairs to

the main engine and they were attending to the engine while Mr Thompson was on board. They

were stripping down the main engine and he therefore inspected it. He found that the main

engine was a 6-cylinder Stork Werkspoor diesel type 6SW280 engine. After Wartsila opened

up the engine, various parts of it were transported to their workshop. Mr Thompson was

able to take photographs of various damaged parts.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">39. In his affidavit Mr Thompson dealt with the following allegations

which the repairers had made:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(1) prior to commencement of works, KO Chan informed the repairers that

  the vessel was having overheating problems and could not achieve normal speed;</p>
<p align="justify">(2) the existing lubricating oil was reused and that oil was watery and

  dark in colour and contained debris;</p>
<p align="justify">(3) the piston crowns were badly choked with accumulated hardened

  substances;</p>
<p align="justify">(4) white metal bearing and crankpins were found scratched; and</p>
<p align="justify">(5) the exterior of the piston crowns had grooves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">40. On the alleged overheating problem, Mr Thompson commented that it

might have been due to high exhaust temperature. The owners had instructed the repairers

to overhaul all fuel pumps, fuel injectors and cylinder head valves. Defects in any of

these could give rise to high exhaust temperature. The maintenance repairs and overhaul

carried out by the repairers would have rectified the alleged overheating problem. In any

event, such problems were not related to the damage suffered by the main engine. In Mr

Thompson’s opinion, the overheating problem would not and did not cause or contribute

to the main engine damage.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">41. Secondly, Mr Thompson considered that the allegation that the

lubricating oil used was in poor condition was without merit. This was because all the

crankpin bearings and the four main bearings that were removed for survey and inspection

by the class surveyor were reused. If the lubricating oil had been in such a poor

condition as the repairers alleged, the aforesaid bearings would have been damaged and the

ABS surveyor would not have allowed them to be reused and would have recommended that they

be renewed.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">42. Further, after the main engine suffered damage, the main bearings

were examined and found to be in satisfactory condition with no appreciable wear. If the

lubricating oil was in poor condition or if there was insufficient lubrication, the main

bearings would be the first engine part to fail or suffer severe damage or wear. In the

present case, however, none of the bearings showed that it had suffered excessive wear or

severe damage.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">43. Mr Thompson then dealt with the allegation that the repairers had

recommended that the piston crowns of units 2, 3, 4 and 5 be opened for servicing but that

no instructions were given to them to do so. He stated that Wartsila had overhauled all

the pistons in 1992 and in his view it was highly unlikely that hardened deposits would

have built up in the pistons after they had run for only 3119 hours. The recommended

running hours between one overhaul of the pistons and the next is between 6,000 hours and

12,000 hours. The ABS surveyor had surveyed the pistons here. He had seen the piston

crowns of units no. 1 and 6. As there was no recommendation by him to disassemble nos. 2,

3, 4 and 5 pistons for further examination, Mr Thompson deduced that nos. 1 and 6 had been

in satisfactory condition and were not badly choked with hardened substances.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">44. Following the damage suffered by the main engine Wartsila’s

representatives and Mr Thompson examined the damaged no. 3 piston. He found no evidence of

the piston crown being badly choked with accumulated hardened substances. Mr Thompson also

noted that the no. 6 piston that had been serviced by the repairers had sustained severe

damage whereas pistons nos. 2, 4 and 5 which were not serviced by the repairers did not

sustain any damage at all. Had the pistons’ oil space been badly choked with

accumulated carbon causing overheating as alleged, all the cylinder liners would have

sustained excessive wear. During the overhaul in March 1995, however, the cylinder liners

were all found to be in good condition.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">45. As regards the allegation that the white metal bearings and

crankpins were scratched, Mr Thompson repeated that the bearings and crankpins had been

surveyed by the ABS surveyor and had then been reused. That reuse confirmed that these

parts were in satisfactory condition.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">46. Regarding the allegation that the exterior of the piston crown had

grooves, Mr Thompson believed that this was a reference to scratches found on the piston

crown. He noted that it is not unusual for piston crowns to have scratches as these are

bound to occur on surfaces which come into contact and rub into each other. The fact that

all the pistons were surveyed by the class surveyor and were reused confirmed that the

pistons were in satisfactory condition.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">47. Mr Thompson’s conclusion after having considered all the

various possible causes of damage to the main engine, was that the damage was caused by

and attributable to the improper fitting/positioning of the crankpin bearings by the

repairers. He explained that for fitting the crankpin bearings, there is a guide hole at

the bottom of the bearing shell where the locating pin on the bearing cap fits. If the

bearing shell is not properly positioned during installation of the bearing cap, the

locating pin will cut into the bearing and would cause deformation of the bearing shell.

Excessive wear of the bearing shells followed by knocking or hammering would result. The

bearing shells could turn or twist within the housing, shutting out oil supply to the

piston and thereby cause a seizure in the liner. His inspection of the bearing shell

showed that the locating hole was deformed indicating that the bearing shell had been

improperly positioned. It should be noted that Mr Pereira agreed that this evidence was

technically correct although of course he did not agree that this is what had happened in

this case.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">48. Mr Thompson considered that his conclusion that the damage

sustained by the main engine was caused by the improper fitting of the bearing shells by

the repairers during the overhaul was supported by the fact that four out of the six

crankpin bearings sustained damage within a short period after the overhaul.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

(ii) The defendants’ expert</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">49. The repairers called Mr Ronald Mervin Pereira as their expert

witness. Mr Pereira is a qualified marine engineer and is presently a consultant and a

director of RIS Technical Services (S) Pte Ltd. He obtained a first class engineering

certificate of competency in July 1967 and after sailing as a third engineer and as a

second engineer for five years, became a marine surveyor and consultant. He has had 34

years experience in this field.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">50. Mr Pereira was appointed in November 2001 by the repairers’

solicitors to review all pertinent documents and information including affidavits of

evidence-in-chief and pleadings relating to the breakdown of the main engine of the vessel

in March 1995. On the basis of all this information he prepared and submitted a report on

19 December 2001 giving his opinion on the cause of the main engine breakdown.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">51. Mr Pereira first recited the details of the work carried out by the

repairers and noted that upon re-assembly of the main engine, it had undergone successful

mooring and sea trials before returning to operation. In his opinion the works were

carried out specifically to comply with the classification society’s requirements and

although all cylinder heads were overhauled together with the fuel pumps and injectors,

the scope of the work was insufficient to result in significant improvement of the

performance of the main engine.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">52. Mr Pereira considered that although the vessel was class maintained

at the commencement of the voyage to Haiphong she was unseaworthy in view of the fact that

the main engine sump had been refilled with unserviceable lubricating oil. In his opinion,

the act of reusing the previously used lubricating oil, which had been removed from the

main engine sump for the purpose of cleaning it, initiated the sequence of accelerated

wear of the crankshaft bearings during the sea trials (after re-assembly of the engine),

which culminated in the seizure of no. 3 piston in its cylinder liner on 21 March 1995

while the vessel was on loaded voyage to Haiphong.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">53. In Mr Pereira’s opinion, the seizure of no. 3 piston was

caused by overheating, brought about by inadequate piston cooling which probably arose

from the blockage of the lubricating oil piping/passages providing lubricating oil cooling

to the piston; the blockage being primarily caused by foreign particles and sludge present

in the unserviceable lubricating oil clogging the small diameter piping/passages through

which the lubricating oil flows to the crankshaft journals, crankpins and pistons whilst

the main engine is in operation.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">54. Mr Pereira considered that the main engine breakdown on 25 March

1995 was an extension of the breakdown on 21 March. In his view, the damage to nos. 2, 3,

4, 5 and 6 crankpin bearings already existed on 21 March but their eventual breakdown was

pre-empted by the seizure of no. 3 piston on that day. The crankpin bearing damage was

probably caused by inadequate lubrication to the crankpin bearings as a result of partial

blockage of the lubricating oil passages in the crankshaft by foreign particles and sludge

present in the lubricating oil.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">55. The failure to fully overhaul nos. 2, 3, 4 and 5 pistons after they

had been removed from the main engine also, in Mr Pereira’s view, contributed to the

seizure of no. 3 piston in its cylinder liner on 21 March. This was because the overhaul

of nos. 1 and 6 pistons had showed that the piston crown were heavily internally layered

with carbon and this condition probably also existed in the no. 3 piston crown.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">56. It was Mr Pereira’s considered opinion that the main

breakdowns of the vessel’s main engine on 21 and 25 March 1995 were primarily caused

by the negligence of the chief engineer and the technical superintendent for the following

reasons:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(1) electing to reuse the unserviceable lubricating oil which had been

  pumped out of the main engine sump. As the oil purifier on board the vessel had not been

  operated for some time, the lubricating oil in the main engine sump was obviously in poor

  condition (containing a high degree of insolubles and water) and should have undergone

  reconditioning and analysis (to establish serviceability) before it was poured back into

  the cleaned engine sump. The fact that the repairers were requested to clean the sump

  indicates that the oil was in dirty and unserviceable condition and it was therefore

  necessary to fill new lubricating oil into the sump before putting the main engine back

  into operation; and</p>
<p align="justify">(2) electing not to fully overhaul nos. 2, 3, 4 and 5 pistons although

  they had been removed from the main engine. The full overhaul of nos. 1 and 6 pistons

  showed that they were internally layered with carbon. This should have indicated that the

  internal condition of the other four pistons was similar and that their full overhaul was

  necessary. By allowing the re-assembly of the main engine without such overhaul, the chief

  engineer and technical superintendent acted negligently and contrary to correct

  engineering practice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">57. Mr Pereira also commented on the owners’ assertion that

incorrect tightening of the main bearing bolts caused the damage. In his view, the

incorrect tightening of the main bearing bolts and big-end bearing bolts would have

resulted in damage of a different nature ie loosening of the securing nuts and detachment

of the bearing caps which could have caused catastrophic impact damage to the crankshaft,

bedplate and entablature, as a result of the detachment of the connecting rod from the

crankpin or dislodgement of the main bearing cap with consequent crankshaft misalignment.

The Wartsila engineers did find the crankpin bearings badly scoured and the corresponding

connecting rod housing and crankpin overheated. This finding, in Mr Pereira’s view,

supported his opinion that operating the main engine using unserviceable lubricating oil

had primarily caused the two main engine breakdowns.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

Findings</p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">58. Before I go on to discuss the experts’ opinions, I should make

findings on the other matters in dispute. First, the condition of the oil separator. It

was FC Chan’s position that this had not been working in early March 1995. He stated

that he had not brought up the matter to the repairers or the ABS surveyor since the oil

separator was not part of the repairers’ scope of work. This excuse seems to me to be

a feeble one for not mentioning that something was out of order especially since it could

have been repaired at the time and FC Chan could have given a quotation for the work and

obtained instructions to carry it out. As a ship repairer it was not in his interest to

fail to point out malfunctioning parts to the owner. I find his evidence on this point to

be unsatisfactory.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">59. I am aware that KO Chan also stated in his affidavit that the oil

separator was not working. This assertion was not contained in his statement and its

strength was also undermined during cross-examination when he admitted that he had not

personally checked the component and also that he could not be sure whether the component

had been repaired during the time the vessel was at the shipyard.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">60. On the other hand, WH Chan, the ABS surveyor, asserted quite firmly

that the oil separator had worked both when it was tested on its own and when it was

operating as part of the engine during the trials. He had checked this component for the

purpose of his survey and had no doubts about its functioning. I accept this evidence in

preference to that given by the repairers as WH Chan was there as an independent assessor

of the situation. He was there to ascertain whether the vessel met the class requirements

and he had no interest in the outcome of the survey one way or another. His evidence on

the point was not subject to any of the doubts that undermined the testimony of WH Chan

and KO Chan. I therefore find that the oil separator was functioning when the vessel left

the shipyard.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">61. The next issue is as to the condition of the lubricating oil. There

was no direct evidence on this point since no analysis of the oil was performed. However,

there was evidence from Mr Thompson and Mr Khoo that the vessel had run for only 3119

hours since its last oil change and therefore the existing lubricating oil should have

been in good enough condition for continued use. Mr Thompson went to investigate the

situation. He interviewed the chief engineer and saw the logbooks and he was quite clear

that the figure that he was given was correct and that there was no reason to doubt that

figure. I accept his evidence on this point. I note that FC Chan testified that the oil

was dirty. He, however, did not make any written protest about the reuse of the oil at the

time. KO Chan’s evidence on the point was of dubious reliability since he had almost

simultaneously given a contradictory account to the owners’ lawyers.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">62. I therefore find that there is no evidence that the lubricating oil

that was pumped out of the vessel in early March 1995 was unserviceable at the time that

it was put back into the vessel. Further, accepting that only 3119 hours had elapsed since

the last oil change, this lubricating oil should have been in good enough condition for

further use since there were more than 8,000 hours to elapse before it would have to be

changed in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendation. On this point KO

Chan’s evidence was also instructive. He had said in his statement that he thought it

safe for the vessel to sail. Whilst he averred in court that the oil was dirty upon being

pressed he confirmed he had not been extremely worried about the oil, only a bit worried.

On consideration of his evidence on this point, it appears to me that the correct version

was, probably, that at the time he did consider it safe for the oil to be re-used.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">63. Mr Thompson’s evidence was that if the lubricating oil had

been in poor condition, the main bearings would have been the first engine part to be

affected. In this case, the class surveyor examined the main bearings for the purpose of

the special survey and found them to be in order. Thus, the lubricating oil must have been

in reasonable condition. It is also noteworthy that the special survey took place only

once in every five years and therefore if components examined by the class surveyor passed

the survey, it would mean that their condition was good enough to last a further five

years. This in fact was admitted by Mr Pereira in cross-examination.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">64. The other preliminary issue relates to the condition of the two

piston crowns that were dismantled by the repairers. FC Chan stated that he had found

these to be heavily layered with carbon and that he had drawn the chief engineer’s

attention to the situation and suggested to the latter that the other piston crowns be

cleaned as well. Again, his complaint was a verbal one only. One would have thought that

he would have wanted the extra business and that when his suggestion to the chief engineer

was ignored, he would have made it in writing direct to Mr Khoo in Malaysia. After all on

the contractual matters and the scope of work, he knew that instructions came from Mr

Khoo. It appears to me that the situation that the repairers found on dismantling the two

piston crowns was not as serious as Mr Chan later made it out to be.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">65. Turning to the cause of the damage to the main engine, the

repairers relied on the opinion of Mr Pereira. His evidence was based on his analysis of

the facts as gained from documents and affidavits. Unfortunately, he had not been engaged

at the time of the incident and therefore had not had the opportunity of examining the

engine or any of the damaged components. Also, he had not had an opportunity of speaking

to the class surveyor before giving his opinion. His opinion on what could have caused the

main engine damage is set out in 56. To summarise, the use of unserviceable oil caused

the lubricating oil passages to be blocked by foreign particles and therefore the main

engine was starved of lubricating oil and overheated. Secondly, the failure to fully

overhaul the other four pistons meant that they continued to be heavily layered with

carbon and this contributed to the seizure of the no. 3 cylinder.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">66. Mr Pereira’s hypothesis is that overheating of the piston,

which caused it to seize, was caused by lubricating oil starvation. This in turn arose

from the blockage of the lubricating passage. The cause of the blockage was the presence

of dirt in the lubricating oil. Mr Pereira posited that the lubricating oil was dirty on

two grounds:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(a) because the owners had decided to clean the main engine sump (in

  fact when I asked him that he had deduced that the lubricating oil was dirty simply

  because the decision was taken to clean the sump, he agreed that that was so); and</p>
<p align="justify">(b) the lubricating oil separator had not been working for some time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">As far as ground (a) is concerned, during cross-examination Mr Pereira

conceded that the cleaning of the main engine lubricating oil sump was because the ABS

surveyor required it to be cleaned for the purpose of the survey. Thus, it would appear

that whether or not the sump was dirty, was irrelevant to the decision to clean it. As far

as ground (b) was concerned, as I stated, Mr Pereira did not have the benefit of WH

Chan’s evidence that the oil separator was working when the vessel left the shipyard.

Thus, neither ground (a) nor ground (b) provided Mr Pereira with a solid basis for his

hypothesis.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">67. There are other grounds on which it is difficult to accept the

hypothesis that the lubricating oil was extremely dirty and therefore unserviceable. As I

pointed out above, the ABS surveyor found the crankshaft bearings and the main bearings to

be in satisfactory condition. Mr Pereira agreed that there was no excessive wear of these

items at the time of the damage. He was then asked to agree that that showed the

lubricating oil could not have been dirty up to the time of survey. His answer was that

that was not necessarily so as the bearings may have been passed because they were within

tolerance. He then admitted, however, that passing the special survey meant that the items

had been certified to be fit for the next five years. That being the case it appears

improbable to me that the bearings were at the limit of acceptability. They must have been

in fairly good condition to be passed as useable for a further five years.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">68. Mr Pereira had also admitted that the dirt in oil by itself would

not have caused the kind of damage that the main engine sustained. He agreed that for the

various parts to be damaged the way they were, the oil supply had to be cut off. However

dirty the oil could get it would not cause this damage because as long as the oil could

flow through the system it would perform its cooling function. His theory about the

causation of the damage was based on blockage of the system so that no oil got through to

cool the main components.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">69. There was, however, a difficulty with the theory that the system

was blocked. Mr Pereira’s evidence was that the lubricating oil would have passed

through two filters. These filters had pores that were 30 microns or three hundredth of a

millimetre in size. He also testified that the size of the oil passage in the crankshaft

is between five to ten millimetres in diameter. Thus, it would appear that only very tiny

particles could pass through the filters and enter the passage. Mr Pereira asserted,

however, that such particles could consolidate into sludge and then block the passage. Mr

Thompson’s evidence was that the bigger particles would not be able to enter the oil

passages because the filter would trap them before they entered the engine. Even if very

tiny particles went through the filters a build up of sludge would be unlikely because of

the high pressure, high velocity flow and temperature of 60C. He asserted that there are

a number of forces that prevent sludge build up in the passage and, if at all, sludge

would build up in the sump. Mr Pereira agreed under cross-examination that the oil flowing

through the filters would be running at a high temperature and under great pressure though

he disagreed that that would entirely prevent build up of sludge. It appears to me that in

these circumstances and considering the minuteness of the particles that would be able to

pass through the filter, even if a build up of sludge could take place as asserted by Mr

Pereira, that build up would be a slow process and would not lead to blocking of the

passage within a period as short as the 18 hours that elapsed between the vessel leaving

Singapore and the no. 3 piston seizing in the South China Sea. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">70. Further, Mr Pereira gave evidence that the blockage was between the

main bearing and the no. 3 crankpin bearing. Even if Mr Pereira was correct in his

assumption, the blockage between the main bearing and the no. 3 crankpin bearing could not

have caused damage to the other crankpins ie nos. 2, 4 and 5. The blockage theory does

not, therefore, explain all the damage sustained.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">71. The other reason why Mr Pereira considered the owners negligent was

that they had not ensured that all the pistons were fully overhauled. However, as I have

stated, the evidence of CF Chan that pistons no. 1 and 6 were internally layered with

carbon was not satisfactory. In addition, Mr Thompson’s evidence is that he had

examined the damaged no. 3 piston and found no evidence of the piston crown being badly

choked with accumulated hardened carbon. That evidence does not support Mr Pereira’s

theory that all the other pistons must have been affected in the same way as no. 1 and no.

6. It should also be noted that even though the no. 6 piston was fully overhauled, it

still seized. Mr Pereira agreed that that was so but asserted that separate factors had

caused the seizure. If that was the case, then overhauling pistons no. 2, 4 and 5 would

not necessarily have prevented them from seizing either.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">72. Overall, I am not able to accept the theory put forward by the

repairers as to the cause of the damage. As I have stated earlier, Mr Pereira’s

opinion depended on the presence of certain facts. Once the facts he relied on were shown

to be incorrect, the strength of his opinion was greatly diminished. There were also other

difficulties in the repairers’ version of events.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">73. The other theory put forward on the causation of the damage was

that espoused by Mr Thompson. I have set out his evidence in more detail above. I found

his evidence to be coherent and consistent. He considered that the seizure of the no. 3

and no. 6 pistons and the damage to the no. 2, 4 and 5 crankpin bearings were caused by

the improper fitting of the crankpin bearings by the repairers. Mr Pereira agreed that

such improper fitting could have caused damage of this nature but did not think that this

had happened in this case because after the main engine was assembled, sea trials had

taken place successfully. His view was that improper fitting would have manifested itself

during the sea trials.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">74. Mr Thompson was cross-examined on his belief that the damage was

caused by the improper fitting despite the fact that there were no signs of improper

fitting during either the mooring or sea trials. He explained that during the mooring and

sea trials, the damage to the bearing metal had already been initiated and that the

bearings had started to wear down. As, however, the bearings were lined with a thin layer

of white bearing metal which was relatively soft, this layer was the first layer to be

worn down and the wear was not appreciable enough to cause obvious manifestations of

damage ie knocking sounds and, subsequently, piston seizure. With the continuous running

of the engine as the voyage continued, more wear of the bearing shell metals took place.

The next layer to be eroded was the copper layer but the damage may still not have

manifested itself because the gap (or clearance) would be small since the layers are thin.

As the crankpin bearing metals became excessively worn down, a larger space (more

clearance) was created which caused the ‘knocking’ because of the motion of the

piston and total bearing failure occurred. Mr Thompson asserted that the damage would only

manifested itself after total failure of the bearings. I find this to be a coherent and

credible explanation of why no damage was noted during the sea trials.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">75. When Wartsila examined the main engine and its components after the

incident, they found the main bearings to be damaged: three of them were badly scored and

the other three were lightly scored. On this basis, the repairers submitted that the

damage was due to insufficient lubrication. Mr Thompson had agreed that if the lubricating

oil was in poor condition or if there was insufficient lubricating oil, the main bearings

would be the first engine part to fail or would suffer severe damage or wear. He was

therefore cross-examined by counsel for the repairers in an attempt to show that the main

bearing damage had occurred before the other damage sustained by the engine.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">76. Mr Thompson asserted that the damage to the main bearings had

arisen as a consequence of the other damage. He had noted in his note book at the time

that when he inspected the no. 4 and no. 6 main bearings, he had found them to have

sustained damage that was a lot less severe than the crankpin damage. He took photographs

of the bearings and these photographs showed that the soft bearing metal was still in

existence. This was an indication that the bearings had not been subjected to as severe

damage as the crankpin bearings had because in the latter case, the bearing metal had

sustained excessive wear. The metal debris from the crankpin bearings had entered the oil

and circulated with it and this is what had caused damage to the other components like the

main bearings. Mr Thompson was convinced that the debris had entered the oil only after

the crankpin bearing metals had been worn because the bearings had been inspected during

the overhaul, the liners and the piston had been calibrated and the components had not

shown any appreciable physical wear at that time. He also said that visually, it was

obvious that the particles embedded in the crankshaft bearings had come from the crankpin

bearings or from the other excessively worn parts of the engine. He had done this visual

inspection and was very sure where the metal debris had come from. Mr Thompson’s

great advantage over Mr Pereira in this case was that he had seen the main engine and its

components in their damaged state and had had access to all equipment parts and personnel

necessary for the purposes of his investigation.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">77. Having considered all the evidence, I accept Mr Thompson’s

testimony and opinion that the cause of the damage was the improper fitting of the

connecting rod bolts or bearings by the repairers during the overhaul of the engine in mid

March 1995.</p>

Conclusion</p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">78. As a result, there must be judgment for the plaintiffs against the

defendants as regards liability and costs. As to quantum of damages, I would like further

submissions on this issue. I will see parties in chambers on the same.<font size="4"></font></p>
