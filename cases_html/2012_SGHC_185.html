        Choo Han Teck J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The appellant (husband) was the defendant in
                    this divorce suit brought by the respondent (wife) against him. They married on
                    27 January 1988. The respondent is 49 years old and the appellant is 48
                    years old. The marriage broke down in 2007 and the respondent filed the divorce
                    suit on 28 October 2008. Interim judgment was granted on 7 October
                    2009. They have three children. The eldest is a son (Kent) aged 22; the second a
                    daughter (Serene) aged 20; and the youngest, a son (Daniel) aged 17
                    years.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The respondent was a housewife until the divorce
                    when she began working as a customer service assistant earning $848 a month. The
                    appellant was ordered to pay a monthly maintenance of $5,000 a month as interim
                    maintenance. There were two main assets, namely, the matrimonial flat which was
                    a flat at Sin Ming Walk known as Gardens@Bishan, and an HDB flat at Teck Whye
                    Lane.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The ancillary orders made by District Judge Wong
                    Keen Onn (“the District Judge”) were as follows. First, the
                    parties were given joint custody of the two minor children with care and control
                    to the respondent and reasonable access to the appellant. Secondly, the
                    appellant is to pay a monthly maintenance in the sum of $1,400 to the
                    respondent. The appellant is to maintain the two minor children in the sum of
                    $3,200 jointly each month. The appellant is also to pay half the overseas school
                    fees and related expenses for Serene until she completes her course. The
                    appellant was also ordered to pay arrears in maintenance amounting to $26,155.
                    Thirdly, the appellant was to transfer his rights, title and interest in the
                    matrimonial flat at Gardens@Bishan to the respondent. The respondent was to
                    transfer her rights, title and interest in the Teck Whye Lane to the appellant
                    but the appellant was to refund the respondent’s Central Provident Fund
                    (“CPF”) money used for the purchase of this flat. Further, the
                    appellant was to pay the respondent the sum of $232,400 from the remaining
                    matrimonial assets. The District Judge ordered this sum to be transferred from
                    the appellant’s CPF account to the respondent’s CPF account with any
                    shortfall to be paid in cash. Fourthly, costs of $5,000 was ordered against the
                    appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The appellant was dissatisfied with the above
                    orders and appealed before me. The appellant was unrepresented in this appeal
                    although he was represented by solicitors before the District Judge. The
                    District Judge set out the arguments from both sides and the grounds in his
                    written judgment dated 16 March 2012. Each item disputed was dealt with in
                    sequence and his decision on each was fully explained. Perusing his judgment, I
                    find myself in full agreement with the learned District Judge on each of his
                    findings and his overall approach. However, there was an inexplicable difference
                    in paragraphs 27 and 29 of his judgment. At paragraph 27, the District
                    Judge noted that the appellant claimed $60,000 for his pilot training course but
                    at paragraph 29 he noted that the respondent conceded that $91,000 was used for
                    the pilot training course. I do not think that this was material as the District
                    Judge ultimately erred in favour of the appellant on this point.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       In regard to the issue of custody, care and
                    control of the two minor children, the District Judge noted the change in
                    position by the appellant who had initially accepted that it would be in the
                    children’s interest to continue living with their mother, the respondent.
                    He changed his mind and prayed for care and control so as to spend more time
                    with them. There seems no doubt that the respondent was the parent who brought
                    up the children when the appellant was at work. The District Judge took his
                    interview with Daniel into account and was satisfied that it would be best to
                    grant care and control to the respondent. The two minor children are well
                    educated and nearing adulthood. They could but did not seek a contrary order by
                    indicating so in an affidavit. I agree with the learned District Judge that
                    there was no need to interview them further. The orders relating to custody,
                    care and further control are therefore not to be disturbed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       In respect of the earnings and contributions
                    made by the parties, there is little evidence indicating that the District Judge
                    was so wrong as to merit an intervention by this court. I am of the view that
                    the decision to award the respondent 45% from the matrimonial assets to be just
                    and fair even though the direct financial contributions made by her were very
                    low. In a marriage that lasted twenty years (1988 to 2008) and involved bringing
                    up three children, and where there was a 5% to 15% direct financial
                    contribution, a 45% to 50% apportionment is fair and reasonable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       I find that the District Judge’s finding,
                    that the total matrimonial assets consisted of $1,808,435.45 inclusive of the
                    two flats, was reasonably accurate. Where, as in this case, some other assets
                    such as investments in unit trusts and bank accounts as well as alleged payment
                    and withdrawal of money from real or phantom accounts are alleged by both sides,
                    the trial judge was duty bound to act only where he is satisfied that the claims
                    appear reasonable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The court ordered an interim maintenance order
                    of $5,000 a month. That order was upheld on appeal. However, at the final
                    hearing, the learned District Judge found the expenses of the two minor children
                    to be $1,935.33 for Daniel and $1,614 for Serene (totalling $3,549, against the
                    claims of $3,479 by the respondent and $1,285 by the appellant). The court thus
                    revised the maintenance to the children to $3,200 (being 90% of $3,549). I am of
                    the view that this assessment was fair. Although the appellant was ordered to
                    pay a much higher percentage than the respondent, the District Judge had taken
                    into account the fact that the appellant earns eight times more than the
                    respondent. I do not accept the appellant’s claim that he is earning less
                    than that. No convincing evidence was adduced before me on this issue. With
                    regard to the respondent’s maintenance, the District Judge found that her
                    expenses were about $2,400.20 a month. This did not include her share of
                    maintaining the children ($349). Her net salary was $1,000. The maintenance
                    order of $1,400 might be high to place the respondent at the expenses level
                    claimed but given the income of the appellant (more than $8,500 a month) the
                    amount ordered was not unreasonable and should remain.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       I come to the appellant’s conduct of the
                    appeal. The appellant loaded a massive stack of documents with a lengthy
                    submission that did not address the factual issues. Instead, his
                    “submission” referred to what seemed clearly old and irrelevant
                    evidence. For instance, pages of photographs of the respondent and a person
                    alleged to be her lover were produced. The photographs were clearly taken more
                    than ten years ago. Some of them show the children at 5 to 7 years old.
                    Photographs and descriptions of the appellant’s past work and projects for
                    the future were also attached with no relevant or logical persuasion. These were
                    all of no relevance to the decision or the ancillary matters. I will merely say,
                    without amplification, that the appellant seems to me to have abused his
                    position as a litigant in-person in vexing the process with tedious polemic and
                    many rude and unjustified references to the learned District Judge. I accept
                    that perhaps he had been, and still is, emotionally affected by the divorce, but
                    that is something for him to work on with professional counsellors. For my part,
                    I am of the view that there is no merit in the appeal and it is therefore
                    dismissed. Given the circumstances, I order costs of this appeal to be paid to
                    the respondent and to be taxed if not agreed.</p>
