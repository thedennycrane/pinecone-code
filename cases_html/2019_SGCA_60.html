The respondents applied to strike out the appellant’s claim on the grounds that continued prosecution of the claim would be an abuse of process because (i) the respondents had made a settlement offer which would give the appellant all the reliefs it sought in the claim and (ii) the proceedings had been commenced for a collateral purpose. At the hearing of the respondents’ application to strike out, the High Court Judge (“the Judge”), instead of proceeding under O 18 r 19 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“ROC”), directed that pursuant to O 14 r 12 and/or O 33 r 2, a preliminary point or issue be decided first. That preliminary point mirrored the issue in the striking out application: <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, whether the appellant was entitled to continue with the action in the light of the settlement offer. The Judge answered the issue in the negative and struck out the appellant’s claim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 There were two key issues in the appeal. The first was whether the respondents were estopped from applying to strike out the appellant’s claim for being an abuse of process by an earlier decision of an assistant registrar (“the AR”) declining to strike out the appellant’s claim on those same grounds (“the <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> issue”). The second was whether the Judge was correct in holding that the appellant’s continued prosecution of its claim in the light of the respondents’ offer to settle was an abuse of process (“the abuse of process issue”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 On 21 August 2019, we heard the matter and dismissed the appeal. We now give the reasons for our decision.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The appellant, TMT Asia Limited (“TMTA”), is a shipping company. The respondents, BHP Billiton Marketing AG (Singapore Branch) and BHP Billiton Marketing Asia Pte Ltd (collectively, “BHPM”), are part of the BHP Billiton Group (“BHPB”), one of the world’s leading producers of iron ore.

</div></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Decision of the High Court </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 As noted at [2] above, there were two main issues before the Judge: (i) whether the AR’s decision gave rise to an issue estoppel precluding litigation of the abuse of process issue; and (ii) if not, whether TMTA’s continuance of its claim was an abuse of the court’s process in light of BHPM’s Offer.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 On the <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> issue, the Judge held that the AR’s decision did not give rise to any issue estoppel. He noted that four cumulative elements must be satisfied before an issue estoppel arises (<span class="font-italic">Lee Tat Development Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Management Corporation of Strata Title Plan No 301</span> [2005] 3 SLR(R) 157 (“<span class="font-italic">Lee Tat</span>”) (at [14]–[15])): (a) there must be a final and conclusive judgment on the merits; (b) the judgment must be of a court of competent jurisdiction; (c) there must be identity between the parties; and (d) there must be identity of subject matter. The Judge found limbs (b)–(d) met but not limb (a). He considered that the AR’s decision was not final and conclusive, at least not in relation to the preliminary point before him because the AR’s decision was in respect of an application to strike out under O 18 r 19 of the ROC whereas the preliminary issue before him was to be determined under O 14 r 12 and/or O 33 r 2, which have a different threshold from O 18 r 19. The AR did not decide that there was no abuse of process but rather that the point was arguable and hence did not merit a striking out. Therefore, the AR’s decision was not final and conclusive on the abuse of process issue which remained open for the Judge to determine pursuant to O 14 r 12 and/or O 33 r 2 of the ROC (GD at [31]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 The Judge also noted that there were new developments in the legislative scheme of the SFA since the AR’s decision. In particular, the provisions of the SFA which were engaged in Suit 580 have been amended substantially so that the significance of the action as a test case for the interpretation of those previous provisions was diminished. The Judge observed that the interpretation of those previous provisions remained relevant to causes of action that arose before the amendments came into operation as the amendments would not have retrospective effect (GD at [26] and [29]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 On the abuse of process issue, the Judge held that the continuance of TMTA’s claim would be an abuse of the court’s process because it would serve no useful purpose in the light of the Offer, under which TMTA would receive all the reliefs it was seeking in its claim, applying the decision of the English Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Balk v </span><span class="font-italic">Otkritie International Investment Management Ltd and others</span> [2017] EWCA Civ 134 (“<span class="font-italic">Balk</span>”). In <span class="font-italic">Balk</span>, the claimant had obtained an order against Balk for the payment of about US$37m in damages. In separate proceedings, Balk claimed that certain deductions should be made from the sum awarded to the claimant to account for recoveries which the claimant had already made. Balk was unsuccessful at first instance but obtained leave to appeal. By the time the appeal was heard, the claimant had made an open offer to give Balk credit for the sums that the appeal was concerned with. Balk did not respond substantively to the offer. The English Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal in light of the offer. Balk should have accepted the offer as the claimant was ready to concede all it had asked for and more. In those circumstances, a hearing on the merits would have been an exercise in futility and would have run counter to all the modern principles of case management which include encouraging the settlement of disputes and making the best use of scarce judicial resources. The court therefore found that Balk was abusing the process of the court by her refusal to engage with the claimant’s open offer and insisting on proceeding with the appeal (GD at [46]–[49]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 In the present appeal, the relevant terms of the Offer were as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">5. … our clients are prepared to make an open offer to your client (without any admission of liability whatsoever) on the following terms:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) subject to paragraph 5(b) below, our clients shall make a payment to your client of an amount equivalent to all the damages, compensation, interest and costs which your client is seeking to recover in Suit 580, comprising:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> (i) the sum of US$81,500;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(ii) interest on the sum of US$81,500 to be fixed at 5.33% from the date of the writ to the date of your client’s acceptance of this offer; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> (iii) costs of Suit 580 to be taxed or agreed;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) the payment referred to in paragraph 5(a) above shall be made by way of set-off against the judgment sum owed by your client to BHP Billiton Marketing AG under the English Judgment;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) your client shall file and serve a notice of discontinuance of Suit 580 within 7 business days of the date of acceptance;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) the set-off shall be effected in full and final settlement of all claims between the parties in Suit 580 and strictly without any admission of liability; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(e) such settlement shall be subject to contract between the parties.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">6. … Please note that this offer is open for acceptance in writing until 4:00pm, 1 February 2016, failing which it will be deemed to have been withdrawn.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 In essence, BHPM offered to pay TMTA (without any admission of liability) the entire sum of US$81,500 plus interest and costs by way of a set-off against sums owed by TMTA to the first respondent under the English judgment for about US$115m registered in Singapore.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 The Judge rejected all five of TMTA’s reasons for refusing to accept the Offer (GD at [50]–[65]). On appeal, the reasons were reduced to three. TMTA’s reasons and the Judge’s decision on each are set out below:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the Judge rejected TMTA’s contention that it was entitled to a finding on the liability of BHPM (since the Offer was made without admission of liability). A finding of liability was not the relief sought by TMTA. It was the basis on which TMTA was seeking relief in the sum of US$81,500 (GD at [51]–[54]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, the Judge rejected TMTA’s contention that the Offer had, on its own terms, expired on 1 February 2016; BHPM had in subsequent affidavits stated that the offer remained open for acceptance and it was clear that TMTA did not intend to accept it (GD at [55]–[57]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, the Judge rejected TMTA’s contention that it would have been unreasonable to have expected TMTA to accept an Offer that remained subject to contract. The Judge was of the view that this was a mere excuse as KW could have asked R&amp;T to remove the requirement for a formal contract if indeed TMTA was genuine about accepting the offer (GD at [58]–[60]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 The upshot of all this is that there was no practical benefit of proceeding to trial, since TMTA would have received all the reliefs it sought by simply accepting the Offer. If the claim proceeded to trial, more time and costs would be incurred and there was a public interest that the court’s resources should not be used for a claim that had become academic in view of the Offer (GD at [67]). The Judge therefore determined that continuation of TMTA’s claim would be an abuse of process and struck out the claim accordingly.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The parties’ cases  </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Appellant’s case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 TMTA’s case on appeal was that (a) the AR’s decision that there was no abuse of process warranting a striking out was <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> and, in any case, (b) it was not an abuse of process for TMTA to continue with its claim without accepting the Offer.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 On the <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> issue, TMTA submitted that the AR’s decision was final and conclusive on the issue of whether there had been an abuse of process warranting a striking out (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, limb (a) of <span class="font-italic">Lee Tat</span>). There was no real distinction between the threshold for striking out under O 18 r 19 (considered by the AR) and under O 14 r 12 and/or  O 33 r 2 read with O 33 r 5 of the ROC (considered by the Judge).

The issue before the AR was whether it was so plain and obvious that TMTA’s claim was an abuse of process that it warranted a striking out, whereas the Judge was concerned simply with whether TMTA’s claim was an abuse of process.

It was the second striking out application (filed after the Offer was made) which TMTA relied on for issue estoppel as this application was dismissed by the AR and BHPM did not appeal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 As mentioned, the Judge’s approach was to direct that the abuse of process issue be framed as a preliminary point for determination pursuant to O 14 r 12 and/or O 33 r 2 of the ROC. The Judge then held that continuance of TMTA’s claim would be an abuse of process and struck out the claim. The Judge considered that the AR’s decision did not preclude his determination of the abuse of process issue (now framed as a preliminary point) because the thresholds for determination under O 18 r 19 and O 14 r 12 and/or O 33 r 2 were different. He was of the view that the AR only decided, pursuant to O 18 r 19, that this was not a plain and obvious case of abuse of process which warranted a striking out, not that there was no abuse of process.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 We respectfully disagree. The question before the AR and the preliminary point before the Judge entailed essentially the same inquiry, which was whether continuance of TMTA’s action would be an abuse of the court’s process. In our view, there is no difference in the threshold applicable for a finding of abuse of process under O 18 r 19 and a preliminary determination of that same issue made pursuant to O 14 r 12 and/or O 33 r 2 of the ROC. When a court strikes out (or declines to strike out) an action for abuse of process under O 18 r 19, that is a final and conclusive finding on the issue of abuse of process. The threshold for striking out is that the facts disclose a “plain and obvious” case of abuse of process. This same threshold applies whether the issue of abuse of process is decided as a preliminary point under O 14 r 12 and/or O 33 r 2 or determined in an application to strike out under O 18 r 19 of the ROC. In our view, the Judge ought not to have invited BHPM to file an application under O 14 r 12 or under O 33 r 2 and should have dealt with BHPM’s application under O 18 r 19 instead.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 We therefore held that the AR’s decision (under O 18 r 19) that TMTA’s continuation of the action was not an abuse of process was a final and conclusive determination in respect of the abuse of process issue as there was no appeal against that decision. Limb (a) of <span class="font-italic">Lee Tat</span> was therefore made out.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Limb (d) – identity of subject matter</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 However, we were of the view that no issue estoppel arose because limb (d) of <span class="font-italic">Lee Tat</span>, that there be identity of subject matter, was not satisfied. The general principle in respect of this limb is that there will not be identity of subject matter if the prior decision cannot be said to have traversed the same ground as the subsequent proceeding owing to a change in the facts and circumstances which gave rise to the earlier decision (<span class="font-italic">Goh Nellie v Goh </span><span class="font-italic">Lian Teck and others</span> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 453 at [34]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The key difference between the situations that existed at the time of the second and the third striking out applications respectively was the fact that amendments were made to the SFA some seven months after the AR’s decision in the second striking out application. With these amendments, s 208 of the SFA was repealed and replaced by s 201B, thereby removing the terms “futures contract” and “futures market” and replacing them with new terms like “derivatives contract” and “organised market” with their own definitions. The effect of these amendments was that the issues of whether an FFA is a “futures contract” and whether the MTFs they are traded on are a “futures market” were no longer relevant to causes of action arising after the amendments came into operation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Whether or not the proceedings raised issues of public interest (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the questions of interpretation of the SFA)<span class="font-italic"> </span>was clearly a relevant and material factor in the AR’s analysis of the abuse of process issue.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I have heard parties and considered both parties’ written subs and authorities. … The difference in the circumstances when [BHPM] failed in their previous striking out application and the present circumstances is that [BHPM] have now offered to settle the matter with the amount of damages and interest claimed by [TMTA]. However, the fact remains that [BHPM] had applied to transfer this case to the High Court on the very basis that it raises issues of public interest and/or important questions of law. … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Because the facts and circumstances forming the backdrop to the abuse of process issue were changed materially by the SFA amendments, it could not be said that the subject matter of the dispute before the AR was identical to that which was before the Judge. Accordingly, in our view, the abuse of process issue was not <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The abuse of process issue</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 We agreed entirely with the Judge that there was no defect in the Offer which would justify TMTA’s refusal to accept it and that TMTA’s various complaints were mere afterthoughts. TMTA’s main complaints, that the Offer was subject to contract and that it could be withdrawn at will, were not raised at the material time. The true stumbling block seemed instead to be TMTA’s insistence on a “global settlement” encompassing the English Judgment, among other things. Moreover, TMTA’s concerns were undoubtedly addressed by the time of the hearing before the Judge when R&amp;T confirmed that the Offer was still open for acceptance as it stood. The fact that TMTA remained unwilling to accept the Offer even after its purported concerns were taken care of was, in our view, quite telling. Had TMTA accepted the Offer, it would have received all the reliefs that it sought, namely, the claimed amount of US$81,500 plus interest and costs. There was no practical benefit to be gained from continuing the action. As the Judge stated, the claim had become “academic” in view of the Offer. It appeared to us therefore that TMTA’s continuation of the action, in the light of the Offer, was for the collateral purpose of seeking a global settlement which included the English Judgment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Against this, TMTA argued that the continuation of its claim was not an abuse of process because of the important issues of public interest which it raised. However, this submission was premised on the expectation that the court’s determination as to whether FFAs are “futures contract[s]” and whether the MTFs on which they were traded are “futures market[s]” would be of interest beyond the parties to the present dispute. This consideration effectively disappeared when the SFA was amended and those terms were replaced with new statutory terms, the “derivatives contract” and the “organised market”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 At the hearing before us, counsel for TMTA, Ms Deborah Barker SC, argued that the present case would still be of interest to potential litigants with causes of action that arose before the amendments to the SFA came into operation on 8 October 2018. However, Ms Barker was unable to point to any potential or pending litigation which involves the repealed statutory terms. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Ms Barker also suggested that, despite the change in terminology resulting from the SFA amendments, the court’s interpretation of the terms “futures contract” and “futures market” might nonetheless be of guidance in the interpretation of the new statutory terms. We did not see why this should be so especially when the issues raised in Suit 580 do not involve a comparison of the pre- and post-amendment statutory regimes. Any determination made in Suit 580 on the scope of the terms in the pre-amendment SFA would therefore be unlikely to be authoritative or of assistance to cases which are subject to the post-amendment regime.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 After the Offer was made, it was clear that the primary benefit of proceeding to trial could no longer be that of TMTA obtaining compensatory relief. That relief could have been obtained by TMTA simply by accepting the Offer. It became incumbent on TMTA to point to other reasons why it should be allowed to continue with its action despite the Offer. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 TMTA attempted to show some other reason why it was entitled to continue with its action. With a trial, it could obtain vindicatory relief since the Offer was made without any admission as to liability. The Judge rejected this submission and held that a finding of liability was not an independent relief sought by TMTA but was instead the basis on which compensatory relief was sought (GD at [53]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 In our view, seeking vindicatory relief in the form of a formal finding of liability or a declaration of non-liability, in the face of an open offer to agree to all reliefs sought in an action without any admission of liability, may be justified in only very special circumstances. For example, let us consider a claim for damages resulting from a very grave defamation, where the defendant pleads justification but subsequently makes an offer to pay damages while refusing to withdraw the pleaded justification. In such a situation, if the plaintiff could show that he may suffer serious practical consequences, for instance, that the defamation would affect his professional status, it is arguable that the plaintiff should be allowed to continue with the action in order to vindicate his reputation completely at trial and remove all the stains resulting from the defamation. TMTA’s action certainly did not come within this sort of very special circumstances as it was essentially a commercial claim. It should therefore not be permitted to carry on with its action for the professed reason of obtaining vindication.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 We therefore dismissed TMTA’s appeal although for reasons which differ from those given by the Judge.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>
Decision of the Court of Appeal (delivered by Tay Yong Kwang JA):
</strong>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Outcome:<em> </em>CoA dismisses appeal against High Court’s decision to
strike out the appellant’s Statement of Claim on grounds of abuse of
process.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Background</strong>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
1 The appellant, TMT Asia Limited (“TMTA”), was the plaintiff in the main
suit, and the respondents, which were companies in the BHP Billiton Group
(collectively, “BHPM”), were the defendants. BHPM applied to strike out
TMTA’s claim on the grounds that continued prosecution of the claim would
be an abuse of process in light of BHPM’s open offer (“the Offer”) to
settle TMTA’s claim in full. At the hearing of BHPM’s striking out
application, the High Court Judge (“the Judge”) directed that pursuant to O
14 r 12 and/or O 33 r 2 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed)
(“ROC”), a preliminary point or issue be decided first. That preliminary
point mirrored the issue in the striking out application: <em>ie</em>,
whether TMTA was entitled to continue with the action in light of the
settlement offer. The Judge answered the issue in the negative and struck
out TMTA’s claim. TMTA appealed.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>The material facts</strong>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
2 The appellant, TMTA, is a shipping company. The respondents, BHPM, are
part of the BHP Billiton Group, a producer of iron ore. The parties were
involved in trading forward freight agreements (“FFAs”) with prices which
were based on a certain index. TMTA alleged that BHPM manipulated freight
prices by procuring contracts for freight in such quantities as to
artificially inflate the freight rates reported on the index, in breach of
s 208(<em>a</em>) of the Securities and Futures Act (Cap 289, 2006 Rev Ed)
(“SFA”), which prohibited manipulation of the price of a “futures contract”
in a “futures market”. BHPM denied the claim.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
3 TMTA commenced suit in February 2013 in the District Court, but the suit
was transferred to the High Court on BHPM’s application on grounds that it
raised issues of public interest pertaining to the interpretation of s 208(    <em>a</em>) of the SFA.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
4 In August 2013, BHPM applied to strike out TMTA’s claim, but this first
striking out application was ultimately dismissed on appeal to the High
Court.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
5 Thereafter, BHPM extended an Offer to settle TMTA’s claim in full. TMTA
did not accept the Offer.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
6 In March 2016, BHPM applied a second time to strike out TMTA’s claim,
this time on the basis that continued prosecution of TMTA’s claim would be
an abuse of process in light of the Offer to settle the claim in full. This
second striking out application was heard by an assistant registrar (“the
AR”), who declined to strike out TMTA’s claim, reasoning in part that the
proceedings raised issues of public importance relating to the
interpretation of s 208(<em>a</em>) of the SFA. BHPM did not appeal.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
7 In June 2018, BHPM applied for the third time to strike out TMTA’s claim
under O 18 r 19 of the ROC. The Judge reframed the issue as a preliminary
point to be decided under O 14 r 12 and/or O 33 r 2 as follows: Whether the
continuance of the action was an abuse of the process of the court in the
light of the Offer.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
8 First, the Judge held that the AR’s decision in the second striking out
application (that the claim should not be struck out) did not give rise to
any issue estoppel. He considered that the AR’s decision was not final
conclusive in relation to the preliminary point before him because it was
made in respect of an application to strike out under O 18 r 19 of the ROC,
whereas the preliminary issue before him was to be determined under O 14 r
12 and/or O 33 r 2, which involved a different threshold. The Judge noted
that s 208(<em>a</em>) of the SFA had since been amended substantially so
that the significance of the action as a test case for the interpretation
of that section was diminished, but observed that it would remain relevant
to causes of action that arose before the amendments came into operation.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
9 Second, the Judge held that the continuance of TMTA’s claim would be an
abuse of process because it would serve no useful purpose in light of the
Offer, under which TMTA would receive all the reliefs it was seeking in its
claim. The Judge struck out the claim accordingly.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>The court’s decision </strong>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
10 The Court of Appeal dismissed TMTA’s appeal and affirmed the Judge’s
decision to strike out the claim, albeit on different grounds.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
11 The Court set out the two issues which fell for determination: First,
whether the abuse of process issue was <em>res judicata</em> as a result of
the AR’s decision (“the <em>res judicata</em> issue”). Second, whether
TMTA’s continuation of its action was an abuse of the court’s process in
light of the Offer (“the abuse of process issue”) (at <strong>[22]</strong>
).
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
12 The Court disagreed with the Judge’s finding on the issue of whether the
AR’s decision was final and conclusive. The Court held that it was,
reasoning that there was no difference in the threshold applicable for a
finding of abuse of process under O 18 r 19 of the ROC and a preliminary
determination of that same issue made pursuant to O 14 r 12 and/or O 33 r
2. The Court further opined that the Judge ought not to have invited BHPM
to file an application under O 14 r 12 and/or O 33 r 2 and should have
dealt with BHPM’s application under O 18 r 19 instead (at    <strong>[25]</strong>).
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
13 Although the AR’s decision was final and conclusive, the Court held that
no issue estoppel arose because there was no identity of subject matter.
The key difference between the situations that existed at the time of the
second striking out application (before the AR) and the third striking out
application (before the Judge) was the fact that amendments were made to
the SFA some seven months after the AR’s decision. With these amendments, s
208 of the SFA was repealed and replaced by s 201B, thereby removing the
terms “futures contract” and “futures market” and replacing them with
differently-defined terms. The effect of these amendments was that the
issues of interpretation of s 208(<em>a</em>) were no longer relevant to
causes of action arising after the amendments came into operation, thereby
diminishing the public importance of the questions raised in TMTA’s claim.
Because the facts and circumstances forming the backdrop to the abuse of
process issue were changed materially by the SFA amendments, it could not
be said that the subject matter of the dispute before the AR was identical
to that which was before the Judge, and the abuse of process issue was
therefore not <em>res judicata</em> (at <strong>[28]</strong> and    <strong>[30]</strong>).
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
14 On the abuse of process issue, the Court agreed entirely with the Judge
that there was no defect in the Offer which would justify TMTA’s refusal to
accept it (at <strong>[31]</strong>). After the Offer was made, it was
clear that the primary benefit of proceeding to trial could no longer be
that of TMTA obtaining compensatory relief, since that relief could be
obtained by TMTA simply accepting the Offer. It became incumbent on TMTA to
point to other reasons why it should be allowed to continue with its action
despite the Offer (at <strong>[35]</strong>).
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
15 The Court rejected TMTA’s submission that the questions raised in the
action would still be of public interest in that the court’s interpretation
of the terms “futures contract” and “futures market” might nonetheless be
of guidance in the interpretation of the new statutory terms. The issues
raised in TMTA’s claim did not involve a comparison of the pre- and
post-amendment statutory regimes, and so any interpretation of the terms of
the pre-amendment SFA would therefore be unlikely to be authoritative or of
assistance to cases subject to the post-amendment regime (at    <strong>[34]</strong>).
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
16 The Court also rejected TMTA’s argument that a trial was necessary for
it to obtain vindicatory relief since the Offer was made without any
admission as to liability (at <strong>[36]</strong>). The Court observed
that seeking vindicatory relief in the form of a formal finding of
liability or a declaration of non-liability, in the face of an open offer
to agree to all reliefs sought in an action without any admission of
liability, may be justified in only very special circumstances. One example
might be a case involving a claim for damages resulting from a very grave
defamation, where the defendant pleads justification but subsequently makes
an offer to pay damages while refusing to withdraw the pleaded
justification. In such a situation, if the plaintiff could show that he may
suffer serious practical consequences (<em>eg</em>, if the defamation would
affect his professional status), it is arguable that the plaintiff should
be allowed to continue with the action in order to vindicate his reputation
completely at trial. However, TMTA’s action did not come within this sort
of very special circumstances as it was essentially a commercial claim (at    <strong>[37]</strong>).
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
17 For these reasons, the Court dismissed TMTA’s appeal, and upheld the
Judge’s decision to strike out TMTA’s claim (at <strong>[38]</strong>).
