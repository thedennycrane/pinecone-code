<strong>JUDGMENT:</strong>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><strong><font color="#804040" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Grounds of Decision</font></strong></p>
<font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">1.    There are two appeals before me. Both arose from Divorce

Petition No 4420 of 1998. The parties married young. The husband had not attained the legal age of

majority when they were married in 1963. After 35 long years and 4 grownup children the wife filed

the present petition. The eldest, a daughter, was 34. The youngest, a son, was 26. It was not a

smooth marriage. Earlier the wife filed a divorce petition in 1994. Then she reconciled and withdrew

it the next year. In 1997 she filed another divorce petition. Once again she reconciled and withdrew

it the next year. She filed the present petition on the ground that the marriage had irretrievably

broken down because the husband had behaved unreasonably. The husband had alienated himself from his

wife and children. According to the wife the husband had another woman in Malaysia. The glue that

held them to the bond of marriage was a business. It was a transport business called Blue and White

Bus Transport Service.</p>
<p align="justify">2.    A decree nisi was made without contest on 23 March 1999.

Consequential matters were adjourned to be heard in chambers. Ancillary matters were heard and

orders were made on 5 July 2000 in the Subordinate Court. Both parties were dissatisfied with the

orders made by the District Judge and appealed to High Court Judge. I heard the appeals and varied

the orders made by the District Judge. The husband was not happy with the orders and has appealed

against the order made by me. The purpose of this judgment is to state the reasons for my decision.</p>
<p align="justify">3.    The orders made by the District Judge were as follows :</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"1. the matrimonial property known as No. 18D Lorong 102 Changi Road,

  shall be sold in the open market and the proceeds of sale, less the outstanding loan is to be

  divided equally between the parties.</p>
<p align="justify">2. the respondent shall be responsible for the repayment of the overdraft of

  $250,000 and the interest thereon.</p>
<p align="justify">3. the petitioner shall be given the first option either solely or with any

  nominee, to be exercised within one (1) month of the Decree Nisi Absolute, to purchase the

  respondent's share in the matrimonial property.</p>
<p align="justify">4. the parties do appoint an accountant to value the business of Blue &amp;

  White Bus Transport Service within three (3) months with expenses to be borne equally, and the net

  assets shall be divided equally between the parties.</p>
<p align="justify">5. the respondent shall be given the first option, to be exercised within one

  (1) month after valuation, to purchase the petitioner's share in Blue and White Bus Transport

  Service.</p>
<p align="justify">6. the respondent shall pay the petitioner lump sum maintenance of $70,000.00

  and the said sum is to be deducted from his share of the net proceeds of sale of the matrimonial

  property.</p>
<p align="justify">7. costs to the petitioner fixed at $3,500.</p>
<p align="justify">8. parties be at liberty to apply."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<i><u>
<p align="justify">The wife's appeal</p>
</u></i>
<p align="justify">4.    The wife was dissatisfied with two of the orders, the first

relating to the Changi road property. The next was in respect of the business.</p>
<p align="justify">5.    As to the Changi Road property she wanted it transferred to

her as the sole owner free of any encumbrance. She wanted it freed from the mortgage securing an

overdraft loan of $250,000 and interest.</p>
<p align="justify">6.    As to the business, she wanted it valued as at 1 December

1998 and not the current value.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<i><u>
<p align="justify">The husband's appeal</p>
</u></i>
<p align="justify">7.    The husband was dissatisfied with paragraph 2 (repayment of

the overdraft amount plus interest) and paragraph 6 (the lump sum maintenance and its deduction from

his share of the proceeds of the matrimonial property).</p>
<p align="justify">8.    As to the former, he wanted the nett proceeds to be divided.

As to the latter he wanted to pay a monthly maintenance of $700.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<i><u>
<p align="justify">My decision</p>
</u></i>
<p align="justify">9.    My decision in respect of both appeals was as follows :</p>
<u>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"RA 720052 of 2000</p>
</blockquote></u>
<p align="justify">1. the appeal be allowed as follows :</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(i) the Order of Court made the 5<sup>th</sup> day of July 2000 in respect of

  the matrimonial property to stay save that the appellant/petitioner shall be given 70% and the

  respondent 30% of the net proceeds from the sale of the matrimonial property;</p>
<p align="justify">(ii) the prayer in the divorce petition shall be amended to give accord to this

  variation; and</p>
<p align="justify">(iii) the Order of Court made the 5<sup>th</sup> day of July 2000 in respect of

  the business known as Blue &amp; White Bus Transport Service to stay save that the valuation is to

  be as of the 1<sup>st</sup> day of December 1998.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">(2) the respondent do pay the appellant/petitioner costs in the ancillary

proceedings and the appeal to be agreed or taxed; and</p>
<p align="justify">(3) parties be at liberty to apply. "</p>
<p align="justify">"<u>RA 720054 of 2000</u></p>
<p align="justify">1. the appeal be dismissed.</p>
<p align="justify">2. the appellant/respondent do pay the petitioner the cost of this appeal to be

agreed or taxed; and</p>
<p align="justify">3. parties be at liberty to apply."</p>
<p align="justify">10.    Four matters require explanation :</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(i) the proportion of division of the property</p>
<p align="justify">(ii) the addition of $250,000 before the division</p>
<p align="justify">(iii) the date of valuation of the business</p>
<p align="justify">(iv) the lump sum maintenance</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<i><u>
<p>Lumpsum maintenance</p>
</u></i>
<p align="justify">11.    I shall first deal with the lump sum maintenance. Like the

District Judge I was of the view that this was an eminently appropriate case for a lump sum

maintenance award. An order for a monthly maintenance would result in the wife getting the run

around. He would not make regular payment. Knowing the history of the husband that was patent.

Additionally the husband had the funds to meet the award.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<i><u>
<p align="justify">Date of valuation</p>
</u></i>
<p align="justify">12.    Now I turn to the date of business valuation. The

relationship between the spouses as regards a family business in general should be treated as a

virtual or quasi partnership. This means an importation of the principles of equity to resolve the

disputes between the "partners". In this case the District Judge applied the principle of

"equity in equality". That was a just and equitable decision. In any event neither party

challenged it. The District Judge, however, ordered a division on the basis of available assets

without specifying the cut-off date.</p>
<p align="justify">13.    The relationship of partnership including a family business

which can rightly be signified as a partnership imports the principles of good faith and fiduciary

obligations. Applying these principles I held that the valuation must be as at 1 December 1998. It

was the date on which the notional partnership was effectively terminated. The history of the

relationship between the parties was uneven. The husbands conduct was unreasonable and unfair

towards the wife. He would have grossly run down the assets of the business. A valuation after the

asset-stripping would be unfair and inequitable to the wife. If the husband has not engaged in

asset-stripping the valuation date would make no difference to him. So the notional state of

dissolution was the appropriate date for the valuation.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<i><u>
<p align="justify">Addition of $250,000</p>
</u></i>
<p align="justify">14.    That brings me to the property. The District Judge held

that the overdraft obligation must fall on the husbands shoulders. This was because "he had

deliberately withdrawn this sum of $250,000 after the divorce proceedings had been instituted".

The evidence pointed to him pocketing that amount. This reconfirms the husbands propensity to run

down the assets to the detriment of the wife. It was a fraud to the wife. It was against the

principles of justice and fairness. I therefore agreed with and affirmed the decision of the

District Judge on this point.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<i><u>
<p align="justify">Division of property</p>
</u></i>
<p align="justify">15.    Finally I advert to the division of the property. I ordered

a division of 70:30 in favour of the wife. I based it on the fact that the wife made a greater

indirect contribution. Although the husband had made a substantial down payment, subsequent

contributions of the wife were substantially greater. The adjustment I made was to give effect to

the sense of proportionality.</p>
