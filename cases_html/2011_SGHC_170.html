<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The two appeals before me (Registrar’s
                    Appeal No 58 of 2011 and Registrar’s Appeal No 59 of 2011) relate to the
                    issue as to which of the two jurisdictions, <em>ie</em>,
                    Singapore or Australia, is the more appropriate forum to hear and decide the
                    dispute between the parties arising from a customer-banker
                relationship.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The thrust of the plaintiff’s case in the
                    Singapore proceedings lies in contract where it claims for payment due under
                    various contracts entered with the first and second defendant respectively (see
                        <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a>, <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a> and <a href="#p1_17">[17]</a> below). The
                    defendants, on the other hand, have commenced proceedings in Australia against
                    the plaintiff for, <em>inter alia</em>, damages based on
                    “deceptive” or negligent misrepresentation. Counsel for the
                    defendants conceded at the hearing that the defendants’ claim in Australia
                    could essentially be mounted as a defence to the plaintiff’s claim in
                    Singapore. In other words, the Singapore proceedings mirror the Australian
                    proceedings. However, the defendants claimed that based on certain perceived
                    advantages arising from some Australian legislation, <em>ie</em>, the Australian Securities and Investments Act 2001 (Cth)
                    (“ASIC Act”), or alternatively, ss 68 and 72 of the Fair Trading
                    Act 1987 (NSW), or alternatively, ss 99–100 of the Fair Trading Act 1989
                    (Qld) (“the FTAs”) (collectively known as the
                    “Australian Acts”), their prospects of success in Australia are
                    purportedly enhanced.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       This decision will, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, examine whether this factor of perceived juridical
                    advantage, even if true, would be sufficient to displace the natural forum if it
                    is determined to be Singapore instead of Australia. In addition, I will also
                    consider the issue of whether the natural forum of a contractual claim can be
                    displaced by the natural forum of a tort of misrepresentation, on the assumption
                    that the natural fora for the contractual and misrepresentation claims are
                    different, when the latter is in essence a defence to the contractual claim.
                    Finally, I will examine the interplay of the principles governing stay
                    applications with those governing anti-suit injunctions to determine whether
                    such an injunction should be granted even if the stay is refused.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Background Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Dramatis Personae</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The plaintiff in Suit No 801 of 2010 (“S
                    801/2010” or the “Singapore Proceedings”) and Originating
                    Summons No 1160 of 2010 (“OS 1160/ 2010”) is UBS AG. Although UBS
                    AG is named as the plaintiff in both S 801/2010 and OS 1160/2010, parties have
                    made submissions by reference to UBS Singapore, which is the Singapore
                    branch of UBS AG and carries on business in Singapore. For the avoidance of
                    doubt, this judgment will employ the term “UBS AG (Singapore)”
                    whenever the Singapore branch of UBS AG is referred to.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Telesto Investments Limited
                    (“Telesto”) is an underlying company of the Dog Star Trust which
                    is a purpose trust registered in Jersey, the Channel Islands. On 3 December
                    2007, Telesto opened an account, <em>ie</em>, Account
                    No [xxx] (“the Telesto account”, “its account”
                    or “the account” as the case may be) with UBS AG
                    (Singapore).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Scott Francis Tyne
                    (“Mr Tyne”), on the other hand, is a director and the
                    controlling mind of Pole Star Funds Management Pte Ltd (“Pole
                    Star”) which, at all material times, was in charge of Telesto’s
                    discretionary investment. Mr Tyne was, at all material times, identified by
                    Telesto (in the minutes of its directors’ meeting) as the sole beneficial
                    owner of the assets in the account.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> He was also the guarantor of all
                    the obligations and liabilities of Telesto owing to UBS AG (Singapore), pursuant
                    to a continuing guarantee and indemnity dated 26 September 2008 (“the
                    Guarantee”) in favour of UBS AG (Singapore).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Telesto and Mr Tyne are the first and
                    second defendants of both S 801/2010 and OS 1160/2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       ACN 074 971 109 Pty Ltd, the third defendant in
                    OS 1160/2010, is the trustee of the Argot Unit Trust (“Argot”)
                    which is also a customer of UBS AG, having opened an account, <em>ie</em>, Account No [xxx] (“the Argot account”)
                    on or about 4 June 2010 with UBS AG (Singapore). Mr Tyne was, at all
                    material times, the director of Argot and the sole beneficial owner of the
                    assets under the Argot account. Therefore, at all material times, the common
                    denominator of Telesto, Pole Star and Argot was Mr Tyne. The three
                    defendants are hereinafter collectively referred to as “the
                    defendants”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       As an application for a stay of proceedings
                    and/or for an anti-suit injunction typically involves an examination of the
                    connections that the <em>relevant issues</em> of the
                    dispute bear to each jurisdiction for the determination of the natural forum, a
                    careful and detailed analysis of the facts giving rise to the present dispute is
                    essential.</p>

                    of a Credit Services Notification Letter (“CSNL”) dated 12
                    December 2007 which was subsequently revised by CSNLs dated 13 February 2008, 1

                AG (Singapore) and Telesto</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Pursuant to the CSNLs, Telesto utilised the
                    facilities to, <em>inter alia</em>, purchase various
                    investments (“the Investments”) for its account. The Investments
                    were secured by Telesto by way of a Charge Over Asset which, in turn, included
                    the Investments and all other assets in the account (“the
                    Collateral”). Notably, the Investments included bonds issued by certain
                    Kazakhstan financial institutions, including Bank Turan-Alem (“BTA
                    Bank”) and Astana Finance (“Astana”) (collectively the
                    “Kazakh Bonds”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     It is undisputed that UBS AG (Singapore) had
                    sent Telesto periodic statements and confirmations reflecting the purchase of
                    the Investments and other transactions carried out under the Account Agreement.
                    The periodic statements and confirmations were retained by UBS AG (Singapore) in
                    Singapore at its Retained Mail unit pursuant to Telesto’s mailing
                    instructions of 13 November 2007 when it signed the Account Mandate.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> Telesto did not

                    Telesto undertook to inform UBS AG (Singapore) promptly and in any event,
                    within 14 days from the date of such confirmation, and, within 90 days from the
                    date of such statements (as applicable), of any discrepancies, omissions,

                    account or the contents of each confirmation or statement or the execution of
                    any order. Failing which, upon the expiry of the 14 days, UBS AG (Singapore) may
                        <em>deem</em> Telesto to have <em>approved</em> the original statements as sent by UBS AG (Singapore)
                    to Telesto and in which case, Telesto shall be <em>deemed
                        conclusively</em> to have <em>accepted</em> all
                    the matters contained in such confirmation and statement without any further
                    proof that the account is, and all entries therein and the execution of all the
                    transactions are correct. Further, UBS AG (Singapore) shall be free from all
                    claims in respect of the Account and all such transactions save for unauthorised
                    transactions which have resulted from the forgery, fraud or negligence of UBS AG

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In or about September 2008, the value of the
                    Collateral decreased due to market deterioration. Consequently, a margin
                    shortfall occurred in the account. In or around 24 September 2008, Mr Tyne
                    travelled to Singapore to, <em>inter alia</em>, meet with
                    the representatives of UBS AG (Singapore) to discuss how to deal with the margin
                    shortfall. Mr Tyne requested UBS AG (Singapore) not to liquidate the
                    Collateral and agreed to furnish additional security by way of, amongst other
                    things, the Guarantee.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Mr Tyne executed the Guarantee in
                    Singapore on or about 26 September 2008. UBS AG (Singapore) and
                    Mr Tyne, who was acting behalf of Telesto, further agreed to negotiate a
                    standstill agreement on the basis that in return for UBS AG (Singapore) not
                    exercising its right to (amongst other things) liquidate or request for more
                    collateral, Telesto would arrange for additional collateral and repay the Total
                    Liabilities, <em>ie</em>, “all moneys, obligations
                    and liabilities now or at any time due, owing or incurred by [Telesto] to [UBS
                    AG], anywhere, whether on the account, or in respect of the Facilities or any
                    instructions or otherwise, in whatever manner, and actual or contingent, present
                    or future, and whether as principal debtor or as surety, including (but not
                    limited to) all principal moneys, interest at such rates as may from time to
                    time be payable by [Telesto], fees, charges and all expenses” (see cl 1
                    of the account T&amp;Cs (General Conditions)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Pursuant to cl 11.2 of the account T&amp;Cs,
                    Telesto was to maintain at all times sufficient Collateral for the Facilities as
                    determined by UBS AG (Singapore) in its sole discretion. UBS AG (Singapore) may,
                    from time to time, require additional collateral to meet the required margin for
                    the Facilities (“Required Margin”). As at 28 October 2008, there
                    remained a shortfall of US$ 28,159,607 in the Required Margin.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     As no standstill agreement was reached with
                    Mr Tyne, UBS AG (Singapore) issued Telesto a Notice of Margin Call dated 29
                    October 2008<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> requesting
                    that Telesto “immediately deposit additional Collateral, or, if
                    applicable, terminate or deal with transactions booked in [Telesto’s]
                    account, in each case in order to restore the Required Margin”
                    (“the Margin Call”). Unfortunately, Telesto did not meet the
                    Margin Call. Under cll 13.2 and 13.3 of the account T&amp;Cs (General
                        Conditions),<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> the Total Liabilities became immediately
                    due and payable. Telesto and Mr Tyne, however, continued to request UBS AG
                    (Singapore) not to liquidate the Collateral or make further margin calls or call
                    for further collateral. The negotiations for a standstill agreement
                    continued.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     On or about 22 December 2008, UBS AG
                    (Singapore) wrote to Mr Tyne stating that “the Required Margin not
                    been re-established[,] [a]s a result thereof, a Default Event has occurred and
                    consequently, the full amount of the Total Liabilities became immediately due
                    and payable to [UBS AG (Singapore)]”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> However, “in recognition of

                    [UBS AG (Singapore) would] suspend enforcement of its rights under the Account

                    the terms of a standstill agreement continued.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     On or about 23 April 2009, UBS AG (Singapore)
                    proposed in writing the terms of a standstill agreement. Telesto was to confirm
                    it by signing and returning a copy of the letter to UBS AG (Singapore). However,
                    this proposed standstill agreement was not signed by Mr Tyne on behalf of

                    notional value of the BTA Bank bonds no later than 11 May 2009. This was
                    because:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_a"></a>(a)     Telesto had not returned a

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_b"></a>(b)     BTA Bank’s default had led to a

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Telesto and Mr Tyne failed to make any

                    for the expected default by BTA Bank. Instead, they asked UBS AG (Singapore) to
                    resume negotiations for a standstill agreement and to accept alternative
                    collateral. UBS AG (Singapore) agreed to suspend enforcement of its rights under
                    the Account Agreement for the time being.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     A standstill agreement was finally entered

                    to) perform or comply with any one or more of their obligations under the
                    Standstill Agreement”. By reason of the Events of Default 1, 3 and 5, the
                    Standstill Agreement was terminated.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     From the defendants’ affidavits filed in
                    the Singapore Proceedings as well as their Australian pleadings, the defendants
                    have sought to deny liability on several fronts, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, as below:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, they alleged that in or
                        around mid 2007, Mr Tyne, acting on behalf of Pole Star, advised UBS AG
                        that Pole Star was the investment manager of Telesto’s investment
                        portfolio but had limited authority and required express authority of
                        Telesto to invest in securities other than “investment grade”
                        debt securities. This conversation purportedly took place over the phone
                        between Mr Tyne (acting on behalf of Pole Star) and one Mr Steven
                        Betsalel (“Mr Betsalel”) who was an officer of UBS AG. It
                        was claimed that Mr Betsalel had advised Mr Tyne that UBS AG would
                        procure Telesto to execute documents authorising Pole Star to operate the
                        accounts, credit facilities and trading lines with UBS AG on behalf of
                            Telesto;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41-p2_b"></a>(b)     Secondly, they alleged that the Kazakh Bonds
                        were purchased as a result of certain misrepresentations made orally by
                        Mr Betsalel and one Mr Edward Farrell
                        (“Mr Farrell”), on behalf of UBS AG, to Mr Tyne (on
                        behalf of Pole Star) and Telesto by way of a number of phone calls made in
                        late 2007;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41-p2_c"></a>(c)     Thirdly, they alleged that UBS AG owed fiduciary
                        duties to Telesto in relation to the account and breached the same by acting
                        as advisers to BTA Bank. BTA Bank defaulted on payment of coupons owed to
                        bond holders, including those under the BTA Bank bonds owned by Telesto.
                        They claimed that the decision of BTA Bank to default was on the advice
                        given by or with the concurrence of UBS AG.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_a"></a>(a)     A declaration that the investment
                        transactions purportedly entered into between 14 January 2008 and
                        11 February 2008, (<em>ie</em>, the Kazakh Bonds)
                        were entered into by UBS AG (Singapore) without Telesto’s authority
                        such that they were not transactions done by or on behalf of
                    Telesto.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_b"></a>(b)     An order

                        Facilities, Mortgage, the Guarantee, the Revision Letter (<em>ie</em>, the Standstill Agreement), the Trust Mortgage (<em>ie</em>, the Deed of Assignment) and the Letter of
                        Undertaking, be declared <em>void ab initio;</em> or
                        alternatively be declared void from a date to be determined by the court; or
                        alternatively UBS AG be restrained from taking any action to enforce any
                        right or entitlement arising under any such instrument.</p>

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_d"></a>(d)     Damages or compensation pursuant to ss 12 GF or
                        12 GM of the ASIC Act (Cth), or alternatively, ss 68 and 72 of the Fair
                        Trading Act 1987 (NSW) or alternatively ss 99–100 of the Fair Trading
                        Act 1989 (Qld).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_e"></a>(e)     Equitable compensation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The writ for the Australian Proceedings was
                    served on UBS AG (Australia)’s office in Sydney, Australia on
                    3 November 2010 prior to the service of the Singapore writ on Telesto in
                    Jersey on 5 November 2010. The slight delay in the service of the Singapore
                    writ, given that it was filed on 15 October 2010, was probably due to the
                    fact that Telesto’s previous solicitors in Singapore, Messrs CTLC Law
                    Corporation, did not agree to accept service on Telesto’s behalf. Thus,
                    UBS AG (Singapore) had to apply to serve the writ on Telesto out of
                        jurisdiction.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Stay Applications and the Anti-Suit Injunction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     On 11 November 2010, UBS AG (Singapore) filed
                    an application for an anti-suit injunction in OS 1160/2010 against the
                    defendants in respect of the Australian Proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     On 21 December 2010, Telesto filed Summons No
                    5910/2010 to stay the Singapore Proceedings in favour of the Australian
                    Proceedings. On 10 January 2011, Mr Tyne filed Summons No 83/2011 to
                    stay the Singapore Proceedings in favour of the Australian Proceedings
                    (collectively “the stay applications”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     All three applications were heard by an
                    Assistant Registrar (“the AR”) on 21 February 2011. The AR
                    dismissed Telesto and Mr Tyne’s stay applications and granted an
                    anti-suit injunction against the defendants from continuing the Australian
                    Proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Registrar’s Appeal No 58/2011 and Registrar’s Appeal No
                59/2011 (“the Appeals”)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Registrar’s Appeal No 58/2011 is an
                    appeal brought by Telesto and Mr Tyne against the decision of the AR to
                    dismiss their stay applications.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Registrar’s Appeal No 59/2011 is an
                    appeal brought by the defendants against the AR’s decision to grant an
                    anti-suit injunction in OS 1160/2010 against them from continuing the Australian
                    Proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     At the start of the hearing of the Appeals, I
                    directed counsel for the defendants, Mr Eddee Ng
                    (“Mr Ng”) to first proceed with his appeal in relation to the
                    stay applications brought by Telesto and Mr Tyne. This was because, in the
                    present circumstances where two fora have been chosen as the place of litigation
                    by the plaintiff (on one hand) and Telesto and Mr Tyne (on the other), if I
                    decide that stay of the Singapore Proceedings should be granted on the ground
                    that Singapore is not the more appropriate forum to try the matter, the appeal
                    against the AR’s decision to grant anti-suit injunction would, logically,
                    be allowed. The converse, however, is not true. The fact that Singapore is the
                    natural or more appropriate forum to hear the dispute <em>per
                        se</em> does not mean that the anti-suit injunction must necessarily
                    be ordered. There are other requirements for UBS AG to establish, <em>eg</em>, that the Australian Proceedings are vexatious and/or
                    oppressive, to justify the granting of an anti-suit injunction.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">RA 58/2010: The appeal against the refusal of the stay
                applications</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Parties were generally <em>ad
                        idem</em> as regards the principles governing the stay applications on
                    the basis of <em>forum non conveniens</em>, <em>viz</em>, the principles laid down in <em>Spiliada Maritme Corporation v Cansulex Ltd</em>
                    [1987] AC 460 (“<em>Spiliada</em>”). Where parties expectedly differ is when applying
                    the test, they arrived at opposing conclusions as to whether Singapore or
                    Australia is clearly or distinctly the more appropriate forum.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     It was common ground between the parties that
                        <em>Spiliada</em> laid down a two-stage test to
                    determine whether a stay of proceedings ought to be granted:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_51-p2_a"></a>(a)     Stage one: The legal burden of proof
                        falls on the defendant to demonstrate that there is some other available
                        forum, having competent jurisdiction, in which the case may be tried more
                        suitably for the interest of all parties and the ends of justice. If the
                        court is satisfied, at this stage of the inquiry, that there is no other
                        forum which is clearly and distinctly more appropriate than Singapore to try
                        the matter, it will ordinarily refuse a stay.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_51-p2_b"></a>(b)     Stage two: If the Singapore court is satisfied
                        that there is another available forum which is more appropriate to try the
                        matter, the burden is then on the plaintiff to show special circumstances by
                        reason of which justice requires that the stay of the Singapore Proceedings
                        should nonetheless be refused.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Stage one of the Spiliada test</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Under stage one of the <em>Spiliada</em> test, the defendants bear the burden of proving that
                    Australia is clearly or distinctly the more appropriate forum to try the dispute
                    between the parties. In this regard, the court would invariably examine the
                    connecting factors which the dispute bears to each of the two competing
                    jurisdictions. These factors include:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">general connecting factors such as residence of

<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the jurisdiction in which the cause of action

                            contract was exclusive, and if not, which law should be applied to the
                            claims in tort and equity); and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the effect of the concurrent proceedings before

                    1 SLR(R) 377 (“<em>Rickshaw</em>”)
                    at [15] and [23]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The list of connecting factors is not closed
                    and much will depend upon the precise factual matrix of each case (see <em>JIO Minerals FZC and others v Mineral Enterprises Ltd</em>
                    [2011] 1 SLR 391 (“<em>JIO
                        Minerals”</em>) at [41]). However, as the threshold is that the natural forum is
                        <em>prima facie</em> clearly more appropriate to try
                    the case, connections which have no or little bearing on the adjudication of the
                    issues in dispute between the parties will carry little weight (see <em>Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore on Conflicts of Law</em>,
                    Vol 6(2) (Lexis Nexis, 2009) (“<em>Halsbury’s Laws
                        of Singapore on Conflicts of Law”</em>) at para 75.090 as
                    cited in <em>JIO Minerals</em> at [41]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     In considering the natural forum of the
                    dispute, it is not the mere personal or geographical connections that are
                    decisive as there must be <em>some legal significance</em>
                    in each of the connecting factors. As such, the numerical preponderance of
                    personal or geographical connections <em>per se</em> is not
                    by any means conclusive (see <em>Yeoh Poh San &amp; another v Won
                        Siok Wan</em> [2002] SGHC 196 at [17]–[18]). Each
                    connecting factor cannot be analysed <em>in vaccuo</em> but
                    must instead be examined in the context of the issues in dispute between the
                    parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     With these settled principles in mind, it is
                    perhaps apposite to set out the key issues that arise from both the Singapore
                    and the Australian Proceedings as it would assist in the determination of the
                    natural forum. Given that the defendants have not filed their Defence in the
                    Singapore Proceedings, the Australian Proceedings are relevant insofar as it
                    provides a clear indication of the defendants’ position as regards their
                    potential defence and their (counter)claim(s) against UBS AG.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Jurisdiction in which cause of action accrued and the
                applicable law of the issues in dispute</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     It is clear that UBS AG’s claims in the
                    Singapore Proceedings against the defendants are made pursuant to various
                    contractual documents:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the claim for the Total Liabilities (as at

                            the CSNLs and the Standstill Agreement; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the claim for the Total Liabilities (as at
                            14 October 2010) against Mr Tyne is based on the
                            Guarantee.</div>
<p class="Judg-1">Noteworthy is that Telesto’s account with UBS AG (Singapore) from
                    which the Total Liabilities (as at 14 October 2010) became due was booked
                    in Singapore and serviced by officers of UBS AG (Singapore). Each of the
                    contractual documents was issued by UBS AG (Singapore).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     It is immediately apparent (see <a href="#p1_42">[42]</a>–<a href="#p1_44">[44]</a> above) that the issues raised by the defendants in the
                    Australian Proceedings are essentially in the nature of defences to avoid
                    liability to the claims brought by UBS AG in the Singapore Proceedings. By
                    juxtaposing the respective positions of UBS AG and the defendants, it is clear
                    that the <em>ultimate issue</em> hinges upon whether UBS AG
                    is entitled to repayment of the Total Liabilities (as at 14 October 2010)
                    under the contractual documents (listed at <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a>, <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a>, <a href="#p1_17">[17]</a>, <a href="#p1_27">[27]</a> and
                        <a href="#p1_28">[28]</a> above) or whether the defendants
                    are entitled to rescission or damages<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> in respect of the investment in
                    the Kazakh Bonds. Simply put, they are two sides of the same coin.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     In response to each of the points raised by
                    the defendants in the Australian Proceedings (see <a href="#p1_41">[41]</a>–<a href="#p1_42">[42]</a> above),
                    counsel for UBS AG, Mr Hri Kumar (“Mr Kumar”), relied on
                    provisions of the contractual documents to address them. Specifically,
                    Mr Kumar submitted that by reason of the conclusive evidence clause, the
                        <em>deemed acceptance</em> of the statements and
                    confirmation (see <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a> above), and to the
                    execution of the Standstill Agreement, the defendants have either ratified the
                    alleged unauthorised transactions and/or have waived their rights to challenge
                    the Kazakh Bonds. For instance, it was Mr Kumar’s submission that
                    under the terms of the T&amp;Cs of the Risk Disclosure Statement, UBS AG is not
                    responsible for any advice or recommendations it might have given to Telesto in
                    relation to any Investments, including the Kazakh Bonds. In addition to that,
                    Telesto had agreed that UBS AG was not acting as a fiduciary and/or adviser in
                    respect of the Kazakh Bonds. The relevant T&amp;Cs can be found in the following

<p class="Judg-1">It was his submission that the presence of jurisdiction clauses in
                    favour of Singapore, <em>albeit</em> non-exclusive, in the
                    bulk of the contractual documentation clearly evinced an intention on the part
                    of the parties that any dispute arising from the Account Agreement should be
                    heard in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Mr Ng, on the other hand, submitted that
                    the focus of the defendants’ case on the lack of authority issue is based
                    on the understanding/agreement reached between Mr Betsalel and Mr Tyne
                    (whereby Mr Betsalel allegedly represented that he would procure the
                    necessary authorisation from Telesto for Pole Star such that the latter could
                    purchase non-investment grade securities) is independent of any contractual
                    documents entered into between UBS AG (Singapore) and Telesto and Mr Tyne.
                    Therefore the existence of the non-exclusive jurisdiction clauses is
                        irrelevant.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span> Mr Ng pointed out
                    that the defendants’ claim against UBS AG for misrepresentations (for
                    instance, the status of Kazakhstan banks) and for breach of fiduciary duties are
                    matters which fall outside any contractual documents entered into between the
                    parties. In fact, he submitted that <em>all</em> of the
                    defendants’ claims, in any event, fell outside the ambit of the composite
                    governing law and non-exclusive jurisdiction clause in the Account Agreement.
                    For reasons as explained in more detail in <a href="#p1_79">[79]</a>–<a href="#p1_81">[81]</a> below, these
                    issues raised by the defendants cannot justifiably be detached from its
                    contractual context.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(3)   Choice of law clauses</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     The law chosen by the parties to govern their
                    contractual relationship is also a significant factor in determining the
                    appropriate forum. In <em>Rickshaw</em>, the Court of
                    Appeal observed at [42]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">42    Choice of law issues are relevant even to a
                            question of jurisdiction. The relevance of choice of law considerations
                            in a <em>jurisdictional</em> enquiry regarding the
                            "natural forum" lies in the general proposition that where a dispute is
                            governed by a foreign <em>lex causae</em>, the
                            forum would be less adept in applying this law than the courts of the
                            jurisdiction from which the <em>lex causae</em>
                            originates. While it is true that the courts of a country (for example,
                            Singapore courts) can apply the laws of another country (for example,
                            German law) to a dispute, there will clearly be savings in time and
                            resources if a court applies the law of its own jurisdiction to the
                            substantive dispute. Hence, choice of law considerations can be a
                            significant factor in determining the appropriate forum to hear a
                            dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     In this regard, it is beyond debate that the
                    governing law of the contractual documents is Singapore law:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">clause 19.1 of the Account Agreement;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span></div>

<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">paragraph 10 of the Letter of Undertaking.
                                <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span></div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     It is noteworthy that, save for Argot’s
                    Letter of Undertaking which stipulates Victorian law as the governing law,
                        <em>none</em> of the other material contractual
                    documents provide for Australian law as the governing law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Although the Standstill Agreement did not
                    expressly stipulate any governing law, I agree with Mr Kumar that it would
                    also be governed by Singapore law. As expressed by the Court of Appeal in
                        <em>JIO Minerals</em> at [79]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">79     It is well established that a three-stage
                        approach is applied to determine the governing law of a contract (see, for
                        example, the decision of this court in <em>Pacific Recreation
                            Pte Ltd v S Y Technology Inc</em> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 491
                            ("<em>Pacific Recreation</em>") at [36]). At the first stage, the court
                        considers if the contract expressly states its governing law ("the Express
                        Law"). If the contract is silent, the court proceeds to the second stage and
                        considers whether it can infer the governing law from the intentions of the
                        parties ("the Implied Law"). If the court is unable to infer the parties'
                        intentions, it moves to the third stage and determines the law which has the
                        closest and most real connection with the contract ("the Objective
                        Law").</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It bears mentioning that the Standstill Agreement is not a standalone
                    contract. Instead, it was executed to supplement and/or modify the rights and
                    obligations of the parties under the Account Agreement. In fact, it was
                    expressly provided in cl 7 of the Standstill Agreement that “the
                    arrangements set forth [t]herein... are <em>without prejudice to
                        [UBS AG (Singapore)’s] rights under the Account Agreement, which
                        remained reserved</em>”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span> In my view, it is clear that the
                    parties intended the Standstill Agreement to be governed by the same law which
                    governs the Account Agreement, <em>ie</em>, Singapore law,
                    given the origin and purpose of the Standstill Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     In any event, it is also clear that Singapore
                    law has the closest and most real connection with the Standstill Agreement.
                    First, some of the negotiations for the Standstill Agreement took place in
                    Singapore. Secondly, the place of performance for the defendants’
                    obligations under the Standstill Agreement, such as the Share Deposit and
                    application of the cash flows generated by the Collateral towards repayment of
                    the Total Liabilities, are to take place in Singapore. Thirdly, the Guarantee,
                    which was entered into pursuant to the Standstill Agreement, was executed by
                    Mr Tyne in Singapore. Finally, the Letter of Undertaking executed by Argot
                    pursuant to the Standstill Agreement provided for the exclusive jurisdiction of
                    Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     In the face of the obvious contractual
                    connections of the claim to Singapore, it was not surprising that Mr Ng
                    conceded during the hearing of the Appeals that Singapore was clearly the
                    natural forum for the determination of UBS AG’s claims under the various
                    contractual documents against the defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(4)   Location and compellability of witnesses</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     From the perspective of UBS AG
                    (Singapore)’s contractual claim, all its witnesses to establish its claim
                    are located in Singapore. On the other hand, the principal issues raised by the
                    defendants centre on questions of fact which revolve around certain
                    conversations between Mr Tyne and Mr Betsalel/Mr Farrell. To
                    rebut the factual allegations as regards Telesto’s lack of authority to
                    purchase non-investment grade securities and the misrepresentations made in
                    relation to the status of the Kazakhstan banks (see <a href="#p1_41">[41]</a> above), all of which were purportedly made over the
                    telephone, Mr Ng submitted that the evidence of Mr Betsalel and one Ms
                    Anna McCeery (Mr Betsalel’s direct supervisor) on the following issue
                    would be critical:</p>

                            were advised of the failure to procure the necessary
                        authorities.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     Notably, Mr Betsalel has since left the
                    employment of UBS AG (Singapore) and he appears from his email to Mr Ng
                    (exhibited as SFT-3 in Mr Tyne’s affidavit filed on 31 January
                    2011) to be willing to testify in either the Australian or Singapore
                    Proceedings, although he did express reservations about filing an affidavit on
                    behalf of the defendants.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span> It is not disputed that
                    Mr Betsalel is currently resident in Singapore. As such, he is compellable
                    to testify at the trial in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     The defendants, however, submitted that the
                    issue of location and compellability of Mr Betsalel is not a weighty factor
                    in favour of Singapore because it is not disputed that the evidence of
                    Mr Betsalel may be adduced by way of deposition through judicial channels
                    under the Australian Proceedings (see the opinion of Professor Mark Aronson of
                    the University of New South Wales (exhibited as SFT-4 in Mr Tyne’s
                    affidavit filed on 31 January 2011)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     The Court of Appeal in <em>Rickshaw</em> at [19]
                    expressed the view that where the main dispute relates to questions of fact, and
                    where “the judge’s assessment of a witness’s credibility is
                    crucial, then the <b><em>location of the witnesses takes on greater
                        significance</em></b> because there would be savings of time and resources
                    if the trial is held in the forum in which the witnesses reside and where they
                    are <em>clearly compellable</em> to testify.”
                    [emphasis in italics in original, emphasis in bold italics added]. Indeed, in
                    the present case, although the evidence of Mr Betsalel may be adduced by
                    way of deposition and then presented before the Australian court, it is
                    certainly not desirable that a critical witness for a serious issue like
                    misrepresentation should not be compellable. ln addition to that, this court is
                    also of the view that Mr Betsalel’s credibility as a witness is also
                    of importance in assisting the trial judge’s determination of where the
                    truth of this matter lay. Thus, the compellability and the importance of the
                    assessment of credibility by the trial judge point to the unsuitability of a
                    witness like Mr Betsalel giving evidence by way of
                deposition.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(5)   The alleged place of tort as the natural forum</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     In spite of the patently obvious indicators
                    which inexorably point to Singapore as the natural forum to determine UBS
                    AG’s claim, Mr Ng, nonetheless sought to convince this court to
                    displace Singapore in favour of Australia as the more appropriate forum to try
                    the matter. The principal point relied on by Mr Ng in aid of the appeal
                    against the stay applications is based on certain misrepresentations made by
                    Mr Betsalel and/or Mr Farell to Mr Tyne in relation to the Kazakh
                    Bonds and that such misrepresentations were received and acted on by
                    Mr Tyne in Australia. This was admittedly the only connection which the
                    dispute has with Australia. The question then turns on whether the natural forum
                    of UBS AG’s <em>claim</em> which is (clearly and
                    distinctly) Singapore could change to Australia just because the (potential)
                        <em>defence</em> and/or <em>counterclaim</em> grounded in tort might favour Australia as the more
                    appropriate forum to determine the tort. Mr Ng answered in the affirmative
                    on the premise that since the misrepresentations were received in Australia, the
                    natural forum for the dispute is therefore Australia. Mr Ng relied on
                    authorities such as <em>Rickshaw</em>, <em>JIO Minerals</em>, <em>Cordoba Shipping Co Ltd v
                        National State Bank, Elizabeth, New Jersey (The Albaforth)</em> [1984]
                    2 Lloyd’s Rep 91 (“<em>The
                        Albaforth</em>”), <em>Diamond v Bank of London
                        &amp; Montreal Ltd</em> [1979] 1 QB 333 (“<em>Diamond”</em>) and <em>Voth v Manildra
                        Flour Mills Pty Ltd</em> (1990) 171 CLR 538
                        (“<em>Voth</em>”) for the proposition
                    that the place where the misrepresentation was <em>received</em> is the place where tort was committed which, in turn,
                    is <em>prima facie</em> the natural forum to try the
                    dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     In addition to that, Mr Ng also stressed
                    that the defendants would be able to invoke the Australian Acts<em>, ie</em>, the ASIC Act and the FTAs, in the Australian
                    Proceedings which are not available in Singapore. To assist the court in the
                    interpretation of the Australian Acts, the defendants submitted an expert
                    opinion by Mr Justin Gleeson QC (“the Gleeson Opinion” or
                    “Opinion” as the case may be). No competing opinion on the
                    Australian Acts was submitted by UBS AG. I will separately review the Australian
                    Acts with the benefit of the Gleeson Opinion to determine whether there are in
                    fact material differences between Singapore and Australia as regards the matters
                    covered by the Australian Acts and if so, where and how this factor would
                    feature in the <em>Spiliada</em> test.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     To place matters in perspective, this issue of
                    the Australian Acts only becomes relevant for consideration if Australian law is
                    the <em>lex loci delicti</em>. This would entail accepting
                    Mr Ng’s submission that by virtue of the place of receipt of the
                    alleged misrepresentation from Mr Betsalel and/or Mr Farell being
                    Australia, Australia is the natural forum of the dispute. In the event that I
                    find that Australia is not the place of the tort, the defendants would have no
                    basis to rely on the Australian Acts in aid of the stay
                application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     According to <em>Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore on Conflict of Laws</em>, at
                    paragraph 75.092, “where the tort has been committed is <em>prima facie</em> the natural forum. It will be a significant
                    albeit not decisive factor”. As a general proposition, this much is not
                    controversial. An analysis of the cases cited by Mr Ng is apposite at this
                    juncture: in both the cases of <em>The Albaforth</em> and
                        <em>Diamond</em>, the misrepresentations were received
                    in London, England. As for <em>Voth</em>, a claim for
                    negligent misstatement was made against an accountant for failing to draw
                    attention to certain tax withholding laws in Missouri, USA which resulted in the
                    imposition of a penalty. As his failure to draw attention to the requirement for
                    withholding tax which, for all practical purposes, was equivalent to a positive
                    statement that it was not payable occurred in Missouri, the place of the tort
                    was determined to be Missouri. In <em>Rickshaw</em>, the
                    Court of Appeal at [37] and [39] accepted that the place where the tort
                    occurred (<em>ie</em>, misrepresentation was received)
                    would, <em>prima facie</em>, be the natural forum of the
                    tort. However, this was only one of the factors to be taken into account in the
                    overall analysis, albeit a significant one (at [40] of <em>Rickshaw</em>). It should be
                    noted that in <em>Rickshaw</em>, in respect of the
                    respondent’s submission that the <em>lex loci
                        delicti</em> was not Singapore law as the alleged misrepresentations
                    were actionable where they had been received, <em>ie</em>,
                    either Germany or New Zealand, the Court of Appeal found that it was not clear,
                    on the pleadings, <em>where</em> the alleged
                    misrepresentations were in fact received (at [72]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(A)   The analysis on authorities which support the specific test
                of the the natural forum being the place of tort</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     Most of the authorities appear at first blush
                    to support Mr Ng’s submission that the tort of misrepresentation is
                    committed in the place where it was received. Notably, the AR accepted that the
                    tort is governed by the law where the tort was received and acted upon. However,
                    she found that the connection with Australia in the present case to be merely a
                    fortuitous one, <em>ie</em>, it just so happened that
                    Mr Tyne was in Australia when he received the misrepresentations from
                    Mr Betsalel/Mr Farrell.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     This is where my analysis differs from that of
                    the AR. I am of the view that the pertinent question turns on whether the
                    inquiry of where the tort of misrepresentation was committed ends at the point
                    of receipt. Recent decisions indicate that the place of receipt is not
                    necessarily decisive. For example, in <em>JIO
                    Minerals</em>, the misrepresentation was received in India (<em>JIO Minerals</em> at [89]) and yet the Court found that the natural forum for the
                    tort was Indonesia (<em>JIO Minerals</em> at [95]). At [91] of <em>JIO Minerals</em>, the Court of
                    Appeal stated the English position, <em>viz</em>, the
                    specific test that “the place of the tort is the place where the
                    representation is received and acted upon” [emphasis added]. Given that
                    reliance is a constituent element of the tort of misrepresentation, the place of
                    reliance (and not merely receipt) of the misrepresentation is unquestionably
                    relevant in the equation. It can be deduced from the cases cited at <a href="#p1_74">[74]</a> above that much emphasis was placed on the
                    place of receipt, as opposed to the place of reliance, because in those cases,
                    the act of receipt and reliance took place in the same jurisdiction. In my view,
                    different considerations should apply where the place of receipt and reliance
                    are different.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(B)   Misrepresentation: receipt and reliance</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     At the hearing of the Appeals, both parties
                    disagreed as to what constitutes “reliance” or “acted
                    upon”. Mr Ng submitted that reliance occurred in Australia when
                    Mr Tyne gave Mr Betsalel the green light to purchase the Kazakh Bonds.
                    Mr Kumar, on the other hand, submitted that reliance took place in
                    Singapore where the officers of UBS AG (Singapore) operated Telesto’s
                    account in Singapore to purchase the Kazakh Bonds pursuant to and in accordance
                    with Mr Tyne’s instructions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     Given that the courts have emphasised on the
                    need to look back at the <em>series of events</em> in order
                    to determine where, <em>in substance</em>, the cause of
                    action arose, where there is a possibility that the act of receipt and reliance
                    might have occurred in different jurisdictions, the court should adopt a fluid
                    analysis in finding the place of the tort. In this regard, the Court of Appeal
                    in <em>JIO Minerals</em> (at [90], [91], <a href="#p1_93">[93]</a> and [94]) indicated that the real substance test as set out in
                        <em>Distillers Co (Biochemicals) Ltd v Laura Anne
                        Thompson</em> [1971] AC 458 at 468, should be adopted where the facts
                    of the case do not fit comfortably with the more specific test (<em>ie</em>, where the misrepresentation was received) as
                    suggested in <em>The Albaforth</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     If one looks at the continuum of the events,
                    it is arguable that the place of reliance of Mr Betsalel’s alleged
                    misrepresentation was Singapore: having received the misrepresentation (in
                    Australia), Mr Tyne acted upon those misrepresentations by communicating
                    his instructions to the officers in Singapore which then manifested itself in
                    the form of his instructions being carried out by the officers of UBS AG in
                    Singapore. In other words, reliance was <em>crystallised</em> when the officers of UBS AG (Singapore) operated
                    Telesto’s account in accordance with Mr Tyne’s instruction.
                    Thus, the chain of communication which constituted the act of misrepresentation
                    was <em>completed</em> when Telesto’s account in
                    Singapore was operated pursuant to Mr Tyne’s instructions which were
                    based on Mr Betsalel’s alleged misrepresentation. This view accords
                    with business efficacy as in a scenario where UBS AG (Singapore) transacts with,
                    for and on behalf of international clients, to say that the place of the tort is
                    where their client is located (barring any fortuitous happenstance) would be to
                    hold UBS AG (Singapore) to a choice of law to which it had not agreed. It is
                    pertinent to point out that the tort in the present case did not occur without a
                    contractual context: <em>but for</em> the banking
                    relationship between UBS AG and Telesto which stemmed from the various banking
                    instruments between the two parties, Mr Betsalel and/or Mr Farrell
                    would not have spoken to Mr Tyne about the Kazakh Bonds to begin
                    with.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     In applying the substance test, I find that
                    the place of the tort for misrepresentation is Singapore and not Australia.
                    Notably, even if the tort had occurred in Australia, in my view, that is not in
                    and of itself sufficient to displace Singapore as the natural forum to determine
                    the <em>entire</em> dispute between the parties (see
                        <a href="#p1_86">[86]</a>–<a href="#p1_88">[88]</a> below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     Upon close scrutiny, one will find that the
                    issues raised by the defendants <em>cannot</em> be
                    legitimately divorced from the contractual context under which the Kazakh Bonds
                    were purchased. It is correct that the Court of Appeal in <em>Rickshaw</em> observed at [47]–[48] that in
                    the absence of bad faith, every plaintiff has the right to avail itself of the
                    cause of action that is most advantageous to it, for instance, in the light of
                    choice of law considerations. However, the situation before me is entirely
                    different from the circumstances in <em>Rickshaw</em>. In
                    the case of <em>Rickshaw</em>, the respondent commenced
                    proceedings in Germany on 8 September 2004 against the first appellant (which
                    was his former employer) for a contractual claim based on the Employment
                    Agreement for:</p>

                    November 2006, only partial payment had been made to the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     An analysis of the causes of action of both
                    parties in <em>Rickshaw</em> reveals that the
                    appellants’ claims against the respondent for conversion, the tort of
                    deceit and the breach of the equitable duty of confidentiality, which transpired
                    from a set of misrepresentations given by respondent sometime in late 2002 and
                    throughout 2003 (see [10] of <em>Rickshaw</em>), is “narrower” than the
                    respondent’s claim in Germany, <em>viz</em>, for the
                    breach of his Employment Agreement under which the appellants owed him his
                    salary and expenses between 2001 and 2003 amounting to €242, 867.40. It cannot
                    be ignored that in <em>Rickshaw</em>, the tortious claims
                    mounted by the appellants were, in a way, independent of the respondent’s
                    wrongful termination claim under the Employment Agreement. In other words, if
                    the wrongful termination claim in the German proceedings should succeed, it does
                    not follow that the tortious claims in the Singapore proceedings would
                    necessarily fail. Phrased in a different manner: the appellants’ claim in
                    Singapore did not form a <em>complete</em> defence and
                    counterclaim to the respondent’s German proceedings as there were issues
                    before the German court which the appellants’ claim in the Singapore
                    proceedings had no bearing on.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     My review of the cases relied on by the
                    defendants confirmed my understanding that the determination of the natural
                    forum in those cases typically occurred in the context where the tort was an
                        <em>independent cause of action</em> and where it did
                    not operate as a defence to a contractual claim. In <em>JIO
                        Minerals</em>, the claim was to recover investments which were induced
                    pursuant to a misrepresentation as regards the quality and quantity of iron ore
                    reserve in Indonesia. It was not raised as a defence. Likewise in <em>The Albaforth</em>, the claim was for damages for
                    misrepresentation arising from a status report provided by the defendant bank on
                    the creditworthiness of the guarantor of a charterer’s liability under a
                    charterparty. The claim was brought as an independent cause of action and was
                    not raised to resist any contractual claim by the defendant bank. Similarly, in
                        <em>Diamond</em>, the claim, which was an independent
                    claim, was for misrepresentation arising from the confirmation of the credit
                    standing of a particular broker. Finally, in <em>Voth</em>,
                    the claim for negligent misstatement against the accountant was also pursued as
                    an independent claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     Here, the situation is quite different. It was
                    accepted by Mr Ng that if the appeal in relation to the stay applications
                    should fail, the defendants would simply raise the issues in the Australian
                    Proceedings as a defence and counterclaim in the Singapore Proceedings. If UBS
                    AG successfully discharges its legal and evidential burden of proof, this would
                    mean that the defendants’ defence and counterclaim has failed. The
                    converse holds true. This merely reinforces my view that the “<em>claims</em>” raised by the defendants in Australia are
                    in truth the defences against the claim by UBS AG.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(F)   Whether the natural forum in determining a contractual claim
                can be displaced due to the tort being committed elsewhere</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     In my view, there is a very good reason why
                    the natural forum in a dispute involving a contractual claim cannot be displaced
                    simply because the defence seeks to avoid liability by raising a counterclaim or
                    set-off premised on a tort which, <em>viewed in isolation as an
                        independent claim</em>, might provide for a different natural forum.
                    Commercial entities, in particular banks and financial institutions, strive for
                    certainty of their contractual rights and obligations by choosing appropriately
                    drafted governing law or jurisdiction clauses. It is not uncommon for parties to
                    allege misrepresentation as a defence to a contractual claim. In this regard, it
                    could not have been in the contemplation of the parties that a contractual
                    claim, once properly instituted before a court of competent jurisdiction, could
                    then be displaced by a foreign court merely because the place of the alleged
                    misrepresentation (which constituted a defence to the contractual claim) was a
                    foreign country. The impracticality and irrationality of this proposition is
                    evident in the following scenario where the customer-banker relationship is
                    governed by Singapore law and is subject to Singapore jurisdiction, exclusive or
                    otherwise:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_86-p2_a"></a>(a)     In the course of the relationship,
                        several transactions were entered into based on certain representations made
                        by the bank’s officers.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_86-p2_b"></a>(b)     Assuming that three such representations were received by
                        the customer over a period of time in three different countries resulting in
                        three different transactions, taking Mr Ng’s submission to its
                        logical conclusion would mean that disputes pertaining to these three
                        transactions should be heard in the three different “natural
                        forums”. This would be a most illogical and <em>unnatural</em> outcome.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_86-p2_c"></a>(c)     If Mr Ng’s submission holds true, in order to
                        avoid such an irrational and illogical outcome, bank’s officers would
                        think twice before speaking to customers whenever they are overseas to
                        prevent the risk of any potential claim being adjudicated in a jurisdiction
                        not stipulated in the governing law/jurisdiction clauses. This would
                        seriously undermine the very essence of international
                banking.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     Although the tort of misrepresentation may be
                    a separate and distinct cause of action, in the context of the present case, it
                    can essentially be raised as a defence to the claims by UBS AG. What is before
                    me is a classic case of the defendant, <em>not the
                        plaintiff</em>, who is seeking to avoid being sued in the <em>natural forum</em> of the dispute by asserting what
                    essentially is a tortious defence in the guise of a claim in Australia. The
                    attempt to displace Singapore as the natural forum for UBS AG’s claim by
                    doing so is disingenuous. The stay principles were not developed to facilitate
                    such objectives. In my mind, this is nothing more than an instance of forum
                    shopping by the defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     By reason of my analysis of the applicable
                    legal principles and my examination of the facts which are germane to the issues
                    before me, I arrived at the firm conclusion that Singapore is not only the
                    natural forum of the dispute but is clearly and distinctly the more appropriate
                    forum for the determination of the dispute between the parties. Thus, the appeal
                    against the AR’s decision not to grant a stay of the Singapore Proceedings
                    is dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Stage two of the Spiliada test: The ends of justice</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     As I have found that Singapore is distinctly
                    and clearly the more appropriate forum to hear the dispute, on this ground
                    alone, RA 58/2010 must be dismissed. Stage two of the <em>Spiliada</em> test only comes into play if Australia is determined to
                    be the more appropriate forum.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     However, for completeness, I shall consider
                    the submissions made by both counsel on the treatment and outcome of stage two
                    of the <em>Spiliada</em> test. It was common ground between
                    the parties that, should the defendants succeed in stage one of the <em>Spiliada</em> test, the court’s focus at stage two of
                    the <em>Spiliada</em> test is to consider <em>all</em> factors as to why the ends of justice require the
                    stay of the Singapore Proceedings should nonetheless be refused. The burden, in
                    this connection, lies with UBS AG. The mere fact that UBS AG has a legitimate or
                    juridical advantage in the Singapore Proceedings will not be decisive (see
                        <em>JIO Minerals</em> at [43] where the Court of Appeal cited with approval <em>Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore on Conflicts of Law</em>
                    paragraph 75.096). It is incumbent on UBS AG to establish, by way of cogent
                    evidence, that it would be denied substantial justice if the case is heard in
                    Australia. I should add that my analysis on the differences, if any, between
                    Australian and Singapore law on the common issues has an important bearing and
                    is entirely relevant to the issue of “injustice” to the defendants
                    in the granting of the anti-suit injunction (see <a href="#p1_155">[155]</a> below).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Injustice to UBS AG as it would be subject to Australian law
                which was not part of its contractual bargain</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     In this regard, Mr Kumar submitted that
                    the burden is discharged by UBS AG because the parties have agreed for the
                    dispute to be subject to Singapore jurisdiction and governed by Singapore law.
                    Accordingly, to grant the stay of the Singapore Proceedings would be tantamount
                    to mandatorily subjecting UBS AG to the Australian Acts which was never in the
                    contemplation of the parties when they entered into the banking relationship.
                    Notably, this factor would already have been considered at stage one of the
                    inquiry and if that was held not to be sufficient (though in this case, it was)
                    to refuse the stay, then, in my view, it would not be right for this same factor
                    to be reconsidered at stage two. However, I must make clear that I am not
                    suggesting that the court is invariably precluded from considering <em>all</em> matters relevant in stage one at stage two of the
                    inquiry. Indeed, the issue of foreign law would become relevant for
                    reconsideration if there are material differences in the foreign law which may
                    apply unfairly or unjustly to the plaintiff in the Singapore Proceedings. For
                    example, in <em>Kuwait Oil Co (KSC) v Idemitsu Tankers KK (The
                        Hilda Maru)</em> [1981] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 510 at 513,
                    the English Court of Appeal refused the stay of the English proceedings in
                    favour of Kuwait because the indemnity provision in the contract might be held
                    to be invalid or unenforceable in Kuwait.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   The juridical advantage which Telesto and Mr Tyne can
                benefit from the Australian Acts</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(A)   The Gleeson Opinion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     There is clearly some overlap between the
                    legal principles governing stay applications and anti-suit injunctions. In
                    support of the appeals against the refusal to stay the Singapore Proceedings as
                    well as the anti-suit injunction (which will be dealt with in detail below),
                    Mr Ng submitted that the balance of justice is on the defendants’
                    side because they would be deprived of a legitimate juridical advantage if they
                    are precluded from pursuing their claim in the Australian Proceedings. He relied
                    on the Gleeson Opinion that highlighted several juridical advantages under the
                    Australian Acts. Insofar as the ASIC Act is concerned, the Gleeson Opinion drew
                    attention to the following advantages:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_92-p2_a"></a>(a)     Under s 12BB, where the
                        representation concerns a future matter (invoked in the present case as an
                        alternative), there are two benefits to the plaintiff. First, unless the
                        defendant had reasonable grounds for making the representation at the time
                        it was made, it will be <em>deemed</em> misleading.
                        Secondly, there is a reversal of onus of proof as the defendant will be
                        taken not to have reasonable grounds for making representation unless
                        evidence is adduced to the contrary.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_92-p2_b"></a>(b)     There is no requirement for the plaintiff to prove or
                        plead intent, negligence or carelessness in the conduct. If the conduct,
                        viewed objectively, has the character of being misleading or deceptive, or
                        likely, or is likely to mislead or deceive, it is
                    actionable.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_92-p2_c"></a>(c)     Assuming there is a contravention of s 12DA, the ASIC Act provides
                        what has been described as a “remedial
                    smorgasbord”.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_92-p2_d"></a>(d)     In relation to damages, a body of Australian law has built up as to
                        what constitutes as sufficient causation, <em>ie</em>,
                        it is enough if the impugned conduct is a cause of the relevant loss, it
                        need not be the sole or even dominant cause.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_92-p2_e"></a>(e)     Concepts of remoteness and foreseeability (which
                        might apply in a claim in tort) are not automatically translated into the
                        statute.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_92-p2_f"></a>(f)     In
                        granting orders under s 12GF, the Australian court is not constrained
                        by limitations under the general law upon a party’s right to rescind
                        for misrepresentation. It can and must consider all the circumstances,
                        including the causal link between the defendant’s conduct and the loss
                        asserted, the plaintiff’s responsibility and any other available
                        remedy (<em>Akron Securities Ltd v Illife</em> (1997)
                        41 NSWLR 353 at 366).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     Further, the Gleeson Opinion also compared the
                    ASIC/FTA regimes with that of the common law of causation, remedies for
                    negligent misrepresentation, tort of deceit and the Misrepresentation Act (Cap
                    390, 1994 Rev Ed) (“Misrepresentation Act”) in Singapore and
                    concluded that the claim under the Australian Acts is broader for the following
                    reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_93-p2_a"></a>(a)     Singapore law requires the existence
                        of a duty to act carefully in respect of the statements. The duty depends on
                        the existence of factual foreseeability, proximity and policy
                        considerations. Under the Australian Acts, the existence of a duty is not
                        required.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_93-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
                        range of actionable conduct appears to be wider under the Australian Acts. A
                        misstatement is an example of misleading conduct. Further, express
                        statements may be taken together with omissions to determine whether the
                        conduct as a whole is misleading.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_93-p2_c"></a>(c)     Once it is established that the conduct is objectively
                        misleading, there is no additional requirement to show that there was any
                        negligence in the conduct.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_93-p2_d"></a>(d)     Where the conduct consists of a future representation,
                        there is a statutory reversal of onus. Thus, the conduct is deemed
                        misleading unless the defendant proves it had reasonable grounds for the
                        conduct at the time it occurred.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_93-p2_e"></a>(e)     The range of available remedies under the Australian Acts
                        is also wider.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     The Gleeson Opinion also observed that the
                    Misrepresentation Act would not extend to Telesto, Mr Tyne and Argot as, in
                    reliance on the alleged misrepresentation, the purchase of the Kazakh Bonds was
                    entered into with a third party. In other words, there was no contract with the
                    alleged wrongdoer, UBS AG. In addition to that, s 2(1) of the
                    Misrepresentation Act speaks of “representation of fact” which
                    does not appear to extend to representations to the future and does not appear
                    to carry a reversal of onus where representations to the future are concerned.
                    Finally, the Misrepresentation Act does not provide for the same range of
                    remedies available under the Australian Acts.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(B)   No contrary opinion adduced by UBS AG and its position that
                there is no difference between the Singapore and Australian regimes</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     As UBS AG did not submit a contrary opinion on
                    the Australian Acts, my comparative analysis shall proceed on the basis that the
                    Gleeson Opinion on Australian law is unchallenged. The issue of Australian law
                    is relevant in the context of the stay applications to demonstrate that the ends
                    of justice would not be achieved if the stay of the Singapore Proceedings is
                    granted. At this stage of the inquiry, it is my task to determine whether there
                    are material or significant differences between the two regimes. Mr Kumar
                    sought to convince the court that the alleged advantages under the Australian
                    Acts were “overstated” and even “false”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span> and that in essence, there is
                    no material difference between the two regimes in the area of the law on
                    misrepresentation whereas Mr Ng advanced the divergent position by
                    emphasising on the juridical advantages under the Australian Acts which are
                    apparently unavailable under the Singapore regime. It may appear somewhat
                    incongruous for Mr Kumar to assert at stage two of the <em>Spiliada</em> test that there are no material differences. However,
                    on closer scrutiny, it is clear that Mr Kumar’s case against the stay
                    application is premised on the defendants failing at stage one which I have
                    accepted. Further, his position is entirely consistent with UBS AG’s case
                    in support of the anti-suit injunction (as explained in detail at <a href="#p1_155">[155]</a> below). This court, however, takes this
                    view: proceeding on the basis that Australia is the natural forum (a necessary
                    assumption before we reach the stage two balancing of justice exercise), if
                    there are no material differences between the two regimes (the position
                    emphatically advocated by Mr Kumar), then I can see no injustice to UBS AG
                    for the case to be heard in Australia as no prejudice of any sort would befall
                    upon it given that establishing UBS AG’s case in Singapore would not
                    be any different from that in Australia.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     Having reviewed the Gleeson Opinion and having
                    compared it with the position under Singapore Law on the same issues, I arrived
                    at the conclusion that there are no significant or material differences which
                    would make it unjust or unfair for the case to be heard in Australia. Therefore,
                    if stage one of the <em>Spiliada</em> test had been
                    satisfied (which I found to the contrary at <a href="#p1_79">[79]</a>–<a href="#p1_80">[80]</a>; <a href="#p1_86">[86]</a>–<a href="#p1_88">[88]</a> above), UBS AG would not have satisfied the burden of proof
                    under stage two. To fully appreciate the absence of material differences, it is
                    imperative to set out the defendants’ case on the alleged
                    misrepresentation:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_96-p2_a"></a>(a)     The oral advice given by UBS AG
                        (through Mr Betsalel and Mr Farrell) to Mr Tyne resulted in
                        Mr Tyne and Pole Star agreeing to reconfigure Telesto’s portfolio
                        to exclusively comprise, <em>inter alia</em>, the
                        Kazakh Bonds recommended by UBS AG in order to reduce the risk of the
                        portfolio. Subsequently, UBS AG advised Mr Tyne (and through him, Pole
                        Star and Telesto) that the Kazakh Bonds met the criteria established
                        pursuant to such recommendations.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_52" id="Ftn_52_1"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_96-p2_b"></a>(b)     UBS AG failed to inform Telesto,
                        Mr Tyne, Argot (and Pole Star) of matters relevant to Kazakh Bonds, in
                        particular the bank frauds which led to the bankruptcy of two
                        government-regulated banks in Kazakhstan, that Kazakhstan banks frequently
                        used disinformation, false accounting and bogus forecasts to routinely
                        mischaracterise sources of problems, <em>etc</em>.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_53" id="Ftn_53_1"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_96-p2_c"></a>(c)     In the light of such matters which UBS AG had
                        failed to disclose, the express representation by UBS AG as to the
                        suitability of the Kazakh Bonds were misleading or deceptive or likely to
                        mislead or deceive, and/or were representations as to future matters which
                        under the Australian Acts would be taken to be misleading or deceptive
                        absent evidence that there were reasonable grounds for making
                            them.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_54" id="Ftn_54_1"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_96-p2_d"></a>(d)     The impugned conduct of UBS AG was causative of
                        the damage to Telesto in that but for the conduct it would never have
                        purchased the Kazakh Bonds and Mr Tyne and Argot would not have
                        provided the additional securities.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_55" id="Ftn_55_1"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(C)   The alleged differences between the Singapore and Australian
                regimes</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-6" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(i)   The existence of Duty of care</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     Although no contrary opinion on Australian law
                    was adduced by UBS AG, I should make some preliminary observations of the
                    Gleeson Opinion. It provided an objective review of the salient features of the
                    Australian Acts and a comparative analysis with Singapore law on common issues
                    based on the advice received from Singapore counsel. However, the Gleeson
                    Opinion, rightly and in my view fairly, did not seek to advance the
                    defendants’ case that it would be unjust to deprive them of the juridical
                    advantages available in the Australian Proceedings or that it would be unjust
                    for the dispute to be heard in Singapore. Nor did the Gleeson Opinion conclude
                    that the differences would make a material bearing on the outcome of the dispute
                    given the specific facts of the case. For example, although there is no
                    requirement for the defendants to establish that UBS AG owed them a duty of care
                    under the Australian Acts, the Gleeson Opinion made no comment on whether this
                    was a material juridical advantage in the sense that the defendants, on the
                    facts, were bound or likely to fail in establishing such duty of care in
                    Singapore. That was correctly reserved for Mr Ng to make good in his
                    submissions in support of the Appeals. Although a claim under the Australian
                    Acts appears to be broader than under Singapore law (given the prerequisite of
                    duty of care in the latter), the language used in the defendants’
                    Australian pleadings nevertheless alluded to the existence of such duty of
                    care:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b><u>Negligent and misleading advice</u></b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">34.    At all material times, UBS [AG] held itself out as
                                <em>having specialist knowledge and
                                expertise</em>... [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It is settled law that “if someone who possessed of a
                    special skill undertakes, quite irrespective of contract, to apply that skill
                    for the assistance of another person who relies upon such skill, a duty of care
                    will arise”, per Lord Morris in <em>Hedley Byrne &amp; Co
                        Ltd v Heller &amp; Partners Ltd</em> [1964] AC 465 at 503
                    .</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     Further, based on the defendants’
                    Australian pleadings, it is clear that they are making a claim in tort against
                    UBS AG, further or in the alternative, to the claims under the Australian
                    Acts:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">42    The matters pleaded in paragraph 41 above were
                            matters that UBS [AG] <em>ought to have known given the
                                specialist expertise that it professed to possess</em>, and
                            the fact that this information was in the public domain.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">43    The failure of UBS [AG] to be aware of the matters
                            pleaded in paragraph 41 above was negligent.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">47    
              <em>But for UBS [AG]’s
                                negligent, or further or in the alternative, misleading or deceptive

                                would not have purchased the [Kazakh]

                                damage</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Thus, any argument which emphasised the significance of the Australian
                    Acts in purportedly providing the defendants an “easier task” in
                    proving its case in Australia overlooked the fact that the defendants have, at
                    the same time, mounted a claim in tort which does not come under the purview of
                    the Australian Acts. Any perceived advantage under the Australian Acts, in this
                    regard, was therefore “overstated”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-6" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(ii)   The reversal of burden of proof under the Australian acts </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     Central to Mr Ng’s submission was
                    the advantage under the Australian Acts which relates to the reversal of burden
                    of proof as regards representations to future matters. Notably, nowhere in the
                    Opinion did Mr Gleeson QC state that the representations received by
                    Mr Tyne relate to matters in the future. The emphasis that the
                    representations regarding the status and/or suitability of the Kazakh Bonds were
                    representations as to a future matter probably stemmed from the Australian
                    pleadings which have characterised them as such.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_56" id="Ftn_56_1"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span> Mr Ng’s
                    emphasis on the reversal of burden of proof point would, however, be rendered
                    moot and academic if the misrepresentation, taken at face value, relates to an
                    existing or past fact. From the defendants’ own pleaded case at [40] of the Australian pleadings, I am of the
                    view that the statements allegedly made by Mr Betsalel and Mr Farrell
                    were made in respect of present facts pertaining to the status and/or
                    suitability of the Kazakh Bonds. By way of illustration, the following are
                    examples of the alleged “representations” made by
                    Mr Betsaslel and Mr Farrell to Mr Tyne all of which, on its face,
                    relate to existing facts:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_57" id="Ftn_57_1"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    If, in the Singapore Proceedings, Telesto

                        [40] and [41] of their Australian pleadings (which is
                    their burden to do so even under the Australian Proceedings), they should be
                    able to establish a <em>prima facie</em> case that:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Mr Betsalel and/or Mr Farrell did not

<p class="Judg-1">If the defendants were able to establish sub-paras (a) or (b) above,
                    they would be able to show that there was fraudulent misrepresentation on the
                    part of Mr Betsalel and/or Mr Farrell (see <em>Derry v
                        Peek</em> [1886–1890] All ER 1 at 23). This would render the
                    view in the Gleeson Opinion that the claim under the Australian Acts is broader
                    than a claim in deceit in Singapore, on the basis that there is no requirement
                    under the Australian Acts to prove that the statement was made knowing it was
                    untrue, or with reckless indifference to its truth, moot. Further, if the
                    defendants are able to establish either one of sub-paras (a)–(c) above,
                    UBS AG would then bear the legal and evidential burden of showing the reverse in
                    order to succeed in proving its case on a balance of probabilities. In other
                    words, although there may be some differences between Australian and Singapore
                    law, they do not translate into any material difference on the specific facts on
                    this dispute. In this sense, I agree with Mr Kumar that the differences
                    were indeed “overstated” by Mr Ng.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-6" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(iii)   The applicability of the misrepresentation act to the
                present case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    Both counsel also agreed that under
                    s 2(1) of the Misrepresentation Act, the burden of proof is reversed,
                        <em>ie</em>, once the representee proves that the
                    statement was false, the burden shifts to the representor to prove that, at that
                    time of the representation up till the time of the contract, he had reasonable
                    grounds to believe that his statement was true, failing which the representor
                    would be liable for negligent misrepresentation. This is no different from the
                    position under the Australian Acts, <em>vis-à-vis</em> the
                    reversal of burden, except that both Mr Ng and the Gleeson Opinion sought
                    to distinguish the position by suggesting that the Misrepresentation Act does
                    not apply to Telesto and Mr Tyne since neither purchased the Kazakh Bonds
                    from UBS AG (Singapore). In response, Mr Kumar submitted that the
                    representation, if proved to have been made by Mr Betsalel and
                    Mr Farell, would indeed be governed by the Misrepresentation
                Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    The applicability of the Misrepresentation
                    Act is a matter of Singapore law which is entirely within the province of this
                    court. It is settled law that the Misrepresentation Act is only applicable where
                    the misrepresentation induces a contract (see <em>Trans-world
                        (Aluminium) v Cornelder China (Sing)</em> [2003]
                    3 SLR(R) 501 at [124]).
                    Notably, it is true that s 2(1) of the Misrepresentation Act will not
                    operate in a situation where Y enters into a contract with Z on reliance of some
                    misrepresentations made by X. Y will have recourse against X for damages in tort
                    but will not have the benefit of relying on s 2(1) of the Misrepresentation
                    Act because X was not party to the contract. Applying this to the facts of the
                    present case, it appears that the defendants may not be able to avail themselves
                    of the Misrepresentation Act <em>vis-à-vis</em> UBS AG in
                    relation to the purchase of Kazakh Bonds.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    However, given my earlier observations at
                        <a href="#p1_101">[101]</a> above that on the facts, UBS AG
                    would have to prove otherwise if the defendants are able to establish a
                        <em>prima facie</em> case of misrepresentation, the
                    inability of the defendants to rely on the Misrepresentation Act as regards the
                    Kazakh Bonds would, at best, be of academic interest and would not have mattered
                    ultimately. Accordingly, while I do not disagree with the Gleeson Opinion that
                    there are differences between the Australian Acts and the position under
                    Singapore law, on the facts of this case, I find that there are no differences
                    of sufficient materiality. This finding, oddly enough, actually favours the
                    defendants as regards stage two of the <em>Spiliada</em>
                    test but alas this is of no comfort to the defendants since they have failed to
                    overcome the test in stage one.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    Given my conclusion at stage one, I dismiss
                    the appeal against the AR’s decision not to grant a stay of the Singapore
                    Proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">RA 59/2010: The appeal against the anti-suit injunction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    In the context of an anti-suit injunction,
                    the principles governing the issues for the determination of the natural forum
                    are as stated in <em>Spiliada</em> (see <em>Koh Kay Yew v Inno-Pacific Holdings Ltd</em> [1997]
                    2 SLR(R) 148 (“<em>Koh Kay
                    Yew</em>”) at [18]) and to
                    that extent, there is some overlap between the considerations under the stay
                    applications and the anti-suit injunction application. There is a temptation to
                    grant an anti-suit injunction following the refusal of the stay application.
                    However, from my review of the authorities, it is clear that an anti-suit
                    injunction is not invariably granted whenever a stay is refused. A timely
                    reminder was recently articulated by the Court of Appeal in <em>John Reginald Stott Kirkham v Trane US Inc and ors</em> [2009]
                    4 SLR(R) 428 (“<em>Kirkham</em>”)

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[W]e ought to add that, had we found that Singapore was the natural forum

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    Thus, I now turn to consider the
                    defendants’ appeal in RA 59/2010, <em>viz</em>, the
                    appeal against the AR’s decision to grant an anti-suit injunction against
                    the defendants from continuing the Australian Proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">General principles</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    In <em>Kirkham</em>,
                    the Court of Appeal at [28]–[29] stated
                    the considerations which should be taken into account in determining whether an
                    anti-suit injunction should be granted:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_108-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether the defendants are amenable
                        to the jurisdiction of the Singapore court;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_108-p2_b"></a>(b)     the natural forum for the resolution of the
                        dispute between the parties;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_108-p2_c"></a>(c)     the alleged vexation or oppression to the plaintiffs if
                        the foreign proceedings are to continue;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_108-p2_d"></a>(d)     the alleged injustice to the defendants if an
                        injunction would deprive the defendants of the advantages sought in the
                        foreign proceedings; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_108-p2_e"></a>(e)     whether the institution of the foreign proceedings is in
                        breach of any agreement between the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    It is indisputable that the jurisdiction to
                    grant an anti-suit injunction, which by the nature of the order has a
                    significant impact on the foreign proceedings, is one that must be exercised
                    with caution (see <em>Societe Nationale Industrielle Aerospatiale
                        v Lee Kui Jak</em> [1987] AC 871 (“<em>Lee Kui Jak</em>”) at 892, in turn citing <em>Cohen v Rothfield</em> [1919] 1 KB 410, 413). Such an
                    injunction is, however, only granted and justified “in the clearest of
                    circumstances that the foreign proceedings are vexatious or oppressive”
                    (see <em>Koh Kay Yew</em> at [25]). Where the anti-suit injunction is sought in the face of
                    an exclusive jurisdiction clause governed by the law of the same forum, there is
                    no question of comity in such a case. It is instead an enforcement of a
                    contractual right not to be sued in another jurisdiction (see <em>Turner v Grovit</em> [2002] 1 WLR 107 (“<em>Turner v Grovit”</em>) at [27]). However, in the absence of an exclusive jurisdiction
                    clause, the principle of comity requires the court to recognise that in granting
                    an injunction, though it may operate <em>in personam</em>
                    against the defendant, it would inevitably interfere with the foreign court
                    process (see <em>Halsbury’s Law of Singapore on Conflicts
                        of Law</em> at p 120). For this reason, the law requires the
                    applicant to demonstrate that the conduct of the foreign proceedings is
                    vexatious and/or oppressive to warrant the court’s intervention in
                    granting an injunction. These considerations must always be borne in mind in
                    deciding whether to grant or refuse an anti-suit injunction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    Of the five considerations set out above, it
                    is common ground that the defendants are amenable to the jurisdiction of the
                    Singapore court. Further, my analysis in <a href="#p1_79">[79]</a>–<a href="#p1_80">[80]</a> and
                        <a href="#p1_86">[86]</a>–<a href="#p1_88">[88]</a> above in arriving at my determination that Singapore is the
                    natural forum of the dispute under RA 58/2010 would similarly apply to RA
                    59/2010. It is UBS AG’s case that the appeal against the anti-suit
                    injunction should be dismissed because the Australian Proceedings were commenced
                    in breach of the jurisdiction clauses in favour of Singapore and/or are
                    otherwise vexatious or oppressive. On the other hand, it is the
                    defendants’ case that the cornerstone of the grant of an anti-suit
                    injunction is entirely founded on wrongful breach of contract or vexatious
                    conduct in the pursuit of the Australian Proceedings and absent such breach or
                    vexatious conduct, which is the situation in the present case, the anti-suit
                    injunction should be discharged. Specifically, the defendants advanced their
                    case against the anti-suit injunction on the basis that injustice would be
                    caused to them because “they will be deprived of substantial juridical
                    advantages under Australian law”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_59" id="Ftn_59_1"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span> In
                    this regard, my finding at <a href="#p1_97">[97]</a>–<a href="#p1_101">[101]</a> above that
                    there are no differences of sufficient materiality between Australian law and
                    Singapore law on the common issues in the dispute would equally apply

                    right and is a separate inquiry distinct from the requirement of vexatious or
                    oppressive conduct. Mr Kumar first relied on paragraph 4 of the Letter of
                    Undertaking executed by Argot as stipulated below:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_60" id="Ftn_60_1"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The present Letter of Undertaking shall be <em>exclusively
                            governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of

                        well as the <em>exclusive place of jurisdiction for any

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">UBS reserves the right, however, to take legal action against [Argot]
                        before the authority of its domicile, or before any other competent
                        authority, in which event exclusively the laws of Singapore shall remain
                        applicable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    Mr Kumar, understandably, attached
                    considerable emphasis on the Letter of Undertaking since that is the only
                    relevant contractual document which expressly provided for the <em>exclusive</em> jurisdiction of the Singapore court. He
                    submitted that Argot has clearly breached the agreement by its institution of
                    the Australian Proceedings. Argot would therefore need to demonstrate
                    “strong reasons for departing from [the exclusive jurisdiction
                    clause]” to justify not staying the proceedings in the face of an
                    exclusive jurisdiction clause (see <em>Donohue v Armco Inc &amp;
                        Ors</em> [2002] All ER 749 (“<em>Donohue v Armco</em>”) at [24]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    Is Argot’s breach critical or even
                    relevant for the purposes of the anti-suit injunction? This issue must be
                    examined in the context of the entire dispute. First, it is pertinent to point
                    out that Argot is not a party to the Singapore Proceedings and therefore there
                    is no issue of parallel proceedings insofar as Argot is concerned. Secondly, I
                    accept Mr Ng’s submission that it would not be consistent for Argot
                    to bring an action in Singapore in respect of its claims which “follow as
                    a matter of law from any judgment in favour of Telesto [in Australia]”.
                    In other words, Argot’s claim hinges on the outcome of the declaratory
                    reliefs brought by the defendants in the Australian Proceedings. Therefore,
                    while Argot’s claim in the Australian Proceedings, viewed in isolation,
                    could be construed as a breach of an <em>exclusive</em>
                    jurisdiction clause, that breach would only assume significance if the
                    commencement of the Australian Proceedings by Telesto and Mr Tyne is
                    somehow wrongful and/or vexatious. In short, the fate of Argot’s claim in
                    the Australian Proceedings would have to abide the outcome of my analysis
                        <em>vis-à-vis</em> Telesto and
                Mr Tyne.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    Although the jurisdiction clauses which
                    apply to Telesto and Mr Tyne are <em>non-exclusive</em> in nature, Mr Kumar nonetheless submitted
                    that their conduct in commencing the Australian Proceedings amounts to a breach
                    of contract. He relies on <em>Sabah Shipyard (Pakistan) Ltd v
                        Islamic Republic of Pakistan</em> [2003]
                    2 Lloyd’s Rep 571 (“<em>Sabah
                        case</em>”) at [37] and
                        [43] in support of the proposition
                    that where a non-exclusive jurisdiction clause is in force, the court may infer
                    an intention not to bring or continue parallel proceedings in foreign countries
                    after an action has been commenced in the primary forum stated in the
                    non-exclusive jurisdiction. In this respect, as UBS AG had commenced S 801/2010
                    in Singapore on 15 October 2010 prior to the institution of the Australian
                    Proceedings and given that Mr Tyne had agreed to waive any objection that
                    any action commenced in Singapore was brought in an inconvenient forum (as
                    provided in para 27 of the Guarantee), Mr Kumar submitted that it
                    could not have been the intention of the parties that if proceedings were
                    commenced in Singapore, parallel proceedings could be pursued
                elsewhere.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    Mr Ng, on the other hand, advanced a
                    completely different position in relation to the nature of the non-exclusive
                    jurisdiction clauses. He maintained that since UBS AG had entered into the
                        <em>non-exclusive</em> jurisdiction clauses, which by
                    its nature contemplated the possibility of simultaneous trials in the
                    jurisdiction referred to in the clause as well as in other competent courts, it
                    therefore accepted the possibility of parallel proceedings. If trial is pursued
                    abroad, there can be no breach of any agreement and equally, it could not amount
                    to vexatious or oppressive conduct.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   The legal effect of exclusive and non-exclusive jurisdiction
                clauses</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    In the light of the diametrically opposing
                    positions adopted by Mr Kumar and Mr Ng, it is necessary to determine
                    the legal effects of exclusive and non-exclusive jurisdiction clauses in the
                    context of an application for an anti-suit injunction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    The observation of the House of Lords in
                        <em>Turner v Grovit</em> at [27] on the legal effects of exclusive and
                    non-exclusive jurisdiction clauses in the context of an application for an
                    anti-suit injunction is instructive:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[W]here the applicant is relying upon a contractual right not to be sued
                        in the foreign country (say because of an <em>exclusive
                            jurisdiction clause</em> or an arbitration clause), then absent
                        some special circumstances, he has by reason of his contract a legitimate
                        interest in enforcing that right against the other party of the contract.
                        But where he is relying upon conduct of the other person which is
                        unconscionable for some non-contractual reason, [the] law requires that the
                        legitimate interest must be the existence of proceedings in this country
                        which need to be protected by the grant of [an anti-suit injunction].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    It is important to understand the nature of
                    the contractual bargain in a non-exclusive jurisdiction clause. By such a
                    clause, the parties simply agree to submit to that jurisdiction, which for ease
                    of reference shall be referred to as the “primary forum”. They
                    also implicitly accept the “primary forum” as appropriate (see
                        <em>British Aerospace v Dee Howard &amp; Co</em> [1993]

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    An overview of the cases involving exclusive
                    and/or non-exclusive jurisdiction clauses shows that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_119-p2_a"></a>(a)     The starting point for considering
                        the effect of a non-exclusive jurisdiction clause must be the wording of the
                        clause. In terms of contract law, a party could not ordinarily be said to be
                        in breach of a contract containing a non-exclusive jurisdiction clause
                        merely by pursuing proceedings in an alternative jurisdiction (see <em>Deutsche Bank AG and anor v Highland Crusader Offshore Partners
                            LP and ors</em> [2010] 1 WLR 1023 (“<em>Deutsche Bank”</em>) at [105]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_119-p2_b"></a>(b)     There is no presumption that multiplicity of
                        proceedings is vexatious (see <em>Lee Kui Jak</em> at
                        894). In the case of non-exclusive jurisdiction clauses, the burden is on
                        the applicant for the anti-suit injunction to show that the foreign
                        proceedings are “vexatious or oppressive for some reason independent
                        of the mere presence of the non-exclusive [jurisdiction] clause” (see
                        Thomas Raphael<em>, The Anti-Suit Injunction</em>
                        (Oxford University Press, 2008) (“<em>Raphael</em>”) at para 9.12).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_119-p2_c"></a>(c)     In the case of a non-exclusive
                        jurisdiction clause, either party is <em>prima
                            facie</em> entitled to bring proceedings in a court of competent
                        jurisdiction. Duplication of litigation through parallel proceedings is
                        undesirable, but it is an inherent risk where the parties elect to adopt a
                        non-exclusive jurisdiction clause (<em>Deutsche
                            Bank</em> at [107]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_119-p2_d"></a>(d)     An exclusive jurisdiction clause creates a contractual right not to
                        be sued elsewhere, (see <em>Turner v Grovit</em> at
                            [27]), but even then, the court
                        has discretion whether to enforce or even refuse it (see <em>Donohue v Armco</em> at [27]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    In view of the foregoing, it appears that
                    Telesto and Mr Tyne cannot be said to have acted <em>in
                        breach</em> of their obligations under the <em>non-exclusive</em> jurisdiction clauses. To hold otherwise would blur
                    the distinction between exclusive jurisdiction clauses and non-exclusive
                    jurisdiction clauses and render any such distinction illusionary or redundant.
                    In support of this view is <em>Raphael’s</em>
                    observation at para 9.10 (cited in <em>Deutsche
                        Bank</em> at [85]) that to
                    interpret a non-exclusive jurisdiction clause as leading to the conclusion that
                    parties could not have intended that proceedings be commenced in a forum other
                    than the primary forum “would mean that non-exclusive [jurisdiction]
                    clauses could be converted into something close to an exclusive jurisdiction
                    clause by the simple expedient of commencing parallel proceedings in [the
                    primary forum] soon after the commencement of the foreign
                    proceedings”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    My reading of the <em>Sabah</em> case does not support Mr Kumar’s submission
                    that, in the context of the existence of a non-exclusive jurisdiction clause,
                    the commencement of proceedings in a competent court of jurisdiction other than
                    the primary forum could <em>per se</em> constitute a breach
                    of contract. In this connection, an examination of the contextual background of
                    the <em>Sabah</em> case is necessary in order to better
                    understand the decisions of both the English High Court and English Court of
                    Appeal in granting an anti-suit injunction against the continuation of the
                    foreign proceedings in spite of the use of a non-exclusive jurisdiction clause
                    in the contractual documents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    In that case, Sabah Shipyard (Pakistan) Pte
                    Ltd (“Sabah Shipyard”) was incorporated in Pakistan for the
                        <em>sole</em> purpose of entering into agreements with
                    the Government of Pakistan (“the GOP”) and a state-owned
                    corporation, KESC, relating to the design, construction and maintenance of
                    electric generation facility at Karachi. The agreements included an
                    implementation agreement (between Sabah Shipyard and the GOP) and a power
                    purchase agreement (between Sabah Shipyard and KESC). The GOP entered into a
                    guarantee in favour of Sabah Shipyard under which it guaranteed the obligations
                    of KESC under the power purchase agreement. Clause 1.91 of the guarantee
                    provided that each party consented to the jurisdiction of the courts of England
                    for any action filed by the other party under the agreement and provided for
                    enforcement in England, subject to immaterial exceptions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    Disputes arose between the parties and an
                    arbitration was held in Singapore which resulted in an award in Sabah
                    Shipyard’s favour in the sum of US$6.84m. Sabah Shipyard made a demand on
                    the GOP under its guarantee. In response, the GOP issued proceedings in
                    Islamabad for:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">a declaration that the award had been obtained by
                            fraud and was not binding on the GOP; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b) </div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">a declaration that the guarantee was therefore
                            not enforceable.</div>
<p class="Judg-1">In addition to that, the GOP also obtained an <em>ex
                        parte</em> injunction against Sabah Shipyard to prevent it from making
                    any demand on the guarantee.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    In the light of this development, Sabah
                    Shipyard issued proceedings against the GOP in England and sought an anti-suit
                    injunction against the Islamabad proceedings. David Steel J granted the
                    anti-suit injunction and his decision was upheld by the English Court of
                    Appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    In my view, the <em>Sabah</em> case does not stand for the <em>general</em> proposition that where a non-exclusive jurisdiction
                    clause applies, the court may infer an intention on the part of the contracting
                    parties not to bring or continue parallel proceedings in foreign countries after
                    an action has been commenced in the primary forum stated in the non-exclusive
                    jurisdiction clause. Notably, caution has been expressed in interpreting the
                        <em>Sabah</em> case in the manner as suggested by
                    Mr Kumar. Toulson LJ in <em>Deutsche Bank</em> at
                        [112] opined that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The <em>Sabah</em> case [2003] 2 Lloyd’s Rep
                        571 has given rise to a good deal of debate as to its interpretation. I
                        agree with Andrew Smith J in <em>Evialis v SIAT</em>
                        [2003] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 377 and <em>Raphael, The Anti-Suit
                            Injunction</em> that <em>the decision is best
                            understood to have been based on the finding that the GOP acted in
                            breach of its contract with Sabah by bringing proceedings in Islamabad
                            in which it claimed an injunction to prevent Sabah from enforcing its
                            rights against GOP in England pursuant to the English non-exclusive
                            jurisdiction clause</em>. (This view is supported by Walker
                        LJ’s statement in the <em>Sabah</em> case [2003]
                        2 Lloyd’s Rep 571, para 44 that the injunction “is being
                        granted by the court to which both parties have agreed to give effect to the
                        bargain they made”.) If I am wrong, and the injunction was granted
                        not in support of a legal right but <em>under the
                            court’s power to protect Sabah from vexatious and oppressive
                            litigation, for reasons already discussed the conduct of the GOP was
                            certainly vexatious and oppressive on the particular facts of the
                            case</em>. On either approach, the case needs to be seen in the
                        context of its own particular facts. It would be wrong in my view to
                        extrapolate from it a rule of law that the prosecution of foreign litigation
                        in parallel with litigation in England pursuant to a non-exclusive
                        jurisdiction clause is per se vexatious or oppressive….</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    Similar sentiments were expressed by
                        <em>Raphael</em> at paragraph 9.10 where he opined
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Sabah should be read as specific to the unusual facts of the case, where
                        the foreign proceedings included a claim for an anti-suit injunction to
                        restrain proceedings in the chosen forum.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The learned authors of <em>Cheshire, North &amp;
                        Fawcett’s Private International Law</em>, (Oxford University
                    Press, 14th Ed) (“<em>Cheshire”)</em> at
                    p 474 echoed the same:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where the agreement provides for the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the
                        English courts there is no breach of agreement in bringing proceedings
                        abroad and therefore an injunction will not be granted on the basis of
                        breach of an agreement. However, <em>if one party (A) by way
                            of a pre-emptive strike seeks an injunction abroad whereby the other
                            party (B) will be permanently restrained from making any demand under a
                            contract (containing a non-exclusive English jurisdiction clause) in the
                            hope of preventing B from starting proceedings in England, this is a
                            breach of contract and vexatious. An injunction restraining A from
                            continuing the proceedings abroad will then be granted on the basis of
                            vexation or oppression</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    It is therefore clear that the general
                    consensus in rationalising the <em>Sabah case</em> is that
                    the anti-suit injunction in respect of the Islamabad proceedings was granted on
                    grounds that it was vexatious and oppressive as opposed to the drawing of an
                    inference that parties had intended that no parallel proceedings be commenced
                    upon agreeing to a non-exclusive jurisdiction clause. Furthermore, the breach of
                    contract in the <em>Sabah case</em> was not the breach of
                    the non-exclusive jurisdiction clause but rather the breach of contract in
                    commencing proceedings to <em>prevent</em> Sabah Shipyard
                    from enforcing its rights under the contract. Indeed, where parties seek to
                    eliminate the possibility of parallel proceedings in different jurisdictions, an
                        <em>exclusive jurisdiction clause</em> could be
                    employed to give effect to such an intention. This is especially so in the
                    present case since different jurisdiction clauses are applicable to different
                    contracts. Clearly the parties by employing different types of clauses to govern
                    different contracts intended for different consequences to arise. In the
                    circumstances, I find that the institution of the Australian Proceedings was not
                    in breach of any contractual obligation other than Argot’s Letter of
                    Undertaking which I have separately dealt with at <a href="#p1_113">[113]</a> above. As such, to justify the continuation of the
                    anti-suit injunction, the burden is on UBS AG to prove vexatious and/or
                    oppressive conduct <em>independent</em> of the
                    non-exclusive jurisdiction clauses.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether the Australian Proceedings are vexatious and/or
                oppressive</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    This is a separate and independent basis for
                    an anti-suit injunction and should not be conflated with the other basis,
                        <em>viz</em>, a breach of an exclusive jurisdiction
                    clause, which has been dealt with above. The power to order an anti-suit
                    injunction, independent of a breach of an exclusive jurisdiction clause, is
                    dependent upon there being wrongful conduct of the party to be restrained of
                    which the applicant is entitled to complain and has a legitimate interest in
                    seeking to prevent (see <em>Turner v Grovit</em> at
                        [24]). The court should look at all
                    circumstances of the case to determine whether the foreign proceedings are
                    vexatious or oppressive (see <em>Koh Kay Yew</em> at
                        [19]). As was observed in <em>Regalindo Resources Pte Ltd v Seatrek Trans Pte Ltd</em>
                    [2008] 3 SLR(R) 930 (“<em>Regalindo</em>”) at [18]
                    (in turn citing <em>Dicey Morris &amp; Collins on the Conflict of
                        Laws</em> vol 1 (Lawrence Collins gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell,

                    Morris</em>”) at paragraph 12-073)), vexation or oppression may be
                    indicated from:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[a] subjecting the other party to oppressive procedures in the
                        foreign court, especially a party with no substantial connection with the

                        the institutions of proceedings which are bound to fail; [c] extreme
                        inconvenience caused by the foreign proceedings; [d] multiplicity of
                        actions, especially where the foreign action might spawn further
                        consequential litigation which might not be reconcilable with the foreign
                        decision; [e] bringing proceedings which interfere with or undermine
                        the control of the [court of the primary forum] of its own process;

                        for no good reason in a court which will disregard an express choice of [law
                        of the primary forum].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    Mr Kumar’s submitted that it was
                    clear that Argot has fallen foul of limb (g) above, given that it had entered
                    into an exclusive jurisdiction clause in the Letter of Undertaking. For reasons
                    as explained at <a href="#p1_113">[113]</a> above, this
                    “breach” is not relevant in the ultimate analysis. Mr Ng, on
                    the other hand, characterised it as a “secondary
                breach”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    Mr Kumar further submitted that the
                    defendants’ institution of the Australian Proceedings was vexatious as it
                    amounts to a subversion of the express choice of law by the parties with the
                    substitution of the Australian Acts. The commencement of the Australian
                    Proceedings which sought to apply a law <em>different</em>
                    from the parties’ express choice of law was described as “plainly
                    vexatious” as by doing so, Australian law, which UBS AG never agreed to,
                    will be applied to the dispute. <em>Cadre SA v Astra Asigurari
                        SA</em> [2006] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 560 (“<em>Cadre</em>”) (at [7] and [18]) was cited
                    in aid of this argument. In addition, it was submitted that as the defendants
                    have refused to identify the Australian remedies which they are purportedly
                    seeking which cannot be granted by the Singapore courts, such conduct was
                    especially vexatious when viewed against their actual prayers in the Australian
                    originating process which relate to damages or declaration, <em>ie</em>, remedies which can readily be obtained in
                Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    Mr Kumar also highlighted the fact that
                    as most of the witnesses and documents are located in Singapore, the imposition
                    to require UBS AG to send its employees (from Singapore) and the documents (from
                    Singapore and some from Jersey) to Australia for the proceedings, while not
                    entirely impossible, would be vexatious or oppressive. This is especially so
                    when there are not many witnesses and in fact no documents in Australia.
                    However, the residence of the parties and location of the witnesses or documents
                    are typically treated as a neutral factor or at least not a weighty factor in
                    the balancing exercise (see <em>Kirkham</em> at [37], [38] and [40]). As noted
                    in [38] of <em>Kirkham</em>, “the location of witnesses is only really
                    significant in relation to third party witnesses <em>who are not
                        in the employ of the parties</em> as it could give rise to issues of
                    compellability” [emphasis added]. In this regard, my observations on the
                    compellability of Mr Betsalel at <a href="#p1_70">[70]</a>
                    above would apply with equal force in this analysis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132    The defendants’ institution of the
                    Australian Proceedings was also described as an attempt at forum shopping. It
                    was urged that such a cynical motive is unconscionable and an anti-suit
                    injunction should be granted (see <em>Cadre</em> at
                        [18]). Mr Kumar submitted that
                    based on the chronology of events, it is apparent that Telesto and Mr Tyne
                    were well aware that UBS AG was commencing or had commenced the Singapore
                    Proceedings when they instituted the Australian Proceedings on 2 November
                    2010. Further, the defendants were also fully aware that the issues in the
                    Australian Proceedings could be raised as a defence or counterclaim in the
                    Singapore Proceedings (see Mr Tyne’s 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    Affidavit at [10]).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_61" id="Ftn_61_1"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Timing of the commencement of the Australian
                Proceedings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a>133    Was the Australian Proceedings commenced to
                    vex or oppress UBS AG? In terms of the <em>timing</em> of
                    the commencement of the Australian Proceedings, I accept Mr Ng’s
                    submission (which is supported by the Eakin letter dated 8 October 2010
                    (see <a href="#p1_33">[33]</a> above)) that the legal action
                    against UBS AG was already in the contemplation of Telesto, at the very least,
                    from as early as 8 October 2010. Hence, unlike the AR, I will be slow to
                    impute any ulterior motive of “getting ahead” before the Singapore
                    Proceedings given that Telesto had evinced its stance even prior to the
                    commencement of the Singapore Proceedings. I would also add that, in the
                    ordinary scheme of things, little weight should be assigned to the order in
                    which the claims were brought in the competing jurisdictions since to do so
                    would be to encourage parties to rush to fire the first shot as was aptly
                    pointed out by Bingham LJ in <em>El Du Pont de Nemours v
                        Agnew</em> [1987] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 585; see also
                        <em>Deutsche Bank</em> at [118]. Similar sentiments were expressed by the Court of Appeal
                    in <em>Rickshaw</em> at [87]–[88] though I
                    should add that it was said in the context where there is no natural forum
                    unlike the present case. Moreover, no argument was mounted to the effect that
                    Mr Tyne and/or Argot, by virtue of the former’s nationality and/or
                    the latter’s place of incorporation, were brought into the picture in
                    order to confer jurisdiction on the Australian court as was found to be the case
                    in <em>Turner v Grovit</em> (at [17]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   The possibility of conflicting judgments in the context of
                non-exclusive jurisdiction clauses</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a>134    It bears emphasis that the question whether
                    an anti-suit injunction should be granted when proceedings are brought in two
                    jurisdictions with the possibility of conflicting judgments has recently been
                    answered in the negative. The fact that there are such concurrent proceedings
                    does not in itself means that the conduct of either action is vexatious or
                    oppressive or an abuse of court, nor does that in itself justify the grant of an
                    injunction (see <em>Lee Kui Jak</em> at 894; <em>Credit Suisse First Boston (Europe) Ltd v MLC (Bermuda)
                        Ltd</em> [1999] CLC 579 at 596; <em>Airbus Industrie
                        GIE v Patel</em> [1998] CLC 702 (“<em>Patel</em>”) at 708–709). In <em>Patel</em>, Lord Goff noted at 709 that since, as between common law
                    jurisdictions, there was no international treaty governing jurisdiction issues,
                    the basic principle was that each jurisdiction is independent and there is
                        “<em>no embargo on concurrent proceedings in the same
                        matter in more than one jurisdiction</em>” [emphasis
                    added].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_135"></a>135    In other words, the possibility of parallel
                    proceedings and risks of conflicting judgments do not, by themselves, warrant
                    the grant of an anti-suit injunction. This is especially so where the parties
                    have entered into an agreement which provides for a non-exclusive jurisdiction
                    clause, out of which parallel proceedings flows as a natural consequence from
                    it. Where it is contemplated that proceedings may be brought in more than one
                    jurisdiction, it cannot constitute a breach of contract nor vexatious and
                    oppressive conduct (see <em>Royal Bank of Canada v Cooperatieve
                        Centrale Raifeissen-Boerenleenbank BA</em> [2004] 1 CLC 170
                        (“<em>Royal Bank of Canada”</em>) at
                    205). In this connection, with the benefit of time for a more detailed analysis,
                    I disagree with the AR’s holding that the “presence of a
                    non-exclusive jurisdiction clause is, in my view, no excuse for parallel
                    proceedings to continue. To allow this would be contrary to the spirit of the
                    jurisdiction clauses and would be oppressive to the
                plaintiff.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_136"></a>136    Mr Ng relied on two decisions with
                    facts seemingly similar to the present case to demonstrate that the Australian
                    Proceedings are not vexatious or oppressive. The case of <em>Royal Bank of Canada</em> involved the Royal Bank of Canada
                    (“RBC”), a Canadian bank having its principal place of business in
                    Toronto, and the defendant, Rabobank, an institution organised under the laws of
                    Netherlands having its principal place of business in Utrecht. Both parties have
                    business in London and New York. RBC’s claim was based on a swap agreement
                    recorded in a Total Return Swap Confirmation with Rabobank. Pursuant to the swap
                    agreement, Rabobank was liable to pay RBC $517m plus $6m interest as on
                    28 June 2002. The swap agreement formed part of and was subject to an
                    International Swap Dealers Association Master Agreement which was expressly
                    governed by English Law and included a non-exclusive jurisdiction clause in
                    favour of England (see <a href="#p1_139">[139]</a>
                below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137"></a>137    On 21 June 2002, Rabobank gave notice that
                    it would not pay the sum due under the swap agreement and commenced proceedings
                    in New York claiming rescission of the agreement and damages in the alternative
                    on grounds of fraudulent misrepresentation. RBC then commenced English
                    proceedings on 24 June 2002 which was the next working day after
                    21 June 2002. It is significant to note that the claims and cross-claims in
                    the English and New York proceedings essentially <em>mirrored</em> each other.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a>138    As the New York proceedings was likely to go
                    to trial before the English action (12 January 2004 and 8 March 2004
                    respectively), RBC applied for an anti-suit injunction. RBC agreed with Rabobank
                    that if its application for an anti-suit injunction should fail, the English
                    proceedings should be stayed pending outcome of the New York suit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a>139    The Master Agreement was expressly governed
                    by and to be construed in accordance with English law and included the following
                    provision:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">With respect to any suit action or proceedings relating to the Agreement

                        Proceedings have been brought in an inconvenient forum and further waives
                        the right to object with respect to such Proceedings that such court does
                        not have any jurisdiction over such party.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Nothing in this Agreement precludes either party from
                            bringing Proceedings in any other jurisdiction ... nor will the bringing

                            bringing of Proceedings in any other jurisdiction</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_140"></a>140    RBC’s case on appeal was solely
                    premised on the argument that by agreeing to a non-exclusive jurisdiction
                    clause, there is an <em>implied term</em> that either party
                    must be entitled to insist that the trial should take place first in the
                    “primary forum”, <em>ie</em>, where the
                    English court was stipulated as the “primary forum”, in any
                    conflict as to the place of trial between the forum and any other forum, the
                    English court should take precedence (see <em>Royal Bank of
                        Canada</em> at 172). Rejecting the appropriateness to import such an
                    implied term, Evans- Lombe J, delivering the decision of the English Court
                    of Appeal, held (at 198) that the clause in the Master Agreement was a
                    non-exclusive jurisdiction clause which, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, gave <em>express sanction</em> to the
                    determination of those proceedings in a court other than the English court and
                    also expressly contemplated that proceedings to determine those issues <em>might run parallel and simultaneously in a number of
                        jurisdictions</em> in addition to that of the English court.
                    Evans-Lombe J further noted (also at 198) that the clause did not expressly
                    deal with parallel proceedings and/or the possibility of simultaneous trials in
                    different jurisdictions where the issues to be tried were substantially the
                    same.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_141"></a>141    On the facts, the English Court of Appeal
                    held that Rabobank’s pursuit of the New York proceedings, <em>being permitted by the terms of agreement between the
                        parties</em>, could not be construed as vexatious or oppressive or a
                    breach of contract by Rabobank. The Court of Appeal opined that it was possible
                    that a foreign suit, properly commenced and pursued at the outset, might become
                    oppressive during its course. However, it would require stronger circumstances
                    before a foreign suit which had been fully and properly contested up to a point
                    near trial could be characterised by an English court as having become
                    oppressive, or as having been conducted oppressively by the foreign claimant. In
                    the light of this, the English Court of Appeal upheld the decision of the judge
                    at first instance not to grant an anti-suit injunction against Rabobank. In
                    arriving at this decision, it is important to bear in mind that parties did not
                    appeal against the finding of the judge at first instance that London, England
                    was not the more natural or appropriate forum than New York for the
                    determination of the dispute (<em>Royal Bank of Canada</em>
                    at 201). This is quite different from the present case given my finding that
                    Singapore is the natural forum to determine the dispute, the significance of
                    which I will elaborate below at <a href="#p1_153">[153]</a> and
                        <a href="#p1_156">[156]</a>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_142"></a>142    In <em>Deutsche
                        Bank</em>, the first claimant was a German bank with its principal
                    place of business in Frankfurt and an office in London while the second claimant
                    was an associated company registered in the US with its principal place of
                    business in New York. The first to third defendants were a group of companies
                    operating as major US hedge funds. It was accepted that all the investment
                    decisions relating to the defendants were made in Dallas, Texas.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_143"></a>143    The defendants entered an agreement to buy
                    from the claimants tranches of asset-backed collaterised loan obligations. These
                    agreements took the form of three global master purchase agreements which, in
                    turn, were a standard form of international finance agreement. The agreements
                    provided for English governing law and the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the
                    English courts. Paragraph 17 of the Global Master Repurchase Agreement
                    (“GMRA”) entered into by parties stipulated as below:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Governing law</b>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
                        laws of England. Buyer and seller hereby irrevocably submit for all purposes
                        of or in connection with this agreement and each transaction to the
                        jurisdiction of the courts of England.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Nothing in this paragraph shall limit the right of any

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_144"></a>144    The claimants subsequently made margin calls
                    on the defendants which they did not pay whereupon the claimants served default
                    and valuation notices. On 16 October 2008, the defendants filed proceedings
                    against the claimants in Texas alleging, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, that the claimants had induced them, through one
                    Mr Newell, to buy securities by fraudulent or negligent misrepresentation.
                    The amended complaint alleged ten causes of action against the claimants (in the
                    English action) and one included the violation of the Texas Securities Act (by
                    making false and misleading misrepresentations and omissions of material facts
                    concerning the securities).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_145"></a>145    On 7 November 2008, the claimants issued
                    proceedings in the English High Court/Commercial Court for amounts due under the
                    default valuation notices (for US$70m plus interest) and applied for an
                    anti-suit injunction preventing the defendants from continuing the Texas
                    proceedings. The judge at first instance granted the anti-suit injunction and
                    held that, absent foreseeable change since the contractual jurisdiction had been
                    agreed, a party would ordinarily act vexatiously or oppressively in pursuing
                    proceedings in a non-contractual jurisdiction in parallel with proceedings in
                    the contractual jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_146"></a>146    The English Court of Appeal, however,
                    disagreed and allowed the defendant’s appeal as it found that in
                    contracting for a non-exclusive jurisdiction clause which did not clearly
                    indicate whether prior or subsequent parallel proceedings in a non-selected
                    forum were permitted or prohibited, parties would usually be taken to have
                    anticipated and accepted the possibility of parallel proceedings (citing
                        <em>Raphael</em> at paragraph 9.12 with approval at
                        [105]). It further held at
                        [106] that there is <em>no general presumption</em> that proceedings brought in the
                    non-contractual forum were vexatious or oppressive unless strong grounds, which
                    had been unforeseeable at the time the contractual jurisdiction was agreed or
                    were otherwise exceptional, could be demonstrated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_147"></a>147    Mr Ng drew my attention to the fact
                    that <em>Royal Bank of Canada</em> and <em>Deutsche Bank</em> both bore an important similarity with the present
                    case, <em>ie</em>, they all involve a claim under contract
                    in one jurisdiction and a claim for the tort of misrepresentation in the other.
                    Furthermore, the other interesting feature shared by these two cases with the
                    present Appeals is that the claim in tort can essentially be mounted as a
                    defence and counterclaim against the contractual claim. The mirroring effect of
                    these proceedings would inevitably lead to the possibility of conflicting
                    judgments by the two different jurisdictions on what is essentially the same
                    subject matter. Yet, the anti-suit injunction was not ordered in either
                        <em>Royal Bank of Canada</em> or <em>Deutsche Bank</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_148"></a>148    Mr Kumar expectedly sought to
                    distinguish the two key decisions relied on by Mr Ng. First, he highlighted
                    the fact that in both <em>Royal Bank of Canada</em> and
                        <em>Deutsche Bank</em>, the non-exclusive jurisdiction
                    clauses, unlike the present case, specifically provided that the parties were
                    not precluded from commencing legal proceedings in any other court of competent
                    jurisdiction. Although it is correct that the courts did observe that the
                    clauses expressly contemplated the pursuit of parallel proceedings, there is
                    nothing in the judgments to suggest that the outcome would be any different if
                    it were otherwise. In my view, the pivotal consideration is whether the
                    jurisdiction clause in question is exclusive or non-exclusive. The mere fact
                    that the non-exclusive jurisdiction clauses in the present case did not
                    specifically provide that the defendants are not precluded from commencing
                    proceedings in another competent court does not make it any less non-exclusive.
                    Once the clause is non-exclusive, certain consequences would flow from the
                    parties’ choice in the same way that an exclusive jurisdiction clause
                    would render the institution of foreign proceedings a breach of contract. Both
                    parties must be held to their contractual bargain, no less, no more. In the
                    instant case, it is common ground between the parties that the jurisdiction
                    clauses in the Account Agreement and the Guarantee are <em>non-exclusive</em> and the contractual bargain contained therein does
                    not bar the institution of foreign proceedings. The submission made in <em>Royal Bank of Canada</em> and <em>Deutsche
                        Bank</em> was premised on the propriety to import an implied term (see
                    the “primary forum” argument as illustrated at <a href="#p1_140">[140]</a> above). I can see no commercial reason or
                    justification to do so. If it was the parties’ intention that litigation
                    ought to be fought before one court of competent jurisdiction and no other, the
                    clause can simply be drafted as an exclusive jurisdiction clause rather than be
                    implied as a term of contract <em>via</em> a convoluted
                    legal fiction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_149"></a>149    Secondly, Mr Kumar correctly identified
                    that in <em>Deutsche Bank</em>, save for English law being
                    stipulated as the governing law and the provision of the non-exclusive English
                    jurisdiction clause, there was little connection between England and the matter
                    in dispute. He submitted that the same could not be said of the present case
                    where there are ample connecting factors between Singapore and the matter in
                    dispute. In addition to that, unlike the present case, there were also ample
                    connections between Dallas, Texas and the dispute. This together with the
                    court’s observation that the dispute bore little connections with England
                    (at [120] of <em>Deutsche Bank</em>) effectively meant that England was found not to
                    be the natural forum. Similarly, the anti-suit injunction was refused in
                        <em>Royal Bank of Canada</em> in circumstances when
                    England was likewise not the natural forum (at 201). Given the courts’
                    determination that England was not the natural forum in those two cases, it was
                    not surprising that the courts did not find the institution of the foreign
                    proceedings to be vexatious or oppressive.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_150"></a>150    Would the outcome be any different if the
                    court considering the anti-suit injunction is the natural forum as in the
                    present case? From my reading of the relevant cases, in such circumstances, it
                    appears to me that if the plaintiff is able to show that the defendants would
                    not suffer injustice if the foreign proceedings are restrained, then an
                    anti-suit injunction should be granted (see <a href="#p1_153">[153]</a>–<a href="#p1_154">[154]</a>
                    below).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The balance of justice </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_151"></a>151    My analysis thus far may be summarised as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_151-p2_a"></a>(a)     The commencement of the Australian
                        Proceedings is not in breach of contract (apart from Argot which I have
                        separately dealt with in <a href="#p1_113">[113]</a>
                        above).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_151-p2_b"></a>(b)     There
                        is no presumption that multiplicity of proceedings is vexatious. The
                        possibility of conflicting decisions in the context of non-exclusive
                        jurisdiction clauses, while undesirable is not in and of itself vexatious or
                        oppressive.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_151-p2_c"></a>(c)     The claims and issues in both proceedings are essentially similar though
                        not identical.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_151-p2_d"></a>(d)     Although there might be some differences between Australian law and
                        Singapore law on the common issues, the differences are “<em>overstated</em>” and are not of sufficient
                        materiality to displace the natural forum, Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_152"></a>152    It is quite clear that Mr Ng relied
                    heavily on the perceived significant differences under the Australian Acts in
                    his quest to highlight the juridical advantages so as to impress upon the court
                    that the defendants would suffer injustice if the anti-suit injunction is not
                    discharged. He placed considerable weight on several decisions in aid of his
                    proposition that the court should discharge the anti-suit injunction:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">if the court is satisfied that “there was
                            good reason behind its institution of the foreign legal process”
                            (see <em>Regalindo</em> at [22]);</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">where “there are substantial reasons to
                            induce him to bring the two actions” (see <em>Peruvian Guano Company v Bockwoldt</em> [1883]
                            23 Ch D 225 at 230); and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the court will not grant an injunction, if by
                            doing so, “it will deprive the plaintiff of advantages in the
                            foreign forum of which it would be unjust to deprive him” (see
                                <em>Societe Aerospatiale</em> at
                        896).</div>
<p class="Judg-1">Clearly for the cases to be relevant in the present appeal, it is
                    imperative for the defendants to demonstrate that there are substantial
                    differences between the Australian and Singapore regimes under which the former
                    confers on them juridical advantages not available in the latter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_153"></a>153    By the same token, Mr Ng also relied on
                        <em>Lee Kui Jak</em> at 895 and 896 to illustrate the
                    point that to justify the grant of an injunction, the [applicant] must show
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… (a) the English court is the natural forum
                            for the trial of the action, to whose jurisdiction the parties are
                            amenable; <em>and </em>(b) that justice does
                            not require that the action should nevertheless be allowed to proceed in
                            the foreign court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[(c) more specifically,] the court will not grant an injunction if, by
                        doing so, it will deprive the [respondent] of advantages in the foreign
                        forum of which it would be unjust to deprive him. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1">(see also <em>Bank of America National Trust &amp;
                        Savings Association v Djoni Widjaya</em> [1994] 2 SLR(R) 898
                    at [15]; <em>Seismic
                        Shipping Inc and anor v Total E&amp;P UK PLC</em>
                    [2005] EWCA Civ 359 at [44]–[46] and
                        <em>Royal Bank of Canada</em> at 209). The rationale
                    for this proposition is simply that if there is no advantage which the defendant
                    would be deprived of if the foreign proceedings are restrained, then there is no
                    reasonable explanation for not defending or pursuing the claim in the natural
                    forum. Consequently, the court is entitled to conclude or infer that the
                    defendants in instituting such foreign proceedings are indeed acting vexatiously
                    or oppressively. Viewed in this perspective, Mr Ng understandably devoted a
                    significant part of his submissions on the differences between Australian and
                    Singapore law on the common issues, for instance, that of misrepresentation.
                    Consistent with this principle, in <em>Cadre</em> at
                        [18], the anti-suit injunction was
                    granted to restrain the Romanian proceedings because the English High Court
                    found that there was <em>no good reason</em> for the
                    defendant to seek to have the dispute determined in Romania and that the
                    proceedings were started as a defensive step to prevent other courts from taking
                    jurisdiction rather than because Romania was the natural or appropriate forum to
                    hear the dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_154"></a>154    In response to the alleged injustice if the
                    anti-suit injunction is not discharged, Mr Kumar made the following
                    points:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_154-p2_a"></a>(a)     The court may still grant an
                        anti-suit injunction even where there would have been some advantage to the
                        opposing party in the foreign proceedings as long as the court is satisfied
                        that substantial justice would be done in the forum. For instance, in
                            <em>Kishinchand Tiloomal Bhojwani and another v Sunil
                            Kishinchand Bhojwani and another</em>
                        [1996] 1 SLR(R) 861 (“<em>Bhojwani</em>”) at [20]–[21],
                        despite the defendant’s contention that she would enjoy much wider
                        discovery rights in New York than in Singapore, the court nevertheless
                        granted the injunction.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_154-p2_b"></a>(b)     In <em>Evergreen International SA v
                            Volkwagen Group Singapore Pte Ltd and ors</em> [2004]
                        2 SLR(R) 457 (“<em>Evergreen
                            International</em>”), the defendants argued that they would
                        be afforded the advantage from the Belgian courts (based on a different
                        limitation convention in respect of the defendant’s action in tort)
                        where the limit of liability would be considerably higher than the limit in
                        Singapore. The court recognised the advantage the defendant might have in
                        Belgium but nonetheless granted the injunction as it found that the
                        limitation regime in Singapore is not an unjust regime and cannot be
                        properly termed as “injustice” (see [58] and [62] which, in turn, cites the decision of
                        G P Selvam J in <em>The Owners of the Ship or
                            Vessel Ming Galaxy v The Owners of the Ship or Vessel or Property Herceg
                            Novi</em> [1998] SGHC 303).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_154-p2_c"></a>(c)     The law is clear that even if the respondent
                        may point to substantive and procedural advantages available to him in the
                        foreign court, if these advantages are available to him only in a forum
                        which is not the natural forum, they will be given little weight, and may
                        even be themselves seen as evidence of oppression (see <em>Regalindo</em> at [18]
                        citing <em>Dicey &amp; Morris</em> at paragraph
                        12-073). As Australia can hardly be said to be the natural forum of the
                        dispute, the alleged “advantages” (if any) should be accorded
                        little weight.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_155"></a>155    Given my finding that there are no
                    differences of sufficient materiality between the laws of Australia and
                    Singapore on the issues in dispute, it must follow that there would be no
                    injustice to the defendants if the Australian Proceedings are restrained by the
                    grant of an anti-suit injunction. I should add there is also nothing unjust
                    about the laws of Singapore on the issue of misrepresentation. As I have
                    observed in <a href="#p1_99">[99]</a>–<a href="#p1_101">[101]</a> above, if Telesto and Mr Tyne are able
                    to adduce evidence to prove the facts as pleaded in the Australian pleadings (a
                    burden which they similarly bear under the Australian Proceedings), they should
                    be able to establish a <em>prima facie</em> case of
                    misrepresentation in which event, the burden would be on UBS AG to prove
                    otherwise even under Singapore law. I agree with the AR that the
                    “loss” of the alleged juridical advantages does not render it
                    “unjust” for the dispute to be heard and determined in Singapore,
                    which I have found to be the natural forum of the dispute. In the premises, it
                    must follow there would be no legitimate reason for the defendants to pursue the
                    Australian Proceedings. In any event, even if the differences can amount to some
                    juridical advantages (which I have determined to be overstated), the court can
                    still grant the anti-suit injunction particularly in this case since the
                    advantages are only available in the Australian Proceedings which is not the
                    natural forum of the dispute. It is of significance that in <em>Bhojwani</em> and <em>Evergreen
                        International</em>, the courts did not find any injustice in depriving
                    the defendants of the juridical advantages because the advantages were only
                    available in New York and Belgium respectively which were not the natural fora
                    of the dispute. There is no reason for a different outcome, on the specific
                    facts of this case especially given my finding that Australia is not the natural
                    forum of the dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_156"></a>156    Further, the compellability of
                    Mr Betsalel cannot be overemphasised since he is an important and probably
                    a key witness to the serious issue of misrepresentation (see <a href="#p1_70">[70]</a> and <a href="#p1_131">[131]</a> above). The misrepresentation issue was introduced and
                    raised by the defendants, and there is nothing intrinsically wrong in that since
                    it is the defendants’ prerogative to do so. However, it seems to me that
                    it is oppressive for the defendants to pursue the claim in Australia in
                    circumstances where UBS AG is unable to compel Mr Betsalel’s
                    attendance at the trial. There is no written undertaking by Mr Betsalel
                    that he would do so and I have my doubts whether such an undertaking, even if
                    provided, is enforceable in Australia should he fail to turn up. Taking all the
                    circumstances into consideration, I arrive at the conclusion that the defendants
                    are acting vexatiously and/or oppressively in instituting and continuing with
                    the Australian Proceedings. For completeness, I should state clearly that I
                    would have arrived at the same conclusion even if the compellability of
                    Mr Betsalel had not arisen as an issue. This finding merely made it a more
                        <em>compelling</em> case for the anti-suit
                    injunction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_157"></a>157    By reason of my findings, the
                    defendants’ appeal in RA 59/2010 is also dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_158"></a>158    Accordingly, both Appeals are dismissed with
                    costs, on an indemnity basis, to be taxed if not agreed. Although the law in
                    these areas is well travelled, Mr Hri Kumar and Mr Eddee Ng have
                    nonetheless raised several interesting and important issues for the
                    court’s determination and I wish to record my appreciation to them for
                    their able assistance in presenting the parties’ respective
                    submissions.</p>
