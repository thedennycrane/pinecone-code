<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The Plaintiff, as purchaser, claims specific
                    performance of a contract for the sale of an apartment at 54 West Coast
                    Crescent, #01-01, West Bay Condominium, Singapore (“the
                    Apartment”). The 1<sup>st</sup> and
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants, a husband and wife, as vendors,
                    resist the claim on various grounds and in the event they fail as against the
                    Plaintiff, they have brought in their solicitors as the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Third Party (“Solicitors” or
                    “Krishna”, as the context requires, Mr Krishnamoorthi being
                    the partner handling the Defendants’ matters in K Krishna &amp; Partners)
                    and the property agent as the 2<sup>nd</sup> Third Party
                    (“the Agent”), claiming an indemnity from either or both of them.
                    The Plaintiff also claims damages and interest under the contract and such
                    further or other order as the court deems fit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       After oral submissions on 4 January 2010, I
                    gave judgement, with brief grounds, in favour of the Plaintiff against the
                    Defendants, dismissed the Defendants’ claims against the
                        1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Third
                    Parties and awarded costs against the Defendants for all parties on an indemnity
                    basis, and said that if any party wished to take this further, I would give my
                    full reasons in a written judgement. As the parties needed time to work out the
                    orders required, I gave leave for the parties to return the next day with an
                    agreed draft judgement. The Defendants appealed against my decision on
                    3 February 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       There are some key facts, which are not really
                    in dispute:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_a"></a>(a)     On the evening of 29 May 2007,
                        the Plaintiff viewed the Apartment together with the Agent and the
                        Defendants; the Plaintiff and Defendants agreed on the price, the Plaintiff
                        issued a cheque for $6,350 to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant
                        and the Plaintiff was given an option to purchase the Apartment (“the
                        Option”), the wording of which was on fairly standard terms and
                        supplied by the Agent.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_b"></a>(b)     The next day, the Plaintiff went to view the Apartment from the
                        outside and was disturbed by a substation or transformer near the Apartment
                        and was afraid it would pose a health hazard to the occupants; she changed
                        her mind and stopped payment of the cheque on 30 May
                    2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_c"></a>(c)     The Defendants
                        left Singapore on the morning of 31 May 2007 for a holiday to Canada
                        and did not return until 11 June 2007, and they were uncontactable
                        during that period.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_d"></a>(d)     Sometime on or before 8 June 2007, the Plaintiff changed her
                        mind and contacted the Agent; the Plaintiff went to see the
                        Defendants’ Solicitors on 8 June 2007 and handed them a second
                        cheque for $6,350 and the original Option.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_e"></a>(e)     The Plaintiff exercised the Option on or about
                        11 June 2007 by paying the remaining 4% of the purchase price,
                        ($25,400). The last date for the exercise of the Option was 13 June
                        2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The details surrounding these five central facts,
                    their legal effect and the state of mind of the parties are in
                    contention.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Defendants’ Case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant did
                    not give evidence. The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant confirmed that
                    he made all the decisions; the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant gave him
                    full authority to do so and to speak on her behalf as well.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The Defendants wanted to sell the Apartment and
                    had a price of $680,000 in mind. The Agent brought the Plaintiff to view the
                    Apartment on the evening of 29 May 2007. The Defendants were also present
                    at the viewing. As the Apartment was tenanted, the parties then went to the car
                    park to negotiate the price. Eventually the price agreed upon was $635,000. The
                    Agent produced the Option, the Defendants signed the Option, and in return, the
                    Plaintiff gave them her cheque for $6,350 (“the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Cheque”). The blanks in the printed
                    Option were filled in by the Agent upon being given the details by the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant. One of the blanks filled in was
                    the name of the Defendants’ Solicitors. The Defendants told the Plaintiff
                    and the Agent that they were leaving for a family holiday on 31 May 2007.
                    The Defendants banked in the 1<sup>st</sup> Cheque on
                    30 May 2007 and left for their holiday on an early morning flight on
                    31 May 2007 to Vancouver.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The Defendants were unaware of the fact that the
                    Plaintiff had stopped payment on the 1<sup>st</sup> Cheque on
                    30 May 2007. The Agent called the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant
                    on 11 June 2007 when they returned and the 1<sup>st</sup>
                    Defendant informed her that they had just landed from a long flight and were
                    suffering from jet lag. The next day, 12 June 2007, the Agent called the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant and told him that the Plaintiff had
                    exercised the Option by depositing the balance 4% with his Solicitors. The
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant called Krishna on the same day to
                    inquire about the sale of another of his properties, 145 Dunlop Street, which
                    Krishna was also handling for him. In this telephone conversation, the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant also asked Krishna about the
                    Plaintiff’s exercise of the Option in relation to the Apartment. Krishna
                    said he was not aware of the same and would have to check and confirm the same.
                    Krishna called back the same day or the next day to confirm the exercise of the
                    Option by the Plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       However, when the 1<sup>st</sup>
                    Defendant went down to open his letter box on 13 June 2007, he was shocked
                    to find a letter from the Plaintiff’s bank to the Defendants, containing a
                    “Return Cheque Advice” dated 1 June 2007 with the reason:
                    “Payment Stopped”. No one had told him about the cancellation of
                    the 1<sup>st</sup> Cheque and he wondered how the Option could
                    have been exercised. The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant called the
                    Agent who said that under the Option the Solicitors had the right to
                    “accept” and since Krishna had already accepted the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Cheque, the 1<sup>st</sup>
                    Defendant had to proceed and if he was not satisfied, he could sue his
                    Solicitors. The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant called Krishna who only
                    then told him that the cheque issued to his firm was dated 8 June 2007 and
                    that it had been banked into his firm’s Client’s Account; Krishna
                    did not know that there was a 1<sup>st</sup> Cheque which had
                    been dishonoured. The receipt and acceptance by Krishna of the 1% option fee and
                    the subsequent 4% upon exercise of the Option was therefore without the
                    Defendants’ knowledge or mandate and outside the scope of his
                    Solicitors’ authority. The Defendants considered that the Option had been
                    terminated by the Plaintiff stopping payment on the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Cheque and there was no valid option to be
                    exercised thereafter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant
                    then verbally informed Krishna on 13 and 15 June 2007 about his position
                    and requested Krishna to stop the sale and withhold from proceeding any further.
                    However Krishna not only made no attempts to stop the sale, but to the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant’s horror, Krishna proceeded
                    to write two letters, both dated 13 June 2007, to the Plaintiff’s
                    solicitors requesting first a postponement of the completion date to
                    15 October 2007 and secondly, the release of the 4% deposit of the purchase
                    price from the Solicitors’ stakeholding obligation. The
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant never asked his Solicitor to make
                    such requests. The Defendants protested against the contents of the 13 June
                    2007 letters in a letter to their Solicitors dated 16 June
                2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant was
                    also upset by the actions of the Plaintiff. He had brought down his selling
                    price below the market value “…to help her and she acted with such
                    bad motive.” The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant tried to
                    contact her but she refused to deal with him. He had to go down to her workplace
                    at Suntec City and ask her to come down to meet him. He asked her why she had
                    dishonoured her 1<sup>st</sup> Cheque and then made payment to
                    his Solicitor with a 2<sup>nd</sup> Cheque. He did not discuss
                    anything else. He subsequently sent a letter to the Plaintiff dated 1 July
                    2007 on the invalidity of the Option and another to the Plaintiff’s
                    solicitors, dated 10 July 2007. The 1<sup>st</sup>
                    Defendant stated in his AEIC that: “There is no other reason for us
                    wanting to stop the sale apart from the misrepresentations and misleading
                    information received from the parties.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The 1<sup>st</sup>
                    Defendant’s AEIC then goes on to say that by a letter dated 10 August
                    2007, his Solicitors tried to blame him and allege that he was aware of the
                    dishonour of the cheque even before going abroad. The
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant denies this and states that he
                    banked in the 1<sup>st</sup> Cheque on 30 May 2007 and left
                    for Canada on 31 May 2007 on an early morning flight and “…by
                    which time…[he had]…no chance to know about the dishonour of the
                    cheque.” The Defendants say that they were “…tricked by all
                    the parties intentionally and negligently to proceed with an invalid
                    sale.” The Defendants argued that they never gave their Solicitors the
                    mandate to act in respect of the Option fee of $6,350 and that their Solicitors
                    should have returned all the monies to the Plaintiff’s solicitors and
                    taken the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant’s instructions. The
                    Agent knowingly assisted the Plaintiff and had acted without the mandate,
                    consent or approval of the Defendants in helping the Plaintiff tender the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Cheque, concealing the fact of the dishonour
                    of the 1<sup>st</sup> Cheque from the Defendants and in getting
                    the Defendants’ Solicitors to accept the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    Cheque.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     On their pleadings the Defendants
                    claim:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_a"></a>(a)     as against the Solicitors, damages,
                        and in effect an indemnity for the Defendants’ liability to the
                        Plaintiff, as a result of their negligence, breach of duty, lack of skill or
                        diligence and/or acting without any mandate from the Defendants, accepting
                        the 1% Option fee in their firm’s name when the Option provided that
                        1% Option was to be paid to the Defendants personally, failing to inform the
                        Defendants when they received a 2<sup>nd</sup> Cheque dated
                        8 June 2007, failing to put the Plaintiff on notice that the exercise
                        of the Option was not available or that the exercise of the Option was
                        invalid, failing to stop the sale although the Option was null and void and
                        stating that “it cannot be done”, resulting in the Plaintiff
                        asking for specific performance (I pause to note that the Defendants’
                        Claim against the Solicitors (Amendment No.1) is badly pleaded; it also
                        includes allegations against the Agent. Most noteworthy is the absence of
                        any allegation that Krishna wrote two 2 letters dated 13 June 2007
                        without any instructions from the Defendants); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_b"></a>(b)     as against the Agent, that the Agent
                        knowingly assisted the Plaintiff in re-tendering the
                            2<sup>nd</sup> Cheque on 8 June 2007, induced and
                        misled Krishna into accepting the 2<sup>nd</sup> Cheque,
                        acted without mandate; it cryptically alleges the “said
                        representation amounted to a collateral warranty” in consideration of
                        which Krishna accepted the 2<sup>nd</sup> Cheque and
                        completed the Contract. This representation was false and the Agent
                        knowingly assisted the Plaintiff in making the said representation
                        fraudulently in that she knew it was false or made it recklessly, not caring
                        whether it was true or false.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Counsel for the Defendants,
                    Mr Joseph, confirmed, during closing submissions, that the Defendants were
                    still maintaining these allegations.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Findings</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Witnesses</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Having heard the witnesses and considered all
                    the evidence, I find the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant to be a
                    totally unreliable witness of fact who lied about many of the material facts and
                    blithely ignored the inconsistencies in his oral evidence, his AEIC and the
                    documentary evidence. He also made up evidence on the stand each time he was
                    caught out on cross-examination. He was even able to feign tears to show how
                    reluctant he was to even criticise his own lawyer although he proceeded to sue
                    his lawyer and the Agent and strongly resisted the Plaintiff’s
                    claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     I found the Plaintiff to be an honest and
                    straightforward person, who answered without hesitation, never failed to look
                    counsel or the court in the eye under cross-examination, and did not waver in
                    her evidence. She stated the facts plainly, in a matter of fact manner without
                    any embellishment. No one could shake her in her evidence. The only minor point,
                    which I found immaterial, was this: Krishna remembers her asking him to act for
                    her in the purchase when they first met on 8 June 2007, but she says that
                    she did not do so. Krishna had declined due to issues of potential conflict of
                    interest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     I also found Krishna to be a witness of truth.
                    He too answered questions without hesitation or embellishment. He readily
                    admitted points that he should have asked questions on, like why was he being
                    given a cheque made out in his firm’s favour when on the face of the
                    Option it was given in exchange for a cheque made out to the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant. But for the reasons set out below,
                    I found this did not dent his credibility or his case. I also found
                    Krishna’s litigation partner, Mr Nedumaran,
                    (“Nedumaran”), to be a witness of truth and I accept his evidence
                    on a short meeting he had with Krishna and the 1<sup>st</sup>
                    Defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     I also accept the evidence of the Agent.
                    Whilst she had some lapses in her memory, she said this was due, understandably,
                    to her age and poorer memory. She offered medical evidence of this but with
                    great chivalry none of the counsel required it. The relevant and important
                    portions of her evidence were not shaken in cross-examination and on the whole I
                    also accept her as a witness of truth. There was one aspect of her evidence that
                    troubled me and I will refer to it below. However on the facts as I have found,
                    this was not an issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     My findings of fact are as
                follows.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The Defendants’ case is that they never
                    knew the 1<sup>st</sup> Cheque was dishonoured. They banked in
                    the cheque on 30 May 2007 and left for their holiday on an early morning
                    flight on 31 May 2007: “…by which time [they would] have no
                    chance to know about the dishonour of the cheque.” (at [11],
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant’s AEIC). This is completely
                    untrue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The Plaintiff denies the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant’s version. Her evidence is
                    that she felt bad backing out of the purchase. On 30 May 2007, she
                    telephoned the Agent first, to explain why she was backing out of the purchase
                    (she feared that the substation or transformer room next to a balcony of the
                    Apartment would pose a health hazard to the occupants) and, secondly, to get the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant’s telephone number; she then
                    telephoned the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant and she told him the
                    same thing and that she was going to stop payment on the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Cheque. After these calls, the Plaintiff
                    proceeded to telephone her bank to stop payment on the cheque. When that was
                    done, she called the Agent and the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant
                    again and told them that she had stopped payment on the cheque. The Agent agrees
                    with the Plaintiff’s version of these facts and these telephone calls on
                    30 May 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Unfortunately for the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, the Plaintiff managed to get the
                    record of her mobile telephone calls on 30 May 2007<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>, and they back up
                    her evidence completely. The telephone numbers of the Agent, the
                    Plaintiff’s bank and the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant are
                    clearly shown on the Plaintiff’s telephone call log. The sequence of
                    calls, starting from 3.18 pm, show calls to the Agent first, then the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant at 4.35 pm, followed by 3 calls to
                    the Plaintiff’s bank, DBS Bank, from 4.55 to 4.58 pm and then calls to the
                    Agent and the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant. There were 10 calls
                    altogether starting from 3.18 pm to 6.49 pm on 30 May 2007; 3 outgoing
                    calls from the Plaintiff to the Agent and 7 incoming calls from the Agent to the
                    Plaintiff. The Plaintiff also made 4 telephone calls to the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant on that day, starting at 4.35 pm
                    and the last one at 5.18 pm. The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant
                    admitted the relevant entries showed his telephone number. This telephone log
                    was <em>not</em> challenged by the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Faced with this on cross-examination, the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant had to admit that the Plaintiff did
                    call him on 30 May 2007 and made up three different stories under
                    cross-examination. First he admitted she called him but claimed that it was to
                    try to lower the price using excuses like “renovation issues”
                        (<em>ie</em>, the condition of the Apartment) but that
                    the Plaintiff had said nothing about the substation; he therefore did not
                    believe she would stop payment on the cheque. Secondly, having been forced to
                    admit that she had called him, he disingenuously said the Plaintiff only told
                    him she <em>intended</em> to stop payment but did not tell
                    him she had <em>actually countermanded</em> the cheque.
                    Thirdly, when confronted with his previous solicitor’s letter of
                    19 November 2007 (which was in reply to the Plaintiff’s then
                    solicitors’ letter dated 15 November 2007, categorically stating that
                    the Plaintiff had informed the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant of her
                    intention to stop payment on the cheque), which categorically denied any
                    telephone conversation having taken place on 30 May 2007, the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant quite incredibly said he had told
                    his solicitor that he did not speak to the Plaintiff on 31 May 2007 but had
                    spoken to the Plaintiff on 30 May 2007 and blamed his previous solicitors
                    for getting it wrong.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The second aspect of this first lie is also
                    telling. Contrary to his case and his evidence that had he known the
                        1<sup>st</sup> cheque was dishonoured he would not have
                    proceeded with the sale of the Apartment, the evidence and documents show he did
                    some things that were quite the opposite.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     I accept the evidence of the Plaintiff and
                    find that when the Plaintiff told the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant
                    that she was going to stop the cheque and why she was doing so, he did not
                    protest nor say he would call off the sale. I accept the Plaintiff’s
                    evidence that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant said to her:
                    “Lady, be happy. We can talk about it when I return to Singapore”
                    or words to that effect (see also Transcript, 2 December 2009, page 85
                    where the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant eventually conceded he said:
                    “…we will settle it when I come back from Vancouver.”). I
                    also accept the corroborative evidence of the Agent and find that when the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant spoke to the Agent on 30 May
                    2007, after his conversation with the Plaintiff, he instructed the Agent to try
                    and persuade the Plaintiff to go through with the purchase and if that was not
                    possible, to find him another buyer for the same price. Pursuant to these
                    instructions, the Agent kept reassuring the Plaintiff that the substation did
                    not pose any health threat and that she should check with the power authorities
                    and Singapore Power. Nonetheless, the Agent took back the Option from the
                    Plaintiff as she felt it was not right to leave a signed option in the hands of
                    the Plaintiff in such circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     I find the following. The Agent did call the
                    Plaintiff to persuade her to continue with the purchase as instructed by the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant. The Plaintiff then called
                    Singapore Power to check if there was any danger to health by staying near a
                    substation or transformer. She was passed from one person to another and
                    eventually got to someone able to answer her and who assured her it was safe and
                    she accepted that assurance. Following her checks, the Plaintiff changed her
                    mind; the Plaintiff telephoned the Agent to say she was prepared to go on with
                    the purchase. This was sometime on or before 8 June 2007. The Agent called
                    Krishna and told him about the sale. The Agent then picked the Plaintiff up,
                    gave her back the Option, drove her to Krishna’s office, told her to see
                    Krishna and to give him her cheque for $6,350 and the Option, but did not go in
                    with her to Krishna’s office. The Plaintiff saw Krishna’s office
                    girl, handed her the 2<sup>nd</sup> Cheque, obtained an
                    acknowledgement and spoke briefly to Krishna. As far as the Agent was concerned,
                    she was fulfilling the instructions of the 1<sup>st</sup>
                    Defendant, <em>viz</em>, to try and persuade the Plaintiff
                    to go through with the sale. I also find that the Plaintiff did not tell Krishna
                    about stopping the 1<sup>st</sup> Cheque because it was
                    irrelevant to her in light of what the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant
                    said to her before his departure for holiday and because the Agent, acting on
                    the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant’s instructions, kept
                    persuading her to go through with the purchase. I find that the Plaintiff did
                    not suppress this fact, neither did the Plaintiff act in concert with the Agent
                    to mislead Krishna. The Plaintiff is someone who would not have realised the
                    legal significance of this fact.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The next lie involved the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant’s actions upon his return
                    from holiday. Upon his return, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant
                    telephoned Krishna and arranged a meeting at the 1<sup>st</sup>
                    Defendant’s office. Krishna’s evidence, which I accept, was that it
                    was the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant who told him at that meeting
                    that there was a first cheque on which payment was stopped whereupon Krishna
                    advised him that he had a choice to accept the repudiation and end the contract
                    or to affirm the contract. I find that prior to that, Krishna knew nothing of
                    the 1<sup>st</sup> Cheque and its dishonour. The
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant thought about it, said he had a
                    slightly higher offer but was not sure if the other buyer was sincere, and
                    proceeded to tell Krishna that his decision was to go ahead with the sale to the
                    Plaintiff. The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant then discussed with
                    Krishna his loan with DBS Bank which was secured by the Apartment and whether he
                    would have to pay any penalties for an early redemption of the loan. The
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant showed Krishna the DBS Offer Letter
                    which had certain parts highlighted in yellow and Krishna read the same and
                    confirmed that because of the 3 month notice period required for redemption and
                    the inability to serve a notice of redemption less than 1 month after any
                    capital repayment was made, he would have to pay a penalty if he redeemed the
                    loan on the scheduled completion date of 3 September 2007 although the
                    effect could be reduced by making a partial redemption first.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Following that meeting the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant telephoned the Plaintiff to ask
                    whether she was prepared to postpone the completion date so that he would not
                    have to pay a penalty for early redemption to DBS. She told him to write to her
                    lawyers, Messrs Matthew Chiong Partnership (“MCP”), handling the
                    purchase for her. The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant also asked her to
                    release the 5% held by Krishna as stakeholder. She gave him the same answer. The
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant denied all this. Again he was
                    caught out on his lie. When he was shown the Plaintiff’s telephone call
                    log with his number on it on 12 June 2007, he was forced to admit he made a
                    call to the Plaintiff on that day. He could not explain why he would call her on
                    12 June 2007 on his version of events or on his case. Upon further
                    cross-examination, he had to admit that although these conversations were
                    pleaded by the Plaintiff and averred to in her AEIC, he had not answered or
                    dealt with this either in his pleadings or in his AEIC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     I find that following this telephone call to
                    the Plaintiff, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant instructed Krishna
                    to write to MCP to make two requests; first, to ask the Plaintiff to postpone
                    completion to 15 October 2007 and secondly to release the balance 4%
                    stakeholder monies to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant. Krishna did
                    so in two letters dated 13 June 2007, (see AB16 and AB17) as he was
                    instructed to make different requests at different times on the same day. It
                    should be noted that in AB17, Krishna wrote: “We have been instructed by
                    our clients that they have spoken to your client as regards the balance
                    4%...” When referred to these letters in cross-examination, the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant quite incredibly claimed that he
                    never instructed Krishna to make any requests of this nature. He said Krishna
                    wrote these letters all on his own and without instructions. I find it quite
                    unbelievable for any lawyer, and especially one of Krishna’s experience,
                    to write to another solicitor with such specific requests of such nature without
                    any instructions. Further, these letters were copied to the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant. Krishna produced his fax
                    transmission journal which showed two faxes to the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant’s fax number on 13 June
                    2007. There is no protest, as one would have expected from the Defendants, that
                    these letters were written without any instructions (the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant relies on a letter dated
                    16 June 2007, which I shall deal with below). He had been asked before, and
                    was asked again, during the trial, to produce his original offer letter from DBS
                    Bank but he chose not to do so, producing instead other letters from DBS Bank.
                    The irresistible inference, which I draw pursuant to section 116, illustration
                    (g) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed), is that if he did, it
                    would show the minimum notice periods and the penalty payable if the sale was
                    completed as scheduled; as noted above, the 1<sup>st</sup>
                    Defendant showed this original offer letter to Krishna at their meeting on
                    11 June 2007 to check if the penalty was payable if completion took place
                    as scheduled. Furthermore, if Krishna did write those two 13 June 2007
                    letters without any instructions from the 1<sup>st</sup>
                    Defendant (thereby severely prejudicing the Defendants’ case), then the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant should have been very annoyed with
                    Krishna. He says he was “surprised” and
                    “disappointed”; (the choice of this understatement was, I find, to
                    put forward his front as a humble man without much education, and who was
                    reluctant to criticise his lawyer). Yet, the contemporaneous evidence shows
                    otherwise. When cross-examined, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant had
                    no answer when he was asked why <em>he</em> wrote a letter
                    to the Plaintiff dated 1 July 2007, (AB19), where in telling the Plaintiff
                    to withdraw her purchase, he said: “Please do not trouble our solicitor
                    any further. <em>We find that our solicitors are not at
                        fault</em>.” (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     That is not all. The
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant chose to lie about these requests
                    to the Plaintiff because, first, he forgot that his telephone call to the
                    Plaintiff would show up on her telephone call log. Secondly, and more
                    importantly, he thought there was no written evidence. During the
                    Plaintiff’s evidence-in-chief, I allowed her to introduce a document,
                    “P-1”, which she says she only just showed her lawyer and did not
                    realise its significance. The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant had
                    written on “P-1” some words, dates and figures that were very
                    telling: it had interest rates for the 1<sup>st</sup>
                    (“3%”), 2<sup>nd</sup> (“3.5%”) and
                        3<sup>rd</sup> (“4%”) years “From date
                    L of offer”; and it had notations like:
                        “14<sup>th</sup> June 2007 to...”,
                        “14<sup>th</sup> July to … -
                    redemption”, “17<sup>th</sup> October
                    2007”, “Sept 07...”,
                        “30<sup>th</sup>”,
                        “1<sup>st</sup>”,
                        “31<sup>st</sup> October...”,
                    “2%”, “1.5%” and various sums of money against some
                    of these notations. My finding is that the Plaintiff says, and I accept her
                    evidence, that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant asked her to extend
                    the completion date to 15 October 2007 and release the 4% from the
                    stakeholding obligation; he telephoned her a number of times making these
                    requests and on 18 June 2007 he telephoned her yet once more and said he
                    was outside her office and asked her to meet him. She obliged. He wanted to
                    explain his situation to her and needed something to write on. She had her file
                    in relation to the purchase of the Apartment with her and she took out one sheet
                    with photocopied cheques on one side, turned it over, and handed the blank
                    reverse side to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant who then proceeded
                    to write out some words and figures which clearly relate to his loan, early
                    redemption and penalty issues. The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant
                    admitted the handwriting was his. The Plaintiff was then cross-examined by
                    Mr Joseph as to why, if she says the 1<sup>st</sup>
                    Defendant wrote on “P-1” on 18 June 2007, the reverse
                    contained copies of three cheques, one of which bore the date 27 August
                    2007. She answered, without any hesitation, that it was a post dated cheque to
                    her lawyers for the purchase of the Apartment, and she pointed to the running
                    cheque numbers: No.150159 was in favour of MCP for $1,800 and dated
                    27 August 2007, but No.150160 was dated 11 June 2007 in favour of MCP
                    and No.150161 was dated 11 June 2007 in favour of K Krishna &amp;
                    Partners for $25,400, which was the balance 4% when the Option was exercised on
                    11 June 2007. She had handed all these cheques to MCP at the same time and
                    MCP made photocopies for her record.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     When confronted with “P-1”, the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant first said it was written in front
                    of Krishna on 12 June 2007. He repeated this emphatically, a number of
                    times without any qualification. He also gave a long explanation and explained
                    some of the notations on “P-1” which related to his DBS Bank loan
                    on the Apartment, (see Transcript, 1 December 2009, pages 76 and 77). This
                    was quite impossible because it is difficult to accept why Krishna would have
                    photocopies of the Plaintiff’s cheques to her lawyer for the purchase on
                    the reverse and on top of all that, have it with him on 12 June 2007. Prior
                    to that, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant had instructed his counsel
                    that “P-1” pre-dated the Option; that was put to the Plaintiff in
                    cross-examination. She denied it. The 1<sup>st</sup>
                    Defendant’s counsel had also said, in cross-examining the Plaintiff at
                    another point in time, that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant had no
                    recollection of writing on “P-1” and later Mr Joseph said his
                    client could not remember when and for what purpose his client wrote on
                    “P-1”. It is unfortunate, but I have to say that the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant’s persistent telling of one
                    lie after another under cross-examination, when shown the inconsistencies in his
                    evidence and the documents, shows up very clearly when one peruses the
                    Transcript. Unfortunately my judgement would be overly long if I quoted from
                    these passages from the Transcript. Many of these passages are set out in the
                    Closing Submissions of Mr Coomaraswamy SC and Mr Daniel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     I need only refer to one more matter, which I
                    find to be very serious, to explain why I completely disbelieved the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant and eventually, after persuasion
                    and considering the Defendants’ case and the way the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant presented his evidence, awarded
                    indemnity costs against him. I find that he manufactured evidence – he
                    made up a letter, 1DBD3, allegedly dated 16 June 2007 which he claimed he
                    sent to his Solicitors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The evidence and contemporaneous documents
                    following from the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant’s return from
                    his holiday in relation to the sale of the Apartment are all consistent with his
                    knowing the 1<sup>st</sup> Cheque had been dishonoured and being
                    prepared to carry on with the sale of the Apartment to the Plaintiff. There is
                    AB13, a letter dated 11 June 2007 from Krishna, acting for the Defendants
                    in the sale of 145, Dunlop Street, to another solicitor, changing the completion
                    payments; this included a Cashier’s Order for $421,889.64 payable to the
                    Defendants, to be used for capital repayment to DBS Bank, and AB15, the DBS
                    capital repayment notice form signed by the Defendants dated 12 June 2007
                    for $480,000. More importantly, there are the two letters of 13 June 2007
                    from Krishna to MCP already referred to (it should also be noted that
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant never subsequently withdrew these
                    letters, even when he changed solicitors). The Defendants only changed their
                    minds about the sale of the Apartment to the Plaintiff when the Plaintiff did
                    not accede to their requests to postpone completion and to release the 4%
                    stakeholder deposit held by Krishna pending completion. Right until 1 July
                    2007 (<em>ie</em> after Krishna wrote the two letters of
                    13 June 2007), the Defendants had taken the position that their Solicitors
                    were not at fault. The Defendants blamed the Plaintiff as the party who
                    surreptitiously, without the Defendants’ and their Solicitors’
                    knowledge, and with the connivance of the Agent, gave another cheque for the 1%
                    Option fee and exercised the Option early. Krishna’s firm also wrote to
                    the Defendants on 4 July 2007 to confirm their instructions not to serve
                    the notice of redemption on DBS Bank in relation to the loan on the Apartment,
                    (see AB21). This was because by then, the Defendants decided not to proceed with
                    the sale. To explain away these contemporaneous documents and evidence, the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant manufactured 1DBD3, purportedly
                    dated 16 June 2007, to record his alleged objection to the two 13 June
                    2007 letters which were allegedly written without instructions:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... As regards to the sale of 54, West Coast Crescent, #01-01, You have
                        disappointed us, and telling us that we cannot stop the sale and have to
                        proceed with it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We will not acknowledged [<em>sic</em>] your recent
                        letters dated 13<sup>th</sup> June 2007 as it has confirmed
                        the 1% cheque given under our name has being [<em>sic</em>] returned reason being stopped payment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">I accept the evidence of Krishna that he never saw this letter until
                    this litigation. He did not receive this or any such letter. If the Defendants
                    were truly annoyed with Krishna for writing such letters without any
                    instructions or authority, I would have expected more explicit language rather
                    than the vague: “we will not acknowledged your recent letters dated
                    13 June 2007”. The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant was
                    quite capable of expressing himself in clearer language to record his
                    objections. This ‘letter’ was only brought up in reply to a request
                    of further and better particulars around 23 April 2008 (the action was
                    commenced on 14 December 2007) and was never referred to in any of the
                    Defendants’ second set of solicitors, Messrs Kalamohan &amp; Co’s,
                    letters which contained many of the material allegations against Krishna. Messrs
                    Kalamohan &amp; Co wrote these letters from 15 August to 18 December
                    2007. Krishna noted that he always dealt with the 1<sup>st</sup>
                    Defendant by telephone and facsimile and the 1<sup>st</sup>
                    Defendant’s letters to him were always by facsimile and AR registered
                    post. This purported letter was only ‘by post’ and it is no
                    coincidence that Krishna did not receive any such letter. Finally when
                    cross-examined why Messrs Kalamohan &amp; Co did not refer to this purported
                    letter in their correspondence, the 1<sup>st</sup>
                    Defendant’s disingenuous lies can be clearly seen from the transcript;
                    (see Transcript, 2 December 2009, pages 33 to 41). When he was pressed on
                    this letter by Mr Daniel, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant
                    became very emotional: see Transcript, 2 December 2009, page 23, line 9 to
                    page 24, line 27. Unfortunately I believe these were crocodile tears shed to
                    evade answering questions about something he knew was fabricated by him,
                    interspersed with reasons like he was never one to write such letters to his
                    lawyers and moreover only over money. I find the 1<sup>st</sup>
                    Defendant to be a very intelligent and shrewd businessman who is very clear in
                    his mind as to what he wants to do or does not want to do. He is also meticulous
                    and does his calculations on his property investments with care. He puts forward
                    the semblance of someone who is very simple, not very educated or well versed in
                    matters of commerce but every now and then he will use words to acknowledge
                    commercial and banking practices with correct pronunciation and accuracy. His
                    portfolio of property transactions, dealt with below, is good evidence of this
                    acumen. He gives evidence quite comfortably in English but when he is caught
                    out, he pretends he needs an interpreter, but only to “help” him
                    understand difficult words. I suspect it is more to give him more time to think.
                    He often refused to answer questions, even simple ones, by giving irrelevant
                    answers and more than one counsel had to keep repeating the question. Sometimes
                    I had to intervene, by repeating the question, before he answered the
                    same.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The following evidence was not challenged and
                    therefore accepted by the Defendants: Krishna had acted for the Defendants in
                    numerous property transactions. Krishna states in his AEIC that he has known the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant from about 1993 and over the years
                    he acted for the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant in something like 28
                    transactions - 17 purchases of property, 3 sales of property and 8 financing
                    transactions like mortgages or re-financing: see [2.2] of his AEIC. Krishna and
                    the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant were well known to each other for
                    about 14 years at the time of the sale of the Apartment. In his unchallenged
                    evidence, Krishna deposed in his AEIC that in early May 2007, the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant informed him that he wanted to sell
                    the Apartment. The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant was eager to do so
                    even if he incurred a slight loss because he had been looking to sell the
                    property since April 2007 but was unable to find a buyer. It is important to
                    note that this is why the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant was confident
                    enough to put Krishna’s firm as his solicitors in the Option on the night
                    of 29 May 2007 and then go off on holiday without telling Krishna that he
                    had done so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Towards the end of May 2007, the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant told Krishna that he was going to
                    Canada for a family vacation. Hence, when the Agent contacted Krishna on
                    8 June 2007 and told him about the sale and when the Plaintiff came to his
                    office with the signed Option, even though the option monies were being paid to
                    his firm, he saw nothing amiss and acted in good faith to secure the sale for
                    the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant. He says he had no reason, and I
                    accept his evidence, to be suspicious why the cheque was made out in his
                    firm’s name. He also says candidly that, <em>on
                        hindsight</em>, perhaps he should have asked why the cheque was in his
                    firm’s name despite the first paragraph of the Option stating otherwise.
                    However, in the context of the long business relationship existing between the
                    Defendants and Krishna, and what the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant
                    had told Krishna before the Defendants went on holiday, I find there was no
                    negligence or breach of duty or breach of mandate on the part of Krishna. This
                    is especially so because when the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant told
                    him of the dishonoured cheque, Krishna promptly advised the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant of his rights but the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant then instructed him to nonetheless
                    proceed with the sale. I find that that is exactly what would have happened if
                    Krishna had informed the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant that the
                    cheque was in his firm’s name on 8 June 2007, Krishna would have
                    found out that it was a second cheque, he would have rendered his advice and the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant would have instructed him to
                    continue with the sale as he did later on 11 June 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     I also accept the following important piece of
                    corroborative evidence. Sometime in July 2007, the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant came to Krishna’s office to
                    discuss another property transaction. The 1<sup>st</sup>
                    Defendant also raised the sale of the Apartment and asked if the letters of
                    13 June 2007 could be detrimental to his case if he wanted to withdraw from
                    the sale. Krishna thought it would but called in his litigation partner,
                    Nedumaran, for confirmation; Nedumaran on being told the facts and shown the two
                    13 June 2007 letters also opined that it would because it clearly evinced
                    an intention to proceed with the sale after knowledge of the dishonoured cheque.
                    Nedumaran was called as a witness by the Plaintiff and I also accept his
                    evidence. I need not deal with any objections of solicitor client privilege as
                    none was raised but if it were I would expect that <em>Tournier v
                        National Provincial and Union Bank of England</em> [1924]
                    1 KB 461 would have been a good answer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     There is one aspect of the Agent’s
                    evidence that I do not accept. The Agent said that when she called Krishna on or
                    about 8 June 2007 to inform him about the sale of Defendants’
                    Apartment and fix an appointment for the Plaintiff to call at his office, she
                    informed Krishna that there was a 1<sup>st</sup> Cheque that had
                    been dishonoured. Krishna denies this. I accept Krishna’s version, he is
                    too experienced a conveyancer and lawyer to have ignored such a crucial fact. I
                    think she was mistaken. Accepting that her memory was not as good as before, it
                    was perhaps her way of subconsciously protecting herself against criticism. At
                    the relevant time, she was only completing the sale process as instructed by the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant and not being legally trained, she
                    may not have realised the significance of a dishonoured cheque. However nothing
                    turns on this in view of my findings of fact.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     There is another aspect of the evidence
                    against the Defendants. After they changed their minds in early July 2007, they
                    wrote to the Plaintiff and her solicitors setting out their position, but
                    surprisingly not to the Agent. Later, after requests by Krishna to the
                    Defendants to instruct another firm of lawyers to act for them and to inform
                    them that they were discharging themselves from further acting for them, the
                    Defendants appointed Kalamohan &amp; Co to act for them. There were letters
                    written by Kalamohan &amp; Co to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant
                    and MCP, setting out the Defendants’ position from 15 August 2007 to
                    December 2007. On 13 December 2007, MCP wrote to Kalamohan &amp; Co asking
                    if they had instructions to accept service and Kalamohan &amp; Co replied on
                    18 December 2007 stating that they had. Again, during this period there
                    were no letters of accusation against the Agent. It was only 28 days after MCP
                    said they were commencing proceedings that the 1<sup>st</sup>
                    Defendant wrote his first letter, dated 10 January 2008, accusing the Agent
                    of assisting the Plaintiff, concealing the fact of the dishonour of the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Cheque from Krishna and dishonesty in acting
                    as an agent. If the Defendants truly felt that the Plaintiff and the dishonest
                    Agent had acted in concert to mislead Krishna and put the Defendants in this
                    legal tangle, one would have expected the Agent to have received a letter or
                    letters from Kalamohan &amp; Co setting out allegations of the Agent’s
                    wrongdoing in the transaction. But there were none until almost a month after
                    MCP said they had instructions to commence proceedings. When this was pointed
                    out to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, all he could lamely say was
                    that he never instructed Kalamohan &amp; Co to do so, (see Transcript,
                    3 December 2009, pages 35-36).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     It is clear to me, having heard and considered
                    the evidence, that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant knew that the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Cheque had been dishonoured on 30 May
                    2007, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant did not repudiate the Option
                    but instead told the Plaintiff that they would discuss it further when he
                    returned from holiday, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant instructed
                    the Agent nonetheless to try and persuade the Plaintiff to go through with the
                    sale, the Agent did so, the Plaintiff changed her mind and pursuant to her
                    instructions, the Agent brought the Plaintiff to Krishna, the Defendants, with
                    full knowledge of the facts, and having been advised of their rights upon their
                    return from holiday, decided to go ahead with the sale of the Apartment
                    nonetheless and the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant instructed Krishna
                    to proceed with the sale and ask for an extension of the completion date and
                    release of the 4% of the purchase price from the stakeholding obligation. The
                    Defendants only changed their minds when the Plaintiff did not accede to their
                    requests. I also find that there are two reasons why the Defendants changed
                    their minds. The first is because the Plaintiff refused to postpone completion
                    and to agree to early release of the 4% Option fee. Secondly, because the prices
                    of properties, including the Apartment, had risen. There were Freudian slips by
                    the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant under cross-examination. Counsel
                    was not asking about property prices at all, but was asking the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant about the contents of Kalamohan
                    &amp; Co’s letters when the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant
                    gratuitously said:</p>

                                went up to $800,000 because within the period when I left the

<p class="Judg-1">Again when being cross-examined on his partial repayment of the
                    capital sum and the 13 June 2007 letter, the 1<sup>st</sup>
                    Defendant again gratuitously said:</p>

                                completed the sale on the 15<sup>th</sup> of June,

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The underlined words above also show the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant’s cavalier attitude to his
                    contractual undertakings with regard to the sale of his properties. It is clear
                    that money is very important to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant,
                    (see also the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant’s AEIC, [9(ii)]
                    where he states that the Defendants sold the Apartment far below the market
                    value of $680,000).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The Defendants rely heavily on the proposition
                    that the Plaintiff’s 1<sup>st</sup> Cheque was given
                    specifically <em>in consideration for the grant</em> of the
                    Option and when the Plaintiff countermanded payment on the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Cheque, the Option failed altogether for want
                    of consideration and the Defendants were no longer contractually bound by the
                    Option. The Option in this case stated, in paragraph 1:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b><em>In consideration of</em></b> the sum of <b><em>dollars</em></b> six thousand three hundred and fifty
                            <b><em>paid by you to me this day</em></b> by way of
                            <b><em>option money</em></b>, <b><em>we</em></b>, Kumar Muthukumaran s/o Varthan and Indira d/o Srinivasa
                        Naidu, the undersigned <b><em>hereby grant to the Purchaser
                            this option</em></b>, which shall be valid until 4.00 pm on 13/6/07
                        (herein called “the expiry date”) to purchase the property at
                        the price of dollars six hundred and thirty five thousand only.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Defendants cite <em>Mohamed Ali s/o Abdul Razak v
                        Tan Ah Bee</em> [2009] SGHC 279 at [23] as authority for
                    this proposition:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Plaintiff’s Option cheque was delivered to Phyllis Ng on
                        4 June 2009 in exchange for the delivery to him of the signed Option.
                        It is quite settled current practice in relation to options to purchase land
                        in Singapore that the tender of a cheque in exchange for the grant of an
                        option is good tender for the payment of the option money, whilst the
                        exercise of an option is customarily effected by payment to the nominated
                        solicitors. See <em>Wong Fook Heng v Amixco Asia Pte
                            Ltd</em> [1992] 2 SLR 342 per Lai Kew Chai J …

                            Pte Ltd v Loh Chun Seng</em> [1993] 3 SLR 498.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Defendants rely on the statement of law emphasized above. However,
                    their reliance on this statement is misplaced. That statement has to be read in
                    context. In the first place, the facts there were quite different. The purchaser
                    gave his cheque to the agent, but unknown to the purchaser, the vendor, in
                    addition to setting a date, had also set a time limit, <em>ie</em>, 4 pm, within which the agent could accept the option fee in
                    exchange for the option. The vendor did not wish to go through with the sale
                    because the option fee, paid by way of cheque, was handed to the agent there at
                    6.45 pm. The vendor therefore returned the cheque to the purchaser. The question
                    was whether a vendor could do so and therefore render his option invalid and
                    defeat a claim for specific performance. The issues were therefore different,
                    see Pillai JC’s judgment at [7]. Secondly, the option in <em>Mohamed Ali</em>’s case had a specific paragraph which
                    provided that if the “option money” (defined as the money paid in
                    exchange for the option in the first paragraph), is not honoured on first
                    presentment, the vendor was entitled to treat the contract as having been
                    repudiated and the vendor was thereupon entitled to rescind the contract or
                    affirm the contract. There is no such clause in this Option. Similarly,
                        <em>Wong Fook Heng v Amixco Asia Pte Ltd</em> [1992]
                    2 SLR 342, is of no assistance to the Defendants. That case stands as
                    authority for the well known proposition that the vendor was entitled to sue on
                    a cheque paid for the option fee even though the purchaser had repudiated the
                    underlying option contract and countermanded payment of the option cheque. This
                    proposition is unremarkable because a cheque is a bill of exchange and remains a
                    separate and distinct cause of action from the underlying contract. The issue of
                    whether dishonour of a cheque given to obtain an option automatically discharges
                    the option was not an issue in this case. Mr Joseph is, with respect, wrong
                    when he relies on these authorities and submits that when the Plaintiff
                    countermanded payment on her 1<sup>st</sup> Cheque, she had by
                    her action repudiated the contract, and no further act was necessary from the
                    Defendants because once she did that, the Option failed to survive and all the
                    terms therein do not survive. There was, according to his submission, an
                        <em>automatic</em> discharge of the Option as a
                    contract once the Plaintiff countermanded payment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     There is no principle of law that the tender
                    of a cheque in exchange for an option for the sale of property, subsequently
                    dishonoured, would automatically discharge the option contract and no longer
                    bind the grantor of the option, unless of course the payment of the option fee
                    is expressly made a condition precedent for the coming into existence of the
                    option or a condition subsequent which expressly provides that failure to pay
                    automatically discharges the option. This Option contains no condition precedent
                    or condition subsequent of this nature. On the contrary, <em>Mohamed Ali</em> and <em>Wong Fook Heng</em>
                    stand for the proposition that payment by cheque for the option is good payment
                    for the option money. This must mean that with the tender of the cheque and
                    handing over of the signed option, the contract came into being.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     In the past there have been some differences
                    of opinion on the nature of an option in relation to the sale and purchase of
                    real property: is there one contract or two contracts, is the option an
                    irrevocable offer to sell for the duration of the option period, is the sale and
                    purchase contract a conditional contract, the condition being the exercise of
                    the option in accordance with its tenor? Is this one contract with two stages, a
                    unilateral contract at the first stage and a synallagmatic contract at the
                    second stage which comes into being upon exercise of the option? Hoffman J
                    (as he then was) in <em>Spiro v Glencrown Properties
                        Ltd</em> [1991] 1 Ch 537 at 543 stated that from the
                    purchaser’s view, it is an irrevocable offer whereas from the
                    vendor’s view it is a conditional contract, but said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…the underlying principles are clear enough. The granting of an
                        option imposes no obligation upon the purchaser and an obligation upon the
                        vendor which is contingent upon the exercise of the option. When the option
                        is exercised, vendor and purchaser come under obligations to perform as if
                        they had concluded the ordinary contract of sale. And the analogy of an
                        irrevocable offer is, as I have said, a useful way of describing the
                        position of the purchaser between the grant and exercise of the option
                        … But the irrevocable metaphor has much less explanatory power in
                        relation to the position of the vendor. The effect of the
                        ‘offer’ which the vendor has made is, from his point of view, so
                        different from that of an offer in its primary sense that the metaphor is of
                        little assistance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In <em>Alrich Development Pte Ltd v Rafiq
                        Jumabhoy</em> [1995] 2 SLR 401, the Court of Appeal accepted
                    this passage and its description of an option to purchase land as a contract for
                    the sale of land contingent upon the exercise of the option; and also said that
                    an option is an unilateral contract along the lines of <em>Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Co</em> [1893] 1 QB 256. The
                    learned authors in Tan Sook Yee’s <em>Principles of Land
                        Law</em> (LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2009) conclude at page 383: “Thus
                    the option is really <em>sui generis</em>...”
                    quoting again from Hoffman J at page 544:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">An option is not strictly speaking either an offer or a conditional
                        contract. It does not have all the incidents of the standard form of either
                        of these concepts. To that extent it is a relationship sui generis. But
                        there are ways in which it resembles each of them. Each analogy is in the
                        proper correct a valid way of characterising the situation created by the
                        option.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     In this case we need to analyse the option
                    stage. What happens to an option, which is stated to be and is in fact given, in
                    exchange for a monetary consideration paid by way of a cheque, and that cheque
                    is subsequently countermanded by the option grantee? The Court of Appeal in
                        <em>Alrich Development</em> said, at page 417:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In our opinion, the option here is a contract, and the
                        revocation of the option by [the Grantor of the option] was a unilateral
                        repudiation of that contract. <b>Such a repudiation, unless
                            it is accepted is of no effect and is a thing ‘writ in
                            water’</b>. In <em>Heyman &amp; Anor v
                            Darwins Ltd</em> [1942] AC 356 at p 361 Viscount
                        Simon LC said succinctly:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">…But repudiation by one party standing alone does not terminate
                            the contract. It takes two to end it, by repudiation, on the one side,
                            and acceptance of the repudiation, on the other.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In this case, the repudiation by [the Vendor] was not accepted and
                        therefore the option survived, exercisable in accordance with its terms. It
                        was exercised by [the nominee of the purchaser] and thus there arose a
                        contract which [the nominee of the purchaser are now claiming.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">For the purposes of this case therefore, the option is a contract, the
                    consideration is the option fee paid by cheque, and in exchange, the vendor
                    promises to keep open the offer to sell the property on agreed terms, for a
                    certain period. During that period the vendor cannot revoke the offer, nor can
                    he offer the property to anyone else. Unless there are express conditions
                    precedent or conditions subsequent, the countermanding of the cheque which is
                    given in exchange for the option, amounts to a repudiation of that contract by
                    the purchaser. The vendor is put to election, within a reasonable time, whether
                    to accept the repudiation, terminate the contract and sue for damages or to
                    affirm the contract and sue for damages. If the vendor does nothing the contract
                    remains afoot, <em>a fortiori</em> if having done nothing,
                    the purchaser meanwhile makes good the option money by tendering it to the
                    vendor or the vendor’s authorised agent, be it the property agent or more
                    likely, his solicitor, who accepts it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Mr Daniel and Mr Coomaraswamy SC
                    referred me to quite a number of authorities to back up their propositions;
                    these include <em>Lim Hwee Meng v Citadel Investment Pte
                        Ltd</em> [1998] 3 SLR 601 at [35] – [37]; <em>Joseph Mathew &amp; Anor v Singh Chiranjeev &amp; Anor</em>
                    [2009] SGCA 51 and [2009] 2 SLR 73 especially at [21] and
                    [22]; <em>Min Hong Auto Supply Ltd v Loh Chun Seng &amp;
                        Anor</em> [1993] 3 SLR 498; and <em>Foo Kee
                        Boo v Ho Lee Investments (Pte) Ltd</em> [1988] SLR 620. I do
                    not think it is necessary to refer to all of them because even though they
                    provide support for the proposition that stopping payment on a cheque which was
                    given in consideration for a contract only amounts to a repudiation of the
                    contract, not an automatic discharge of the contract, the authorities I have
                    cited above are sufficient for the purposes of this judgement. Also, since
                    options for the purchase of land are contracts <em>sui
                        generis</em>, limited guidance can be gleaned from those cases dealing
                    with, for example, contracts requiring a deposit before full
                performance.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The Defendants therefore fail at a number of
                    levels, any one of which is fatal to their defence. First, when the Plaintiff
                    repudiated the option stage of the contract by countermanding payment of the
                    cheque with the intention of backing out of the purchase of the Apartment, which
                    repudiation was communicated to the Defendants, the Defendants were put to
                    election, to accept the repudiation and terminate the contract or to affirm the
                    contract, having in either case, the right to damages. The
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant clearly elected to keep the option
                    stage of the contract alive by what he said to the Plaintiff as well as his
                    instructions to the Agent before he went on holiday. Secondly, even if we put
                    this to one side, when he returned from his holiday, with full knowledge of the
                    facts, he instructed Krishna to proceed with the sale, he even affirmed the
                    contract by asking for a variation of terms, <em>viz</em>,
                    postponing the completion and seeking a release of the option exercise monies
                    from the stakeholder obligation, both through his lawyers to the
                    Plaintiff’s lawyers as well as personally to the Plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The Defendants submitted that Krishna was
                    negligent and acted without mandate in accepting the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Cheque on 8 June 2007 whereas the
                    Option, dated 29 May 2007, expressly provided that the option monies were
                    paid to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant. This submission does not
                    arise in view of my findings of fact. In the event I am wrong, there are at
                    least three answers to this. First, the Option itself provides that the
                    vendor’s solicitors are appointed “…as the vendor’s
                    agent for the collection of the purchase price or any part thereof and all money
                    payable under this option.” Secondly, even after the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant knew of the tender of the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Cheque and the exercise of the Option on
                    11 June 2007, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant affirmed the
                    contract by instructing Krishna to proceed and to ask for a variation of terms.
                    This would amount to waiver with full knowledge of the facts and circumstances.
                    Thirdly, this would also amount to ratification of Krishna’s acts in
                    accepting the 2<sup>nd</sup> Cheque and the exercise of the
                    Option.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     As for the Agent, she acted within the scope
                    of her authority and the instructions given to her by the Defendants. The
                    Defendants have not even begun to discharge the heavy burden of proof in their
                    allegations of false representations, knowing assistance to the Plaintiff to
                    make representations fraudulently or making it carelessly not caring whether
                    they were true or false. She did not induce or mislead Krishna in view of my
                    findings of fact, especially the 1<sup>st</sup>
                    Defendant’s instructions on 30 May 2007 to try and persuade the
                    Plaintiff to go through with the purchase. If I am wrong, and she was under a
                    duty to inform Krishna that there was a 1<sup>st</sup> Cheque
                    that was dishonoured, then I find that the Defendants waived this oversight in
                    proceeding with the sale nonetheless and by doing so, ratified any acts done by
                    the Agent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     For the reasons set out above, I gave
                    judgement for the Plaintiff. I granted her the order for specific performance of
                    the contract for the sale of the Apartment, with the usual order that if the
                    Defendants fail to execute the necessary documents, the Registrar is empowered
                    to do so on the Defendants’ behalf to effect a transfer of the Apartment
                    to the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff has also asked for loss and damage, damages
                    either in lieu of or in addition to specific performance, interest under the Law
                    Society Conditions of Sale 1999, costs and such further or other relief as the
                    court deems fit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     I awarded the Plaintiff interest under
                    Condition 8.2 of the Law Society Conditions of Sale as the sale was not
                    completed as contracted and the delay in completion is due solely to the default
                    of the Defendants as vendors. Under Condition 8.2, interest is payable as
                    liquidated damages for delay. Condition 8.2 provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">8 Late Completion Interest</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">8.2 Interest Payable by Vendor</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">8.2.1</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">If
                            –</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-No">(a)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-Item">the sale is not completed on or before the
                                date fixed for completion; and</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-No">(b)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-Item">the delay in completion is due solely to the
                                default of the Vendor,</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">he must pay interest (as liquidated damages) commencing on the day
                        following the date fixed for completion up to and including the day of
                        actual completion. Interest will be calculated on the purchase price at 10%
                        per annum.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Condition 8 interest has been applied to similar fact situations where
                    specific performance is being claimed as well as Condition 8.2 interest: see
                        <em>eg</em>, <em>Fernhill City
                        Investments Pte Ltd v Lee Keng Huat</em> [1997] SGHC 327,
                        <em>Alivestone Investment Pte Ltd v Splendore Investments Pte
                        Ltd</em> [1996] 1 SLR(R) 678.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The Plaintiff also asked for an account for
                    the rent, if any, and claimed that sum pursuant to Condition 6.2 of the Law
                    Society Conditions of Sale. I initially had some reservation as payment of
                    interest as liquidated damages for delay and being accountable for rent, if
                    there was any, seemed like double damages. However, I awarded the Plaintiff the
                    net rent, if any, after taking into account all the outgoings from the date when
                    completion should have taken place and an account thereof from the Defendants to
                    the Plaintiff. I should point out that I have not had the benefit of
                    counsel’s arguments on this point and on hindsight, I should have asked
                    counsel to address me. Mr. Joseph did not object when Mr Daniel made a
                    claim for this item, nor did he demur when all counsel appeared before me the
                    following evening, with the agreed draft judgement. But I do not criticise or
                    blame Mr Joseph as I should have asked for further argument on my
                    reservation before making such an award. I am only glad that if I am wrong, the
                    Court of Appeal will be able to put that right.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     I now set out my reasons why, I instinctively
                    felt it was fair and just that the Defendants should also account for the net
                    rental, if any.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Mr Daniel based his claim on Condition
                    6.2 of the Law Society Conditions of Sale 1999, but I have my doubts on how
                    Condition 6 is to work in the circumstances of this case. I find Condition 6
                    quite confusing. Condition 6 provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>6       Outgoings, Rents and
                                Profits until

<p class="Judg-1">It will be noticed straightaway that Clause 6.1 strangely does not
                    provide who is entitled to the rents and profits up to completion. One would
                    have expected the rents and outgoings to go hand-in-hand and for it to be belong
                    to the vendor up to and including the completion date. Condition 6.2 on the
                    other hand provides, as one would expect, that after the date fixed for
                    completion, the purchaser must discharge all outgoings <em>and</em> will be entitled to all rents and profits (and possession).
                    However, Condition 6.2 is made subject to Condition 6.3 which draws a
                    distinction between contractual completion and <em>actual</em> completion; it provides that the purchaser is not to be
                    let into <em>actual</em> possession or the receipt of rents
                    and profits until the date of <em>actual</em>
                    completion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Nonetheless, does Condition 6.3 indicate that
                    if there is delayed completion, the purchaser is not entitled to possession nor
                    the rent or profits generated by the property until actual completion? If so,
                    then like the converse of Condition 6.1, Condition 6.3 does not provide who is
                    responsible for the outgoings during the period after contract completion and
                    actual completion. Perhaps that is why Condition 6.4 states that “where
                    necessary”, the outgoings, rent and profits are to be apportioned between
                    the parties. Whilst Condition 6.4 may or may not have its origins due to the old
                    Common Law rule that rents cannot be apportioned in respect of time, the phrase
                    “where necessary” remains the current yardstick to apportion rent
                    and profits. That does not help much in construing Conditions 6.2 and 6.3. The
                    plain reading is that, leaving aside the outgoings, Condition 6.3 envisages that
                    the purchaser is not entitled to possession, the rents or profits before
                        <em>actual</em> possession under these Conditions.
                    However, when it comes to payment of Condition 8.2.1 interest by way of
                    liquidated damages for delay in completion, Condition 8.2.2 provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">8.2.2 If the Vendor has delivered vacant possession of
                            the property before the date of actual completion, then the interest
                            payable to the Purchaser will be reduced by a sum equivalent to a rent
                            calculated on the annual value of the property fixed under the Property
                            Tax Act (Cap 254)</p>
<p class="Judg-1">By implication, and contrary to Condition 6.3, early possession
                    can be given to the purchaser. Condition 8.2.2 can be looked upon either as
                    reduction of liquidated damages in cases where vacant possession has been given
                    before the date of actual completion, thereby protecting it from attack as a
                    penalty or perhaps as indicating that one cannot obtain the rent and profits in
                    addition to the liquidated damages of 10% per annum on the purchase price for
                    the period of delay. In either case it has no application to the facts at hand
                    because on a plain reading Condition 8.2.2 deals with a situation where there is
                    late completion but early physical possession is given to the purchaser who is
                    an owner occupier.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     It is interesting to look at the precursors of
                    Condition 6. Condition 6 of the 1981 Law Society Conditions of Sale read as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">6    The outgoings will be discharged by the Vendor down
                            to but excluding the date fixed for completion, as from which day all
                            outgoings shall be discharged by and the rents and profits or possession
                            shall belong to the Purchaser, (such outgoings, rents and profits, if
                            necessary, being apportioned) but the Purchaser shall nevertheless not
                            be let into actual possession or receipt of rents and profits until
                            completion of the purchase, and the Purchaser shall on completion pay to
                            the Vendor a due proportion of the current rents less the like
                            proportion of the current outgoings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This version of Condition 6 makes it reasonably clear that for the
                    rents and profits and outgoings, a line is drawn on the day before contract
                    completion - prior and including the day before completion - up to that day they
                    are the responsibility and for the benefit of the vendor; from the date of
                    completion, they are the responsibility and for the benefit of the purchaser,
                    with an apportionment of outgoings, rents and profits accordingly. That makes
                    sense. It then goes on to provide that the purchaser is not entitled to actual
                    possession, the rents or profits until completion of the purchase. The last
                    portion of Condition 6 deals with the situation where rents and outgoings are
                    paid at intervals which do not neatly coincide with the completion date.
                    Arguably this is already covered by the provision in parenthesis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     In 1994 the Law Society Singapore’s
                    Conditions of Sale were amended and Condition 6 provided as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">6    The outgoings will be discharged by the Vendor down
                            to and including the date fixed for completion, after which day all
                            outgoings shall be discharged by and the rents and profits or possession
                            shall belong to the Purchaser, (such outgoings, rents and profits, if
                            necessary, being apportioned) but the Purchaser shall nevertheless not
                            be let into actual possession or receipt of rents and profits until the
                            date of actual completion of the purchase.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a>The change was that for rents, profits and outgoings, the line
                        was now drawn on the date fixed for completion and not the day before. The
                        last portion of the old 1981 Condition 6 was deleted, as noted above,
                        probably because the words in parenthesis would have catered for the
                        eventuality that the rents and outgoings did not coincide with the
                        completion date.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     In <em>Law Relating to Specific
                        Contracts in Singapore</em>, (Michael Hwang SC editor-in-chief) (Sweet
                    &amp; Maxwell Asia, 2008), Kelvin F K Low in his chapter on the Sale of Land,
                    citing English authorities, states generally:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">12.10.16 General. Where completion is delayed, adjustments must be made to
                        the rights of the parties in respect of the period between the date fixed
                        for completion and that of actual completion. In principle, a purchaser
                        enjoys the income and suffers the outgoings of the property and the vendor
                        is entitled to interest on the price as if completion had taken place on the
                        contractual date.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">12.10.17 Apportionment. The vendor must account to the purchaser for all
                        rents and other profits out of the property accrued due since the date fixed
                        for completion in the contract. Where the vendor is the occupier, he must
                        pay a fair occupation rent for the period between the contractual date for
                        completion and the actual date for completion, unless the delay is due to
                        the purchaser’s default. On the other hand, the purchaser must repay
                        by the latter in respect of the same period. The [Law Society] Conditions of
                        Sale 1999 does not depart from these rules.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">12.10.18 Interest for late completion. Since it is not right that a
                        purchaser should have the income of the property from the contractual date
                        of completion and yet be relieved from paying interest on the purchase
                        money, a vendor becomes entitled to interest on the balance of the purchase
                        money outstanding until it has been paid to the purchaser. The modern
                        approach to the rate of interest, unless contractually specified, is to take
                        into account the constantly fluctuating interest rates. Where the delay is
                        due to the wilful default of the vendor and the interest exceeds the income
                        of the property, then the purchaser and the vendor may keep the interest and
                        income respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The above principles have much to commend it. The current 1999
                    Condition 6 splits the one clause into 4 sub-clauses and in so doing created,
                    with respect, ambiguities and difficulties pointed out above. It is difficult to
                    apply this Condition where, as here, the date for actual completion has not yet
                    occurred. Conveyancing practitioners will say that in situations where
                    completion has not actually taken place, Condition 6 is of no application. I
                    agree with that approach and prefer to base my decision on other
                grounds.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     The first ground rests on whether Condition 8,
                    which provides for liquidated damages for delay in completing, is the only
                    remedy. There is no express provision that says so in the Law Society Conditions
                    of Sale 1999. There are many instances where liquidated damages for delay cater
                    for just that, delay, and the innocent party is entitled to pursue other heads
                    of damages apart from delay damages. For example, in a voyage charterparty,
                    where charterers are obliged to load a full and complete cargo at a stipulated
                    daily rate of loading, demurrage which is calculated on a daily basis, is
                    payable for every day of detention of the ship beyond the time stipulated for
                    loading or discharging at that rate. If the rate of loading is not met and the
                    vessel is delayed, and as a result crosses into winter where because of
                    legislation the vessel can only carry a reduced load, this loss of freight can
                    also be claimed in addition to the demurrage: see <em>Aktieselskabet Reidar v Arcos Ltd</em> [1927] 1 KB 352.
                    Similarly, in a building contract where unsuitable equipment is used by the
                    contractor which leads to major structural defects resulting in the suspension
                    of work and extensive remedial work being required before it could be completed,
                    the owners are not limited to the liquidated damages stipulated for delay; they
                    were entitled to claim financing charges as well: see <em>Chanthall Investments Ltd v F G Minter Ltd</em> 1976,SC 73. If these
                    defective works also caused the owners to have to pay damages to other
                    contractors involved in the project whose works were affected by these defects,
                    these are claims not related to delays but defective works and recoverable. Also
                    if a building contract on the RIBA/JCT 1977 Form provided for 5 completion dates
                    for 5 distinct areas but the contract provided for one completion date and
                    liquidated damages are based on that one date for completion and possession, it
                        <em>prima facie</em> does not preclude unliquidated
                    damages for delays to the earlier phases and completion dates: see <em>E Turner &amp; Sons Ltd v Mathind Ltd</em> (1989)
                    5 Const LJ 273.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     So the question is whether rental is something
                    apart from liquidated damages for delay. Is this an alternative remedy or is it
                    a cumulative remedy?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     If the property was rented out during the
                    period of delay then the position is in my view different because once a
                    contract for the sale of real property, which can be enforced by specific
                    performance, has been entered into, in the period before completion, the vendor
                    becomes a qualified trustee of the property for the purchaser who has equitable
                    ownership of the land through the doctrine of conversion; see <em>British &amp; Malayan Trustees Ltd v Sindo Realty Pte Ltd</em> [1999]
                    1 SLR(R) 61 at [66], <em>Lim Kim Som v Sheriffa Taibah
                        bte Abdul Rahman</em> [1994] 1 SLR(R) 233 and <em>Chen Kon Ling-Tony v Quay Properties Pte Ltd</em> [2004]
                    2 SLR 181 endorsing <em>Lysaght v Edwards</em>
                    (1876) 2 Ch D 499. It is a qualified trust because it does not have
                    all the usual incidents of a bare trustee, <em>eg</em>, the
                    trustee has his own interest in receiving the purchase price which he is
                    entitled to protect and he has a lien on the property until he has been paid his
                    purchase money. But there is no doubt that the property itself is held as by a
                    trustee. Thus if before completion the vendor wrongfully sells the property to
                    another person, he was accountable to the first purchaser for the purchase money
                    as a trust and was entitled to pursue tracing of the purchase money rather than
                    pursue his remedy in damages: see <em>Lake v Bayliss &amp;
                        Anor</em> [1974] 1 WLR 1073. On this basis, the Defendants
                    are accountable for the rent to the Plaintiff as trustees of the Apartment
                    pending completion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     In <em>Personal Representatives
                        of Tang Man Sit v Capacious Investments Ltd</em> [1996]
                    1 AC 514, a Privy Council decision on appeal from Hong Kong, it was
                    said, at 521 that the law frequently affords an injured person more than one
                    remedy for the wrong he has suffered. Sometimes the two remedies are alternative
                    and inconsistent. The classic example is an account of the profits made by the
                    defendant in breach of his fiduciary obligations or damages for the loss
                    suffered by the plaintiff by reason of the same breach. The former is measured
                    by the wrongdoer’s gain and the latter is the measure of the injured
                    party’s loss; (this passage was cited with approval in <em>Main-Line Corporate Holdings Ltd v United Overseas Bank Ltd</em>
                    [2010] 1 SLR 189 at [26]). In that case, Tang, a landowner entered
                    into a joint venture with Kung, through his company, the plaintiff, in 1978 for
                    the construction of 22 houses on Tang’s land. The plaintiff provided the
                    money. The houses were completed in September 1981. By a deed dated
                    20 March 1982, Tang agreed to assign 16 of the houses to the plaintiff. But
                    no deed of assignment was executed. Kung then died and there were some
                    complications with his estate. The houses were originally empty but from 1985,
                    Tang let out some and progressively all of the 16 houses as homes to the elderly
                    without the plaintiff’s knowledge or consent. On an application for
                    summary judgement, a judge granted the plaintiff a declaration that at least
                    from the date of the deed, it was the equitable owner of the 16 houses and,
                    (Tang having died two days before the writ was issued), ordered Tang’s
                    personal representatives to assign the 16 houses to the plaintiff free from
                    encumbrances, with vacant possession and to furnish an account of all secret
                    profits in Tang’s use and letting of the 16 houses and to pay the
                    plaintiff the profits and to pay damages for breach of trust to be assessed. The
                    Privy Council held that the plaintiff was entitled to either an account of the
                    profits in respect of the money received by Tang from letting out the 16 houses
                    or damages for loss of use and occupation, as these were alternative remedies.
                    The plaintiff was also entitled to claim damages for the decrease in the value
                    of the houses as they had deteriorated badly through over-occupation. In
                    addition, since Tang’s estate was unable to assign the houses free from
                    encumbrances, damages were also payable therefor. This Privy Council decision
                    thus shows that other heads of damage may be cumulative remedies and if so, both
                    heads can be claimed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     The Plaintiff here is recovering Condition 8.2
                    interest as liquidated damages for delays in completion. That interest also
                    covers other damages, <em>eg</em>, for rises in the price
                    of property. If the property is not rented out, the Plaintiff is only entitled
                    to the interest under Condition 8.2. However, if the property happens to be
                    rented out, then the Defendants as trustees of the Apartment should be made
                    accountable for the profit, if any. If not, any profit kept by the Defendants
                    goes towards reducing their interest damages under Condition 8.2. It is not
                    difficult to envisage a situation where a vendor deliberately breaches his
                    obligation to complete because not only has the value of the property has
                    suddenly increased but also because the rental obtainable has spiked. In 2007,
                    before the September 2008 financial meltdown, office rentals were reaching dizzy
                    heights of over $20 per square foot per month when only 6 to 12 months earlier
                    they were at $6 per square foot per month. In such a market, would it be fair or
                    just to allow the vendor to make a profit over his 10% per annum liquidated
                    damages? If any party is to make a gain out of the rental, then it should be the
                    innocent party, <em>ie</em>, the Plaintiff. This is based
                    on some very basic notions of what is just and fair in our legal system. In
                        <em>Jia Min Building Construction Pte Ltd v Ann Lee Pte
                        Ltd</em> [2004] 3 SLR(R) 288, V K Rajah JC, as he then was,
                    said at [60]: “This principle applies to all facets of the common law and
                    has its origins in Roman Law – “<em>Nullus commodum
                        capere potest de injuria sua propria</em>”. In <em>Jowitt’s Dictionary of English Law</em> (John Burke ed)
                    (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2nd Ed, 1977) at p 1266, this maxim is explained thus:
                    “(No one can gain an advantage by his own wrong.) The maxim goes much
                    further than to say merely that no man shall profit by his own fraud: he is not
                    allowed to profit by his own mistake” We are also referred to two other
                    maxims in the Dictionary (at pp 1230 and 1263 respectively):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Nemo ex suo delicto meliorem suam conditionem facere
                            potest</em> … (No one can improve his position by his own
                        wrongdoing.) English law also acts on this principle; and so where the
                        existence of a cause of action is, by the fraud of the person who creates
                        it, concealed from the person who could take advantage of it, then the
                        Limitation Act, 1939, will begin to run only as from the date when the fraud
                        is or could reasonably have been discovered.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Nul prendra advantage de son tort demesne</em>
                        (No man shall profit by wrong that he does.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">These old underlying or foundational principles in our law still guide
                    us today when exceptional circumstances arise. I need only cite two examples.
                    For example, it allows a court to give, exceptionally, exemplary or punitive
                    damages, for defamation where two persons deliberately cause a company, owned
                    and controlled by them, not to make full and frank disclosure to scheme
                    creditors so as to obtain their un-informed consent to the scheme, and who
                    deliberately flouted their statutory duty and assurance given to the court to
                    explain the accounts by telling deliberate half-truths to mislead scheme
                    creditors and the court in approving the scheme and to hide their culpability by
                    blaming others for the disappearance of the company’s funds when the two
                    of them were in fact responsible for the same: see <em>Lim Eng
                        Hock Peter v Lin Jian Wei and Anor</em> [2009] SGCA 48.
                    Secondly, a court is no longer limited to compensatory damages for breach of
                    contract based on expectation or reliance interest, it can, in appropriate and
                    exceptional cases, award restitutionary damages: see <em>Attorney-General v Blake</em> [2001] 1 AC 268, <em>Experience Hendrix LLC v PPX Enterprise Inc</em> [2003]
                    1 All ER (Comm) 830, <em>Esso Petroleum Co Ltd v Niad
                        Ltd</em> [2001] All ER (D) 324, <em>O’Brien Homes Ltd v Lane</em>
                [2004] EWHC 303.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     This is an exceptional case with not only no
                    merit but also with all the demerits on one side. I must not be taken to be
                    laying down any general rule that in all circumstances, purchasers will be
                    entitled to claim an account for rental in addition to their Law Society
                    Conditions of Sale liquidated damages under Condition 8.2. In many cases there
                    will be legitimate and respectable argument, <em>eg</em>,
                    on whether title is in order or whether requisitions were satisfactory or
                    whether the property is affected by any public authority reserves. The
                    Defendants’ breach here belongs to the category of deliberate and cynical
                    wrongdoing; they deliberately refused to go through with the sale because of
                    monetary considerations and without any legitimate reason. It involved
                    proprietary rights and trust. They brought three parties to court, cast
                    unwarranted aspersions on these parties and they lied on numerous aspects of
                    their defence as well as manufactured evidence. I see no reason why any court
                    should allow them to keep the rental income from their conduct in deliberately
                    breaching their clear contractual obligations in such a cavalier manner. If only
                    interest was payable for this kind of breach, then the Defendants will be able
                    to keep the rental and profits to lower their damages. As noted above, in an
                    exceptional market, they will make a profit. That does not seem just or fair in
                    the circumstances of this particular case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Not having had the benefit of counsels’
                    submissions on any of the above, I say no more, but leave the final decision in
                    better hands. I hope that counsel will, in addition to full submissions on these
                    and other points before the Court of Appeal, have ready agreed information like
                    whether the Apartment was in fact rented out, the outgoings and rental, the
                    interest earned on the balance purchase price and other relevant details that
                    may assist the Court of Appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Order for Indemnity Costs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     I was initially not minded to order indemnity
                    costs. However, having heard counsels’ submissions and after retiring for
                    a while to reflect on the reasons put forward, I agreed. The principles on which
                    a court would order indemnity costs are settled. There must be compelling
                    reasons and this includes exceptional circumstances or a special case to do so.
                    The Supreme Court Practice 2009, at [59/27/5], states that factors which justify
                    indemnity costs include litigation which is conducted by the party paying in a
                    dishonest, acrimonious or otherwise improper manner and the absence of
                    merit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     In my judgement, all these criteria have been
                    satisfied. The Defendants chose to maintain their pleaded case against the
                    Plaintiff, the Solicitors and the Agent when material parts of their case had no
                    evidence to support the same. The Defendants have also blatantly maintained they
                    had no knowledge of the 1<sup>st</sup> Cheque being dishonoured,
                    that they were tricked by the Plaintiff, surreptitiously handing the
                    unsuspecting Krishna, a 2<sup>nd</sup> Cheque with the knowing
                    assistance and fraudulent misrepresentation of the Agent, and that Krishna had
                    acted without mandate, wrote two letters without instructions whatsoever and
                    then refused to obey their instructions not to proceed with the sale. All these
                    are, unfortunately, blatant untruths. The 1<sup>st</sup>
                    Defendant has been caught out lying time and again on very material allegations
                    of his case. The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant refused to produce the
                    original DBS Bank letter, which he had discussed with Krishna in his office on
                    11 June 2007, and then fabricated the 16 June 2007 letter. He not only
                    blamed Krishna for mistakes, but also Mr Kalamohan and gave this,
                        (<em>ie</em>, Mr Kalamohan’s mistakes), as
                    one of his reasons for discharging Mr Kalamohan and changing lawyers to
                    Mr Joseph. There were Freudian slips in 1<sup>st</sup>
                    Defendant’s evidence during cross-examination which showed the true reason
                    for the Defendants’ actions – money.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     The Defendants have no respect for the law or
                    the legal process and think they can concoct multiple lies in their pleadings,
                    their AEIC and in the oral evidence, hide documents and fabricate evidence to
                    suit their ends. As I have noted above, the 1<sup>st</sup>
                    Defendant is not an ignorant person, on the contrary, he is a shrewd and
                    intelligent businessman, although he puts up a front of being very humble and
                    not very well versed in commercial matters. He made a mockery of his affirmation
                    to tell the truth. For these reasons, I awarded indemnity costs to the
                    Plaintiff, the Solicitors and the Agent against the Defendants.</p>
