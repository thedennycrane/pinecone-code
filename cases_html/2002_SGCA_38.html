appellant’s property would entail undue delay and expense.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Held, </p></b>granting the respondents’ application:

<p align="justify" xmlns="">(1)        The power granted to the

court by O 57 r 3(4) confers an unfettered discretion to the court to make orders as it

deems "fit". This concept of "fit" must encompass the notion of what

is just in all the circumstances (see  17-18)</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(2)        Foreign residency is a

ground warranting the imposition of further security for costs if there would be undue

delay and expense in enforcing an order for costs, since the whole point of ordering a

foreign plaintiff or appellant to furnish security is to ensure that a fund would be

available within the jurisdiction of this court against which a successful defendant or

respondent could enforce the order for costs (see 19, 27), <i>De Bry v Fitzgerald </i>[1990] 1 All ER 560 and <i>Porzelack KG v Porzelack (UK) Ltd </i>[1987] 1 WLR 420 followed.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(3)        The merits of the appeal

are also a valid factor for consideration in determining whether it is just to order that

further security be furnished. Here, it had been assumed that there could be some merits

in the appeal. (see 29)</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(4)        Another factor to be

considered is if the application is so late that the bulk of the costs have already been

incurred by the appellant. The court would look at whether there was a satisfactory

explanation by the appellant, in the absence of which the application may be refused. (see

20)</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(5)        In the present case, the

appellant’s previous conduct evidenced an intention to resist vigorously an order for

costs if made against her and it was likely that she would make it difficult for any

enforcement of such order to take place. It was notable that in her affidavit filed to

oppose the application, she was silent concerning the respondents’ allegations that

she did not intend to satisfy the judgement debt and/or costs awarded against her. In

addition, her conduct in relation to the attempts by the respondents’ to satisfy

their judgment debt gave the impression that she was trying to evade enforcement action.

(see 14, 24-25)</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(6)        The respondents had only

made their application when it became clear from the appellant’s conduct that she was

likely to resist enforcement of an order for costs against her; hence, there could not be

said to be a delay in the making of the application (see 21,22)</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(7)        Enforcement of an order

for costs against the appellant was also likely to give rise to undue delay and expense

for two reasons: Firstly, there is no arrangement for reciprocal enforcement of judgments

between Singapore and USA, where the appellant is resident; secondly, the ruling in <i>Malayan

Banking</i> meant that the fact that the appellant was a joint tenant of a private

residential property in Singapore would not obviate there from being difficulties in

enforcement of an order for costs (see 26)</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(8)        It was also clear that

the appellant was a person with means, hence there was no danger of her appeal being

stifled by an order to furnish security. In view of all the circumstances, an order to the

appellants to furnish further security of $30,000 was appropriate and just. (see

27-28)</p>

<p xmlns="">1        This was an application by way of a motion,

filed by the respondent, in Civil Appeal No. 15/2002 for an order to require the appellant

to furnish further security for the costs of the appeal. After hearing the parties, we

allowed the motion by ordering that a further security of $30,000 be furnished by the

appellant. The standard security of $10,000 was already furnished when the notice of

appeal was filed. We now give our reasons.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Background</p>
</b>
<p xmlns="">2        The appellant, Shirley Ooi Ching Ling

(Shirley Ooi), is a substantial shareholder in a British Virgin Island company, Pacific

Rim Trading Ltd (Pacific Rim). It is an investment company. Pacific Rim, in turn, held

shares of a Californian company, Agate Technologies Inc (Agate), which is involved in the

development of software technology. Shirley Ooi is a shareholder of Pacific Rim and a

director of both Pacific Rim and Agate.</p>
<p xmlns="">3        In June 1996, Shirley Ooi offered to sell

to one Jamilah Binti Abu Bakar (Jamilah) 750,000 shares in Agate. The respondent company,

Just Gems Inc (JGI), was incorporated by Jamilah also in British Virgin Island to hold the

Agate shares for Jamilah. Some two months later, Shirley Ooi offered to Jamilah about 22%

of Pacific Rim shares (or the equivalent of 1,000,000 Agate shares) for a sum of

US$500,000. This latter offer was accepted. Payment was to be by instalments. Jamilah

claimed that on 16 September 1996, she paid US$200,000 into Shirley Ooi’s Citibank

account. This was followed by US$250,000 on 6 November 1996 and US$100,000 on 20 November

1996. In total, US$550,000 was paid. It was explained that an excess of US$50,000 was paid

by mistake. The Pacific Rim shares so bought by Jamilah were to be registered in the name

of JGI.</p>
<p xmlns="">4        On the other hand, Shirley Ooi asserted

that only US$450,000 had been paid. Eventually, a total of 126,001 shares in Pacific Rim

were, by mistake, registered in the name of Jamilah. Following a capital restructuring,

this shareholding of Jamilah became 900,007 shares, representing slightly more than 20% of

the shares in Pacific Rim. Despite numerous requests, and Shirley Ooi’s promise that

the shares would be transferred and registered in the name of the respondent, JGI, this

was never done. JGI instituted the present action seeking a declaration that the contract

between JGI and Shirley Ooi was void for a total failure of consideration, as JGI never

became a shareholder of Pacific Rim. It also asked for the return of the US$550,000 paid

to Shirley Ooi.</p>
<p xmlns="">5        The trial judge, Judith Prakash J, found

that a contract was concluded between JGI and Shirley Ooi; that the contract was void due

to a failure of consideration, and that Shirley Ooi should return the US$550,000 to JGI.

Shirley Ooi was dissatisfied with the decision and has appealed, and which appeal is

pending.</p>
<p xmlns="">6        On 21 May 2002, JGI applied by motion for

further security for costs in a sum of S$100,000. On 2 July 2002, this was refused by a

single Judge exercising the powers under s 36(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act

(SCJA). Following that refusal, JGI applied to this Court to review the decision of the

single Judge and asked that the application for further security be granted.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Grounds for application</p>
</b>
<p xmlns="">7        The grounds upon which JGI sought to obtain

further security for costs fell under three main heads. 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(i) Shirley Ooi is not ordinarily resident in Singapore;</p>
<p align="justify">(ii) the conduct of Shirley Ooi showed that she was evasive and did not

  want to satisfy the judgment debt owed by her and was likely to resist any enforcement of

  any order for costs; and</p>
<p align="justify">(iii) although she has an asset in Singapore, in the form of a flat

  jointly owned with her husband, enforcement of any order on costs would be protracted and

  expensive.</p>
</ol>
<p xmlns="">8        It was not in dispute that Shirley Ooi was

and is ordinarily resident in California, USA. According to her solicitors, she has been

residing in USA "for at least the past six years", if not longer. She is the

Chief Financial Officer of Agate.</p>
<p xmlns="">9        JGI also referred to the following facts

regarding the residential address of Shirley Ooi. In her affidavit of evidence-in-chief

she stated her address to be care of 519 Montague Expressway, Milipitas, CA 95035, the

company address of Agate. At the trial she stated on oath that she resided at 1600

Carmentia Road, Cerritos, California 90703, which was not the case. In her certificate for

security for costs, the address 16000 Carmentia Road was given as a "care of"

address. Then, by a search through the INTERNET, for the purposes of levying execution on

the judgment obtained against Shirley Ooi, JGI discovered the correct address to be

"16000 Carmenita Road", and not "16000 Carmentia Road" and that the

address was the address of Agate. </p>
<p xmlns="">10        On 6 March 2002, JGI’s solicitors,

M/s Peter Low, Tang &amp; Belinda Ang (PL), requested Shirley Ooi, through her Singapore

solicitors, M/s Arthur Loke Bernard Rada &amp; Lee (AL), to pay up the judgment sum. It

drew no response whatsoever. On 26 April 2002, JGI served a copy of an order to examine

the judgment debtor on Shirley Ooi’s Singapore solicitors. On the same day, PL asked

AL if they had instructions to accept service of a statutory demand on Shirley Ooi. On 29

April 2002 AL replied to advise that they had no instruction to accept service of the

order to examine the judgment debtor or the statutory demand.</p>
<p xmlns="">11        On 10 May 2002, PL sought to serve a

garnishee application on Shirley Ooi’s solicitors, AL. Again, AL replied stating that

they had no instructions to accept service.</p>
<p xmlns="">12        JGI submitted that by her conduct, Shirley

Ooi clearly evinced an intention not to pay the judgment sum and also intended to make it

as difficult and/or costly as possible for JGI to enforce the judgment sum or any order on

costs. AL were and are, at all times, acting for her in relation to her appeal and could

very well have accepted service on her behalf. Yet she chose not to instruct them to do

so.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Appellant’s contentions</p>
</b>
<p xmlns="">13        In her affidavit filed to oppose the

application, Shirley Ooi, after giving her address, as "care of 895 Dove Street, 3<sup>rd</sup>

Floor, Irvine CA 92660", made the following points:- 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(i) The notice of appeal was lodged on 28 February 2002. If JGI

  required further security, the request should have been made, and the application should

  have been filed, earlier. JGI’s solicitors only wrote to AL asking for further

  security for the costs of the appeal on 15 May 2002.</p>
<p align="justify">(ii) As she often travelled in relation to her work, and as the

  assigned mailbox for her apartment was invariably small, it was convenient that her

  mailing address be her office address. Because she had always used Agate’s office

  address as her address for general correspondence, she adopted the same for the purposes

  of the action and this appeal. Thus the indication "care-of".</p>
<p align="justify">(iii) She had to change her place of residence whenever the office of

  Agate moved. She wanted to live near to her place of work so that less time would be spent

  on commuting. Sometimes she moved because the place she was staying was not satisfactory.</p>
</ol>
<p xmlns="">14        We would observe that what was significant

about Shirley Ooi’s affidavit was not what she said but what she did not say. We were

aware that she did insert this caveat in her affidavit: "the mere fact that I have

not commented on a particular paragraph or part thereof should not be taken to mean that I

agree with its contents." Apart from the allegation about her address, the other main

point raised by JGI was the accusation that she did not intend to satisfy the judgment

debt and/or the order on costs and this was exemplified by the fact that she refused to

appoint her solicitors to accept service of enforcement process on her behalf. Her caveat

was that her silence must not be taken as agreement. But her failure to rebut the

accusation, or explain her conduct, certainly left us with the impression that there was

probably no satisfactory explanation.</p>
<p xmlns="">15        Before us, Shirley Ooi made the following

two main arguments against the ordering of any further security:- 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(i) the application for further security was made too late and the

  appellant had already incurred substantial costs of the appeal;</p>
<p align="justify">(ii) the appellant, though resident in USA for the last six years, is a

  Singapore citizen and is a joint owner, with her husband, of a private residential

  property here worth many times more than what JGI asked as further security. It was

  purchased some twenty years ago for S$200,000.</p>
</ol>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The Law</p>
</b>
<p xmlns="">16        Order 57 r 3(4) provides that the Court of

Appeal may "at any time, in any case where it thinks fit", order further

security for costs to be given. The power given to the Court here is clearly wider than

the corresponding rule in England then (before the introduction of the English Civil

Procedure Rules 1998). The then English O 59 r 10(5) provided that the Court of Appeal

might "in special circumstances, order that such security shall be given for the

costs of an appeal as may be just."</p>
<p xmlns="">17        Under the then English requirement, the

following were considered to be "special circumstances" , e.g., insolvency or

impecuniousity; difficulty or expense in enforcing costs order; abuse of the process of

the Court. Of course, even if an applicant for costs established a recognised head of

"special circumstances", it did not follow that the court must grant the further

security asked for. The court still had a discretion in the matter. Here, we would like to

quote from the <i>Supreme Court Practice (1999 Edn) at para 59/10/39</i>:- 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The approach which the Court adopts is that, if one of the heads of

  special circumstances is established and the appellant is able to furnish security for

  costs (either from his own resources or with financial assistance from someone else), then

  security should be ordered. The view taken is that if the appellant can furnish the

  security, then he should be ordered to do so in fairness to the respondent, and there is

  no good reason for invoking the residual discretion.</p>
<p align="justify">Where, however, an appellant contends that security should not be

  awarded because it would prevent him pursuing his appeal, he has to satisfy the Court not

  only that he is unable to furnish security for costs from his own resources, but also (and

  the onus of proof is on him on this issue), that he is unable to raise the money

  elsewhere; in assessing whether he could raise the money elsewhere the Court adopts the

  same rigorous approach as in the O 14 case of <i>York Motors v Edwards</i> [1982] 1 WLR

  444 at 449 and 450; [1982] 1 All ER 1024, at 1027 and 1028, HL. In addition, the appellant

  has to demonstrate that his appeal has a sufficiently good chance of success to justify

  exposing the respondent to the injustice of having to bear his own costs win or lose. The

  appeal does not have to be bound to succeed, but to satisfy the merits test for the

  exercise of the residual discretion the grounds of appeal must be "real and

  substantial".</p>
</ol>
<p xmlns="">18        In view of the fact that our rule is

worded more widely than the then English rule, it must follow that a respondent who asks

for further security from the appellant under our provision need not necessarily show

"special circumstances". The rule gives an unfettered discretion to the court to

make such orders as it thinks "fit". It seems to us that the term

"fit" must encompass the concept of what is "just" in all the

circumstances. We do not think it would be desirable, nor possible, to circumscribe such a

wide discretion by any specific categorisation or criteria, other than the broad concept

that further security should only be ordered where in all the circumstances it is

"just" to do so.</p>
<p xmlns="">19        Under our rules, foreign residency is a

factor which may warrant the imposition of security for costs of a trial (O 23) or further

security in respect of an appeal. But it also does not follow that just because an

appellant is resident abroad, that security must be ordered against him. The rationale for

such an order against a foreign resident is the delay or expense that will arise in

enforcing the costs order abroad: see <i>De Bry v Fitzgerald</i> [1990] 1 All ER 560 at

565, CA. </p>
<p xmlns="">20        Finally, every application for further

security should be made promptly. If it is made so late that the bulk of the costs have

already been incurred, the application might well be refused. Of course, if the delay is

satisfactorily explained, then the position could be different.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Our determination</p>
</b>
<p xmlns="">21        We now turn to consider the two main

contentions of Shirley Ooi. First is the question of delay. It is necessary to restate the

essential facts. The notice of appeal was filed on 28 February 2002. On 6 March 2002

JGI’s solicitors demanded the payment of the judgment sum. There was no response.

Then between 26 April to 10 May 2002, PL, sought to take out enforcement proceedings and

asked AL if they had instructions to accept service on behalf of Shirley Ooi. In each

instance the reply was a negative. Then on 15 May 2002, PL wrote to AL asking for the

provision of a sum of $50,000 as further security within 2 days. An interim reply was

given by AL on 17 May 2002 querying the urgency and stating that the solicitor in charge,

Mr Benjamin Goh, was then overseas and would revert upon his return. But it would appear,

whatever might be the reasons, he never reverted. So on 21 May 2002 JGI applied by motion

for further security, which motion was on 2 July 2002 dismissed by the single Judge. On 10

July 2002, the present motion was filed pursuant to s 36(3) of SCJA.</p>
<p xmlns="">22        In this regard, it must be pointed out

that this application for further security was not made on the ground of poverty or

impecuniosity of Shirley Ooi. It was on the ground that her conduct evidenced an intention

on her part to vigorously resist any costs awarded against her and it was likely that she

would deliberately make it more difficult and expensive for enforcement action to be taken

against her. This ground only surfaced on account of her conduct in April/May 2002. Thus,

we found that there was really no delay on JGI’s part in making the application.</p>
<p xmlns="">23        Turning to the second point of Shirley

Ooi, that she is the joint owner of a property, while this may, on the face of it, show

that she has assets within jurisdiction to satisfy any costs order, the circumstances

would indicate that any enforcement of a costs order against her would not be without

delay or unnecessary expense.</p>
<p xmlns="">24        First, even accepting her explanations on

why she often had to change her residence, or her postal address, this would mean that a

third party like JGI would have great difficulty in tracing her, unless she keeps her

solicitors informed and permits them to notify others, like JGI, of her updated address.</p>
<p xmlns="">25        Second, having regard to her previous

conduct, she is likely to take every step to delay and/or place obstacles in the way of

the execution of a cost order. She did not apply for a stay of execution of the High Court

judgment, and yet she resisted the request to pay up the judgment sum. She refused to

instruct her solicitors to accept service of the enforcement actions which PL intended to

pursue. We could not help feeling that she was trying to evade enforcement action. The

case <i>Lek Swee Hua v American Express International Inc</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=4844&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1991] 2 MLJ 151</a> is

illustrative. There, there had been difficulties in effecting service of bankruptcy

notices on the appellant-plaintiffs in other proceedings and security for costs was

accordingly ordered.</p>
<p xmlns="">26        Thirdly, enforcement of a costs order

against Shirley Ooi would necessarily give rise to undue delay and expense. Again, looking

at the previous behaviour of Shirley Ooi, we thought it was likely that JGI would have

real difficulties in enforcing such an order against her. Orders of this Court are not

enforceable in USA as there is no arrangement on reciprocal enforcement of judgment

between Singapore and USA. This then brings us to the flat which she co-owns with her

husband. In <i>Malayan Banking Bhd v Focal Finance Ltd</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=48719&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1999] 3 SLR 229</a>, the High

Court held that a writ of seizure and sale issued under O 47 r 4(1)(a) is not enforceable

against an immovable property in which the judgment debtor is a joint tenant. This is

because a joint owner does not have a distinct and identifiable share in the property for

so long as the joint tenancy subsists. Instead, the High Court indicated that in such a

situation the judgment creditor could proceed by way of equitable execution through the

appointment of a receiver (under O 30 and O 51 of the Rules of Court). However, as a

receiver is not empowered to sell the property, it is clear that satisfaction of the

judgment sum owing by the judgment debtor would entail further difficulties, or at least

further delays, assuming that incomes received by the receiver are utilised to satisfy the

costs order. We have referred to <i>Malayan Banking Bhd v Focal Finance Ltd</i> only to

show the difficulties that <i>could</i> be encountered. We have assumed the decision to be

correct as no appeal was taken against it. These difficulties, coupled with the fact that

Shirley Ooi is not likely to cooperate, could only further enhance the impediments which

JGI would encounter.</p>
<p xmlns="">27        In view of all the foregoing, it was our

opinion that the circumstances warranted the making of an order for further security. The

whole point of ordering a foreign plaintiff or appellant to furnish security is to ensure

that a fund would be available within the jurisdiction of this court against which the

successful defendant or respondent could enforce the judgment for costs: see <i>Porzelack

KG v Porzelack (UK) Ltd</i> [1987] 1 WLR 420 at 422. Without such further security there

is a real risk that JGI could be left with a costs order which would be unenforceable or

only enforceable with great difficulty and expense, plus delay.</p>
<p xmlns="">28        Moreover, it was clear that Shirley Ooi is

a person with means. There was no suggestion that she would have difficulties in

furnishing such additional security which the court might reasonably order. Neither had it

been said that if such security were ordered, her appeal would be stifled.</p>
<p xmlns="">29        Before we conclude, we ought to mention

that another factor which is relevant in the equation of determining whether it is just to

order further security is the question of the merits of the appeal. For the purpose of the

present motion, we had assumed that there could be some merits in the appeal.</p>
