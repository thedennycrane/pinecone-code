The respondent is the Chief Assessor. I will refer to him as the “Chief Assessor” in these written grounds. The property which is the subject of the appeal (“the subject property”) comprises #07-01 to #07-15 on the seventh floor of the mall known as Plaza Singapura at 68 Orchard Road, Singapore 238839. The appeal centres on the annual value of the subject property for the year 2008 – which was $3,292,000. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The Appellant had on 29 December 2008 filed a notice of objection against this annual value to the Chief Assessor and sought the amendment of the 2008 Valuation List. Its objection was rejected by the Chief Assessor. The Appellant then appealed to the Valuation Review Board (“VRB”) under s 20A of the Property Tax Act (Chapter 254, 2005 Rev Ed) (“PTA”) in respect of the 2008 annual value. In its notice of appeal, the Appellant stated that its desired annual value for the subject property was $2,127,000 with effect from 1 January 2008 and $2,265,000 with effect from 14 February 2008. The VRB dismissed the appeal after a hearing spread over a number of days between October 2016 and April 2018. The Appellant filed Tribunal Appeal No 9 of 2018 (“TA 9/2018”) in an appeal to the High Court against the VRB’s decision, under s 35 of the PTA. I dismissed the appeal on 22 November 2018, and the Appellant having filed an appeal a month later, I now set out below the written grounds for my decision. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 In its written judgement of 23 May 2018

Plaza Singapura has nine floors of retail space with a diverse tenant mix which – in 2008 (the assessment year in issue) – included Golden Village Multiplex Pte Ltd (“GV”) who occupied the seventh floor, Carrefour (a hypermarket chain), Best Denki (an electronics retailer chain), Yamaha Music School and others.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The subject property was leased by PSPL to GV on 29 April 1999.

Between 1998 and 1999, GC arranged for fitting-out works on the subject property at a total cost of $7,829,288.53, in order to fit it out as a fully functional cinema complex.

GV’s office headquarters were moved to another, larger unit in Plaza Singapura (#B1-10) under a separate lease with the Appellant. These further works during 2008 were not taken into account by the expert witness called on behalf of the Chief Assessor, Ms Ching Yung Ket (“Ms Ching”) when she considered the assessment of the 2008 annual value of the subject property.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 In 2008, the rent payable by GV for the subject property comprised base rent alone (excluding separate charges such as advertising and promotion fees, service charges and the like) as there was no turnover rent for 2008.

According to the Appellant, although it had brought the appeal before the VRB, it was the Chief Assessor who bore the onus of proving to the VRB that its decision on the annual value was correct. For that matter, the Appellant suggested that it was the Chief Assessor who bore the onus of proving the correctness of its decision in “the present appeal” in TA 9/2018.

The Appellant claimed that GV’s fitting-out works were only chattels.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 Fourth, the Appellant argued that the VRB had erred in accepting the Chief Assessor’s determination of the 2008 annual value. The Appellant said that the rental comparison method should have been used to determine the annual value, and that it would have yielded the lower figure of $2,265,000.  The Appellant attacked the methodology of the Chief Assessor’s expert witness Ms Ching for using what it decried as a “hotch-podge” approach, which had involved using the Profits Method to assess the cinema component of the subject property and the rental comparison method to assess the office and retail components. The Appellant also attacked Ms Ching’s use of the Rent Plus Amortised Cost Method as a “check” on the correctness of the annual value figure derived using her first approach.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 I will explain why I found against the Appellant on each of these four issues.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">First issue: Whether the onus of proof in an appeal fell on the Chief Assessor</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 On the first issue, the Appellant’s case was built firstly on the fact that the PTA – unlike the Income Tax Act (Chapter 134, 2014 Rev Ed) (“ITA”) and the Goods and Services Tax Act (Chapter 117A, 2005 Rev Ed) (“GSTA”) – did not contain any provision which expressly placed on the party seeking a review of the respective Comptroller’s decision the onus of proving that decision wrong. The Appellant pointed to s 80(4) of the ITA and s 52(3) of the GSTA, which expressly placed the onus of proof on the party seeking such a review.  s 80(4) of the ITA reads as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(4) The onus of proving that the assessment is excessive or that the amount of any unabsorbed losses, allowances or donations that may be carried forward ought to be of a higher amount than that assessed (as the case may be) shall be on the appellant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 s 52(3) of the GSTA reads as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3) The onus of proving that the decision of the Comptroller on the application for review and revision under section 49 is incorrect shall be on the appellant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 In the absence of any similar provisions in the PTA which explicitly provided for the onus of proof to fall on the party seeking a review, the Appellant argued that “the general principles relating to onus of proof should prevail”

In contending that these “general principles” placed on the Chief Assessor the onus of proving the correctness of his assessment of an annual value each time such assessment was challenged, the Appellant’s case rested primarily on s 103(1) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (“EA”).  s 103(1) reads as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Burden of proof</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">103.</span>—<span class="font-weight-bold">(</span><span class="font-weight-bold">1) </span>Whoever desires any court to give judgement as to any legal right or liability, dependent on the existence of facts which he asserts, must prove that those facts exist.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 According to the Appellant, although it had brought the appeals before the VRB and the High Court, it was the Chief Assessor who “asserted that the [annual value] of the subject property should be $3,292,000” and who therefore bore “the burden to prove his assertion”.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 I rejected the Appellant’s argument on this first issue as it was based on a fundamental misreading of s 103(1).  s 103(1) of the EA applies in the context of proceedings before a court. It should be noted that s 103(1) appears in Part III of the EA; s 2(1) of the EA provides that “Parts I, II and III shall apply to all juridical proceedings in or before any court, but not to affidavits presented to any court or officer nor to proceedings before an arbitrator”. From the arrangement of the EA, it is plain that Parts I, II and III of the Act were enacted to provide for the receipt of evidence in proceedings before a court. Broadly, Part I provides for what facts are relevant and therefore admissible before a court; Part II deals with the manner(s) in which relevant facts may be proved; and Part III deals with the burden of proving relevant facts to the court and the witnesses who may give evidence of such facts. s 103(1) itself refers to the party who “desires any court to give judgement as to any legal right or liability”.  In this connection, it should also be noted that s 3(1) of the EA defines the term “court” so as to “[include] all Judges and Magistrates and, except arbitrators, all persons legally authorised to take evidence”. This definition thus includes the VRB, which is authorised by s 32(4) of the PTA to take evidence in the course of hearing appeals filed under s 20A or s 22(5) of the PTA.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 That s 103(1) of the EA is to be understood as providing for the onus of proof in proceedings before a court is clear from the judgements of our own courts: see for example the judgement of the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Westacre</span><span class="font-italic"> Investments Inc v The State-Owned Company Yugoimport SDPR (also known as Jugoimport SDPR) &amp; ors</span> [2015] 4 SLR 529, at [24].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Who, then, in the context of appeals under the PTA, is the party who “desires [the] court to give judgement as to any legal right or liability”? The property owner who brings an appeal to the VRB under s 20A is clearly dissatisfied with the Chief Assessor’s assessment of the annual value of his property and desires the VRB to give judgement as to the correctness of the value assessed.  s 29(2) of the PTA requires that such an owner state in his notice of appeal, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, “the grounds on which the appeal is based” and the “amendments desired”. Pursuant to s 103(1) of the EA, such a property owner is clearly the party who “desires any court to give judgement as to any legal right or liability”.  Similarly, the owner who then files an appeal to the High Court under s 35 of the PTA, against a decision of the VRB, is dissatisfied with that decision and desires the High Court to give judgement as to the correctness of the annual value  of the property. Again, the property owner is – pursuant to s 103(1) – clearly the party who “desires any court to give judgement as to any legal right or liability”.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Again, the judgements of our own courts bear out the above point – that the dissatisfied property owner who appeals to the VRB and/or to the High Court against the Chief Assessor’s assessment of his property’s annual value bears the burden of establishing the grounds on which he says the assessment is wrong.

</div> (“<span class="font-italic">Cho Chih Yee</span>”)  (a decision cited by the VRB in the present case), the VRB ruled on a preliminary point raised by the appellant property owner concerning the latter’s entitlement to a copy of the report submitted by the chief assessor to the VRB.  This was a report submitted by the Chief Assessor under s 28 of the then Property Tax Ordinance (No 72 of 1960), in which he disclosed to the VRB what steps he had taken to investigate the matter further following the notice of appeal. In ruling that the property owner was not entitled to receive a copy of such report, the VRB (chaired by Mr TS Sinnathuray) held that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… an owner / appellant having brought the matter before the board, it is for him to satisfy the board that the chief assessor had come to a wrong decision and not for the chief assessor to justify his decision.

</div>, for example, the owner of the property known as “Wave House” on Sentosa appealed to the VRB against the Chief Assessor’s assessment of the property’s annual value, claiming that it was excessive. In dismissing the appeal, the VRB noted, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, that the Chief Assessor had used a certain figure for the amount of fitting-out costs incurred by the appellant owner as tenant of the Wave House and had amortised this figure over the expected tenure of ten years using 6% per annum as the rate of return (at [56]).

</div>. With respect, this submission is again something of an exaggeration. The dissatisfied property owner who appeals under s 20A of the PTA against the Chief Assessor’s decision must certainly have his own view as to the appropriate methodology to be applied in the valuation of a property – how else could he have formed the opinion that the Chief Assessor’s valuation needed revision?  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 In the instant case, for example, the Appellant contended before the VRB and before me that the rental comparison method was the appropriate valuation methodology; that the annual value should be the actual rent paid by GV for the subject property; and that such an approach would have yielded an annual value figure substantially less than the $3,292,000 figure assessed by the Chief Assessor.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 It should moreover be remembered that s 103 of the EA is concerned with the legal burden of proof; whilst the Appellant had the <span class="font-italic">legal</span> burden of proving in its appeal that the Chief Assessor’s decision was wrong, “<span class="font-italic">the evidential burdens might shift as between the parties</span><span class="font-italic">, depending on the precise evidence adduced before the court</span>” [emphasis added] (<span class="font-italic">per</span> the CA in <span class="font-italic">Loo </span><span class="font-italic">Chay Sit v Estate of Loo Chay Loo v Estate of Loo Chay Loo</span> [2010] 1 SLR 286 at [14]).

In respect of the office component and the retail component, as there was sufficient rental evidence to reflect the market rent for these two components, she adopted the rental comparison approach.

</div> – that Ms Ching’s evidence amounted to evidence of the manner in which the Chief Assessor had <span class="font-italic">in fact</span> arrived at the annual value of $3,292,000 in respect of the subject property in 2008.  In the first place, as counsel for the Chief Assessor has pointed out, there was no review by the Chief Assessor of the assessment in 2008: he had simply maintained the annual value at the same figure as it had been since 2005. Second, Ms Ching was not a witness of fact, but an expert witness called for the purpose of giving the VRB her expert opinion on whether the annual value of $3,292,000 was reasonable and fair.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Next, it should be noted that the PTA itself does not prescribe the manner in which the Chief Assessor is to carry out his assessment of the subject property; it certainly does not state that a subject property must invariably be assessed as a single tenement even where it has been divided into different components, each with its distinct physical nature or condition and use.  Indeed, where the property under assessment has been divided into several components, each with its own physical nature or condition and use, it would follow from the <span class="font-italic">rebus sic </span><span class="font-italic">stantibus</span> principle that each of these distinct components of the property be assessed as a distinct tenement. The <span class="font-italic">rebus sic </span><span class="font-italic">stantibus</span> principle states that the assessable entity should be valued according to its physical nature and condition as well as its usage: <span class="font-italic">per </span>the CA in <span class="font-italic">Aspinden</span> at [32].  In <span class="font-italic">Aspinden</span>, the appellant had purchased a number of strata lots in a strata divided building in which each strata lot was issued with a separate subsidiary certificate of title.  The strata lots were leased by the appellant to various tenants. All in, the tenants operated 45 business units across 155 strata lots. These 155 strata lots formed the subject properties for the purposes of the Chief Assessor’s valuation.  The Chief Assessor decided to amalgamate the property tax accounts of the subject properties for the purposes of calculating the property tax payable by the appellant. The CA held that he was justified in amalgamating the property tax accounts of the subject properties.  Noting that the party walls had been removed between various strata lots in order to create contiguous units, the CA held that “where several strata lots were occupied on a combined basis, it was open to the [Chief Assessor] to value them as a whole” (at [18] of the CA’s judgement in <span class="font-italic">Aspinden</span>). Noting as well the usage to which the strata lots had been put, CA also held that “[t]he reality of the situation was that the assessment of annual value accorded with the manner in which the strata lots were used. If larger businesses indeed operated as an integral unit over several [strata] lots, they ought to be and were assessed as a single business entity for property tax purposes” (at [29] of <span class="font-italic">Aspinden</span>). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 The situation in the present case is the diametrical opposite of that in <span class="font-italic">Aspinden</span>, since what we have in the present case is a single subject property divided into three different components, each with its own physical condition and each being used for a different purpose.

In the present case, the subject property has been described as “68 Orchard Road #07-01-15”.  It is a description which, to my mind, sufficiently identified the property being valued. As the Chief Assessor has pointed out, it is a description which “covers the entire 7th storey of Plaza Singapura… [A]ll three components of the cinema, office and family entertainment centre are encapsulated in this property description”

</div>, the subject-matter of the appeal before the VRB consisted of two flats.  The appellant was the owner of both the flats.  Before the VRB, he argued that property tax in Singapore attached to the owner of the property and not the property itself; and that since he was the owner of both the flats, they must be considered as a single unit and assessed as one entity.  This argument was firmly rejected by the VRB, which noted that “property tax is levy of tax on immovable property and not on the owner”; and that this being the case, “it is <span class="font-weight-bold">incumbent</span> on the Chief Assessor, <span class="font-weight-bold">under section 9(1)</span> of the [Property Tax Ordinance], to put on the valuation list <span class="font-weight-bold">each flat as a separate </span><span class="font-weight-bold">‘tenement’, notwithstanding that the flats are owned by one person, and </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">assign an annual value to each of them as a separate </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">‘tenement</span>’”.

</div> – as “good authority for the proposition that an invalid entry in the Valuation List can be deleted”. In reliance on these two cases, the Appellant contended that “the inclusion of “68 Orchard Road #07-01/15” with a single [annual value] in the 2008 Valuation List is invalid and <span class="font-italic">ultra vires</span> and as such, ought to be deleted from the 2008 Valuation List”.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 I make three points in this respect.  First, in filing TA 9/2018, the Appellant had never prayed for deletion of the subject property from the 2008 Valuation List as a relief. Second, and somewhat astonishingly, the Appellant failed to address the implications of the deletion it proposed of the subject property from the 2008 Valuation List. Any such deletion would render the subject property a non-existent entity to which no annual value could be assigned – with no property tax levied. This seemed to me a wholly absurd and unacceptable outcome, given that nobody was actually disputing that the subject property had market rental value. Third, the VRB’s decisions in <span class="font-italic">Toh</span><span class="font-italic"> Kim Soo</span> and <span class="font-italic">Seacold</span> were arrived at on the basis of facts which differed substantially from the facts in the present case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 In <span class="font-italic">Toh</span><span class="font-italic"> Kim Soo</span>, the subject property was a single piece of land comprised in Mukim 10 Lot 482. The Chief Assessor issued a total of four valuation notices in respect of Lot 482, purporting to assess different annual values in respect of different portions of the piece of land. On the property owner appealing to the VRB, the VRB held that the Chief Assessor was not authorised under the PTA to give the subject property more than one annual value. In the circumstances, the four valuation notices were <span class="font-italic">ultra vires</span>, and the resultant valuations should be deleted from the Valuation List.  This case was in fact summarised by the CA in <span class="font-italic">Aspinden</span> as follows (at [20]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In <span class="font-italic">Toh</span><span class="font-italic"> Kim Soo</span>, the Chief Assessor sought to give more than one annual value to a particular property. This was not authorised by the provisions in the PTA, either expressly or impliedly.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 In <span class="font-italic">Seacold</span>, what was in issue was the assessment of excess land under proviso (d) to s 2 of the Property Tax Act (Cap 254, 1985 Rev Ed) (now s 2(5) of the PTA).  Pursuant to proviso (d), excess land could be separately assessed for annual value if the sanction of the Minister for Finance is obtained. In <span class="font-italic">Seacold</span>, approval for the separate assessment of the excess land had been given by a civil servant in the Ministry of Finance; there was no evidence of any sanction having been given by the Minister himself. Not surprisingly, the VRB held that the requirements of proviso (d) had not been complied with, and that the notice of annual value given in respect of the excess land was therefore <span class="font-italic">ultra vires </span>the PTA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Neither of these two VRB decisions can sensibly be extrapolated so as to provide any support for the Appellant’s position.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 I should also add for the record that I found no merit in the Appellant’s allegation that it had been given no forewarning that the Chief Assessor had assessed the subject property as three tenements “[p]rior to Ms Ching’s cross-examination”

</div>.  The affidavit filed by Ms Ching on 30 November 2017 (prior to her taking the witness stand) had made it plain that she had valued the subject property as three different components. Therefore, it could not be true that the Appellant had only realised this in the course of her cross-examination. Nor did I find any merit in the Appellant’s allegation that this stance “may have been made in response to the Appellant’s written submissions filed prior to the hearing, wherein the Appellant had criticised the Chief Assessor’s valuation methodology as “hotch-potch”.

Out of this entire list of fitting-out works, the works which were identified by the Chief Assessor’s expert witness Ms Ching as amounting to fixtures accounted for $7,374,652.57 of the total cost of $7,829,288.53.

In <span class="font-italic">Pan-United</span>, the appellant was the owner of a shipyard and a concrete batching plant (“the Property”). The appeal before the CA related to three floating dry docks which were berthed above the seabed adjacent to the Property, and which were connected to the Property by a ramp. The appellant was dissatisfied with the Chief Assessor’s decision to include these three floating dry docks in assessing the annual value of the Property, and appealed to the CA after unsuccessful appeals before the VRB and the High Court. One of the issues which arose in the appeal before the CA was the appropriate test to apply in determining whether the floating dry docks were part of the land and thus assessable to property tax. The appellant argued for the fixture test, whereas the Chief Assessor argued for the enhancement test. The majority in the CA held that it was unnecessary to decide which test should be the operative test under Singapore law because in its view, the same outcome would be arrived at regardless of which test was applied (at [53]). It did, however, note that the fixture test was “more stringent than the enhancement test” (at [52]) and went on to apply the fixture test to the facts of the case before it, following which it ruled that the floating docks were clearly not only “buildings” within the meaning of s 2(1) of the PTA, but that they also formed part of the Property and were to be included in the assessment of the annual value. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 I will focus first on the application of the fixture test to the present case.  In this respect, it is necessary first to examine some of the more pertinent case law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 In <span class="font-italic">Pan-United</span>, the CA acknowledged (at [45]) that the <span class="font-italic">locus </span><span class="font-italic">classicus</span> on the application of the fixture test was the English case of <span class="font-italic">Holland v Hodgson</span> (“<span class="font-italic">Holland</span>”) (1872) LR 7 CP 328, in which Blackburn J laid down the following principles:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">There is no doubt that the general maxim of the law is, that what is annexed to the land becomes part of the land; but it is very difficult, if not impossible, to say with precision what constitutes an annexation sufficient for this purpose. It is a question which must depend on the circumstances of each case, and mainly on two circumstances as indicating the intention, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>., the degree of annexation and the object of the annexation. Where the article in question is no further attached to the land, then by its own weight it is generally to be considered a mere chattel; see <span class="font-italic">Wiltshire v Cottrell</span> [(1853) 1 El &amp; Bl 674, 118 ER 589]; and the cases there cited.  But even in such a case, if the intention is apparent to make the articles part of the land, they do become part of the land: see <span class="font-italic">D’Eyncourt</span><span class="font-italic"> v Gregory</span> [(1866) LR 3 Eq 382].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The fixture test</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Following the decision in <span class="font-italic">Holland</span>, the CA held that in applying the fixture test, the two considerations for determining whether the floating dry docks were fixtures or chattels “rested on: (a) the degree of annexation; and (b) the object of annexation”. It added (at [55]) that it was “important to note” that “as a point of general legal principle, the purpose of annexation is an extremely important factor (indeed, so it appears, even more so than the degree of annexation)”. In elucidating this point, the CA cited (at [46]) the observations by Boreham J in <span class="font-italic">Hamp v Bygrave</span> (1983) 266 EG 720 (at 724) on the object or purpose of annexation:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The second test is: What was the purpose of the annexation?  Was it in order to enjoy the chattel as a chattel or was it to improve the freehold in a permanent way? There is, in my judgement, authority for the following propositions: (a) Items which are firmly fixed to the land may yet remain chattels if (1) the purpose of the annexation was to enjoy them as chattels and (2) the degree of annexation was no more than was necessary for that purpose. See <span class="font-italic">Re de </span><span class="font-italic">Falbe, Ward v Taylor</span> [1901] 1 Ch 523, which was a case concerning valuable tapestries. (b) Articles which are intended to improve, in the sense of being a feature of, the land through their annexation is by no more than their own weight may be regarded as fixtures.  See <span class="font-italic">D’Eyncourt</span><span class="font-italic"> v Gregory</span> (1866) LR 3 Eq 382. (c) While the earlier law attached greater importance to the mode and degree of annexation, more recent authorities suggest that the relative importance of these considerations has declined and that the purpose of the annexations is now of first importance.  In judging the purpose of the annexation regard must be had to all the circumstances, including the manner of annexation and the intention of the annexor or occupier of the land at the relevant time. See <span class="font-italic">Leigh v Taylor</span> [1902] AC 157. (d) Nevertheless, in the absence of evidence of a contrary intention, the prima facie inference to be drawn from the mode and degree of annexation will not be displaced…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Applying the fixture test to the facts of the case before it, the CA held that although the floating dry docks were each attached to the property by only a ramp,</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">54 …[T]he <span class="font-italic">purpose</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>of anchoring these docks where they were was clear beyond peradventure: It was intended that these docks constitute the very pith and marrow of the business conducted by the appellant on the Property.

</div>
</div>
</div> illustrates how the fixture test and the principles enunciated by the CA in <span class="font-italic">Pan-United</span> have been applied by the Singapore High Court. In that case, the respondent was the trustee of CapitalMall Trust which owned the shopping mall known as Bugis Junction – a mall with 180 units leased out to tenants operating various types of business (collectively, “the Premises”). In assessing the annual value of the various tenanted units for the valuation years 2004 and 2005, the Chief Assessor did not exclude a portion in the gross rent for depreciation arising from wear and tear of the escalators, lifts air-conditioning and fire safety systems installed in Bugis Junction (collectively, “the asset items”). On the respondent appealing to the VRB, the VRB reversed the Chief Assessor’s decision as it agreed with the respondent that the claim for depreciation of these items was a constituent part of the total cost of the services provided by the respondent, and that it should be excluded from gross rent in the assessment of annual value. The Chief Assessor appealed the VRB’s decision. In considering the Chief Assessor’s appeal, the High Court was concerned with the question of whether the depreciation of the asset items was an item related to the “rent or letting” of the subject property – and whether this depreciation component should be included in the computation of the annual value of the subject property.  The High Court noted at [25] that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Under our local property tax regime, tax is payable on immoveable properties… [I]t is the immovable property that is taxed. Thus, a building is assessable together with fixtures that are on or in the building unless the fixtures are manufacturing or industrial machinery exempted under s 2(2) of the PTA… </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 If the relevant asset items in <span class="font-italic">Bugis</span><span class="font-italic"> Junction </span>constituted fixtures, they would be assessable to tax together with the building, and in assessing annual value in these circumstances, it could not then be said that depreciation of the asset items had nothing to do with letting of the Premises: the deprecation component in the gross rent would be related to rent or letting (at [27]). The High Court then considered the question of whether the asset items were fixtures such that they formed an integral part of the subject property and were assessable to tax. Following the approach of the CA in <span class="font-italic">Pan-United</span>, the court held that there were two alternative tests which could be applied to determine whether an item was a fixture or a chattel for property tax purposes: the fixture test (as embodied in the decision in <span class="font-italic">Holland</span>) or the enhancement test (as <span class="font-italic">per </span><span class="font-italic">Field Place Caravan Park Ltd v Harding</span> [1966] 2 QB 484). It ruled that on the facts before it, either the fixture test or the enhancement test “should reach the conclusion that the asset items [were] affixed to land so as to become part of the land and, thus, be assessable to tax together with the building concerned under s 6(1) [PTA]” (at [42]). For the purposes of the present discussion, I focus on the High Court’s treatment of the fixture test in its judgement (I will touch on the enhancement test at a later stage).  In allowing the Chief Assessor’s appeal, the High Court held (at 30]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…The significance of the existence of fixtures in a building is potentially the enhancement in value that is added to the annual value of the building. Conversely, if the plant and machinery is not affixed to the building, the question of including it in the assessment of the building’s annual value does not even arise.  Hence, the difference between fixtures and chattels is important in relation to the calculation of the annual value for property tax purposes…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Citing the CA’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Pan-United</span> and noting the appellate court’s reliance on <span class="font-italic">Holland</span>, the High Court found (at [38] and [43]) that </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…(A)ccording to the fixture test as described, the asset items in question are undoubtedly part of the land, being annexed to the building that comprises Bugis Junction. The photographs of the escalators, lifts, air conditioning and fire safety systems adduced as evidence in this case show that these have been built-in or affixed to the buildings. Accordingly, they therefore satisfy the first consideration stated in <span class="font-italic">Holland v Hodgson</span>. In regard to the object of annexation, there are no facts in evidence to rebut the <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> inference to be drawn from the fact that the asset items have been annexed to the building. I note that there was not a great deal of difference between the parties on the question of whether the asset items were fixtures or chattels… Given the nature of and the manner in which the escalators, lifts, air-conditioning and fire safety systems are usually utilised, their function or purpose is to be served by annexation to the building, where they will remain in place for a substantial period of time. It is quite clear that escalators, lifts, air-conditioning and fire safety systems are incapable of utility on a free standing basis and cannot be enjoyed as mere chattels. Air conditioners with vents, ducts and piping form a cooling system that function together to cool the building in question.  Escalators and lifts are mainly or usually used for shoppers and visitors. In the case of the fire safety system, it consists of several components. For example, the indicator boards, piping, alarms, heat sensors, hose reels, and sprinklers.  All these components function together to form the system. Each component also performs its own discrete function independent of the others, but taken as a whole, they are affixed to the building to serve as protection from fire and are intended to remain in place for a substantial period of time. As the Board found on the facts in evidence, the asset items were fixtures and they formed integral parts of the building.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">43. …[A]s fixtures, the asset items enhance the value of the building, and they are, thus, included in the assessment of the building’s annual value. It follows that the portion of the gross rent for depreciation of the asset items in question has to do with the letting of the Premises, which in turn, means that the depreciation component in the gross rent is related to rent or letting of the Premises. Therefore, the depreciation component in the gross rent has to be included in the computation of annual value in the valuation years of 2004 and 2005.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 <span class="font-italic">Chief Assessor &amp; another v Van Ommeren Terminal (S) Pte Ltd</span> (“<span class="font-italic">Van </span><span class="font-italic">Ommeren</span>”) [1993] 2 SLR(R) 354

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> is another case which provides a useful example of how the High Court approached the issue of whether certain structures on a subject property constituted fixtures or whether they were chattels. In this case, the respondent leased from the then Port of Singapore Authority (“PSA”) land (“the property”) which it used for storage of oil. The issue in dispute before the High Court was whether the Chief Assessor was correct to have taken into account the costs of constructing the storage tanks and pipelines on the property in assessing the annual value. The VRB had agreed with the respondent that he was incorrect to have done so and had directed that the value of the storage tanks and pipelines be omitted in the assessment of the annual value of the property. The Chief Assessor’s appeal was allowed by the High Court, which agreed that both the storage tanks and the pipeline had to be taken into account in assessing the annual value of the property. Whilst noting that the storage tanks were not annexed to the land but rested on the land by their own weight and that they could be jacked up for repairs or moved to a different location, the High Court held that the fact “whether an article is or is not bolted or cemented to the ground is not necessarily conclusive” (at [26]).  Citing <span class="font-italic">Holland</span>, the High Court noted that Blackburn J had stated <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Perhaps the true rule is that articles not otherwise attached to the land than by their own weight are not to be considered as part of the land unless the circumstances are such as to show that they were intended to be part of the land, the onus of showing that they are so intended lying on those who assert that they have ceased to be chattels; and that, on the contrary, an article which is affixed to the land, even slightly, is to be considered as part of the land, unless the circumstances are such as to show that it was intended all along to continue a chattel, the onus lying on those who contend that it is a chattel.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 In the High Court’s view:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">28 …the Board in its deliberations placed too much significance on the fact that the tanks are not physically annexed to the ground and could be moved, and did not give sufficient consideration to the purpose for which the tanks are placed on the land.  It is clear from the statement of Blackburn J that the fact that the tanks rest on their own weight is not necessarily conclusive that they are chattels and have not become part of the land.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">34 …[I]t seems to me clear that <span class="font-italic">the storage tanks (and the pipelines) were and are placed on the property to improve or promote the enjoyment of the la</span><span class="font-italic">nd rather than the enjoyment of the chattels (the tanks) themselves.  Pulau Sebarok is a barren piece of land. In its natural state it could not be of any good practical use other than as perhaps a dumping ground.  The siting of the storage tanks on it is no doubt to enhance or maximise the use of the land.  It is an improvement made to the land.</span>  I do not think any real significance should be attached to the fact that the tanks are not bolted or cemented to the ground.  It is quite unnecessary.  Due to their size and weight, the tanks need no bolting or cementing. They are not chattels which can be removed easily… (T)he occasions the tanks have been moved are few and far between.  To move or lift them would involve a big operation.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">35 In this connection, I think cl.6.4 of the lease granted by PSA to Van Ommeren is pertinent.  It provides that on the expiry of the lease or earlier determination thereof Van Ommeren are required to surrender the land “together with the said complex and all other improvement, structures and buildings” on it to PSA without any compensation whatsoever.  The tanks and the pipelines are certainly improvements and will go to PSA.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">39 I do not think the pipelines should be considered in isolation and separate from the storage tanks. The pipelines cannot be viewed otherwise than as an integral part of the tanks without which the tanks in themselves cannot be of any functional use.  The pipelines serve as conduits in the transportation of the petroleum products from vessels to the tanks and <span class="font-italic">vice versa</span>.  They are necessary adjuncts to the storage tanks.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 To sum up broadly at this point, therefore, in applying the fixture test to the present case, the two considerations for determining whether the included assets were fixtures or chattels rested on the degree of annexation and the purpose of annexation. Whilst the latter is of greater importance than the former, generally speaking, an item which is affixed to the land, even slightly, is <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> to be considered part of the land, unless the party contending otherwise demonstrates that the circumstances are such as to show that it was intended all along to be a chattel. Conversely, items not otherwise attached to the land other than by their own weight are not to be considered part of the land unless the party contending otherwise demonstrates that the circumstances are such as to show that they were intended to be part of the land.  In considering what the circumstances may show, it should be asked whether the item in question was placed on the land in order to be enjoyed as a chattel, or whether it enhances the use of the land and therefore its value.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 In its submissions, the Appellant laid great emphasis on the fact that the included assets in this case were “Tenant’s fittings”. The inference which the Appellant apparently sought to have me draw was that that as a tenant, GV was a “temporary” occupant of the subject property; that the “temporary” nature of its occupation militated against its having any intention to dedicate the included assets to the subject property; and that in so far as the included assets were attached to the subject property, there were good reasons for why they were so attached, which had nothing to do with an intention to dedicate the included assets to the subject property; and that in any event these were items which could be fairly easily removed without any damage to the subject property

</div>
</div>. The CA ruled that these tapestries were chattels belonging to the estate of the tenant for life. Notably, in so ruling, the CA made it clear that any inquiry into the object and purpose for which the tapestries had been attached to the walls was an objective exercise in which the court asked itself what inferences could be drawn from the evidence available.  Thus, for example, Vaughan Williams LJ held:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I have not the faintest doubt upon the evidence that these tapestries were affixed by the tenant for life to the freehold for the purpose of their enjoyment as chattels, and in no sense for the improvement of the freehold. In dealing with the question of fixtures it sometimes becomes material to consider the object and purpose of the annexation, by which <span class="font-italic">I do not mean that there must be an inquiry into the motive of the person who annexed them, but a consideration of the object and purpose of </span><span class="font-italic">the annexation as it is to be inferred from the circumstances of the case</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 In the same vein, Rigby LJ held that the evidence available, including evidence of the manner in which the tapestries were affixed to the walls, indicated that the intention of the tenant for life was “to have what she considered … beautiful and valuable objects placed in such a position as might please the eye and satisfy her desire for ornament”. Similar observations were made by Stirling LJ:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">As regards the object of the annexation the question to be considered is, whether the object is to improve the freehold to which the annexation is made, or whether it is the more complete and better enjoyment of the chattel itself. Here the chattels to be enjoyed are some pieces of tapestry.  How are they to be enjoyed?  They must be placed so as to be seen by the eye, and in order that they may be properly seen they must, as they are large pieces of tapestry, be placed in a large room.  Madame de Falbe [the tenant for life] put them into the best room in the house, the drawing-room.  She affixed them, no doubt, to the walls of the room, but she did this in such a way that the tapestries might be removed without any structural damage… Looking at the evidence as to the mode in which the tapestries were affixed and the position in which they were placed, I feel no doubt that everything which was done was done for the better enjoyment of the tapestries as chattels, and not for the purpose of making an addition of some thousands of pounds to the value of the mansion-house.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 In upholding the English CA’s decision, the House of Lords also held that the tapestries were put up purely to be enjoyed as ornaments in themselves, and did not become part of the freehold. Thus, for example, the Earl of Halsbury L.C. held that whilst these tapestries were very valuable, they were at the end of the day really pictures “made for the purpose of ornamentation”

I would add that Vaughan Williams LJ’s observation that an inquiry into the object or purpose of annexation of items to the land involves “a consideration of the object and purpose of the annexation<span class="font-italic"> as it is to be inferred from the circumstances of the case</span>” – rather than “an inquiry into the motive of the person who annexed them” – is a useful reminder that declarations of subjective intention by the landlord and its tenants – particularly in the context of testifying on appeal before the VRB – are usually of limited evidential value in themselves.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Vaughan William LJ’s comments were echoed by the House of Lords in <span class="font-italic">Elitestone</span><span class="font-italic"> Ltd v Morris &amp; another</span> [1997] 1 WLR 687

</div> (“<span class="font-italic">Elitestone</span>”). In that case, the House of Lords held that the answer to the question whether a structure had become part and parcel of the land itself depended on the degree and the object of annexation to the land, and in the course of their judgements, made it clear that this was an objective inquiry. Thus Lord Lloyd for example, held that “the intention of the parties is only relevant to the extent that it can be derived from the degree and object of the annexation. The subjective intention of the parties cannot affect the question whether the chattel has, in law, become part of the freehold” (at 693F).  Lord Clyde too, in referring to Blackburn J’s remark in <span class="font-italic">Holland</span> about whether there was an apparent intention “to make the articles part of the land”, cautioned that “intention in this context is to be assessed objective and not subjectively... As Lord Cockburn put it in <span class="font-italic">Dixon v Fisher</span> (1843) 5 D. 775, 793 ‘no man can make his property real or personal by merely thinking it so’” (at 698E-698H).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 I note that the Appellant has tried to suggest that “<span class="font-italic">Elitestone</span> should be read with caution as the case was primarily concerned with the principle of accession, which is not relevant to the present appeal”

The Appellant also failed to acknowledge that both the judgements delivered in that case actually invoked the test laid down by Blackburn J in <span class="font-italic">Holland</span> in answering the question of whether the disputed structure had become part and parcel of the land itself.

</div> (“<span class="font-italic">Billing</span>”) concerned the question of whether the appellant had been wrongly convicted of larceny in respect of his act of dismantling a hut which had been constructed on a piece of land and re-erecting it on his own land. Due to the manner in which the relevant provision in the Larceny Act, 1916, had been drafted, the issue turned on whether the hut should be considered as being attached to or forming part of the realty. The hut itself was one of a number erected by the War Office during World War II for use as a gun emplacement: it rested on a concrete foundation, the floor of the hut being secured to the foundation by bolts let into the concrete.  At the conclusion of the war, the army had vacated these huts, and the local authority had been instructed to demolish them but had not yet done so. In affirming the appellant’s conviction for larceny on appeal, the English CA held that the hut had not become attached to nor formed part of the realty and remained a chattel capable of being stolen.  Lord Goddard CJ, who delivered the CA’s judgement, affirmed the importance of the object or purpose of annexation of an item to the land in the court’s consideration of whether the item formed part of the land:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If the object and purpose was for the permanent and substantial improvement of the land or building, the article will be deemed to be a fixture, but if it was attached to the premises merely for a temporary purpose or for the more complete enjoyment and use of it as a chattel, then it will not lose its chattel character and it does not become part of the realty.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 In <span class="font-italic">Billing</span>, what the court found significant was the fact that the hut had been erected to serve a wartime purpose which had since run its course with the end of the war – in other words, a temporary purpose. Its attachment to the land via the bolts set in the concrete foundation was simply for the purpose of stabilising it. These propositions do not help the Appellant in its attempt to characterise the leasehold improvements, projection system, cinema seats and other included assets as mere chattels. The following observations by Lord Goddard CJ make it clear that the decision in <span class="font-italic">Billing </span>was specific to the facts of that case:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Can anybody doubt that the hut in question was erected for a temporary purpose?  It can be removed without doing any damage to the freehold at all. It rests upon a concrete bed which is let into the land.  I should say that there is no question but that the concrete bed has become part of the land, but <span class="font-italic">the hut which stands upon it has not become part of the land merely because some bolts have been put through the floor of the hut to stabilise or steady it.

</div>, the subject-matter of the dispute was an office constructed by the plaintiffs within a warehouse owned by the defendant. The plaintiffs had obtained a licence (which was <span class="font-italic">not</span> a lease) from the defendant to occupy the warehouse, and had erected the office on the warehouse premises. The office had partition walls and a ceiling. After ten weeks in occupation, the plaintiffs terminated the licence agreement. The defendant subsequently refused the plaintiffs access to the office and occupied it himself, claiming that the office was a fixture and thus part of the realty. Miles CJ, sitting as a single judge in the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory, upheld the magistrate’s decision that the office was not a fixture and not part of the realty. It was noted that the office was constructed of prefabricated wall frames, doors and windows; that whilst its removal would cause some damage to the premises, such damage was not irreparable. On the other hand, the office itself would, on severance of the licence, “cease to have the character of an office”: it would be merely a “collection of re-usable building materials most of which” could “without much difficulty be re-assembled and used for the erection of a similar office elsewhere”

I think it is common sense to say that the capacity in which such person carried out the act(s) of annexation may be one of the evidential clues from which the court draws inferences as to the purpose of the annexation. This does not, however, mean that so long as the occupant of the land is a tenant or a licensee, he can <span class="font-italic">never</span> be held to have intended to confer a permanent benefit to the land – which was what the Appellant seemed to be suggesting at one point

</div>, for example, the plaintiff was the lessee of land on which two warehouses had been erected; the defendant was the mortgagee of the land and the premises.  Following the liquidation of the plaintiffs, a dispute arose between the liquidator and the defendants as to whether three overhead cranes installed by the plaintiffs on the warehouse premises constituted fixtures forming part of the land, or whether they were chattels belonging to the plaintiffs. Thean J (as he then was) cautioned (at [8]) that in determining whether annexation had taken place, physical attachment was only one of the considerations to be kept in mind, as an article not physically attached to the land could in certain circumstances become part and parcel of the land and lose its chattel nature: the question of annexation “depends on a number of circumstances… and… each case must be considered and decided on its own circumstances”. Having regard to the physical nature of the cranes, the manner in which they had been installed, and the functions they served, he held that they were “intended to serve, and they [served], only the warehouses where they were installed”; they were “an adjunct to the warehouses”; and they “[improved] the usefulness of these warehouses and [enhanced] their values” (at [12]). In the circumstances, he found these cranes to be fixtures which had become part of the warehouses.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Bearing in mind Thean J’s injunction that each case must be considered and decided on its own facts, the facts of <span class="font-italic">Ball-</span><span class="font-italic">Gyumer</span> were clearly distinguishable from the case before me.

The floor screed and the wall plastering would have provided the essential finishing works on the floors and the walls of the subject property. As for the glass and shop front, I agreed with counsel for the Chief Assessor that these items having been described as leasehold improvements in GV’s 1998/1999 list of assets, the inference to be drawn must be that these were works carried out for the subject property as a whole. As the Chief Assessor noted, although Mr Sticca alleged that these were only applicable to the office and the retail units, no evidence was actually adduced by the Appellant to substantiate this (and it would not have been difficult for the Appellant to produce such evidence, whether in the form of photographs or some other form).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 For the above reasons, I was satisfied that the leasehold improvements constituted fixtures which formed part of the subject property and had to be included in the assessment of its annual value.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 The second largest item among the included assets was the projection system which comprised projectors, screens, sound system, wall drapes and curtains.

</div>.  Again, this characterisation of the decision regrettably omitted material aspects of the court’s reasoning. In <span class="font-italic">Colledge</span>, the subject-matter of the dispute also concerned the seats in a cinema (referred to as a “motion-picture theatre building” in the judgement). An issue arose as to whether these seats were fixtures or chattels, as the registered proprietor of the cinema had executed a mortgage of the cinema to the defendant bank while also executing an instrument by way of security to the plaintiff over, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the cinema seats.  In holding that the seats were fixtures and therefore property of the defendant company, Smith J found on the evidence before him that the seats were “screwed to the floor”; that they were “chairs for the audience”; and that “(t)he theatre could not have been opened without them” (at p 1068). On such evidence, he held that the seats had been sufficiently affixed to the freehold to raise a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> inference that they were fixtures and to cast upon the plaintiff the onus of showing that they remained chattels – which onus he found the plaintiff to have failed to discharge. In short, whilst Smith J did refer in passing to the fact that the “owner of the chairs” who had affixed the chairs “also owned the land”, this factor in itself was clearly not the sole – indeed, not even the decisive – reason for his decision.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 Having regard to the guidance afforded by the case law discussed above, and in light of the evidence available, I was satisfied that the cinema seats constituted fixtures which formed part of the subject property and had to be included in the assessment of its annual value.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 As to the signage, carpets, wheelchair lifts to cinemas, and video display system, there did not appear to me to be any real controversy that each of these items was physically affixed to the subject property. More importantly, I agreed with counsel for the Chief Assessor that each of these items had been so affixed in order to enhance the use of the subject property as a cinema complex, and not for the enjoyment of the items as chattels in themselves. As to the signage, it was not disputed that they served the function of indicating to GV’s customers important directions such as the exits and entrances to the cinemas and the directions to the toilets, and also of informing customers of upcoming movies

The key point which the VRB appeared to have been making in [67] of its judgement was that pursuant to clause 2.46, GV as tenant “did not have the overriding right” to remove fitting out works which had become part of the land.

GV could be required by the landlord to refrain from removing any fitting-out works which did not fall within the description of “furniture and chattels” – a point which the VRB was entirely justified in highlighting.  It did not appear to me that in referring to clause 2.46, the VRB had somehow relied on the provision to “pre-determine” that the disputed included assets in this case amounted to fixtures. Indeed, by the time the VRB referred to clause 2.46 at [67] of its judgement, it had already made the express finding that the included assets amounted to fixtures: see [47] to [58] of its judgement.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The enhancement test</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 In relation to the third issue raised by the Appellant, it was also argued by the Appellant that the VRB had erred in holding that the enhancement test was applicable in Singapore.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 In <span class="font-italic">Pan-United</span>, the CA noted (at [44]) that there were two alternative tests which could be adopted in order to resolve the issue of whether a structure (such as the floating dry docks in that case) constituted part of the land.

This is the first stage… [T]he qualifying words are a statutory impetus to <span class="font-italic">include </span>in the annual value any component of the gross rent that is to cover the expenses that the qualifying words expressly enumerate, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the landlord’s expenses for repair, insurance, maintenance or upkeep and all taxes (other than goods and services tax). If the expense belongs to one of these categories, it has to be included in determining annual value, and no further question arises.  </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">47 It is only if an expense does not fall within any of the categories in the qualifying words that the test of “rent or letting” comes into play. This is the second stage… In our view, where the expense in question forms a part of the gross rent <span class="font-italic">it must relate to the use or occupation of the heritable subject </span>if it is to qualify as one relating to “rent or letting” and so be included in the annual value…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">48 In this regard, the fixture and/or enhancement tests may be helpful. As the test for “rent or letting” is whether the expense is related to the use or occupation of the heritable subject, it follows that expenses related to fixtures which are components of the heritable subject itself (apart from fixtures falling under s 2(2) of the PTA) are related to rent or letting… We agree with the Judge’s reasoning… and would only add one rider to it. It is important not to lose sight of the fact that while a fixture becomes part of the land or enhances the value of the land, the fixture and/or enhancement tests are not the key focus. It is the rent at which the premises or property may reasonably be expected to be let which is the touchstone of s 2(1) of the PTA.  </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 The long and short of it is that at the appellate level in our courts, the enhancement test has not been disavowed as an applicable test for determining whether an item or a structure forms part of the land so as to become assessable to property tax together with the land. As such, I did not think the VRB erred when it disagreed with the Appellant’s argument below that “the enhancement test should not apply in the context of our PTA”

</div>:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[O]ur main criticism of Ms Ching’s Profits Method Plus Rental Comparison Method is that it is fundamentally wrong to use such a piece-meal (hotchpotch) method when the Subject Property is supposed to be assessed as a single tenement given that there is only a single entry and single [annual value] for the Subject Property in the 2008 Valuation List.  In other words, having adopted the Profits Method, Ms Ching ought to have applied the method consistently for the entire Subject Property without any carve-outs…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 I did not find any merit in the above argument. As I noted earlier, the PTA itself does not prescribe <span class="font-italic">how </span>the Chief Assessor is to carry out his assessment of the subject property; it certainly does not prescribe that a subject property must invariably be assessed as a single tenement even where it has been divided into different components, each with its distinct physical nature or condition and use.  Rather, where the property under assessment has been divided into several components, each with its own physical nature or condition and use, the <span class="font-italic">rebus sic </span><span class="font-italic">stantibus</span> principle would require that each of these distinct components of the property be assessed as a distinct tenement (see <span class="font-italic">Aspinden</span> at [32]).  In this connection, the PTA also does not prescribe that the Chief Assessor must use the same methodology to assess each distinct tenement, nor does it prescribe which methodologies the Chief Assessor is to use.  In the present appeal, therefore, what was pertinent was whether Ms Ching provided sound and sensible reasons for the methodologies she adopted.

That is the very first question that a hypothetical tenant would put to himself: What have been the profits that have been made in it?  Because that is the best proof as to whether it is doing a good business or not. True it is said A.B. might make good profits, but C.D. might lose.

</div>. Not surprisingly, the Appellant also attacked the use which Ms Ching made of actual gross receipt figures as well as her reliance on data in Ms Rachel Ng’s affidavit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 As to the reliance placed on the data in Ms Rachel Ng’s affidavit, I did not think the VRB erred in permitting Ms Ching to refer to such data and in subsequently accepting the findings she made based on such data. It was not disputed that Ms Rachel Ng was in fact medically unfit to give evidence. In the circumstances, I did not think it could be seriously disputed that it would have been open to the VRB to admit her affidavit into evidence pursuant to s 32(1)(j) EA. Given that the Appellant’s witness Ms Ng was asked about various aspects of Ms Rachel Ng’s affidavit in cross-examination, I also did not think it could be seriously disputed that the Appellant would have been well aware – even before Ms Ching took the witness stand – that the Chief Assessor was relying on data from that affidavit. It was open to the Appellant to produce evidence refuting the data in Ms Rachel Ng’s affidavit; even to seek leave from the VRB to call evidence in rebuttal of such data after Ms Ching’s testimony. It did neither of these things. In the circumstances, I did not find any merit in its objections on appeal to reliance being placed on such data.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 Similarly, it was open to the Appellant to adduce evidence that GV was  – contrary to Ms Ching’s findings – a “leading cinema operator”.  It did not. In the circumstances, the Appellant’s complaint on appeal that the VRB should not have accepted Ms Ching’s findings about GV’s “average occupier” status was wholly unmeritorious.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The estimation of the rental which a hypothetical client would pay and the use of “hindsight”</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 Since the evidence indicated that GV was an “average occupier”, I agreed with the VRB that it was reasonable to use GV’s profits and loss statements to determine the amount of rent that a hypothetical tenant would be willing to pay the subject property. In this respect, the Appellant argued that “Ms Ching’s approach to take the average of the gross profits for 3 years from 2005 to 2007 [was] flawed” because it failed to account for “the persistent downward trend in financial result suffered by GV and the onset of the global financial crisis in late 2007”

Further, so the Appellant contended, Ms Ching could not be permitted to support the valuation of the 2008 annual value by having regard to GV’s actual gross profits for the year 2008 itself and/or the later years of 2009 to 2011. According to the Appellant, there could be “no benefit of hindsight” because the Profits Method involved a “hypothetical tenant who [was] trying to project and estimate the earnings as at 1 January 2008”. This hypothetical tenant would not “have the benefit of relying on actual figures for the year 2008 to come up with the projections”

She was not testifying as a factual witness on the actual mode of assessment adopted by the Chief Assessor in 2008. In any event, as earlier observed, there was no actual assessment carried out in 2008, the 2008 annual value having been maintained at the same figure it was at from 2005 to 2007. The argument that Ms Ching could not be permitted the benefit of hindsight should accordingly be evaluated in this light. It should also be noted that Ms Ching in fact prepared two sets of calculations

</div>. In that case, which involved the rating of a public utility undertaking (the Central Electricity Board) for the valuation list made by the rating authority on 1 April 1934. The Profits Method was adopted as the appropriate rating methodology. In the assessment, evidence of the Central Electricity Board’s profits subsequent to 1 April 1934 was excluded. On appeal, the Divisional Court – and after that, the English CA – upheld the exclusion of the profit figures post 1 April 1934. In the English CA, Goddard LJ stated:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…the profits basis has to be calculated not on what may happen in the future, but on the profits ascertained down to the latest period before the date of the rate or, in this case, the preparation of the valuation list and, therefore, the quarter sessions were right in excluding evidence as to events subsequent to 1934 as being irrelevant.  The accounts to April 1, 1934, were relevant and those subsequent to that date were irrelevant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 I make two points in respect of the Appellant’s reliance on <span class="font-italic">Barking</span>.  First, an examination of Goddard LJ’s judgement shows that the rating authority had actually called for the Central Electricity Board’s profit estimates subsequent to 1934, and the Board had declined to produce them on two grounds: first, that these were private papers which it could not be obliged to produce for the purpose of enabling the rateable value to be ascertained; and second, that only the accounts down to 1 April 1934 were relevant.  Goddard LJ’s comment that the accounts post 1 April 1934 were irrelevant was made in the context of his having found that the Board could not in any event have been obliged to produce and did not produce the estimates for subsequent years.  As he stated in the same passage in his judgement:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Moreover, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">as it was conceded that the respondents could not have been obliged to produce and did not produce the estimates for subsequent years, the question whether they contained anything relevant or irrelevant does not arise.  They were not in evidence</span> and the respondents [the Board] were entitled to take the objection that they were private documents and exempt from production… </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 The words in bold italics show that Goddard LJ’s statement as to the irrelevance of the accounts post 1 April 1934 was not intended to be a broad statement of general principle, but rather, a comment based on the facts of the case before him; in particular, the finding that the Board could not have been obliged to produce and did not produce the estimates for the period post 1 April 1934.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 Second, it did not seem to me sensible as a matter of principle to insist that in considering whether the 2008 valuation of $3,292,000 was reasonable and fair, neither the expert witness Ms Ching nor the VRB should be permitted to consider evidence of GV’s profit and loss figures post-2008. It is correct to say that the Profits Method is premised on a hypothetical tenant’s estimation of the earnings he may obtain from carrying out his business on the subject property for a particular year in order to project the rent he is willing to pay for that property in that year. However, as the CA has repeatedly emphasised, the assessment of “the gross amount at which [a subject property] can reasonably be expected to be let from year to year… is an objective exercise” (see <span class="font-italic">Glengary</span> at [31]). In evaluating whether the rental figure derived from the application of the Profits Method is a reasonable one, it would be needlessly pedantic to insist that evidence of the actual earnings for that year – or in the ensuing years – be completely disregarded. Thus, for example, in <span class="font-italic">Robinson Brothers</span>, Scott LJ held (at pp 482-483):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">You have in each case to find out in the best way you can what is the rent which a tenant may reasonably be expected to give, and if the best way under the particular circumstances is to ascertain the use which a tenant might expect to be able to make of the premises, the facility afforded by the premises for the carrying on of a trade appears to me to be a primary and elementary consideration in the case. If you are to take into account the fact that the premises command a trade, you must surely ask what trade. Is it a large trade, or is it a small trade?  And I do not know myself any better test of what trade they may be expected to command than the trade which they actually do command. It is not that you rate the profits, it is not that you rate the man’s skill and judgement or discretion in the mode of carrying on the business, but you have to ascertain what sort of trade the hypothetical tenant, as he is called, may reasonably expect to be able to carry on on those premises as an element in determining the rent he would be willing to offer… I entirely agree in a passage in the Lord Chancellor’s judgement, which I will take the liberty of quoting and adopting as the expression of my own mind. His Lordship says: ‘It would be to my mind one of the most extraordinary things in the world if you could give expert evidence that such and such a house would be likely to command such and such a business, and yet not be able to verify that a priori opinion by proof of the fact that it did command such a business.’</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 In <span class="font-italic">China Light &amp; Power Co Ltd </span><span class="font-italic">v Commissioner of Rating &amp; Valuation (No. 1)</span> [1997] 4 HKC 461, the Hong Kong Lands Tribunal had to consider the use of the Profits Method in the valuation of power stations owned by the appellant company which was in the business of electricity generation. The valuation was in respect of the year commencing 1 April 1991. The Lands Tribunal noted that both the valuers who gave evidence before it had taken into account a number of trends in the growth of revenue and customer base which had become evident by 1 July 1990; and that in taking into account those trends, each valuer had also sought to reduce the subjectivity of his assessment and to improve the accuracy of valuation by relying on an element of hindsight – for example, by considering if the <span class="font-italic">projected</span> growth and depreciation rates could be achieved, having regard to the actual growth and depreciation figures taken from the annual accounts up to 30 September 1991. The Land Tribunals viewed this reliance on hindsight with approbation, stating as follows (at p 478 E-H):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Both valuers’ approaches involved exercising varying degrees of hindsight. Hindsight may be available to a valuer depending on the statutory or other terms of reference.  Where hindsight can be used it is obviously desirable, if the material is available, to achieve greater accuracy by using actual figures, rather than falling back on assumption based projections. This Tribunal has for many years encouraged valuers to take advantage of hindsight where, as a matter of law, that course is permissible.  At times valuers too readily ignore post-relevant date evidence, by self-imposed rules of practice, which have no basis in law.  </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If authority for taking advantage of the benefit of hindsight is required, it is to be found in the judgement of Lord Macnaghten in <span class="font-italic">Bwllfa</span><span class="font-italic"> v Merthyr Dare Steam Collieries</span> (1891) Ltd v Pontypridd Waterworks Co [1903] AC 426.

Of course the Appellant objected to the first factor on the basis that the fitting-out works installed by GV should be regarded as “Tenant’s Fittings” and should not be considered fixtures forming part of the subject property

I have earlier dealt with this under the Third Issue (see above at [55]-[110]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 As to the second factor, I did not think it could be seriously disputed that the prime location enjoyed by the subject property in this case constituted a major contributor in the generation of revenue by GV. The Appellant argued that in taking locational advantage into account in the allocation of the tenant’s share, Ms Ching had “effectively double-counted” for the effects of the factor because she had already “chosen to use actual profits of GV in her application of the Profits Method” and had in so doing expressed the view “that the location of Plaza Singapura contributed substantially to the profits of GV”

</div>. I did not find any merit in this argument. That Ms Ching might have (quite rightly) acknowledged locational advantage to be one of the factors contributing to GV’s gross receipts did not in principle preclude her from taking into account locational advantage as one of the factors relevant to her assessment of the relative contributions of landlord and tenant in increasing the size of the divisible balance. As counsel for the Chief Assessor pointed out, there would really only be double-counting of the effects of locational advantage if Ms Ching had “allowed the landlord a first bite of the divisible balance, leaving the remainder to be split between the landlord and tenant”. She did not: the “entire divisible balance [was] split between the hypothetical landlord and the hypothetical tenant”

</div>. The Appellant sought to argue that this study showed that “accommodating a Cineplex within a shopping mall enhances the shopping centre’s magnetism by attracting a specific user group to visit it more frequently and also, entice them to stay longer”.  Whilst I did not disallow the Appellant’s reference in their submissions to the paper, I did not accord any real weight to its contents, given that these contents had not been probed or tested by being put to either of the expert witnesses below.  In any event, the paper concerned a survey of <span class="font-italic">suburban </span>malls; the Appellant did not produce any evidence to support its contention that the “Cineplex effect” referred to in the paper would apply with equal force to an Orchard Road mall such as Plaza Singapura.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 Finally, in respect of Ms Ching’s allocation of 40% for the tenant’s share, I found it reasonable for her to have drawn comparisons with the decision in <span class="font-italic">Underwater World</span>. In <span class="font-italic">Underwater World</span>, the VRB considered the appellant tenant’s counter-argument that its tenant’s Share of the divisible balance should be 80% in view of the high risks involved in operating a theme park, as evidenced by the failure of high-profile theme parks such as the Tang Dynasty Village, Haw Park Villa and the Chinese Garden.  Whilst acknowledging the risks inherent in operating a theme park, the VRB nevertheless concluded (at [37]) that the Chief Assessor’s allocation of 50% as the Tenant’s Share was “already a reasonable amount”. The VRB noted that Sentosa had been “specially developed as a place for pleasure and leisure”, and held that “[i]n this case, the location played the crucial role in the generation of the income of the theme park” (at [35]). Given the risks inherent in operating a theme park involving live animal exhibits and performances, I did not think it at all unjustifiable for Ms Ching to suggest that the tenant’s business in <span class="font-italic">Underwater World</span> was more risky than GV’s business as a cinema operator in the present case.  Since the Appellant had the onus of proving the Chief Assessor’s decision wrong in this appeal, and since it objected to the allocation of 40% for the tenant’s share as being too low, it should have been the party to adduce the necessary evidence if it asserted that GV’s business as a cinema operator carried higher risks than that of a theme park operator like the tenant in <span class="font-italic">Underwater World</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 For the above reasons, I did not find any merit in the Appellant’s objections to the allocation of 40% for the tenant’s share in this case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The application of the Rental Comparison Method in respect of the office and retail components</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 As to Ms Ching’s use of the Rental Comparison Method in respect of the office and retail components of the subject property, the Appellant only took issue with its application to the office component.

I did not find the Appellant’s criticism to be made out. Ms Ching had explained that generally a smaller area would mean a higher dollar rate of rental. Since the office in Basement 1 was 623m2 compared to the 7th floor office unit which was 452.72m2, she estimated the office rental for the 7th floor office unit to be slightly higher at $3.50 psf/month, taking into account the rental evidence of comparable office properties in the vicinity. I did not see anything illogical or unreasonable in this approach. Indeed, the Appellant’s own expert Ms Ng did not disagree with the concept that the rental rate for a larger area would be lower due to size adjustments

The point to be emphasised, though, is that there is nothing in s 2(4), or for that matter, in the rest of the PTA, which “precludes” the Chief Assessor from including – in his assessment of the annual value – the annualised cost of fitting-out works which constitute fixtures and form part of the subject property.  Indeed, as counsel for the Chief Assessor pointed out, to exclude this cost would “fly in the face of the legislative purpose of the PTA, which is to levy tax on immoveable properties”

</div> – which it claimed showed the VRB’s previous rejection of the Rent Plus Amortised Cost Approach.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">162 As to <span class="font-italic">Causeway Point</span>, I have earlier noted that the report of the VRB’s decision in this case is extremely brief and provides little if any guidance to the VRB’s reasoning.  It was not clear from this report whether the VRB’s reference to “the notional rent approach” was a reference to the Rent Plus Amortised Cost Approach. Even assuming it was a reference to the Rent Plus Amortised Cost Approach, nothing in the report suggested that the VRB had found this methodology to be – generally and in principle – inappropriate for use in the assessment of annual value. Indeed, it was plain from the report that the VRB intended its refusal to use the “notional rent approach” to be confined to the case before it, as it expressly stated that it felt this approach “was not the correct approach <span class="font-italic">in this case</span>” [emphasis added] (at [5]). The VRB further stated that it “was not shown” that there “was a correlation between how much a particular tenant was willing to pay for his improvements, and the amount a hypothetical tenant would be willing to pay” (at [6]); and it expressed some concern about the evidence from the Chief Assessor’s witness that there was “no limit” with the “notional rent approach and that even extravagant renovations would lead directly to an increase in the Annual Value”. These remarks showed that assuming the VRB in <span class="font-italic">Causeway Point</span> was referring to the Rent Plus Amortised Cost Approach, its refusal to use this approach was due to the evidential difficulties in that case, and not to the approach being generally unsuited for use in assessing the annual value. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">163 As for <span class="font-italic">First DCS</span><span class="font-italic"> (VRB)</span>, the subject property was a district cooling plant used for the production of chilled water for the air-conditioning needs of other buildings in Changi Business Park. In upholding the Chief Assessor’s decision to use the Contractor’s Test Method for the assessment of the annual value in that case, the VRB found that there was no real comparable rental evidence: even the rental paid for a Biopolis property retrofitted for a district cooling service was found not to provide “cogent rental evidence of a like district cooling plant” because of the differences in its design (at [10]).  The appellant property-owner argued for the application of what it called “an ‘Elemental approach’, comprising a rental value for the premises and the value of the tank structure”. This, the present Appellant submitted, was really the same thing as the Rent Plus Amortised Cost Approach. In <span class="font-italic">First DCS</span><span class="font-italic"> (VRB)</span>, the Chief Assessor had expressed the concern that the “Elemental approach” was at that point “as yet unprecedented in Singapore”, and had cited several earlier cases in which the VRB had allegedly declined to use the approach. Notably, the VRB’s response to this was that “(t)he present case [did] not require [it] to decide on the cases cited”; and that for its “present purposes, where [it had] held that there [was] no relevant, reliable and competitive comparable rental”, the “Elemental approach” – “which requires elements of the rental method to be combined with elements of the contractor’s test – would clearly not be appropriate” (at 12]). Again, therefore, the VRB’s refusal to adopt the “Elemental approach” in <span class="font-italic">First DCS (VRB)</span> was also confined to the specific facts of the case before it. This is also made clear in Andrew Ang J’s judgement on appeal. At [49] of his judgement, he noted that the “Elemental approach” comprised two elements: first, a rental value for the premises based on that of a comparable property; and second, a value based on the contractor’s test method for the tank structure on the land. As noted earlier, Ang J declined to interfere with the VRB’s finding that no comparable rental evidence existed, and accordingly held (at [52]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In the absence of rental evidence of comparable properties, the first element of the elemental approach cannot be ascertained.  The elemental approach therefore cannot be used.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">164 For the reasons set out above, I rejected the Appellant’s argument that the use of the Rent Plus Amortised Approach in this case was “precluded” by the PTA and /or that it had been disavowed by the VRB in previous decisions.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether the use of 18 years as the period of amortisation and 6% per annum as the rate of return was reasonable and fair</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">165 In applying the Rent Plus Amortised Cost Approach as a “check” in this case, Ms Ching adopted 18 years as the period of amortisation and 6% per annum as the rate of return.

Having examined Ms Ching’s evidence, however, I was satisfied that she was able to explain her reasons cogently and sensibly.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">166 In respect of the adoption of 18 years as the period of amortisation, Ms Ching explained that she had proceeded on the basis that all renewal options would be exercised because in her experience, for cinema leases where substantial fitting-out costs were generally incurred, the cinema operator would usually look to a lease period of more than 10 years

Ms Ching explained that a hypothetical landlord who had invested $7.373 million (the total cost of the included assets) in the subject property would hope to recoup the principal sum and returns as a rate of return similar to what CMT had derived from Plaza Singapura, subject to the following: since Plaza Singapura was a freehold whereas the subject property was leased for a total period of 18 years (assuming all renewal options were exercised), a hypothetical landlord looking at the subject property would require a rate of return higher than 5.4% in order to recoup its total investment. Seen in this light, Ms Ching’s assessment was that 6% was a reasonable rate of return.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">168 The Appellant complained that Ms Ching should not have relied on the capitalisation rates shown in CMT’s unitholder reports because “those rates were based on valuations for which Ms Ching conceded she had no information on”

</div>.  Again, this objection was in my view spurious. Ms Ching did not claim that tenure was the only factor which could influence capitalisation rates. The upshot of her evidence, as I understood it, was really that all other things being equal, the shorter the time frame the hypothetical landlord had to recoup his investment, the higher should be the rate of return required on the capital investment. I did not think this was a proposition that could be faulted in terms of logic and common sense. That the 6% rate of return was ultimately a value judgement was inevitable; the question was whether this value judgement was supported by credible reasons. The VRB accepted that it was

</div>, and I found no reason on appeal to disagree. As Lord Diplock observed in <span class="font-italic">Collector of Land Revenue v </span><span class="font-italic">Alagappa Chettiar</span> [1971] 1 MLJ 43:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…(L)and valuation inevitably involves an element of appreciation and impression. There is room for divergence of opinion. As in the case of appeals against assessments of damages or against apportionment of blame in actions for negligence an appellate court ought not to reject the judge’s assessment and to embark upon a fresh valuation of its own unless it is satisfied for good reason that the judge’s assessment must be wrong.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">170 The above passage was also relied on by Andrew Ang J in <span class="font-italic">First DCS (HC)</span>, at [51] of his judgement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">171 Finally, as counsel for the Chief Assessor highlighted, while the Appellant carped at virtually every aspect of Ms Ching’s evidence on her application of the Rent Plus Amortised Approach, the Appellant’s own expert Ms Ng did not offer any evidence as to viable alternatives to the amortisation factors of 18 years and 6% per annum as the rate of return.  Ms Ching’s testimony thus remained the only evidence before the VRB and before me. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">172 To sum up, therefore: on a review of the evidence, the VRB’s reasoning and the arguments advanced on appeal, I did not find the Appellant to have demonstrated any fatal flaw in Ms Ching’s application of the Rent Plus Amortised Cost Approach. In any event, as stated earlier, given my findings on the Appellant’s arguments for the application of the Rental Comparison method versus Ms Ching’s use of the Profits Method for the cinema complex and the Rental Comparison Method for the office and retail components, I did not find it necessary to rely on Ms Ching’s evidence of this backup “check” method in order to dismiss the present appeal.  </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">173 For the reasons set out above, I dismissed the Appellant’s appeal against the VRB’s decision and awarded costs of the appeal to the Chief Assessor, such costs to be taxed if not agreed within two weeks from my order. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Mavis Chionh Sze Chyi  <br/>Judicial Commissioner</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Tan Kay Kheng and Soh Zi Qing Jeremiah (WongPartnership LLP) for the appellant;<br/>Quek Hui Ling, Pang Mei Yu and Chong Wai Teng Victoria (Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (Law Division)) for the respondent. </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-List text-justify"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
