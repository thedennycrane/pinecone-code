However, the defendant would not, for this reason, be barred from effecting valid service on the plaintiff by way of the advertisement and/or the 4 October email, under r 96(4)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) BR. In the present case, both the advertisement and the 4 October 2019 email, individually or collectively, would, in my view, constitute valid service under r 96(4)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>BR. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 The underlying purpose of the service regime under the BR is to provide practical means for a creditor to effectually bring notice of a statutory demand to a debtor’s attention. To this end, each limb under r 96(4) BR pertaining to the modes of substituted service is to be read disjunctively, providing a creditor with alternative modes of substituted service. Further, the individual limbs in r 96(4) BR are not, in my view, mutually exclusive. Subject to the caveat I mention at [27] below, a creditor can choose to effect substituted service using any mode permissible under r 96(4) BR, provided he is able to satisfy the requirements of the mode so chosen. In this regard, and as succinctly explained by VK Rajah J (as he then was) in Re<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Rasmachayana Sulistyo (alias Chang Whe Ming), </span>ex parte<span class="font-italic"> The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp Ltd and other appeals</span> [2005] 1 SLR(R) 483 (“Re<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Rasmachayana Sulistyo</span>”) at [10], it is important to bear in mind that the requirements for service under the BR are “circumscribed by pragmatism and not by an overtly rigid and technical approach.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 As such, a creditor would only be availed of service under r 96(4)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>BR if he is able to meet the requirements under that provision, <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>the creditor must have been unable to effect substituted service in accordance with rr 96(4)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>or (<span class="font-italic">b</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>BR by reason of the creditor having no knowledge of the debtor’s last known place of residence, business or employment<span class="font-italic">. </span>If the creditor, like the defendant in this case, is unable to meet the requirements under r 96(4)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>BR, the statutory regime enables it to effect substituted service under r 96(4)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>BR and it cannot, in those circumstances, be said to be circumventing r 96(4)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>BR. Rule 96(4)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>BR, unlike r 96(4)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) BR, does not contain any pre-requisite that the modes of service under the other sub-paragraphs are unavailable to the creditor.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 There is a caveat to this, in that a creditor should, ordinarily, first avail itself of rr 96(4)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>and (<span class="font-italic">b</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>BR before choosing to effect service under r 96(4)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>BR. The first two limbs in r 96(4) BR encapsulate the preferred methods of substituted service (<span class="font-italic">Re: Wong Kin Heng Ex-</span><span class="font-italic">parte: Imperial Steel Drum Manufacturers Sdn Bhd </span>[1998] SGHC 237 (“<span class="font-italic">Wong Kin Heng</span>”) at [29]). To this, I would add the gloss that the methods prescribed in rr 96(4)(a) and (b) BR should first be attempted <span class="font-italic">where practicable</span>, depending on the specific facts in each case. If, for example, a creditor is aware that the debtor sold the property that was his last known address and therefore no longer resided at that address, and yet purports to effect substituted service of a statutory demand under r 96(4)<span class="font-italic">(a) </span>or <span class="font-italic">(b)</span> BR at that address, that creditor might find it an uphill task to persuade a court, should the debtor subsequently challenge the service of the demand, that the method of substituted service so chosen was effective in bringing the statutory demand to the notice of the debtor. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Reverting to the case at hand, contrary to the plaintiff’s submissions, I am of the view that r 96(4)<span class="font-italic">(</span><span class="font-italic">c) </span>BR is not the only or exclusive provision under which service by way of an advertisement can constitute valid service of an SD. On its plain wording, r 96(4)<span class="font-italic">(</span><span class="font-italic">d) </span>BR<span class="font-italic"> </span>provides for service by such other mode as the court would have ordered in an application for substituted service of an originating summons in the circumstances.

</div>. I note that no arguments were raised nor was any discussion had in <span class="font-italic">Wong </span><span class="font-italic">Kwei Cheong</span> on the application of r<span class="font-italic"> </span>96(4)(<span class="font-italic">d) </span>BR to the facts in that case. I do not read <span class="font-italic">Wong </span><span class="font-italic">Kwei Cheong</span> as widely as Mr Kang urged me to. In <span class="font-italic">Wong </span><span class="font-italic">Kwei Cheong</span>, Rajendran J reasoned at [15], that a creditor has to comply with the procedures specified under the BR to take advantage of the statutory regime relating to substituted service. In that context, r 96(4)(<span class="font-italic">c) </span>BR required the creditor to advertise the statutory demand itself and not only a notice of it. Whilst that conclusion was, in my view, correct given the plain wording of r 96(4)<span class="font-italic">(</span><span class="font-italic">c) </span>BR, I disagreed with Mr Kang’s submission that it follows that service by way of advertisement is exclusively governed by that provision. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 As explained earlier at [24]-[28] of this judgment, r 96(4)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) BR<span class="font-italic"> </span>is inapplicable in the present case and the defendant is, in my view, entitled to avail itself of r 96(4)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>BR. No authority was cited to me in support of the plaintiff’s argument that substituted service by advertisement, in any shape or form, was only permitted under r 96(4)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) BR.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Where proceedings are commenced in court and the court makes an order for substituted service of a document (including an originating process) under O 62 r 5 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“ROC”), advertising <span class="font-italic">a notice</span> that an action has been commenced against the defendant would be sufficient to constitute good and valid service (see, as an illustration, ROC Appendix A, Forms 136 and 138, para (e)). The authors of <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure 2020, vol 1 </span>(Paul Quan, gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell Asia, 2019) at para 62/5/6, note that in relation to substituted service of a writ by advertisement under O 62 r 5 ROC, “… the court’s order may direct that a copy of the writ be left at the defendant’s place of business and last known residence, and that an advertisement be inserted to the effect that an action has been commenced, that the court has authorised service in such and such a manner, that the defendant is required to appear, and that in default of appearance, the action will proceed to judgment”. There is no requirement, in the above example, that the contents of the entire writ (including any Endorsement of Claim or Statement of Claim endorsed thereon) are to also be reproduced in the advertisement. In my view, that would also be the case if substituted service of an originating summons by way of advertisement is ordered under O 62 r 5 ROC. The notice in the advertisement could be to the effect that an action has been commenced by originating summons against the defendant, that the court has authorised service in such and such a manner, that the defendant is required to appear, and that in default of appearance, the court will proceed to hear the originating summons. Similarly, I see no reason why a bankruptcy creditor would not, in an appropriate case, be able to validly serve a statutory demand under r 96(4)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>BR by advertising notice of it and thereby bringing notice of the statutory demand to the debtor’s attention. Ultimately, the court must be satisfied that the mode of substituted service employed by the creditor was sufficient, <span class="font-italic">on the facts before it</span>, and amounted to a reasonable step by the creditor to bring notice of the statutory demand to the debtor’s attention effectively. Accepting the plaintiff’s submission would, in my view, amount to adopting an overtly and unduly technical and rigid approach to the methods of substituted service prescribed in r 96(4) BR.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Mr Kang also contended that to allow advertisement of a notice of the SD under r 96(4)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>BR would render r 96(4)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>BR redundant. I disagree with this submission as it presupposed, incorrectly, in my view, that each limb in r 96(4) BR applied to the mutual exclusion of the others. Even if there is an overlap between the first three limbs of r 96(4) and r 96(4)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>BR, as I stated at [31] above, ultimately each case would depend on its facts. Therefore, it does not mean that a creditor could circumvent the requirements of r 96(4)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>BR and choose instead to simply rely on r 96(4)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>BR by only advertising notice of an SD. Depending on the facts, that creditor would risk the debtor being able to successfully challenge the validity of that mode of service. In the circumstances, I was not persuaded by the redundancy argument raised by the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 On the facts of this case, the defendant had taken all reasonable steps to bring the SD to the plaintiff’s attention and utilised a mode of substituted service that the court would have ordered in the circumstances, as required under rr 96(1) and 96(4) BR. The defendant had conducted the necessary investigations into the last known address of the plaintiff and knowing that the plaintiff was not likely to be reached at the said address, adopted, in my judgment, an appropriate and valid mode of substituted service to serve the SD on the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 For the foregoing reasons, I found that the advertisement constituted valid service under r 96(4)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>BR in the circumstances of this case and was effective in bringing notice of the SD to the plaintiff’s attention. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Turning now to the 4 October 2019 email, I am of the view that it too constituted valid service under r 96(4)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>BR, whether on its own or taken together with the advertisement. On the facts, sending the notice of the SD as advertised by email to the plaintiff’s current solicitors was effectual in bringing notice of the SD to the plaintiff. Even though the plaintiff’s solicitors did not have authority to accept service of the SD on behalf of the plaintiff, they were at the time acting for the plaintiff in the taxation proceedings that were ongoing. As such, it was reasonable in the circumstances for the defendant to presume that this method of substituted service would be effective in bringing the SD to the plaintiff’s attention. The plaintiff’s solicitors also confirmed that the plaintiff did in fact have notice of the SD at around the time the 4 October 2019 email was sent.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 I did not think there was merit in the plaintiff’s argument summarised at [21] above that the defendant’s failure to adhere to paragraph 33(6) of the Supreme Court Practice Directions would invalidate the service of the SD by way of the 4 October 2019 email. While the Supreme Court Practice Directions on service by email should, if applicable, be adhered to, the issue before me was whether the 4 October 2019 email to the plaintiff’s solicitors would meet the requirements under r 96(4)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>BR as a valid mode of substituted service. As explained above, it was entirely reasonable for the defendant to presume that the 4 October 2019 email would be effective in bringing the plaintiff’s attention to the SD, and the SD was in fact successfully brought to the plaintiff’s attention. In <span class="font-italic">Wong </span><span class="font-italic">Kwei Cheong</span> ([20] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [14], Rajendran J accepted the debtor’s counsel’s argument that in circumstances where the creditor was aware that the debtor was legally represented, it would be reasonable to expect the creditor or its solicitors to communicate a statutory demand to the debtor through the debtor’s solicitors. This is precisely what the defendant did in this case by the 4 October email. It would therefore, in my opinion, have been a mode which the court would have ordered in an application for substituted service of an originating summons in the circumstances, irrespective of paragraph 33(6) of the Supreme Court Practice Directions. Further, I do not consider that paragraph 33(6) of the Supreme Court Practice Directions, or for that matter O 62 r 5(4) ROC, exhaustively set out the requirements of substituted service by way of electronic mail.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 In reaching this conclusion, I also considered that the court may permit substituted service of originating process by way of social media, including Skype, Facebook and internet message boards (see <span class="font-italic">Storey, David Ian Andrew v Planet </span><span class="font-italic">Arkadia Pte Ltd and others </span>[2016] SGHCR 7, in relation to substituted service under O 62 r 5 ROC). I hark back to VK Rajah J’s comments in Re<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Rasmachayana Sulistyo </span>([25] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [10] that the requirements for valid service of the statutory demand, whilst undoubtedly an important prerequisite to the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings, are circumscribed by pragmatism and not by an overtly rigid and technical approach. The emphasis of r 96 BR and the mischief it seeks to address is ensuring that the statutory demand is “brought to the <span class="font-italic">personal</span> attention of the debtor prior to the hearing of the petition” [emphasis in original] (<span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Rasmachayana Sulistyo</span> at [10] and [21]). The overarching intention of, or purpose underlying, the service requirements in civil proceedings in general, and under r 96 BR, is the efficacy of the mode of service (be it actual or deemed service) in bringing effective notice of the proceedings or the statutory demand, as the case may be, to the defendant or the debtor respectively. In my view, the 4 October email more than met this purpose on the facts before me and was therefore a sufficiently reasonable step taken by the defendant. In my judgment, it constituted valid service under r 96(4)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>BR, whether by itself or collectively with the advertisement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 For all the reasons given above, I dismissed the plaintiff’s challenge to the validity of service of the SD. The SD was validly served on the plaintiff on 4 October 2019.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 2: Whether there are any other grounds on which the SD should be set aside. </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Having found that there was valid service of the SD, I then turned my attention to whether the SD should be set aside on any other grounds under r 98 BR. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">No genuine triable issues on the 26 October invoice</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The parties’ cases </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 The plaintiff contended that the SD should be set aside under r 98(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>BR on the basis that he disputed the quantum owed to the defendant. The plaintiff submitted that the facts surrounding the 13 March invoice (and the taxation proceedings) gave him reason to deduce that there may be inaccuracies in the 26 October invoice that was the subject of the SD, that the 26 October invoice did not provide a breakdown of time entries, and that the amount of professional fees claimed by the defendant was unreasonably excessive.

</div> The plaintiff also submitted that the SD should be set aside under r 98(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>BR as he had a cross demand against the defendant for breach of contract for an amount that exceeded the amount of the debt specified in the SD. The essence of this last contention was that the defendant held deposits from the plaintiff that, according to the terms of the defendant’s letter of engagement, were only to be utilised in payment of the defendant’s final invoice (that, in this case, would have been the 13 March invoice). However, in breach of that term, the defendant proceeded to utilise the deposits in part payment of the 26 October invoice, which was the penultimate invoice issued by the defendant to the plaintiff. The plaintiff’s cross demand against the defendant was for the total amount of deposits amounting to $176,025.30 alleged to have been wrongfully utilised by the latter.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Plaintiff’s Submissions at paras 76-81 </div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 The defendant submitted that the plaintiff is no longer entitled to dispute the quantum of the debt, as taxation is the only judicial process by which a client can dispute the quantum of his solicitor’s bill, citing as authority the decision of Vinodh Coomaraswamy J in <span class="font-italic">Kosui</span><span class="font-italic"> Singapore Pte Ltd v Thangavelu </span>[2015] 5 SLR 722 (“<span class="font-italic">Kosui</span>”) at [56]–[57]. The plaintiff did not apply for an order for taxation within the time limit prescribed in the Legal Profession Act, and Abdullah J had found in OS 67 that there were no special circumstances justifying an order for taxation. As the plaintiff did not appeal the decision in OS 67, it had no other avenues available to it to challenge the quantum of the 26 October invoice.  The present appeal before me, the defendant so argued, was a backdoor attempt by the plaintiff to circumvent the decision of Abdullah J and thereby, in effect, obtain an order for taxation. The defendant submitted that if the SD was set aside and it were to commence a suit to enforce the debt, the court should similarly not go into the merits of whether the solicitor’s fees were reasonable. If it did, it would be tantamount to opening a backdoor for the plaintiff to enable taxation proceedings, thereby denuding the protection offered to solicitors against their clients under s 122 of the Legal Profession Act.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 In regard to the plaintiff’s contention that it had a valid and genuine cross demand against the defendant, the defendant’s explanation given to me by its counsel, Mr Goh Keng Huang (“Mr Goh”), was that there was an agreement reached during a telephone conversation between the defendant and the plaintiff’s previous solicitors Optimus Law, that the defendant was to utilise the deposit in part payment of the 26 October invoice in order to stop or reduce interest running on that invoice. Following that agreement, the total deposit amounting to $176,025.30 was so utilised by the defendant, and the remaining sum due under the 26 October invoice was the amount demanded in the SD.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Legal principles</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Rule 98(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>BR provides that the court shall set aside a statutory demand if the debtor appears to have a valid counterclaim, set-off or cross demand that is equivalent to or exceeds the amount of the debt or debts specified in the statutory demand. Rule 98(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>BR provides that the court shall set aside a statutory demand if the debt is disputed on grounds that appear to the court to be substantial. Additional guidance on these provisions has been given in paragraph 144(3) of the Supreme Court Practice Directions, which states that when a debtor claims to have a counterclaim, set-off or cross demand, or disputes the debt, the Court will normally set aside the statutory demand if, in its opinion, there is a genuine triable issue on the evidence. As the Court of Appeal explained in <span class="font-italic">Mohd</span><span class="font-italic"> Zain bin Abdullah v Chimbusco International Petroleum (Singapore) Pte Ltd and another appeal </span>[2014] 2 SLR 446 at [30], it will “not suffice for a debtor to raise spurious allegations in order to fend off bankruptcy proceedings..…”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">No dispute that appears to the court to be substantial </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 I agreed with the defendant’s submissions and found <span class="font-italic">Kosui</span> persuasive that taxation is the exclusive judicial recourse available to the plaintiff to any challenge he wished to mount over the quantum of the defendant’s fees. The plaintiff had in fact attempted to avail himself of that very avenue of recourse <span class="font-italic">via</span> OS 67. The court had decided in OS 67 that the plaintiff was not entitled to an order for taxation for the 26 October invoice, from which order there was no appeal or attempt to do so by the plaintiff. That was, in my judgment, rightly the end of the matter in relation to whether the 26 October invoice could be challenged. The 13 March invoice, which was the subject of the taxation proceedings, was a separate matter from, and irrelevant to, the current proceedings. During the hearing before me, Mr Kang did not seek to distinguish <span class="font-italic">Kosui</span> or persuade me that it was inapplicable to the plaintiff’s case. Whilst Mr Kang submitted that the plaintiff was not seeking to circumvent the order of Abdullah J in OS 67, it was clear to me that this was, in substance, a blatant attempt to do so. As an illustration of this, the second affidavit of the plaintiff filed in OSB 129 comprised more than 70 paragraphs detailing why the quantum of the 26 October invoice was unreasonable. These would be precisely the sort of objections one would expect to be raised in taxation proceedings. It was therefore difficult to accept the plaintiff’s contention that he was not seeking a second bite of the cherry. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Finally, during the hearing before me, Mr Kang referred me briefly to the decision of Mavis Chionh DJ (as she then was) in <span class="font-italic">Engelin</span><span class="font-italic"> Teh Practice LLC formerly known as Engelin Teh and Partners v Tan Sui Chuan</span> [2006] SGDC 2 (“<span class="font-italic">Engelin</span><span class="font-italic"> Teh Practice</span>”). <span class="font-italic">Engelin</span><span class="font-italic"> Teh Practice</span> involved an appeal by the plaintiff law firm against the refusal to grant it summary judgment against the defendant, a former client. The appeal was allowed and judgment entered against the defendant by the judge. The defendant was granted leave by the judge to appeal to the High Court, and its appeal to the High Court was subsequently dismissed without any written grounds delivered. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Pertinently, in <span class="font-italic">Engelin</span><span class="font-italic"> Teh Practice</span>, it was held that as the defendant there had not objected to the bill for more than two years since the bill was delivered and no application had been made to tax the bill, the defendant was precluded from challenging the bill or seeking an order for taxation in the summary judgment proceedings.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Mr Kang referred me to a passage in <span class="font-italic">Engelin</span><span class="font-italic"> Teh Practice</span> where the judge was referred to an English Court of Appeal decision in <span class="font-italic">Turner &amp; Co</span><span class="font-italic"> (a firm) v O Paloma SA</span> [1999] 4 All ER 353 (“<span class="font-italic">Turner &amp; Co</span>”). Mr Kang relied on that passage in support of his argument that the plaintiff could, in OSB 129, still dispute the quantum of the defendant’s fees notwithstanding that the plaintiff was no longer entitled to have the 26 October invoice taxed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The English Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Turner &amp; Co</span> held that where a solicitor sued a client for unpaid charges, the client was entitled to challenge the reasonableness of the sum claimed under common law notwithstanding that the period for invoking the taxation procedure under the relevant English legislation (the 1974 Solicitors Act (c 47) (UK)) had expired.  Mr Kang submitted that following <span class="font-italic">Turner &amp; Co</span>, there was no bar to the plaintiff seeking to dispute the reasonableness of the 26 October invoice in OSB 129.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 I did not find <span class="font-italic">Turner &amp; Co</span> persuasive and in any event, I decline to follow it in light of the decision of Coomaraswamy J in <span class="font-italic">Kosui</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([41] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic">. </span>Indeed, it appeared to me that the <span class="font-italic">ratio decidendi</span> in <span class="font-italic">Engelin</span><span class="font-italic"> Teh Practice</span> (summarised at [46] above) was in fact consistent with <span class="font-italic">Kosui</span>. Further, <span class="font-italic">Turner &amp; Co</span> was, in my opinion, distinguishable from the facts before me. There was, for example, nothing to suggest that the defendant in <span class="font-italic">Turner &amp; Co</span> had applied to the court for an order for taxation and failed, like the plaintiff in this case.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 In my view, the plaintiff had failed to raise any genuine triable issue with regard to the quantum of the debt under the 26 October invoice and therefore, there was no basis for the SD to be set aside under r 98(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>BR. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">No valid or genuine cross demand</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Whilst the explanation given by Mr Goh at [42] above was not on affidavit, I saw no reason to disregard it or to disbelieve Mr Goh’s explanation.  In this case, the defendant’s counsel was from the same entity as the defendant who had issued the SD. In the circumstances and based on the explanation given, which I was prepared to accept, I rejected the plaintiff’s contention that it had a valid or genuine cross demand against the defendant to justify setting aside the SD under r 98(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>BR. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Extension of time</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Given my decision that the advertisement and the 4 October 2019 email constituted valid service of the SD, whether individually or collectively, it was not necessary for me to consider if service by way of the 22 October 2019 email was valid. In my view, valid substituted service of the SD was effected on 4 October 2019. Under r 97(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>BR, an application to set aside an SD was required to be made within 14 days from the date of actual or deemed service of the SD. The plaintiff’s application in OSB 129 (filed on 31 October 2019) was thus out of time as it should have been filed by 18 October 2019. The plaintiff would have to obtain an extension of time, under r 97(3) BR, to apply to set aside the SD. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 The plaintiff submitted that it had made its application to set aside the SD after only a short delay and with no prejudice to the defendant. Mr Kang cited <span class="font-italic">Liew Kai Lung Karl v Ching Chiat </span><span class="font-italic">Kwong </span>[2015] 3 SLR 1204 (“<span class="font-italic">Liew Kai </span><span class="font-italic">Lung Karl</span>”) to make the case that the threshold to obtain an extension of time was not a particularly high one, and also argued that the plaintiff had strong grounds on which to apply for the SD to be set aside. The defendant submitted that the plaintiff had not given the court any explanation for the delay and should not be granted an extension of time. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The factors that the court should take into consideration when an application is made for an extension of time to set aside an SD are set out in <span class="font-italic">Rafat</span><span class="font-italic"> Ali Rizvi v Ing Bank NV Hong Kong Branch </span>[2011] SGHC 114 at [32]. The factors are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the period of the delay;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the reasons for the delay;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the grounds for setting aside the statutory demand; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) the prejudice that may result from an extension of time.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">but the weight to be given to each factor is dependent on the specific facts of each case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 On the facts before me, the application was filed almost two weeks late, which I found to be not insubstantial given that the plaintiff was aware of the SD on or around 4 October 2019. Further, the plaintiff did not give any reasons for the delay and in fact it appears that he made a deliberate, tactical decision to wait until HC/B 2786/2019 was filed before taking any action.

</div>
</div> In addition, as I have found above, the grounds for setting aside the SD are also unmeritorious. However, since one of the reasons relied on by the plaintiff to set aside the SD was that he was not validly served, my decision on the date of valid service could conceivably affect his application for an extension of time. I thus proceeded to consider if there were other grounds on which the SD could be set aside. In any event, as I found the plaintiff’s application to set aside the SD to be without merit, whether an extension of time should be granted was ultimately rendered moot. This was, in essence, also the approach taken in<span class="font-italic"> Liew Kai Lung Karl</span> at [8].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 I found that: (a) there was valid service of the SD on the plaintiff on 4 October 2019 by way of the advertisement and the 4 October email, whether viewed individually or collectively; (b) there was no dispute on the debt that appeared to the court to be substantial; and (c) there was no valid cross demand that was equivalent to or exceeded the debt. For these reasons, I dismissed the plaintiff’s appeal with costs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 On the issue of costs, Mr Goh for the defendant sought to persuade me that costs should be ordered against the plaintiff on an indemnity basis and referred me to the decision of Justice Chan Seng Onn in <span class="font-italic">Airtrust</span><span class="font-italic"> (Hong Kong) Ltd v PH Hydraulics &amp; Engineering Pte Ltd</span> [2016] 5 SLR 103 at [49]. Mr Goh submitted that the conduct of the plaintiff in evading service and attempting, in OSB 129, to circumvent Abdullah J’s order in OS 67 amounted to sufficiently improper conduct warranting an order of indemnity costs against the plaintiff. On the other hand, Mr Kang submitted that it could not be said that OSB 129 was taken out without any basis or that the appeal before me had been conducted in an inappropriate or utterly baseless manner and therefore, costs of the appeal should only be awarded against the plaintiff on the standard basis. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 I agreed with the plaintiff. I did not think that the conduct of the plaintiff in OSB 129 or in the appeal before me could be construed as improper, warranting a departure from the usual basis on which costs are ordered against an unsuccessful party. This was not an appropriate case for costs against the plaintiff to be ordered on an indemnity basis. Accordingly, I ordered that the plaintiff pay the defendant costs of the appeal on the standard basis (inclusive of disbursements), which I fixed at $4,000. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">S Mohan <br/>Judicial Commissioner</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Derek Kang Yu Hsien and Ashok Kumar Rai (Cairnhill Law LLC) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Goh Keng Huang and Leong Woon Ho (Shook Lin &amp; Bok LLP) for the defendant;</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-center"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
