It carried on this business from the time it was incorporated in May 2005 until it went into liquidation in October 2007. Hocen has only ever had two shareholders and two directors: Ong Bee Chew and Ong Shu Lin. The two Ongs are, respectively, the plaintiff and the defendant in the two suits now before me. It does not appear that the two Ongs are related to each other.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 Hocen went into liquidation in 2007 because the defendant secured an order for it to be compulsorily wound up on the just and equitable ground. Acting by its liquidators, Hocen commenced these suits against the defendant in 2011 and 2012. In 2013, the liquidators assigned Hocen’s causes of action in these suits to the plaintiff. The plaintiff was then substituted for Hocen and progressed these suits to trial before me.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The plaintiff’s claim is that the defendant breached the statutory and fiduciary duties which he owed to Hocen by causing Hocen to make payments of about S$1.8m which were of no corporate benefit to Hocen.

I examine the terms of the assignment more closely at [188]–[189] below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 The plaintiff adopted the liquidators’ case against the defendant in both suits.

Both suits were ultimately tried before me.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Before turning to the parties’ cases, I make this general observation. The parties’ business relationship began on the basis that the plaintiff would bring to the table his capital and access to financing while the defendant would bring to the table the business opportunity to sell cables in China and his personal relationships with Chinese buyers. In short order, and supercharged by corruption, Hocen’s business proved lucrative beyond either party’s expectations (see [89] below). Each party then suspected the other of trying to take over the entire corrupt business for himself. The resulting deadlock led to the defendant’s application to wind up Hocen in 2007. It also led the plaintiff to fund the liquidators to pursue the defendant in these suits, and eventually to take over as the plaintiff in both suits. The parties’ business relationship has obviously ended in acrimony. I accept the defendant’s submission that the plaintiff has brought these suits against him as part of a vendetta arising from the defendant’s decision to kill the goose that laid the golden egg by winding up Hocen in 2007.

</div>
</div> The plaintiff submits that Hocen derived no corporate benefit from the Payments for two reasons: (a) because Crossbridge did not, in fact, provide any of the Services to Hocen; and (b) because the defendant caused Hocen to make the Payments pursuant to a scheme to engage and fund Crossbridge to procure business for Hocen from ZPMC by corruption. The plaintiff also claims that he was not complicit in the defendant’s breaches of duty because the plaintiff had little knowledge about Hocen’s dealings with Crossbridge and trusted the defendant in that regard. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 The defendant, on the other hand, claims that he did not breach his duties to Hocen. He argues that Hocen derived three corporate benefits from the Payments: (a) Crossbridge did, in fact, provide the Services; (b) Crossbridge entertained individuals from ZPMC and bought them gifts to induce them not to make complaints about cables supplied by Hocen; and (c) Crossbridge also entertained individuals from YICT and bought gifts for them.

</div> The defendant also claims that, despite appearances, the Payments were paid without corrupt intent and not pursuant to a scheme to procure business for Hocen by corruption. In the alternative, the defendant argues that if he did breach his duties to Hocen, the plaintiff is equally culpable. The plaintiff knew that Hocen was making the Payments to Crossbridge and knew the purpose of the Payments.

</div> The plaintiff suggests that the defendant does not himself believe that Crossbridge ever performed any of the Services. The thrust of the defendant’s evidence, as presented in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”), is that Hocen engaged Crossbridge to procure business from ZPMC, not to perform the Services for Hocen.

</div> It was only under cross-examination that the defendant attempted to support a case based on ZPMC’s actually performing the Services by alleging – for the first time – that he had personally witnessed Crossbridge inspecting the installation of Olex cables at the ZPMC site. Unsurprisingly, the plaintiff submits that the defendant’s oral evidence is an afterthought and should not be believed.

</div> In any event, even if the defendant’s claim to have visited the ZPMC site “a couple of times” is true, this does not address Crossbridge’s failure to prepare and furnish documentation to Hocen as stipulated in the Crossbridge Contracts.

</div>
</div> It is also unbelievable, says the plaintiff, for the defendant to claim that this documentation was unnecessary or that he could not obtain it as he was shorthanded. The defendant’s own position is that Crossbridge was engaged to inspect Olex cables and ensure that ZPMC properly installed the cables to protect Hocen against possible claims by ZPMC. On this hypothesis, it is likely that the defendant would have ensured that Hocen was actually protected by insisting that Crossbridge prepare and furnish the stipulated documentation, for  Hocen to have available in case ZPMC ever made a claim against Hocen arising from the installation work.

</div> The complete absence of any of the stipulated documentation amongst Hocen’s records means that it is more likely that Crossbridge never performed any of the Services.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Defendant’s submissions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 The defendant, in turn, has four principal submissions. First, he submits that the lack of documentation does not mean that Crossbridge did not perform the Services. He claims that counterparts in China do not place much emphasis on ensuring that documentation is complete and up to date. He did nevertheless satisfy himself, by visiting the ZPMC site, that Crossbridge had performed the Services. The reason that both he and the plaintiff did not ask Crossbridge for any reports is because they were satisfied that everything was running smoothly.

The defendant submits that the liquidators saw an email between the defendant and Huang in which the defendant had asked Huang to confirm the presence of Hocen’s subcontractors at ZPMC’s site. Little weight should therefore be given to the fact that Hocen’s liquidators did not find the fax, which contained words to similar effect, in Hocen’s records.

</div> The liquidator’s evidence was not challenged. The liquidator is an officer of the court. Neither party has suggested that he has acted without impartiality or independence, whether in giving evidence at trial or in his investigation of Hocen’s affairs. I accept his evidence. It is important also to note that the defendant does not suggest that Crossbridge did, in fact, generate and furnish to Hocen the documentation which it was obliged to generate under the Crossbridge Contracts or that it was likely to generate in the course of performing the Services, but that the documentation is, for whatever reason, no longer amongst Hocen’s documents or otherwise unavailable.

</div>
</div> It is understandable that a small company like Crossbridge may, for various reasons, fail to document thoroughly the services which it performs for a customer. But the complete lack of even the simplest form of direct or even indirect documentation in this case strongly suggests that Crossbridge never performed any of the Services at all. At the very least, as the plaintiff argues, the fact that Crossbridge failed to generate the documentation which the Crossbridge Contracts expressly obliged it to generate as part of the Services necessarily means that Crossbridge did not perform the Services in full.

</div> Furthermore, one would think that Hocen would consider it important to generate and retain some sort of documentation, however incomplete or indirect, to protect itself against claims by ZPMC. That was, after all, Hocen’s ostensible purpose in engaging Crossbridge to provide the Services.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51  Third, I agree with the plaintiff that Huang Xing Fei’s fax is inadmissible hearsay. Huang did not testify at trial to prove the fax and to be cross-examined on its contents. Even then, it is not clear that his direct evidence would have addressed the hearsay objection. There is no evidence that the contents of Huang’s fax – tendered to prove that Crossbridge in fact performed the Services – was within Huang’s personal knowledge.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Even if the fax were admissible, it would carry little evidential weight. Although it refers to “subcontractors”, there is no mention that Crossbridge was one of the subcontractors. Even if I were to assume that Huang was referring to Crossbridge, the statement that Hocen “engaged” Crossbridge to provide quality assurance services is merely evidence that Hocen entered into the Crossbridge Contracts. That is an undisputed and indisputable fact. The point in dispute is whether Crossbridge actually performed the Services. That is not a fact which Huang’s statement asserts. Even if I were to read Huang’s statement as confirming that Crossbridge actually did perform the Services, the statement does not assert – and therefore cannot prove – that Crossbridge performed the Services in accordance with the Crossbridge Contracts so as to have earned the Payments.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Fourth, I attach little weight to the photograph allegedly showing Joe Liang stripping cables on site. There is no independent evidence that the person in the photograph is in fact Joe Liang. There is also nothing in the photograph to suggest that it was taken at the ZPMC site. And even if it was, it would at best be evidence that on one specific occasion, one representative of Crossbridge was on site to remedy one specific issue with the cables. It hardly supports the claim that Crossbridge performed the Services in accordance with the Crossbridge Contracts so as to have earned the Payments. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Fifth, I do not accept the defendant’s evidence that he “personally witnessed” Crossbridge inspecting the installation of cables at the ZPMC site.

</div> Accordingly, the fact that Cheng was spotted on the island by someone other than the defendant hardly corroborates the defendant’s oral evidence that Crossbridge performed the Services: Cheng could have been there not for Crossbridge but for YICT. And even if he had been there for Crossbridge, that in itself says nothing about whether Crossbridge performed the Services in accordance with the Crossbridge Contracts so as to have earned the Payments. Loh’s ignorance about Crossbridge’s operations is underscored by his evidence that he knew nothing about the people associated with Crossbridge, including Joe Liang.

</div> The suggestion is that the plaintiff is attempting to shirk the legal burden of proving his case by relying on an absence of evidence that Crossbridge performed the Services. I do not accept that suggestion. Instead, I find that the plaintiff has produced evidence which is not inherently incredible – for example, in the form of the liquidator’s evidence that no documentation was found in Hocen’s records suggesting that Crossbridge had performed the Services – which suffices to raise an inference that Crossbridge did not in fact perform the Services. The evidential burden of rebutting that allegation thus falls properly upon the defendant. For the reasons I have given, the defendant has failed to produce weighty or even credible evidence to the contrary. The distinction between the legal and evidential burdens of proof are well-established and are explained fully in the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Britestone</span><span class="font-italic"> Pte Ltd v Smith &amp; Associates</span> [2007] 4 SLR(R) 855 at [57]–[60].

</div> Thus, having accepted that Crossbridge did not provide any reports or certifications to Hocen as it was obliged to by the Crossbridge Contracts, the defendant is eager to show that Crossbridge was nevertheless “resourceful in providing other ‘value added services’”. These other services included, among other things, “[e]ntertaining the [YICT] and ZPMC staff to maintain good relations so that they would not complain or create trouble.”

</div> Accordingly, the defendant appears not to dispute the substance of the plaintiff’s first submission on the purpose of the Payments (see [60] above) and the facts underlying the plaintiff’s second submission on the issue (see [61] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 What the defendant does dispute is the plaintiff’s allegation that Crossbridge procured business for Hocen from ZPMC <span class="font-italic">by corruption</span>. The defendant’s central submission on this issue is that he caused Hocen to make the Payments to Crossbridge without any corrupt intent. One reason for this, he says, is that Hocen did not instruct Crossbridge to buy gifts for people at ZPMC or to entertain them; instead, Crossbridge did this of its own accord to further Hocen’s business interests.

In that context, there is no technical definition of corruption is which is applicable. There is such a definition in the penal legislation which criminalises corruption. That definition contains the mental and physical elements which a prosecutor must prove to secure a conviction for corruption. But the broad question in this part of my analysis is whether the defendant breached his duty to Hocen as a director and not whether he is guilty of the crime of corruption. A director may breach his duties as a director by giving a corrupt payment as defined in the criminal law. But that is not the only way in which he may breach that duty. In any event, much will depend on the circumstances. Therefore, it would be inappropriate for me to suggest or to adopt a comprehensive legal definition of what corruption is for the purposes of determining whether a director is in breach of duty.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 In this connection, the plaintiff refers me to <span class="font-italic">Black’s Law Dictionary</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(10th Ed, 2014), which defines a bribe as a “reward, gift or favour given or promised with a view to pervert the judgment of or influence the action of a person in a position of trust”.

</div> That is, however, a distinction without a difference. The entertainment, gifts and favours which Crossbridge extended to the representatives of ZPMC amount to corruption because they were given for the purpose of influencing the decisions which the recipients made on behalf of ZPMC. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Second, I accept that Daniel Cheng used his position and influence in YICT to cause YICT, as the end user, to specify Olex cables over rival manufacturers’ cables in its contracts with ZPMC with the expectation that ZPMC would source the Olex cables through Hocen. Although the evidence which the plaintiff has presented as the foundation for this inference is circumstantial in nature, it is nevertheless compelling in effect when viewed in the round. Much of this evidence, again, comes from the defendant’s own mouth. Its key strands are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Daniel Cheng was in a position to influence YICT for Hocen’s benefit. As a representative of Crossbridge, who had been engaged and funded by Hocen to procure business, Cheng was alive to Hocen’s business interests. At the same time, he was also an equipment manager with YICT, according to the defendant.

I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that Cheng exercised improper influence over YICT, through bribes such as entertainment and gifts, to cause YICT to specify Olex cables in its contracts with ZPMC. And funding these inducements to YICT was at least part of the defendant’s purpose in making the Payments to Crossbridge. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Third, the defendant’s argument that he had no corrupt intent in making the Payments misses the point. What matters is whether he intended the Payments to be used to influence decision-makers in a position of trust at ZPMC and YICT. And that was indeed the defendant’s intention. It is his own case that the Payments went towards entertaining ZPMC officers and buying them gifts so that they would, among other things, not pursue valid claims against Hocen for defective cables or poor installation. While he seems to deny that Daniel Cheng played a crucial role in bribing YICT officers, he does not deny that the only way YICT would insist on Olex cables was if it had been persuaded to do so, and that Crossbridge was paid to do the persuasion (see [70(b)] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 For these reasons, I accept the plaintiff’s case that the defendant made the Payments pursuant to a scheme to engage and fund Crossbridge to procure business for Hocen from ZPMC by corruption.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Did the defendant breach his duty to Hocen?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 I turn now to whether, in the light of these facts, the defendant breached his duty to Hocen as a director.

I begin with the applicable principles. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Applicable principles</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 Section 157(1) of the Act imposes upon every director of every company two distinct statutory obligations in discharging the duties of his office: (a) at all times to act honestly; and (b) at all times to use reasonable diligence.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> I must therefore consider whether the defendant, as a director of Hocen, failed to act <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> in Hocen’s interests by causing Hocen to make the Payments to Crossbridge, or whether he failed to exercise reasonable care and diligence in doing so. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 I begin by considering the first of these distinct obligations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 To determine civil liability for breach of the duty to act <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> in the interests of a company, the court will assess the intention of a director on a subjective and an objective basis: <span class="font-italic">Goh Chan Peng and others v </span><span class="font-italic">Beyonics Technology Ltd and another and another appeal </span>[2017] SGCA 40 (“<span class="font-italic">Goh Chan Peng</span>”) at [35]–[36]. At the subjective level, the court must consider whether the director acted <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> in what he believed (and not what the court believes) to have been in the interests of the company (at [35]). At the objective level, the court has to assess whether an intelligent and honest man in the position of the director could, in the whole of the existing circumstances, have reasonably believed that acting in that way would be for the benefit of the company (at [36]). Where a director’s act is not objectively in the company’s interests, the court may draw the inference that the subjective element is also not satisfied (at [36]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Having framed the analysis as incorporating a discrete subjective element, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Goh Chan Peng</span> then endorses the observation in <span class="font-italic">Walter </span><span class="font-italic">Woon on Company Law </span>(Tan Cheng Han gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, Revised 3rd Ed, 2009) that the courts in practice often apply a more objective test (at [36]). In this connection, I add that <span class="font-italic">Goh Chan Peng</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>may be read in two ways. First, it may be read as relying on the objective assessment of a director’s intention purely as an evidential basis upon which to draw an inference as to his subjective intention. To the extent that this is true, <span class="font-italic">Goh Chan </span><span class="font-italic">Pheng</span> departs from the Court of Appeal’s earlier approach in <span class="font-italic">Ho</span><span class="font-italic"> Kang Peng v Scintronix Corp Ltd</span> [2014] 3 SLR 329 (“<span class="font-italic">Ho</span><span class="font-italic"> Kang Peng</span>”). That case has been regarded in a leading local text as laying down a purely objective approach to determining a civil breach of the duty to act <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> in the interests of a company: <span class="font-italic">Corporate Law</span> at paras 09.022–09.023. The second way in which <span class="font-italic">Goh</span><span class="font-italic"> Chan Pheng </span>may read is that it lays down a substantive objective component, consonant with <span class="font-italic">Ho</span><span class="font-italic"> Kang Peng</span>. <span class="font-italic">Goh Chan </span><span class="font-italic">Pheng </span>was not available at the time the parties made their closing submissions. In fairness to the parties, therefore, I shall read <span class="font-italic">Goh Chan </span><span class="font-italic">Pheng</span> as being consistent with <span class="font-italic">Ho</span><span class="font-italic"> Kang Peng.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 Also relevant to the present case is the idea that a director who creates a sham contract and who causes the company to participate in corruption cannot be said to be acting <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> in the interests of the company even if his subjective intent is to maximise the company’s profits. This proposition forms the <span class="font-italic">ratio</span> of <span class="font-italic">Ho</span><span class="font-italic"> Kang Peng</span>. That is a case on which the plaintiff relies heavily. The basis of the proposition appears to be twofold, according to <span class="font-italic">Ho</span><span class="font-italic"> Kang Peng </span>at [40]. First, it is not in the interests of a company to maximise profits by any means. It is in the interests of a company, which ultimately comprises its shareholders (at least, while it is solvent), “to have its directors act within their powers and for proper purposes, to obtain full disclosure from its directors, and not to be deceived by its directors”. Second, a director who causes a company to participate in corruption runs the risk of exposing the company to criminal liability, a risk which can never be justified as being in the company’s interests. The same would, of course, be true of a director who causes a company to make a payment to an intermediary, intending the intermediary to make the corrupt payments in place of the company.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 I make two conceptual observations about the principle in <span class="font-italic">Ho</span><span class="font-italic"> Kang Peng</span>. First, it seems to me that for the principle in <span class="font-italic">Ho</span><span class="font-italic"> Kang Peng</span> to have any teeth, the test for determining whether a director is in breach of his duty to act <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> in the interests of the company must necessarily incorporate a discrete objective element. That is because the principle in <span class="font-italic">Ho</span><span class="font-italic"> Kang Peng</span>, by definition, circumscribes the interests of a company and the justifiability of the risks which it may take in purely objective terms: terms which may be entirely at variance with a director’s subjective intentions. Thus, in <span class="font-italic">Ho</span><span class="font-italic"> Kang Peng</span>, the Court of Appeal accepted (at [37]) that the director in question, subjectively speaking, had the financial benefit of the company in mind and did not act to further his own interests: see also <span class="font-italic">Corporate Law</span> at para 09.022. The Court nevertheless went on to observe that, objectively speaking, the director acted against the company’s interests by causing it to participate in a corrupt scheme because his act exposed the company to potential criminal proceedings (at [40]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 By finding that the director in <span class="font-italic">Ho</span><span class="font-italic"> Kang Peng</span> had breached his duty to act <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> in the company’s interests solely by virtue of the objective result of his actions and not his subjective intention in acting as he did, the Court of Appeal effectively exercised a supervisory jurisdiction over directors by drawing a consequentialist line in the sand. A director who crosses that line will be held to have breached his duty to the company and will be held responsible for the result or potential result of his acts without regard to his subjective intention. The consequentialism behind the rule in <span class="font-italic">Ho</span><span class="font-italic"> Kang Peng</span> is unmistakeable: directors cannot be allowed, by crossing that line, to put at risk the wider interests which all stakeholders have in the company. In that case, the director was held to have crossed the line by exposing the company to criminal liability when he acted to maximise the company’s profits by participating in a corrupt scheme.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 This leads to my second observation, which is that the objective approach seems quite unexceptional in a case like <span class="font-italic">Ho</span><span class="font-italic"> Kang Peng</span> but can seem anomalous in a case like the present. The company in <span class="font-italic">Ho</span><span class="font-italic"> Kang Peng</span> was a large public listed company (see <span class="font-italic">Ho</span><span class="font-italic"> Kang Peng </span>at [41] and [70]). As such, it had widely-held shares, a broad base of diverse stakeholders and well-developed governance structures going far beyond the minimum required the Act. The director in <span class="font-italic">Ho</span><span class="font-italic"> Kang Peng</span> undermined all those underlying interests when he breached his duty. Hocen, on the other hand, is a small, closely-held private company. It has never had more than four employees. Its internal governance is no more than the bare minimum required by the Act. It has a complete coincidence of identity and interests between the directors, the shareholders and the company. That was the case throughout its life, and even now when it is in liquidation. Creditors’ interests have not intruded because it is solvent. In that sense, the plaintiff and the defendant <span class="font-italic">are</span> the company. I shall refer to such a company as a “one-man company”. I use that term to mean a company, whether solvent or insolvent, which is under the <span class="font-italic">de facto</span> ownership and control either of a single person or of a group of persons who are acting entirely in concert, all of whom I shall refer to as “director-shareholders”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 In a one-man company, it may be said that the consequentialism of the objective approach loses a measure of force, at least so long as it is solvent. There is no true separation between ownership and control. As a consequence, there is no principal-agent problem for the law on directors’ duties to target and address. In other words, there is in reality and in substance no abstract third party known as the “company” who has a diverging interest which the law must be astute to protect. Instead, the shareholders, the directors and the company are, <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">hypothesi</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>voluntarily assuming all of the risks which they choose to take on in order to maximise the company’s profits. There is a strong argument for saying that, in those circumstances, company law should not intervene to prescribe a consequentialist line beyond which a director’s act will be a breach of the director’s duty regardless of his subjective intention. If the director’s act exposes the company to risk, and the risk eventuates, the consequences that follow are within the province of the general law, both criminal and civil and both at the corporate and the individual level. If the risk does not eventuate, however, it could be said that company law has no basis to intervene and hold the director to be in breach of duty merely in exposing the company to that risk. Hence, the consequentialist approach, if it is to apply to a solvent one-man company such as Hocen, must be justified on grounds other than addressing the tensions inherent in the principal-agent problem. And there are at least two grounds.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 First, the law on directors’ duties serves not only to vindicate the shareholders’ private interest in having their capital applied in accordance with their agreement and for proper corporate purposes in order to maximise returns but also to vindicate a public interest in holding directors to minimum standards of commercial morality in directing a company’s affairs. No doubt that minimum standard must set a very low baseline in order to avoid unnecessary interference with the central role of the enterprise and of risk-taking in wealth creation. But not causing the company to participate in a scheme to procure business by corruption is not too much for company law to ask of a director. Because this interest is a public interest, it will subsist and can be vindicated at the suit of the company even in a one-man company, and even if the company is solvent. Of course, as a practical reality, this public interest will not be vindicated unless control of the company’s right to bring action changes, either through share transfers, through a successful application under s 216A of the Act or, as here, through the imposition of external administration such as the appointment of liquidators. But recognising that practical reality does not undermine the conceptual basis of the court’s supervisory jurisdiction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 Second, it is preferable for company law to take a single approach to all companies, whether large or small and whether widely or closely held. Just as all directors are subject to the same fiduciary, common law and statutory duties regardless of the size and nature of their companies, so too all directors must be subject to the same objective approach regardless. Making an exception to the objective approach for companies like Hocen would have to rest upon difficult distinctions of fact around the constitution and composition of a given company. These distinctions would have either have to be fixed <span class="font-italic">a priori</span> by drawing bright lines, which are always essentially arbitrary, or would have to be resolved after the fact by judge-made law on a case by case basis. Either approach runs the risk of introducing uncertainty and possible incoherence into the law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 The upshot is that there is good reason for the part-subjective and part-objective approach to breach of duty in <span class="font-italic">Ho</span><span class="font-italic"> Kang Peng</span> to prevail even in the case of a solvent one-man company like Hocen.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Analysis and decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 I turn now to apply these principles to the facts of the present case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 I begin by finding that, in causing Hocen to make the Payments, the defendant’s subjective intent was to confer an economic benefit on Hocen and not on himself. In a very broad sense, of course, it is true that the defendant’s ultimate objective in making the Payments was to derive a personal economic benefit by way of the fees he would earn as a director of Hocen and the dividends he would receive as a shareholder of Hocen. But, on the assumption I have set out at [18] above, his intention at all times was that those benefits should not accrue to him directly but only indirectly through the medium of the company. That would mean that he intended those benefits be equally available to all stakeholders in accordance with Hocen’s corporate constitution and the Act. And indeed both the plaintiff and the defendant did earn substantial director’s fees and dividends from Hocen so long as its business with ZPMC continued. There is therefore no reason for me to doubt that, as a question of fact, the defendant subjectively intended the Payments to result in an economic benefit for Hocen rather than for himself.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 The next point I make is that, in a purely factual sense, the Payments indeed resulted in a significant economic benefit for Hocen. The defendant engaged and paid Crossbridge to procure business for Hocen from ZPMC. The defendant told the liquidators in clear terms that “the tie up with Crossbridge brought us more sales because of their connection (<span class="font-italic">guanxi</span>) as they have high level contacts with ZPMC”.

</div> The effectiveness of Crossbridge is borne out by the figures. Hocen achieved the remarkable feat of booking almost S$23.7m in revenue and earning over S$4.7m in profit in just two and a half years of operations, achieving a profit margin of just under 20%. Further, it managed to do all of this with no sales staff at all in China and only three sales staff in Singapore.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> Virtually 100% of this business came from just one customer: ZPMC. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 However, I agree with the plaintiff that, on the authority of <span class="font-italic">Ho</span><span class="font-italic"> Kang Peng</span>, the defendant breached his duty to act <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>in the interests of Hocen when he secured this economic benefit for Hocen through corruption. Now, it is true that in this case, unlike <span class="font-italic">Ho</span><span class="font-italic"> Kang Peng</span>, the defendant did not deceive the company in securing the benefit. For reasons I will come to, I find that the plaintiff knew and understood how Hocen intended to and managed to attract this staggering volume of extraordinarily profitable business from ZPMC in such a short time. The sham Crossbridge Contracts and the Payments were therefore tacitly but unanimously approved by both organs of the company: the shareholders and the directors. In that sense also, the defendant did not act dishonestly, at least not as against the plaintiff or Hocen. Nevertheless, a number of factors lead me to conclude that the court’s supervisory jurisdiction over directors is engaged in this case so as to render the defendant’s conduct a breach of his duty to Hocen.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 The first factor is my finding that the defendant made the Payments pursuant to a scheme to engage and fund Crossbridge to procure business for Hocen from ZPMC by corruption. In the words of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Ho</span><span class="font-italic"> Kang Peng</span> (at [40]), the defendant by making the Payments created an “unjustified risk of subjecting [Hocen] to criminal liability”. That risk is objectively contrary to Hocen’s interests. The defendant personally created that risk by initiating and making the Payments.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 The second factor is my finding that the Crossbridge Contracts were sham contracts. As I have found (see [48]–[56] above), Crossbridge did not perform the Services for Hocen as stipulated in the Crossbridge Contracts. Crossbridge’s true role was to procure business for Hocen from ZPMC by corruption. But the truth is nowhere reflected in any agreement between Hocen and Crossbridge, and certainly not in the Crossbridge Contracts.

</div>
</div> I find that Hocen and Crossbridge intended the Crossbridge Contracts from the very outset to be nothing more than a plausible legal pretext for the corrupt scheme. They entered into the contracts with absolutely no intention whatsoever that Crossbridge should ever perform the stipulated Services. The result is that the Crossbridge Contracts were a sham. They were not unlike the sham consulting agreement which the director in <span class="font-italic">Ho</span><span class="font-italic"> Kang Peng</span> executed on behalf of his company as a plausible legal pretext for the corruption in that case. That was one reason the Court of Appeal found that the director had breached his duty to act honestly under s 157 of the Act: <span class="font-italic">Ho</span><span class="font-italic"> Kang Peng </span>at [41]. Similarly, the fact that the Crossbridge Contracts were a sham taints indelibly the defendant’s conduct in causing Hocen to make the Payments, ostensibly pursuant to those contracts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 A third factor is that the defendant deliberately structured the corrupt scheme to create a defence of plausible deniability. He needed this defence not as against the plaintiff, who for reasons I will explain knew the truth from the outset, but as against external parties such as Hocen’s auditor, a liquidator who might take over control of the company and criminal investigators such as the CAD who might investigate the Payments. The defendant’s own evidence is that he interposed Crossbridge in Hocen’s dealings with ZPMC because he wanted an intermediary to do what he euphemistically calls the “leg work” and what I would call the dirty work:

</div> </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">This is also to ensure that the end customers/users will be happy with the cables supplied, and do not cause trouble by complaining about quality and delivery (which is a common practice in China to obtain gratification and kick back). As [the plaintiff] and I were not prepared to pay any kick back, [the plaintiff] himself had proposed using a middle man to do the necessary leg work and to ease the paper works. This was agreed between the 2 directors, and the Company needed Crossbridge to service the customers in China, without the 2 directors being accused of paying bribes or kick-backs. In fact, this was the idea of [the plaintiff], who wanted to keep his nose clean and use others to facilitate the business, and now after we have our fall out, [the plaintiff] is trying to get me into trouble by alleging that I pocketed the money.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">This indicates, at the very least, that the defendant interposed Crossbridge specifically to remove Hocen by one step from future gratifications to ZPMC. Further, the defendant made the majority of the Payments in cash delivered directly to Crossbridge. That was no doubt to make it harder for anyone with an interest to trace the flow of funds and the purpose of the Payments. All of this was a deliberate attempt to engage plausible deniability and to misdirect investigation of the Payments by external parties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 It will be recalled that the plaintiff’s pleaded case is that the defendant breached his duties to Hocen by effecting various payments to Crossbridge which did not confer any corporate benefit on Hocen: see [38] above. The plaintiff has asserted that the Payments had three purposes (see [35] above). The sole legitimate purpose is as compensation to Crossbridge for performing the Services. As Crossbridge did not perform the Services, it follows that Hocen made the Payments for illegitimate purposes. The Payments did, however, earn huge profits for Hocen. But that economic benefit cannot be regarded as a corporate benefit because that economic benefit was derived by corruption, at the cost of exposing Hocen to criminal liability. All of that points to the defendant breaching his duty to act <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> in the company’s interests rather than complying with it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 All of this also points to the defendant having breached his duty to exercise reasonable care and diligence rather than complying with it. It is apposite to note here that the Court of Appeal’s analysis in <span class="font-italic">Ho</span><span class="font-italic"> Kang Peng</span> found that the director’s act in causing the company to enter into a sham contract as a pretext for making corrupt payments was a breach not only of his fiduciary duty, but also of his duty to exercise reasonable diligence and to exercise reasonable care and skill: see <span class="font-italic">Ho</span><span class="font-italic"> Kang Peng</span> at [40], [42] and [44]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 Accordingly, the plaintiff has succeeded in proving his pleaded case. The defendant is in breach of duty to Hocen. That suffices to dispose of the defendant’s primary case in defence.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 2: The plaintiff’s breach of duty</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 I turn now to consider the defendant’s alternative case in defence. That case is that the plaintiff knew and approved of the defendant’s scheme to engage and fund Crossbridge to procure business for Hocen from ZPMC by corruption and is therefore liable to make a contribution of 50% to the defendant in respect of his liability. I begin with the defendant’s submissions.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Knowledge of Hocen’s transactions with Crossbridge</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Defendant’s submissions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 The defendant’s case on the plaintiff’s knowledge of Hocen’s transactions with Crossbridge is this: the plaintiff knew the true purpose of involving Crossbridge in the parties’ planned business even before Hocen was incorporated. After Hocen was incorporated, the plaintiff was an equal participant in all of Hocen’s major decisions, particularly those involving Hocen’s business and finances. The plaintiff approved all 18 of the Payments and countersigned the relevant cheques or remittance instructions together with the defendant.

The plaintiff refers to the latter role as that of an “agent”. As a result, says the plaintiff, his understanding of Crossbridge’s true role all along was that it was a subcontractor and not an agent. He says that the defendant himself maintained the position that Crossbridge was a subcontractor before this litigation was commenced.

I find that the plaintiff knew exactly the purpose of the defendant’s visit to the MacPherson branch of UOB to do in September 2005. The plaintiff had signed the cash cheque which the defendant took with him to UOB that day. And, when the plaintiff asked the defendant the purpose of the payment (as the plaintiff testified he always did), I find that the defendant would have told him the true purpose of the payment in order to obtain the defendant’s signature on it. Moreover, the weight of the plaintiff’s own evidence is that he knew that the defendant was at the branch to cash a cheque.

</div> The foundation of the plaintiff’s claim of ignorance in this regard is effectively an assertion that the defendant – while he was making the 18 Payments to Crossbridge and when the plaintiff questioned the defendant on the need for each of the Payments, as the plaintiff claims he did – consistently and repeatedly lied to the plaintiff that Crossbridge was merely a subcontractor and that Hocen was paying Crossbridge these large sums of money purely for the never-performed Services. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 In my judgment, the defendant had no reason to lie consistently and repeatedly in this manner. I attach little weight to the fact that the plaintiff has historically referred to Crossbridge consistently as a subcontractor, a point the plaintiff emphasises in his submissions: see [104] above. That fact is equally consistent with the view that the plaintiff knew all along that Crossbridge was procuring business from ZPMC for Hocen by corruption – which is the defendant’s alternative case – and that the plaintiff knew well enough to conceal his knowledge of the corrupt scheme to protect himself. That, I find, is what in fact happened. The plaintiff has offered no sensible reason why the defendant would lie to him consistently and repeatedly over a two-year period. Even if the defendant did tell him that Crossbridge was merely a subcontractor, I reject the plaintiff’s evidence that he simply took the defendant’s word at face value and authorised Hocen’s payments to Crossbridge on that basis. As I explain below at [119], the plaintiff’s own evidence is that he is a careful businessman. More importantly, my finding on the plaintiff’s attempt to conceal his own knowledge is supported by how the plaintiff dealt with the auditor’s letter dated 28 July 2006. On this point, I accept the defendant’s submission that the plaintiff’s actions in relation to that letter point to an unwillingness to be seen as authorising bribes (see [100] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 It is useful at this point to elaborate on the auditor’s letter. The auditor addressed that letter to the defendant and copied to the plaintiff. In it, the auditor sought confirmation that the payments to Crossbridge were for cable installation services commissioned by Hocen and that the services had actually been rendered by Crossbridge.

Further, given the defendant’s practice of keeping the plaintiff informed of contracts that Hocen entered into, it is highly unlikely that the plaintiff would be ignorant of Crossbridge’s true role, or that he would not have asked and been honestly informed of the true nature of the “value-added services” that Crossbridge was performing.

</div> In the event, Cheng was unwilling to help. But the point here is that the plaintiff’s actions show that he must have known about the true nature of the arrangement between Hocen, Crossbridge and ZPMC, and about the substantial profits which this arrangement yielded for Hocen while it lasted. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 For all of these reasons, I find that the plaintiff knew from the outset, even before Hocen was incorporated, that Crossbridge was to be engaged and funded, and was indeed engaged and funded, to procure business for Hocen from ZPMC by corruption.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Pinkerton reports</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 Before leaving this section, I should briefly mention the significance to this case of two reports prepared by a firm of private investigators called Pinkerton (Singapore) Pte Ltd (“Pinkerton”). The plaintiff engaged Pinkerton in August 2007 to carry out checks on Crossbridge and on ZPMC. The plaintiff accepts that portions of Pinkerton’s first report, and the entirety of its second report, are inadmissible hearsay.

</div> In any event, the contents of the two reports are also of little significance. The plaintiff submits that these reports prove that Crossbridge was a company existing only on paper. The plaintiff intended this to support his additional contention that the defendant must have pocketed part of the Payments because Crossbridge had no real existence.

</div>
</div>
</div> As the plaintiff does not need to succeed in this contention in order to succeed in his claim (see [18] above), I need not analyse this contention further. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 What is significant about the Pinkerton reports, however, is this. It might be argued that the plaintiff’s conduct in engaging a private investigator to inquire into Crossbridge and ZPMC suggests that the plaintiff did not know Crossbridge’s role in procuring business for Hocen from ZPMC. I do not accept that argument. The context in which the plaintiff engaged Pinkerton must be borne in mind. By mid-2007, the relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant had seriously deteriorated. The plaintiff’s evidence is that he filed an application to inspect Hocen’s accounting and other records in order to pursue his suspicions about the defendant’s management of Hocen. Instead of cooperating, the defendant deflected the plaintiff’s application by applying to wind up Hocen. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 I reject the plaintiff’s evidence entirely. For the reasons I have given above, I accept the defendant’s evidence that he always kept the plaintiff truthfully informed about Hocen’s dealings with Crossbridge. The plaintiff, on the other hand, was always careful to distance himself from the corrupt scheme. Commissioning the Pinkerton reports is equally consistent with the view that, after the plaintiff fell out with the defendant, and when the plaintiff realised that he could not continue to earn profits through Hocen’s business with ZPMC, the plaintiff engaged Pinkerton to gather dirt on the defendant for the plaintiff to use in his intended vendetta against the defendant: see [33] above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 The Pinkerton reports do not assist the plaintiff’s denial that he was privy at the material time to the corrupt scheme involving Crossbridge. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Breach of duty</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 Having found that the plaintiff was complicit in the defendant’s corrupt scheme, I find also that plaintiff’s conduct breached his duties to Hocen. Applying the principles stated at [75]–[86] above, I hold firstly that the plaintiff satisfies the subjective aspect of the test for breach of duty because he had actual knowledge that Crossbridge had been engaged and funded to procure business for Hocen from ZPMC by corruption. Next, given that the Payments were part of a corrupt scheme, and given that the plaintiff authorised the Payments with knowledge of the scheme, he like the defendant must be considered objectively to have failed to act <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> in the interests of Hocen.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 Further, I find that the plaintiff’s breach of duty is no less culpable than the defendant’s breach of duty. The fact that the plaintiff was not the one who cashed the cheques or delivered the cash to Crossbridge is no mitigation. The plaintiff and the defendant both agreed, as I have found, to engage and fund Crossbridge to procure business for Hocen from ZPMC by corruption. They simply had different roles in carrying out a single corrupt scheme, which was from start to finish entirely contrary to Hocen’s interest. I therefore see no basis to move beyond an equal apportionment of liability. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 Thus, I find that the plaintiff is obliged to contribute to the defendant’s liability in these suits in the proportion of 50%.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 3: </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Ex </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">turpi causa non oritur actio</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Introduction</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 I have found that both the plaintiff and the defendant are in breach of duty to Hocen because they both participated in a scheme to engage and fund Crossbridge to procure business for Hocen from ZPMC by corruption. That brings me to the defendant’s final alternative defence: the doctrine of <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">turpi causa non oritur actio</span> or, as it is sometimes known, the defence of illegality. Although this doctrine is not a defence in the true sense of the word, it probably does no harm to refer to it as such, so long as it is always recognised that <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">turpi causa</span> is founded on high public policy rather than the parties’ private interests: see <span class="font-italic">ANC Holdings Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Bina Puri Holdings Bhd</span> [2013] 3 SLR 666 (“<span class="font-italic">ANC Holdings</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [78]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 I should point out that the defendant has not pleaded his reliance on the <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">turpi causa</span> doctrine. Instead, he raises it only in his submissions, and even then only in his reply submissions.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> But because <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">turpi causa</span> rests on public policy, a court is required to act in any case to which it applies, if necessary of its own motion:<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">ANC Holdings </span>at [84]; <span class="font-italic">Les </span><span class="font-italic">Laboratoires Servier v Apotex Inc</span> [2014] 3 WLR 1257 (“<span class="font-italic">Les </span><span class="font-italic">Laboratoires</span>”) at [23]. Both parties have also had the opportunity to make oral submissions on <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">turpi causa</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 It is well-established that the <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">turpi causa</span> doctrine is not confined to criminal wrongdoing but extends even to non-criminal conduct which carries the necessary degree of turpitude: see <span class="font-italic">ANC Holdings </span>at [82] and <span class="font-italic">Les </span><span class="font-italic">Laboratoires </span>at [25]. I use “turpitude” as a term of art encompassing all conduct, criminal or otherwise, which is capable of invoking the <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">turpi causa</span> doctrine.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 The classic statement of the <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">turpi causa</span> doctrine is that “No court will lend its aid to a man who founds his cause of action on an immoral or an illegal act” <span class="font-italic">per</span> Lord Mansfield in <span class="font-italic">Holman v Johnson</span> (1775) 1 Cowp 341 at 343. Put that way, there are three elements which must be present in order for the doctrine to arise. They correspond to each of the Latin words “<span class="font-italic">ex</span>”, “<span class="font-italic">turpi</span>” and “<span class="font-italic">causa</span>”, though not in that sequence. The three elements are: (a) there must be turpitude; (b) the claimant must found his cause of action on that turpitude; and (c) the turpitude must be the claimant’s own turpitude. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 On the last element, I consider that the person whose turpitude I must examine is Hocen, not the plaintiff. That is because the cause of action which the plaintiff asserts in these suits is a cause of action vested in Hocen, and which the plaintiff has acquired only by assignment. The policy underlying the <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">turpi causa</span> doctrine is to prevent an inconsistency in the law by holding a plaintiff to be entitled to relief in one context while holding that the conduct underlying that entitlement is illegal in another context: <span class="font-italic">ANC Holdings</span> at [80]. That underlying policy requires consistency to be tested as between the counterparties to the substantive cause of action and not as between the procedural parties to litigation which arises out of that cause of action. Otherwise, the purpose of the doctrine could be easily evaded by the artifice of assignment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 It is not seriously disputed that the first of the three elements I have set out at [131] above is established in this case. Engaging and funding an intermediary to procure business from a commercial counterparty by corruption is undoubtedly turpitude. Arriving at that conclusion does not require me to consider or make any findings on the niceties of the criminal law on corruption, whether in Singapore or in China. That is because, as I have pointed out, the concept of turpitude is not confined to criminal conduct. A corrupt scheme of this nature is undoubtedly turpitude within the meaning of the <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">turpi causa</span> doctrine.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 So too, the second element is established in this case. The corrupt scheme is in substance an essential ingredient of Hocen’s cause of action against the defendant. That cause of action asserts that the defendant’s conduct in causing Hocen to make the Payments is a breach of duty because Hocen derived no corporate benefit from the Payments. The turpitude is an essential ingredient of the cause of action because it is the turpitude which negates the undoubted economic benefit which Hocen derived from the Payments and renders that economic benefit incapable of being a corporate benefit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 Only the third of the three elements therefore arises in this case. That requires me to determine whether the turpitude in this case is Hocen’s <span class="font-italic">own</span> turpitude. The fundamental question is one of attribution: is the defendant’s turpitude attributable to Hocen such that the turpitude is Hocen’s own?</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Is the turpitude Hocen’s own?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 In my view, the defendant’s turpitude is not attributable to Hocen. The principle is that a company who makes a claim against a director arising from the director’s breach of duty is treated in law as being a victim of that breach of duty. In those circumstances, the law will not allow the director to attribute any turpitude involved in his breach of duty to the company in order to invoke the <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">turpi causa</span> doctrine and defeat the company’s claim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 This principle is part of the general approach to attributing a director’s conduct – whether involving turpitude or otherwise – to a company. The general approach is to treat the applicable rule of attribution as being dependent on the purpose and context in which the question of attribution arises. It is thus entirely possible, and indeed entirely just, for the same act of a director to be attributable to the company for one purpose or in one context and not to be attributable to the company for other purposes or in other contexts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 I will now elaborate on the position, beginning with the applicable principles.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Applicable principles </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 The principles by which the acts of a natural person will be attributed to a company are well-settled. They are derived from Lord Hoffmann’s analysis in the decision of the Privy Council in <span class="font-italic">Meridian Global Funds Management Asia Ltd v Securities Commission </span>[1995] 2 AC 500 (“<span class="font-italic">Meridian</span>”). Lord Hoffmann grouped the rules of attribution into three sets. The first set comprises the primary rules of attribution which are found in the company’s constitution or implied by company law which deem certain acts by certain natural persons to be the acts of the company (at 506D). The second set comprises the general rules of attribution by which a natural person may have the acts of another attributed to him, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the principles of agency; and by which a natural person may be held liable for the acts of another, such as estoppel, ostensible authority and vicarious liability (at 506F). The third and final set comprises special rules of attribution which the court must fashion in exceptional cases where applying the first or second set of principles would defeat the policy underlying a particular provision of the substantive law as it was intended to apply to a company (at 507D–F). Lord Hoffmann’s analysis was endorsed by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Ho</span><span class="font-italic"> Kang Peng</span> ([78] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [47]–[48].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 In my view, what is critical in the present case is the purpose for which these rules of attribution exist. It is important to distinguish between two kinds of purposes. I shall call them the functional purpose and the substantive purpose. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 The functional purpose of the rules of attribution, as the name suggests, describes the function of those rules. In the Court of Appeal’s words in <span class="font-italic">Ho</span><span class="font-italic"> Kang Peng</span> at [47], “[a]ttribution rules…serve to determine when and which natural person’s acts and thoughts are to be treated as the company’s own”. In <span class="font-italic">Meridian</span> (at 506C), Lord Hoffmann provided the conceptual basis for these rules: they are a necessary part of corporate personality. A company exists, as Lord Hoffmann said, only because there is a rule (usually in a statute) which deems the company to exist as a juridical person and to have certain of the powers, rights and duties of a natural person. But there is little sense in deeming a juridical person to exist unless there are also rules to determine which acts of the natural persons associated with it are to be treated in law as its own acts: <span class="font-italic">Meridian </span>at 506B-C. The important point, however, is that the functional purpose of the rules of attribution does not explain the reason for invoking a particular rule of attribution in a particular case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 It is the substantive purpose of the rules of attribution which supply that reason. The special rules of attribution in Lord Hoffmann’s third set (see [140] above) are a clear example of this concept. One such rule was crystallised and applied as a distinct rule of attribution in <span class="font-italic">Meridian. </span>In that case, two senior employees of Meridian Global Fund Management Asia Ltd (“Meridian”) caused Meridian to acquire shares in a listed company in New Zealand, Euro-National Corporation Ltd (“ENC”). Both employees knew that the acquisition was sufficiently large to require Meridian, under New Zealand’s securities legislation, to give immediate notice both to ENC and the New Zealand stock exchange that Meridian had become a substantial shareholder of ENC. But Meridian failed to give the required notice. In acquiring the shares, the two employees acted with the company’s authority but without the knowledge of its board of directors and of its managing director. Meridian’s directors therefore did not know that Meridian had become a substantial shareholder of ENC. Lord Hoffmann had no hesitation in holding that the underlying policy of New Zealand’s securities legislation required the employees’ knowledge that Meridian was a substantial shareholder of ENC to be attributed to Meridian without any need to consider whether either of the two employees was the directing mind and will of Meridian. The intent of the notice requirement was to compel a person who had become a substantial shareholder of a public company to give immediate notice of that fact, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, as soon as he knew of it. In order to avoid defeating the policy of the legislation, and given its intent as it applied to companies, it was appropriate to attribute to Meridian the knowledge of the natural person who had caused Meridian to acquire the relevant shares: <span class="font-italic">Meridian </span>at 511D. Lord Hoffmann concluded by surveying other English cases which had applied what might appear to be inconsistent rules of attribution on superficially similar facts and said at 512B: “Each [special rule of attribution] is an example of an attribution rule for a particular purpose, tailored as it always must be to the terms and policies of the substantive rule.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 Of course, not every case in which a question of attribution arises requires the court to tailor a rule of attribution to support the underlying policy of a substantive rule of law as it was intended to apply to companies. But the court must, in every case, have regard to the reason for which a particular rule of attribution is being invoked. That is why, narrowing the focus to directors for the time being, the law distinguishes between cases in which a director’s knowledge or acts are sought to be attributed to the company: (a) when a third party seeks to hold a company liable for breach of a duty owed to the third party; and (b) when a company seeks redress from a director for breach of duty owed to the company.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 This distinction is a valid one in both a moral and a legal sense. It is entirely just that a company should be bound by the knowledge or acts of its directors when an innocent third party sues the company for a breach of duty, even if the director’s knowledge or acts may, in other contexts, not be attributed to the company. By the same token, it is equally just that a company should not be bound by the knowledge or acts of a director when the company itself sues the director as the victim of his breach of duty, even if the director’s knowledge or acts may, in other contexts, be attributed to the company. These two propositions, and the underlying distinction between the two types of cases, was articulated by the English Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Bilta</span><span class="font-italic"> (UK) Ltd (liquidation) v Nazir (No 2)</span> [2014] Ch 52 (“<span class="font-italic">Bilta</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span>”) at [34]–[35] and approved by the Singapore Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Ho</span><span class="font-italic"> Kang Peng</span> at [70].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 To the second proposition above, <span class="font-italic">Ho</span><span class="font-italic"> Kang Peng</span> suggests an exception. The court said at [70]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [T]he [director] was not acting in the interests of the Company when he entered into the [sham] Agreement and effected the Payments. This is not a one-shareholder company but a publicly-listed company. The Appellant could have protected himself by having the proposed arrangement approved by the Board. Alternatively, he could have sought ratification from the general body of the Company. The Appellant did none of that.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The suggested exception appears to be in two parts. First, it suggests that, if a company is a one-man company, any act by the sole director-shareholder which is a breach of duty will be attributed to the company without the need for further formality, even if the act amounts to turpitude. Second, it suggests that even if the company is not a one-man company, any act by a director which is a breach of duty will be attributed to the company if the act is approved formally by the board or ratified formally by the shareholders, even if the act amounts to turpitude.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 I should point out that the existence and scope of this suggested exception was not part of the <span class="font-italic">ratio</span> of <span class="font-italic">Ho</span><span class="font-italic"> Kang Peng</span>. The company in that case was not a one-man company and the director in that case had no board approval or shareholder ratification whatsoever for carrying on with the corrupt scheme. The exception, however, is pertinent in the present case. The plaintiff and the defendant, as I have found, acted in concert in engaging and funding Crossbridge to procure business for Hocen from ZPMC by corruption. That makes Hocen for present purposes conceptually indistinguishable from a one-man company. If the suggestion at [70] of <span class="font-italic">Ho</span><span class="font-italic"> Kang Peng</span> is correct, the directors’ corrupt scheme is attributable to Hocen despite the turpitude involved and even in a claim by Hocen against the directors for breach of duty arising from that turpitude.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 Yet, as plaintiff’s counsel accepted during oral submissions, it is not clear even from <span class="font-italic">Ho</span><span class="font-italic"> Kang Peng</span> that<span class="font-italic"> </span>all types of breach of duty by a director can be approved by a company’s board or ratified by its shareholders. Even if they can be, the limits of the effect of such approval or ratification are not clear when it is the company who is suing the directors for breach of duty. If the effect were unlimited, there would be no substantive protection for shareholders against rogue directors and no substantive protection for creditors against either rogue shareholders or rogue directors.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 This approach would also mean that, as long as the shareholders and directors of any company act unanimously, the court in the exercise of its limited supervisory jurisdiction cannot hold the directors to the minimum standard of commercial morality even in those limited circumstances where that jurisdiction might, in practical terms, come to be exercised (see [84] above). To deal with this difficulty, it seems appropriate for me to examine a number of cases in which a company proceeded against a director for breach of duty where the director was either formally or informally authorised to commit that breach.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 I begin with the leading case of <span class="font-italic">Belmont Finance Corporation Ltd v Williams Furniture Ltd </span>[1979] 1 Ch 250 (“<span class="font-italic">Belmont</span>”).<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Ho Kang Peng</span> at [71] cites <span class="font-italic">Belmont </span>with approval for the proposition that “where a company makes a claim against a director premised on the latter’s breach of duty, the company is a victim, and the law will not allow the enforcement of that duty to be compromised by the director’s reliance on his own wrongdoing”. I shall refer to this as the <span class="font-italic">Belmont </span>principle. This principle is a generalisation of an older principle, known as the <span class="font-italic">Hampshire Land</span> principle after the leading case of <span class="font-italic">In re Hampshire Land Co</span> (1896) 2 Ch 743 at 749.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 In <span class="font-italic">Belmont</span>, the directors of Belmont Finance participated in a scheme to extract value from the company by making it buy shares at a highly inflated price. The directors concluded that transaction with board approval. The company then went into receivership. The receivers brought an action in the name of the company against the directors for breach of duty in causing the company to buy the shares. The English Court of Appeal held that the directors could not rely on the <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">turpi causa</span> doctrine against the company because their knowledge of the true nature of the transaction was not to be attributed to the company. Buckley LJ (with whom Orr and Goff LJJ agreed) held at 261-262:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">But in my view, such knowledge should not be imputed to the company, for the essence of the arrangement was to deprive the company improperly of a large part of its assets. As I have said, the company was a victim of the conspiracy.

The defendants were charged with theft from solvent companies which they wholly owned and controlled. The issue was whether, for the purposes of s 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the English Theft Act 1968, the defendants had appropriated the property of another “in the belief that [they] would have the other’s consent if the other knew of the appropriation and the circumstances of it”. The English Court of Appeal acknowledged the rule of attribution which attributes to a solvent company the unanimous decision of all of its shareholders (at 640). But the court did not consider this principle to be applicable. It also rejected the argument that the companies, having no will other than that of their directors, must be taken to have consented to whatever the directors did. One of the court’s reasons for rejecting this argument was the <span class="font-italic">Belmont </span>principle. Kerr LJ, who delivered the leading judgment, cited the passage from Buckley LJ’s judgment (which I have reproduced at [151] above) and said that “[s]o far as the authorities in the realm of the civil law are concerned, [<span class="font-italic">Belmont</span>] directly contradicts the basis of the defendants’ argument in the present case”. He held, further, that there was no reason why the position in criminal law should be any different (at 641).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 The next case is <span class="font-italic">Pertamina</span><span class="font-italic"> v Thahir Kartika Ratna and others</span> [1981–1982] SLR(R) 653 (“<span class="font-italic">Pertamina</span>”). This is the first reported local decision to apply the <span class="font-italic">Belmont </span>principle. <span class="font-italic">Pertamina</span> was a dispute over the beneficial interest in money held in Singapore banks by a deceased Indonesian national, Thahir. His employer, Pertamina, claimed that it was entitled to the money because it represented the proceeds of bribes which Thahir had received in breach of duty to Pertamina. His wife applied to strike out Pertamina’s claim, arguing that Pertamina’s claim was obviously unsustainable because a number of named employees of Pertamina knew and consented to Thahir receiving the bribes. Sinnathuray J rejected the wife’s argument as being itself obviously unsustainable on the basis of the passage from Buckley LJ’s judgment in <span class="font-italic">Belmont</span> (see [151] above) It is implicit in Sinnathuray J’s reasoning that he considered that the consequence of applying the <span class="font-italic">Belmont </span>principle was that even if Pertamina’s other employees did have knowledge of Thahir’s breach of duty, their knowledge was not attributable to Pertamina itself in its claim against Thahir for breach of duty.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 The <span class="font-italic">Belmont</span> principle is now a well-established rule of attribution in English and Singapore company law.

In <span class="font-italic">Stone &amp; Rolls</span>, an insolvent one-man company, acting by its liquidators, brought an action against its auditors for breach of duty for failing to detect and terminate the fraud which the company’s sole director-shareholder, Stojevic, had perpetrated on its bankers using the company as his vehicle.

Those principles did so because: (a) the auditors owed a duty of care only to the company and its members and not to its creditors; (b) all those to whom the auditors owed their duty of care were complicit in the company’s fraud; and (c) the company’s liquidators were now pursuing the claim for the ultimate benefit of the creditors, parties to whom the company’s auditors owed no duty of care in tort: <span class="font-italic">Stone &amp; Rolls</span> at [83]–[86].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 The minority in the House of Lords comprised Lords Scott and Mance. They rejected the one-man company limit on the <span class="font-italic">Belmont</span> principle. They held instead that the <span class="font-italic">Belmont</span> principle operated even in the case of a one-man company, if only to protect the company’s creditors. I quote from Lord Mance’s speech at [229]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Neither in <span class="font-italic">Belmont Finance</span> nor in <span class="font-italic">Attorney General’s Reference</span><span class="font-italic"> (No 2 of 1982)</span> is there any suggestion that the application of the principle in <span class="font-italic">Hampshire Land</span> depends upon there being some innocent constituency within the company to whom knowledge could have been communicated. Moreover, <span class="font-italic">Attorney General’s Reference (No 2 of 1982)</span> is direct authority to the contrary. The two defendants were charged with theft, consisting of the abstraction of the assets of companies, of which they were “the sole shareholders and directors” and “the sole will and directing mind” (pp.635D-F and 638F-G). They contended that the companies were bound by and had consented to the abstractions precisely because they were its sole shareholders, directors and directing mind and will (pp. 634E-F and 638F-H). The Court of Appeal acknowledged the rule of attribution attributing to a solvent company the unanimous decision of all its shareholders (p.640A-D), but roundly rejected its application to circumstances where the sole shareholders, directors and directing minds were acting illegally or dishonestly in relation to the company. The court cited <span class="font-italic">Belmont Finance</span> as “directly contradict[ing] the basis of the defendants’ argument” (p. 641B-C). The defendants’ acts and knowledge were thus not to be attributed to the companies – although there was no other innocent constituency within the companies. Another justification for this conclusion may be that the effect of the limitations recognised by Lord Hoffmann in <span class="font-italic">Meridian</span> … is that in such situations there is another innocent constituency with interests in [Stone &amp; Rolls], since it is not open even to a directing mind owning all a company’s shares to run riot with the company’s assets and affairs in a way which renders or would render a company insolvent to the detriment of its creditors.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">159 <span class="font-italic">Stone &amp; Rolls </span>was not a claim by a company against its director arising from the director’s breach of duty. Instead, it was a claim by a company against a third party arising from the third party’s breach of duty to the company. In this context, Lords Phillips and Walker expressed the view that the <span class="font-italic">Belmont</span> principle applies only when the company is a “primary victim” of the director’s wrongdoing (in the sense that the director’s acts result directly in the company’s loss) and not a “secondary victim” (where the company’s loss arises only in consequence of the company having to compensate the primary victim for its loss): <span class="font-italic">Stone &amp; Rolls</span> at [5] and [55] <span class="font-italic">per</span> Lord Phillips and at [171]–[174] <span class="font-italic">per</span> Lord Walker. On this analysis, the company in <span class="font-italic">Stone &amp; Rolls</span> was merely a secondary victim, because Stojevic targeted the company’s fraud at the company’s banks and not at the company itself. This distinction, if valid, would mean that Stojevic’s knowledge would have been equally attributable to the company, despite the <span class="font-italic">Belmont</span> principle, if the company had been suing Stojevic for breach of duty in <span class="font-italic">Stone &amp; Rolls</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">160 In their discussion of <span class="font-italic">Stone &amp; Rolls</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the learned authors of <span class="font-italic">Corporate Law</span> ([75] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>give short shrift to the distinction between primary and secondary victims for the purpose of deciding when the <span class="font-italic">Belmont </span>principle applies.

What is relevant to the present case is that their Lordships considered that the <span class="font-italic">Belmont</span> principle applied even to a one-man company, as long as it was invoked in the context of a company seeking redress against a director for breach of duty. On this analysis, and contrary to the implication of Lords Philips’ and Walker’s view (at [159] above), the <span class="font-italic">Belmont</span> principle would have applied to prevent the knowledge of Stojevic<span class="font-italic"> </span>from being attributed to the company were the company to sue Stojevic for breach of duty. I quote from Lord Scott’s speech at [109] (but see also Lord Mance’s view at [229] quoted at [157] above):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is noteworthy that there appears to be no case in which the ‘sole actor’ exception to the <span class="font-italic">Hampshire Land</span> rule has been applied so as to bar an action brought by a company against an officer for breaches of duty that have caused, or contributed to, loss to the company as a result of the company engaging in illegal activities. I can easily accept that, for the purposes of an action against the company by an innocent third party, with no notice of any illegality or impropriety by the company in the conduct of its affairs, the state of mind of a ‘sole actor’ could and should be attributed to the company if it were relevant to the cause of action asserted against the company to do so. But it does not follow that attribution should take place where the action is being brought by the company against an officer or manager who has been in breach of duty to the company. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">162 In <span class="font-italic">Lim Leong Huat v Chip </span><span class="font-italic">Hup Kee Construction Pte Ltd</span> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 318, the plaintiff sought to add the defendant company’s managing director as an additional defendant to the plaintiff’s action alleging that the company and the director had conspired unlawfully to cause the plaintiff loss. The managing director was allegedly the controlling mind of the company.

The company in <span class="font-italic">Bilta</span> was in liquidation. Its liquidators commenced an action in the name of the company against its two directors, one of whom was its sole shareholder, arguing that they had unlawfully conspired with other parties to cause it loss. The directors allegedly did so by involving the company in a carousel VAT fraud, which left the company with a liability to account to the tax authorities for output VAT in excess of £38m but with no assets with which to discharge that liability. The directors applied to strike out the company’s claim. One of their arguments was premised on the <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">turpi causa</span> doctrine: the directors contended that their own knowledge of the fraud was to be attributed to the company. The English Court of Appeal rejected this argument and held that the judge at first instance had been right in refusing to strike out the claim.

Where a company has been the victim of wrong-doing by its directors, or of which its directors had notice, then the wrong-doing, or knowledge, of the directors cannot be attributed to the company as a defence to a claim brought against the directors by the company’s liquidator, in the name of the company and/or on behalf of its creditors, for the loss suffered by the company as a result of the wrong-doing, even where the directors were the only directors and shareholders of the company, and even though the wrong-doing or knowledge of the directors may be attributed to the company in many other types of proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">165 This proposition is a clear statement that the <span class="font-italic">Belmont </span>principle applies even to one-man companies, albeit when the company is in liquidation. Their Lordships in <span class="font-italic">Bilta</span><span class="font-italic"> (SC)</span> offered two possible ways of characterising this proposition. According to Lord Mance (with whom Lords Neuberger, Clark, Carnwath, Toulson and Hodge agreed on this point: <span class="font-italic">Bilta</span><span class="font-italic"> (SC)</span> at [9] and [191]), the question of attribution is always an open one. Whether or not it is appropriate to attribute a director’s act, knowledge or state of mind to a company in a given claim must depend on the nature and factual context of the claim in question: <span class="font-italic">Bilta</span><span class="font-italic"> (SC)</span> at [37]–[44]. As Lord Neuberger put it (at [9]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [I]t seems to me that [the <span class="font-italic">Belmont</span> principle] is not so much an exception to a general rule as part of a general rule. There are judicial observations which tend to support the notion that it is, as Lord Sumption JSC says …, an exception to the agency-based rules of attribution, which is based on public policy or common sense, rationality and justice. … However, I agree with Lord Mance JSC’s analysis … that the question is simply an open one: whether or not it is appropriate to attribute an action by, or a state of mind of, a company director or agent to the company or the agent’s principal in relation to a particular claim against the company or the principal must depend on the nature and factual context of the claim in question.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Lord Mance (at [41]) traces the origin of this view back to Lord Hoffmann in <span class="font-italic">Meridian</span>, who “made clear” that “the key to any question of attribution is ultimately always to be found in considerations of context and purpose”. In a similar vein, I too read <span class="font-italic">Meridian</span> as standing for a broader concept of bearing in mind the substantive purpose for invoking rules of attribution: see [142] above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">166 On the other hand, Lord Sumption took the narrower view that the <span class="font-italic">Belmont </span>principle was better regarded as an exception <span class="font-italic">only</span> to the agency-based rules of attribution, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, only to the rules of attribution in the second set of Lord Hoffmann’s rules of attribution: see [140] above. That is why Lord Sumption refers to it as the breach of duty “exception”: <span class="font-italic">Bilta</span><span class="font-italic"> (SC)</span> at [71]. The basis of the exception is public policy, or as Lord Neuberger paraphrased it, “common sense, rationality and justice”: <span class="font-italic">Bilta</span><span class="font-italic"> (SC)</span> at [9]. The policy in question can be readily discerned: to allow a director to rely on his own turpitude in resisting a claim by the company in respect of a breach of duty involving that turpitude would undermine the very reason and utility of that duty. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">167 Inherent in Lord Sumption’s characterisation of the <span class="font-italic">Belmont</span> principle as an “exception” only to “agency-based rules” of attribution is a desire to keep the principle within definable bounds for the sake of certainty in articulation and clarity in analysis. These values are undoubtedly desirable. Nevertheless, I prefer the view taken by Lord Mance and the rest of their Lordships. In my view, Lord Sumption’s view of the <span class="font-italic">Belmont</span> principle as an exception is too narrow, insofar as that view confines the principle’s operation only to the second set of Lord Hoffmann’s attribution rules: see [140] above. In each of the cases I have discussed which involve one-man companies, the turpitude of the director could have been attributed to the company under the first set of Lord Hoffmann’s attribution rules as well, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the primary, corporate, rules of attribution. Thus, in <span class="font-italic">Belmont </span>itself, the director’s wrongdoing had been performed under board approval. In <span class="font-italic">A-G’s Ref (No 2 of 1982)</span>, the two directors, as the companies’ only two shareholders, may be regarded as having informally approved their own scheme to misappropriate the company’s funds. This being the case, it is conceptually more accurate for the <span class="font-italic">Belmont</span> principle to be described as part of the approach which takes the question of attribution to be an open one that is always rooted in the context and purpose of the claim in which that question arises.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">168 At a fundamental level, however, it seems to me important to appreciate that Lord Sumption’s view shares the same normative roots as Lord Mance’s, namely, Lord Hoffmann’s idea in <span class="font-italic">Meridian </span>that the purpose for which attribution is relevant is all-important. Thus Lord Sumption observes that the concept of a breach of duty “exception” is a “valuable tool of analysis, but it is no more than that”. His Lordship then goes on to say at [92]–[93] of <span class="font-italic">Bilta</span><span class="font-italic"> (SC)</span>:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Another way of putting the same point is to treat it as illustrating the broader point made by Lord Hoffmann in <span class="font-italic">Meridian </span><span class="font-italic">…</span> that the attribution of legal responsibility for the act of an agent depends on the purpose for which attribution is relevant. Where the purpose of attribution is to apportion responsibility between a company and its agents so as to determine their rights and liabilities to each other, the result will not necessarily be the same as it is in a case where the purpose is to apportion responsibility between the company and a third party.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">This makes it unnecessary to address the elusive distinction between primary and secondary victimhood. That distinction could arise only if the application of the breach of duty exception depended on where the loss ultimately fell, or possibly on where the culpable directors intended it to fall. If, however, the application of the breach of duty exception depends on the nature of the duty and the parties as between whom the question arises, the only question is whether the company has suffered any loss at all.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">169 Having reviewed these authorities, I have no hesitation in agreeing with Lord Neuberger’s statement of the rule in <span class="font-italic">Bilta</span><span class="font-italic"> (SC)</span> at [7] (see [164] above). I return to the distinction between the functional purpose and the substantive purpose of the rules of attribution which I drew at the beginning of this discussion: see [141]–[143] above. The authorities make it clear that as between the two, the substantive purpose is the logically anterior. One must first consider the nature of the claim which is brought, and the nature of the rights and liabilities to be determined, before deciding the applicable rule of attribution. Where a company claims that those who wholly own and control the company are in breach of duty to the company, the turpitude of the defendants will not be attributed to the company such that the company’s claim is defeated by the <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">turpi causa</span> doctrine. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">170 Of course, the elephant in the room remains: what about the theoretical objection that in the case of a one-man company, there is a complete identity of interests between the director-shareholders and the company? As I have mentioned at [83] above, there is no distinction in fact between ownership and control in such a company and therefore no real principal-agent problem. Can it sensibly be said that the acts and knowledge of its sole director-shareholder will not be attributed to the company if the company were to sue the director for breach of duty?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">171 It may be tempting to corral the elephant by suggesting that the answer lies in the traditional anthropomorphic view of the company as an independent person, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, by holding that there <span class="font-italic">always</span> exists a company “as such”, separate from its members, to be protected. But the modern law has moved away from that idea. Lord Hoffmann famously stated in <span class="font-italic">Meridian </span>at 507A that “[t]here is in fact no such thing as the company as such, no <span class="font-italic">ding </span><span class="font-italic">an sich</span>, only the applicable rules.” The result, in Lord Hoffmann’s view, is that “[t]o say that a company cannot do something means only that there is no one whose doing of that act would, under the applicable rules of attribution, count as an act of the company” (at 507A). The transparency and boldness of this statement will not be lost on the careful reader: it is an assertion of the brutal fact that one must simply look to the rules which the courts have fashioned to decide what counts as the act of a company. Consequently, the only question is whether those rules are sound. This may be theoretically problematic, but at least the source of the problem is clear. Lord Sumption describes it in the following terms in <span class="font-italic">Bilta</span><span class="font-italic"> (SC)</span> at [66]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A natural person and his agent are autonomous in fact as well as in law. A company is autonomous in law but not in fact. Its decisions are determined by its human agents, who may use that power for unlawful purposes. This gives rise to problems which do not arise in the case of principals who are natural persons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">172 Therefore, is the <span class="font-italic">Belmont </span>principle, as refined by the UK Supreme Court in <span class="font-italic">Bilta</span><span class="font-italic"> (SC)</span>, a sound principle? In my view, it is. It effectively addresses a specific problem arising from abuse of directors’ powers, that is, it prevents an errant director from relying on his own turpitude to avoid being held accountable for his acts or knowledge. It also draws a valid distinction between cases in which a company seeks redress against the director and cases in which a third party seeks to hold the company liable. And it enables external administrators of a company (whether liquidators or receivers) to hold the company’s directors to a minimum standard of commercial morality, which is in the public interest. That is as much the case for a solvent company as it is for an insolvent company. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">173 Having considered the applicable law, I turn now to apply it to the facts. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Analysis and decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">174 My findings of fact necessarily entail that both shareholders of Hocen knew that the directors of Hocen engaged and funded Crossbridge to procure business for Hocen from ZPMC by corruption and approved the directors’ conduct, albeit informally. That result follows from the nature of Hocen, because its shareholders <span class="font-italic">are</span> its directors. As the plaintiff and the defendant were acting in concert in this corrupt scheme, Hocen was effectively a one-man company, like the companies in <span class="font-italic">A-G’s Ref (No 2 of 1982) </span>([152] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), <span class="font-italic">Stone &amp; Rolls</span> ([155] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) and <span class="font-italic">Bilta</span><span class="font-italic"> (SC)</span> ([163] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">175 Yet, as I have shown from the cases, the <span class="font-italic">Belmont</span> principle applies even to companies like Hocen. By that principle, the plaintiff’s and the defendant’s corrupt scheme cannot be attributed to Hocen in a claim by Hocen against them for breach of duty in involving Hocen in that scheme. That is because Hocen is seeking redress against its directors for wrongs they have committed against Hocen. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">176 On one view, however, it could be argued that unlike the companies in <span class="font-italic">Belmont</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([150] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), <span class="font-italic">A-G’s Ref (No 2 of 1982)</span> ([152] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) and <span class="font-italic">Bilta</span><span class="font-italic"> (SC) </span>([162] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), Hocen did not actually suffer “loss”. Quite the contrary: the bribes which the parties caused Hocen to pay yielded substantial profits for  HocenHocen (see [89] above). I do not accept that as a valid distinction. I have held on the authority of <span class="font-italic">Ho</span><span class="font-italic"> Kang Peng </span>that the profits which Hocen earned through corruption (and the opportunity to earn those profits by those means) cannot be regarded as a corporate benefit which the defendant acquired for Hocen: see [94] above. Accordingly, there remains a breach of duty sufficient to invoke the <span class="font-italic">Belmont </span>principle against the defendant. The result is that Hocen, and therefore the plaintiff (to whom Hocen assigned its cause of action), is not barred from proceeding against the defendant just because Hocen’s director-shareholders informally assented to this corrupt scheme. To be clear, I say nothing about a case in which the company cannot in any sense be regarded as having suffered loss or detriment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">177 It follows that the defendant cannot rely on the <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">turpi causa</span> doctrine to defeat the claim in this case. These suits cannot be regarded as resting on Hocen’s own wrong because the <span class="font-italic">Belmont </span>principle prevents the defendant from attributing his turpitude to Hocen. For the same reasons, the plaintiff’s turpitude is not attributable to Hocen either.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Two points by way of postscript</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The </span>Duomatic<span class="font-italic"> principle</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">178 Before concluding, I turn to deal with two cases whose reasoning appears to be inconsistent with the analysis I have adopted. Essentially, the inconsistency arises because those cases appear to take the view that a company may be precluded from bringing a claim against its director for breach of duty if the breach was approved by the board or by the shareholders. The first of these cases is <span class="font-italic">Ho</span><span class="font-italic"> Kang Peng</span>. As I mentioned at [146] above, the Court of Appeal suggested that the director in that case would have “protected himself” from a future claim by the company if he had obtained board approval before signing the impugned agreements. However, this was <span class="font-italic">obiter</span><span class="font-italic"> dicta</span> as no board approval was in fact obtained in that case. So I need say no more about it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">179 The second case is <span class="font-italic">Yong </span><span class="font-italic">Kheng Leong</span> <span class="font-italic">and another v </span><span class="font-italic">Panweld Trading Pte Ltd and another </span>[2013] 1 SLR 173 (“<span class="font-italic">Yong </span><span class="font-italic">Kheng Leong</span>”). In that case, a company sued a director for having caused the company to pay the director’s wife a salary over a period of 17 years when she had done no work for the company to earn that salary. In that case too, the only two shareholders of the company were its only two directors (at [26]). The director argued that the other shareholder could be taken to have impliedly assented to the salary payments such that the company could no longer seek to avoid the payments and recover them from the defendant director (at [25]). It was true that the director had made no attempt to conceal the salary payments from management or the other shareholder. However, on the facts of that case, the Court of Appeal held that the other shareholder’s conduct amounted, at most, to some degree of forbearance rather than to implied assent (at [26]). In order for the company to be bound such that it could no longer recover the salary from the director, there must be a sufficient basis for the court to infer that: (a) there was an agreement between the shareholders with regard to the impugned act; and (b) what the key contents of that agreement were (at [25]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">180 It does not appear that the <span class="font-italic">Belmont</span> principle or any of the cases in that line of authority were cited to the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Yong </span><span class="font-italic">Kheng Leong</span>. The court’s in-principle acceptance of the argument from implied assent must be considered in that light. To be specific, counsel for the director in that case, Dr Tang Hang Wu, presented the implied assent argument in reliance on “the principle [in <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Duomatic Ltd </span>[1969] 2 Ch 365] … where all the shareholders, particularly in a closed private company with a track record of informality in their deals, assent to a particular course of dealing, even in relation to the disposal of assets, this may be effective to bind the parties” (at [25]). This is a well-established principle which falls under the primary rules of attribution, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the first set of the rules of attribution which Lord Hoffmann identified in <span class="font-italic">Meridian Global</span>: see <span class="font-italic">Bilta</span><span class="font-italic"> (SC)</span> at [187]. It was also a principle which the court in <span class="font-italic">A-G’s Ref (No 2 of 1982)</span> decided specifically to override on the authority of <span class="font-italic">Belmont</span>: see [152] above. In other words, the <span class="font-italic">Belmont </span>principle does not deny or contradict the <span class="font-italic">Duomatic</span> principle. Instead, to borrow Lord Sumption’s analytical language, it constitutes an “exception” to it, just as it is, on his view, an exception to the agency-based rules of attribution which would ordinarily apply: see [167] above. As Lord Neuberger said in <span class="font-italic">Bilta</span><span class="font-italic"> (SC)</span> at [7], the <span class="font-italic">Belmont</span> principle applies “even though the wrong-doing or knowledge of the directors may be attributed to the company in many other types of proceedings”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">181 Hence, it is appropriate to read <span class="font-italic">Yong </span><span class="font-italic">Kheng Leong</span> as saying that the company could have met Dr Tang’s argument with the <span class="font-italic">Belmont </span>principle. The company could have argued that even if the other shareholder had impliedly assented to the payments, the <span class="font-italic">Belmont</span> principle would operate to preclude the director from attributing that shareholders’ assent to the company. This argument, of course, was not raised in <span class="font-italic">Yong </span><span class="font-italic">Kheng Leong</span>. There was also no need for the court to consider this argument because, on the facts, the court found that there was in fact no implied assent. Accordingly, there is no real inconsistency between my analysis and the decision in <span class="font-italic">Yong </span><span class="font-italic">Kheng Leong</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Unclean hands</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">182 I have thus far focused on the position of Hocen. That is because at the centre of the <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">turpi causa</span> analysis is the issue of whether the defendant’s turpitude can be attributed to Hocen (see [133] above). It is convenient at this juncture to consider the plaintiff’s position and to deal with a point unrelated to attribution. It could be said that the plaintiff has brought these suits with unclean hands and that that is a sufficient reason not to hold the defendant liable in equity. That point can be disposed of quickly for two reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">183 The first reason is that, although the plaintiff is, on my finding, in breach of duty to Hocen, the plaintiff does not assert in these suits a personal cause of action vested in him. He asserts in these suits a corporate cause of action initially vested in Hocen and which the liquidators have assigned to him. Hocen, as a company, does not have unclean hands because the acts of its directors cannot be attributed to it (for the reasons set out at [174]–[177] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">184 The second reason is that, even if the allegation of unclean hands is available as against the plaintiff, I have found the defendant to have breached not only his fiduciary duties but also his statutory and common law duties. The defence of unclean hands may defeat a claim in equity but cannot defeat a statutory or a common law claim.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Judgment</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">185 In light of my findings in each of the two suits, I have entered judgment: (a) requiring the defendant to pay the plaintiff the full sum which the plaintiff claims in that suit; and (b) requiring the plaintiff upon receiving that sum from the defendant, to pay the defendant back half of that sum. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">186 As for costs, the claim and the counterclaim have succeeded in each suit. Therefore, the event in both suits goes in both directions. Further, the issues raised by the counterclaim – about the plaintiff’s own knowledge and culpability for the Payments – were relevant not only to the counterclaim but also to the claim, going to an aspect of the defendant’s defence. Because the facts and the law on the claim and the counterclaim were indistinguishably bound up with each other, and because the events in both suits negate each other, I have exercised my discretion to make no order as to costs on both the claim and the counterclaim in both suits. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">187 There is another reason for my decision to make no order as to costs. This has been utterly pointless litigation. The plaintiff and the defendant each had and have an equal interest in Hocen. While Hocen was trading, they divided the considerable profits from Hocen’s business with ZPMC between themselves in accordance with Hocen’s corporate constitution and with the Act. The plaintiff and the defendant now have an equal interest in Hocen’s substantial liquidation surplus. If Hocen had not assigned its causes of action to the plaintiff, the result of my findings would be (putting on one side the issue of costs) that each defaulting director would pay 50% of the Payments to the liquidators who would then immediately return the same money to the same individuals as shareholders together with 50% of the liquidation surplus which the liquidators already hold.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">188 The liquidators’ decision to assign Hocen’s cause of action underlying these two suits to the plaintiff has changed nothing. That is because the plaintiff paid nothing for the assignment and, in return, promised under cl 2.4 of the assignment to pay over to the liquidators 50% of any sum which he recovers from the defendant in these suits. Further, by cl 2.4(iv) of the assignment, the plaintiff authorised the liquidators to pay that 50% to the defendant alone. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">189 The plaintiff’s rights and obligations under the assignment are subject only to the following provision on costs: (a) the plaintiff is allowed to retain any sum which the defendant pays to the plaintiff pursuant to a costs order by the court; and (b) the plaintiff is allowed to retain out of the principal sum which he recovers from the defendant in these suits a further sum equivalent to 33% of any costs award. The purpose of this proviso is to allow the plaintiff to recover 133% of any costs award which the court might make at the conclusion of the litigation as an approximation of indemnity costs. I have found that the plaintiff is not entitled even to an award of party and party costs by way of a partial indemnity for the costs which he has incurred in pursuing this litigation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">190 The outcome of this litigation, therefore, is a pointless merry-go-round of money. Under my judgment, the defendant must pay over to the plaintiff 100% of the Payments. Also under my judgment, the plaintiff must immediately pay 50% of what he has just received back to the defendant. Under cl 2.4 of the assignment, the plaintiff must pay the other 50% of what he has just received without deduction (there being no award of costs in the plaintiff’s favour) to the liquidators. Under cl 2.4(iv) of the assignment, the liquidators will then pay over to the defendant the 50% which they have just received from the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">191 The pointlessness of this litigation is another reason I have made no order as to costs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left">Vinodh Coomaraswamy  <br/>Judge<br/></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Lionel Leo, Oh Sheng Loong and Doralyn Chan (WongPartnership LLP) for the substituted plaintiff;<br/>Leo Cheng Suan, Teh Ee-Von and Grismond Tien (Infinitus Law Corporation) for the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-left"></div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
