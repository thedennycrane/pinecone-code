</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font color="#800000"><strong><u>GROUNDS OF DECISION</u></strong></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">          The appellant,

Wong Loke Cheng, was tried and convicted in the district court on nine amended charges of

corruption pursuant to s 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241) (‘the

Act’). The first amended charge read:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">You, Wong Loke Cheng, Male 44/years, NRIC No: S1246390A,

    are charged that you, on or about the 14<sup>th</sup> day of July 2000, at the Basement

    One Foodcourt at Chinatown Point Complex, Singapore, being an agent, namely, an Executive

    Director in the employ of Sea Consortium Pte Ltd, Singapore, did corruptly obtain from one

    Yu Yong Jun, Managing Director of Fortune Glory Pte Ltd, a gratification in the form of a

    sum of US$8,687 (US Dollars Eight Thousand Six Hundred And Eighty Seven), equivalent to

    S$15,067.60 (Singapore Dollars Fifteen Thousand Sixty Seven and Cents Sixty), as a reward

    for having done an act in relation to your principal’s affairs, to wit, having

    recommended to your principal in or about June 2000 the charter of the vessel ‘Da

    Fu’ from Da Lian Marine Shipping Corp, and you have thereby committed an offence

    punishable under Section 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Cap 241.</p>
</font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">The other eight amended charges were the same in all material respects,

save only for the amounts of the gratification obtained and the locations at which the

offences were alleged to have taken place. The total gratification, paid out between July

2000 and May 2001, amounted to US$90,377.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">2        The district judge

sentenced the appellant to pay a penalty of S$157,255.98, which penalty he paid before I

heard this appeal, and to a total of 10 months’ imprisonment for the nine amended

charges. The appellant appealed against both conviction and sentence. I dismissed both

appeals, and now give my reasons. The appeal against sentence was initially withdrawn, but

as counsel made oral submissions on that point before me, I shall address the points he

raised herein.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3        At the same time, the

appellant filed Criminal Motion No. 11 of 2002 seeking to adduce new evidence at the

appeal, which counsel for the appellant then sought leave to withdraw at the hearing

before me. I granted such leave, and the criminal motion was duly withdrawn. </p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The proceedings below</p></b><i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The case for the prosecution</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4        The prosecution’s case

was essentially this: that the appellant, as executive director of Sea Consortium Pte Ltd

(‘Sea Consortium’), had received US$90,377 in bribes from one Yu Yong Jun

(‘Yu’), in return for procuring Sea Consortium’s charter of the vessel Da

Fu from her owner, Da Lian Marine Shipping Corp (‘Da Lian’).</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5        Sea Consortium provides

scheduled container feeder services from four hub ports, Singapore, Colombo, Dubai and

Malta, to minor ports within those regions. In order to provide such services, Sea

Consortium charters various vessels. Yu is the managing director of Fortune Glory Pte Ltd

(‘Fortune Glory’), which was the Da Fu’s shipping agent at the material

time. Together with Da Lian and Far Glory Holdings Pte Ltd (‘Far Glory’), it is

a subsidiary of the China-based Da Lian Shipping Group.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6        Yu was the key witness for

the prosecution. He testified that in early June 2000 he knew that the Da Fu would be in

Colombo in mid-June without any business. However, he wanted to bring the Da Fu back to

Singapore for dry dock repairs and it was dangerous for the vessel to sail without any

cargo. In these circumstances, he called the appellant, with whom he had been acquainted

since 1994 through certain shipping industry events, although they only began working

closely together from June 2000 onwards. He asked the appellant if he could charter the Da

Fu so that it could be brought back to Singapore for repairs. The appellant said he would

consider the matter, and call him back.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7        The appellant called Yu one

or two days later. The appellant proposed that Sea Consortium charter the Da Fu for the

journey back to Singapore (‘the voyage charter’), and enter into a one-year time

charter of the same vessel thereafter (‘the time charter’). The proposed rate

for the voyage charter was US$3,000 to US$3,200 per day, while that for the time charter

would be US$5,000 to US$5,100 per day. The appellant added that he required ‘some

personal benefits’ of US$300 per day for both charters. Yu told him that he could

arrange for this. On the same day, he spoke by telephone to the chairman of the Da Lian

Shipping Group, one Men Hong Sheng (‘Men’), who was in China. That night, Yu

faxed Men setting out the details of the arrangement, which was then approved.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8        The faxed reply from China

was not admitted at the trial below as no-one from China came to testify. The prosecution

indicated that Men had been willing to come, but had then fallen ill and decided against

travelling to Singapore. However, the defence sought to have and did have the faxed reply

admitted as Exh D6 for the fax transmission details contained therein. Yu testified that

the original faxes had been lost.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9        Subsequently, there were

two meetings between Yu on the one hand, and the appellant and his associates on the

other, to discuss the voyage charter and the time charter. The first meeting was on 7 June

2000 at Sea Consortium’s office. The appellant’s associates at this meeting were

one Vico Lew (‘Capt Vico’) and one Surajdeep Singh (‘Capt Suraj’), a

line manager at Sea Consortium. A charter rate of US$3,200 was agreed on. No formal

agreement was signed. Instead, Yu tied up the details with the appellant via e-mail. The

second meeting was on 15 June 2000. The appellant telephoned Yu asking him to come to his

office. At this meeting, Sea Consortium’s chartering manager and head of the fleet

management department, one Yong Lin Kong (‘Yong’), was present in addition to

the appellant and Yu. At this meeting, a rate of US$5,100 per day was agreed on for the

time charter. A formal agreement was signed. At neither meeting was the US$300 per day

‘personal benefit’ mentioned. Yu said that this was because he understood it to

be a confidential matter between himself and the appellant.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10        The modus operandi for the

payment of the bribes to the appellant was as follows. Yu calculated the first amount due

to the appellant. For subsequent payments, he instructed his subordinate Zhang Li Qin

(‘Zhang’), who was in charge of the financial affairs of Far Glory and Fortune

Glory, to calculate the amounts and prepare the cash for him. Zhang would draw up a

payment voucher and a cash cheque for each amount. In the payment vouchers, the payments

were described as ‘commission’ for Sea Consortium. Yu paid the appellant in US

dollars, cash, to avoid leaving evidence behind. He made a total of nine payments. Yu met

the appellant at the Chinatown Point Foodcourt and the Amara Hotel coffee house to make

the first two payments. For the remaining seven payments, Yu parked his car at Duxton

Road, near Sea Consortium’s office, and handed the appellant the cash in the car. Yu

said that they would then go for drinks or some food, but could not remember where they

went each time. He also could not remember the precise dates on which the payments were

made. The dates provided to the court below were mainly based on the dates of the payment

vouchers and the cash cheques.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">11        Yu would place the cash in

envelopes to hand over to the appellant. One such envelope was Exh P13. This was the

envelope used for the second payment. It was recovered from the appellant’s residence

when it was raided by officers from the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau

(‘CPIB’). The dates on the envelope, ‘10 Aug – 9 Sep 2000’, were

written in Yu’s handwriting and represented the period for the second payment.

However, Yu made an error of a day when writing those dates down. They should have been 9

August to 8 September 2000.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">12        Yu created five sham

receipts for some of the payments. In them, one ‘LC Wong’ was stated to have

received ‘address commission’ from Fortune Glory for Sea Consortium’s

charter of the Da Fu. Yu said that he did not ask the appellant to sign the receipts as he

knew that the appellant would not have done so. Yu did not prepare receipts for the

remaining payments as he was busy with his work and did not have the time to do so. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">13        Sea Consortium had

previously chartered the Da Fu’s sister ship, the Da Fa. In April or May 2001, this

charter ended and was not renewed by Sea Consortium. However, Yu discussed the charter of

another vessel, the Da Lian, with the appellant around this period. Sea Consortium did

eventually charter this vessel at US$6,300 per day. The appellant did not ask for any

‘personal benefits’ this time.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">14        Two CPIB officers, one Soh

Kin Wai and one Lim Yong Seng Vincent, testified that on 25 June 2001 they raided the

appellant’s residence and found four envelopes containing substantial amounts of US

dollars in cash, including Exh P13. They testified further that, when asked, the appellant

told them that he was keeping the money to invest in a ship.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">15        Apart from his executive

directorship at Sea Consortium, the appellant was also involved in two other companies,

namely, Joint Fun Investments Pte Ltd (‘Joint Fun’) and Royal Ship Brokering

Services (‘RSS’). The appellant was a part-time consultant for Joint Fun, giving

advice on ships’ suitability for the feeder market. He had set up RSS jointly with

one Chan Yew Thong, an ex-classmate. RSS provided boarding, checker and ship planning

services to Sea Consortium. When the appellant’s superior at Sea Consortium, one

Timothy Hartnoll (‘Hartnoll’), asked him directly if he was involved in RSS, he

denied it.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The defence</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">16        In his defence below, the

appellant denied that the corrupt payments ever took place. It was Capt Suraj’s idea,

in early June 2000, to charter the Da Fu following his encounter with Yu on board the Da

Fa during a routine inspection. Capt Suraj was the line manager in charge of the

Singapore-Colombo-Chittagong service. Yu told Capt Suraj that he had a ship due for

redelivery from the last charterer, and asked if Sea Consortium required a ship. Upon Capt

Suraj’s return to Sea Consortium’s office, he asked the appellant and Capt Vico

whether they were interested. The appellant asked Capt Suraj to invite Yu to the office to

discuss the matter. The telephone call from Yu to the appellant, and the subsequent call

from the appellant to Yu to arrange for the US$300 per day ‘personal benefit’ on

top of the two charters, never took place.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">17        At the meeting on 7 June

2000, Capt Suraj offered a charter rate of US$3,200 per day. Yu accepted this rate even

though it was well below the daily market rate of US$5,100 to US$5,500. This was probably

because he was desperate and could not find any other charterers for the Da Fu. It was

already early June and the vessel had to be brought back by mid-June to undergo repairs.

However, it would not be particularly dangerous for the Da Fu to be brought back without

any cargo despite the monsoon. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">18        Capt Suraj was also

present at the meeting of 15 June 2000 with the appellant, Yu and Yong. Yong joined

towards the end of the meeting. The main terms of the time charter were subsequently set

out in an email. The charter rate of US$5,100 was well within market range. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">19        With respect to the dates

on the envelope Exh P13, the appellant’s version of events was that they were dates

for the laycan period of a vessel for potential charter by Sea Consortium. According to

the evidence of the appellant, Capt Suraj and one Ananda Kumar (‘Capt Kumar’),

Yu met with them at the Elvis Pub near Sea Consortium’s office on 21 July 2000 for an

informal meeting to discuss possibilities for Sea Consortium’s new Singapore-Surabaya

route. Yu took out Exh P13, which contained ship specifications, and asked the appellant

for advice on them. The appellant mentioned the laycan period dates required for the

Singapore-Surabaya service. Yu wrote them down on Exh P13. The appellant took Exh P13 home

with him.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The decision of the district judge</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">20        As it was clear to me that

this appeal involved two completely conflicting bodies of evidence – that of the

prosecution, and that of the defence – I now set out in some detail the district

judge’s reasoning as to her findings on the credibility of the witnesses who

testified in the proceedings below. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">21        In evaluating the evidence

of the key prosecution witness, Yu, the district judge bore in mind her prior ruling that

his role in the factual milieu went beyond that of a mere payor, and consequently fell

outside the scope of s 25 of the Act. Section 25 reads:</p>
<font size="3" xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Notwithstanding any rule of law or written law to the contrary, no

    witness shall, in any such trial or inquiry as is referred to in section 24, be presumed

    to be unworthy of credit by reason only of any payment or delivery by him or on his behalf

    of any gratification to an agent…</p>
</blockquote></blockquote></font>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">The district judge found Yu’s account cogent and consistent, and

not incredible in any aspects. It fitted in with the surrounding circumstances at the

time, and was in accord with the undisputed factual matrix. Further, she was of the view

that Yu had been candid in court. He had not sought to hide his own role as an accomplice

in the matter, and had implicated himself fully in the transactions. His evidence was

supported by the documentary evidence, namely, the fax transmission (Exh P22) and the

envelope (Exh P13), and corroborated by Zhang’s oral testimony. The district judge

concluded:</p>
<font size="3" xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Having considered all the aspects, <i>and bearing in mind the caution

    with which to treat his evidence</i>, I found Mr Yu credible, and his testimony reliable.

    [Emphasis added.]</p>
</blockquote></blockquote></font>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">22        On Zhang’s testimony,

the district judge had this to say:</p>
<font size="3" xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">On the whole, Ms Zhang’s evidence was factual in nature, and she

    gave a clear account of what happened, without any embellishments. I considered the

    possibility that Ms Zhang was protecting Mr Yu or herself. However, in her evidence, she

    had clearly implicated Mr Yu in the transactions, and she also admitted to her knowledge

    of the bribes. I found that she was a reliable witness, and that her evidence was to be

    given full weight.</p>
</blockquote></blockquote></font>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">23        In contrast, the district

judge rejected the defence version of events as portrayed in the accounts of the main

defence witnesses, namely, the appellant, Capt Suraj and Capt Kumar. She noted that while

the appellant’s evidence was consistent both internally and with the evidence of the

other defence witnesses, she did not rely much on that in weighing his evidence. Instead,

what was critical was that the appellant’s version was unbelievable. While quick to

dissociate himself from Yu and any wrongdoing, the appellant’s own conduct showed

that they shared a close relationship. The appellant was quick to portray Yu as an

untrustworthy person out to frame him when there was no basis for doing so. The district

judge therefore found the appellant’s version implausible, and rejected it. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">24        She also rejected the

evidence of Capt Suraj and Capt Kumar. She found that they both had clear motives to

assist the appellant, in that Capt Suraj was his subordinate and worked closely with him,

and Capt Kumar was dependent on Sea Consortium for business and was an old subordinate of

the appellant’s. Capt Suraj’s account of the negotiations for the two charters

of the Da Fu was rejected, as was Capt Kumar’s version of the meeting at the Elvis

Pub and how the appellant came into possession of Exh P13.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">25        As such, the district

judge found that the prosecution had proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt and

convicted the appellant accordingly.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The appeal against conviction</p></b><i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The crux of the appeal</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">26        Before me, the appellant

raised the following issues:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">a whether the district judge was correct in finding that Yu was a

    credible and reliable witness;</p>
<p align="justify">b whether the district judge erred by failing to give proper weight to

    undisputed facts which rendered improbable Yu’s version that the appellant had asked

    for and received the bribes;</p>
<p align="justify">c whether the district judge erred in not giving proper weight to the

    evidence of Capt Suraj;</p>
<p align="justify">d whether the district judge erred in not giving proper weight to the

    evidence of Yong;</p>
<p align="justify">e whether the district judge erred in rejecting the evidence of Capt

    Kumar; and</p>
<p align="justify">f whether the district judge erred in not treating Zhang’s

    evidence with sufficient caution.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">27        The nub of this appeal,

therefore, was this: whether the district judge was correct in accepting the evidence of

the prosecution witnesses, principally Yu, and rejecting the evidence of the defence

witnesses. This was a near-classic case of oath against oath, namely, Yu’s bare

allegation, given that no-one save he himself had actually seen the appellant accepting

the bribe monies, as against the appellant’s bare denial, corroborated only by

witnesses who appeared to risk bias given that, as his subordinates and business

associates, they apparently stood to gain if they testified in his favour.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The law</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">28        Fundamentally, this appeal

involved an attack by the appellant on the findings of fact made by the district judge. As

such, I found it appropriate to revisit the settled principles of law relating to

overturning the trial judge’s findings of fact on appeal. The threshold that must be

reached in order to justify overturning those findings is very high. Section 261 of the

Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (‘CPC) provides:</p>
<font size="3" xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">No judgment, sentence or order of a District Court or Magistrate’s

    Court shall be reversed or set aside <i>unless it is shown to the satisfaction of the High

    Court that the judgment, acquittal, sentence or order was either wrong in law or against

    the weight of the evidence</i>, or, in the case of a sentence, manifestly excessive or

    inadequate in the circumstances of the case. [Emphasis added.]</p>
</blockquote></blockquote></font>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">In <i>Lim Ah Poh</i> <i>v PP</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=6012&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1992] 1 SLR 713</a>, FA Chua J stated:</p>
<font size="3" xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">An appellate court will not disturb findings of fact unless they are

    clearly reached against the weight of the evidence. In examining the evidence, <i>an

    appellate court has always to bear in mind that it has neither seen nor heard the

    witnesses and has to pay due regard to the trial judges’ findings and their reasons

    therefor.</i> [Emphasis added.]</p>
</blockquote></blockquote></font>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">29        I endorsed this principle

in an entire line of subsequent cases: see for example <i>Shamsul bin Abdullah v PP</i>

(MA No. 145/2002), <i>Chua Yong Khiang Melvin v PP</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=49424&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1999] 4 SLR 87</a>, <i>Soh Yang Tick v

PP</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=45534&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1998] 2 SLR 42</a> and <i>Sundara Moorthy Lankatharan v PP</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=11130&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1997] 3 SLR 464</a>. In <i>Soh

Yang Tick v PP</i>, I held, specifically in relation to situations where findings of fact

depend on the credibility and veracity of witnesses, that an appellate court should be

reluctant to overturn the trial judge’s findings. This is simply because the

appellate court is in a less advantageous position as compared to the trial judge, who has

had the benefit of hearing the evidence of the witnesses in full, and observing their

demeanour. I then summarised the effect of the governing jurisprudence as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">The upshot of these cases is that factual findings of

    fact [<i>sic</i>] are prima facie correct and will not be lightly disturbed in the absence

    of good reasons. To do so would be contrary to the function of an appellate court, for its

    duties lie in correcting errors, and not in the reviewing of facts.</p>
</font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">30        With these principles

borne firmly in mind, I now turn to examine each of the six grounds of appeal, all of

which centre on the district judge’s findings of fact with respect to the credibility

of the witnesses and the weight to be accorded their evidence. As the issues relating to

grounds (c), (e) and (f) are essentially the same, I will deal with them together.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The grounds of appeal</p>
<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman">
<p align="justify"></p></font></i>(a) Whether the district judge erred in finding Yu a credible and

reliable witness

<p align="justify" xmlns="">31        Before me, counsel for the

appellant asserted that Yu could have been the actual offender. He had fabricated the

faxes, and his actual forgery of the receipts showed that he had no qualms about

fabricating evidence to pervert the course of justice. Some of his evidence contradicted

that of Zhang’s; for example, while he had said that he did not count the money that

she gave him, she had stated that he would do so sometimes. Further, his inability to

recall where he went with the appellant after the Duxton Road meetings called into doubt

his evidence that he had actually paid the appellant the bribe monies.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">32        After thoroughly reviewing

both the Notes of Evidence of the proceedings below, as well as the district judge’s

grounds of decision, I concluded that the district judge had clear and cogent reasons for

making her findings. First, in relation to treating Yu’s evidence with caution, she

had firmly kept in view the fact that Yu himself was not completely absolved of

wrongdoing. To make a direct assertion that Yu was siphoning funds off from Fortune Glory

and/or Da Lian in this way was to cast aside completely the district judge’s careful

consideration of Yu’s evidence, and the demeanour with which he gave that evidence,

at first instance. The allegation that Yu forged the faxes was but a bare allegation given

that the appellant’s criminal motion was subsequently withdrawn.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">33        Second, Yu stated in his

testimony that he did not ask the appellant to sign the receipts because he knew that he

would not have done so. I did not see that this was such an implausible explanation. In

addition, given the fact that Yu was bribing the appellant in the first place, it would

have been ludicrous at the very least to expect him to obtain the appellant’s

signature on those receipts. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">34        As to Yu’s inability

to recall where he and the appellant went after the Duxton Road meetings, I found that the

district judge had directed her mind to this aspect of his testimony too. She noted that

the payments stretched over almost a year, and that ‘in such circumstances, it was

reasonable that Mr Yu could not remember where exactly they went to after meeting up at

Duxton Road.’ As the DPP submitted in his written arguments, even if this were an

issue, it was not material to the commission of the offence. The DPP cited the following

passage from <i>Ng Chiew Kiat v PP</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=50029&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[2000] 1 SLR 370</a>, where I stated:<font size="3"></font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">… the mere fact that the complainant was unable to say with

    certainty when the offences took place would not without more render her entire testimony

    unreliable. Unlike the appellate court, the district judge had the advantage of observing

    the complainant’s demeanour at the stand as she gave her evidence. She found her to

    be a truthful witness. Having perused the records of appeal thoroughly, I could not say

    that the district judge was plainly wrong in her assessment of the veracity of the

    complainant. As such, I would not interfere with her findings.</p>
<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman">
</font></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">The same reasoning could be applied to the appellant’s contention

on the inconsistency of Yu’s evidence with Zhang’s on the point of whether or

not he counted the money before handing it to the appellant. It was in no way material to

the offence for which the appellant was convicted.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">35        I therefore saw no valid

reason for overturning the district judge’s findings with regards to Yu’s

credibility and reliability as a witness.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(b) Whether the district judge had failed to give proper weight to

undisputed facts which rendered Yu’s allegations that the appellant had asked for and

received bribes improbable</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">36        The appellant argued

before me that the fact that he did not ask for bribes when the Da Fa’s charter came

up for renewal and for the charter of the Da Lian showed that it was improbable that he

had asked for bribes for the two charters of the Da Fu. I reiterate that the district

judge expressly stated that she found that Yu’s testimony ‘fitted with the

surrounding circumstances at the time, and was in accord with the undisputed factual

matrix.’ It could not be said, then, that she did <i>not</i> give proper weight to

the other evidence in making her assessment of Yu’s credibiltiy and his account of

the events that took place. Whether or not the appellant asked for bribes for the charter

of the Da Lian and the possible renewal of the Da Fa’s charter is entirely irrelevant

to whether or not he committed <i>this</i> offence. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">37        The appellant further

submitted that the bribes did not make commercial sense. He also contended that there

would have been no necessity for Yu to bribe him for the time charter of the Da Fu, since

there was no evidence that Yu was hard-pressed to find a charterer for the vessel after

its return to Singapore, and given that Hartnoll stated in his evidence that market demand

for vessels of the Da Fu’s specifications was in fact rising. I was satisfied from my

review of the notes of evidence that it was clear, given the monsoon season and the

potential danger to the Da Fu if she sailed without cargo, that Yu was prepared to accept

a loss. In those circumstances, the bribe was not exorbitantly high. Also, the bribe for

the time charter was part of Yu’s private agreement with the appellant, concluded

over the telephone in early June 2000. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">38        With specific regard to

whether or not it was actually dangerous to sail in the Bay of Bengal during the monsoon

season, the district judge chose to reject Capt Suraj’s evidence that it was not, and

accepted the version presented by the prosecution that it was. She was perfectly entitled

to do so, and there was nothing in the notes of evidence that persuaded me otherwise. As

such, I also found no reason to disturb the district judge’s findings of fact on this

issue. I will deal with Capt Suraj’s evidence in further detail under heading (d)

below.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(c) Whether the district judge erred in failing to consider Yong’s

evidence</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">39        I found it was true that

the district judge did not consider Yong’s evidence at length in her grounds of

decision. However, I was not convinced, after carefully perusing the Notes of Evidence in

relation to his testimony at the trial, that he could be of any help to the defence. He

could only testify as to the tail-end of the meeting of 15 June 2002 at which the time

charter of the Da Fu was finalised. I set out this extract from Yong’s

cross-examination to demonstrate how little he actually knew of the events in this case:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="3"><p align="justify">Q. When you joined

    the meeting, had parties already agreed on charter rate?</p>
</font><font size="3"><p align="justify">A. Yes.</p>
<p align="justify">Q. Did you get to listen to any of the negotiations on charter rate?</p>
<p align="justify">A. No.</p></font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The appellant had therefore shown no valid reason, apart from the mere

fact that the district judge did not dwell at length on Yong’s evidence in her

grounds of decision, why her findings should be disturbed. Simply put, Yong’s

evidence contributed nothing to the defence case.</p>
<p align="justify">(d) The district judge’s treatment of the evidence of Capt Suraj,

Capt Kumar and Zhang</p>
<p align="justify">40        Counsel for the appellant

submitted at length in their written arguments on certain factual aspects of Capt

Suraj’s and Capt Kumar’s evidence that they contended showed why the district

judge should have preferred the defence case to that of the prosecution. The root of the

dispute here was in fact, once again, witness credibility.</p>
<p align="justify">41        The appellant’s

submissions with respect to the district judge’s findings on the evidence of these

three witnesses could be summarised thus. The district judge rejected the evidence of Capt

Suraj and Capt Kumar on the grounds that their evidence was designed to corroborate the

appellant’s own testimony and the defence version of events in general, and that they

had some motive to generate favourable testimony for the appellant because of their

respective relationships with him. Capt Suraj was the appellant’s subordinate at Sea

Consortium, while Capt Kumar was a former subordinate who now depended on Sea Consortium

for business. He also continued to be a regular golf buddy of the appellant’s. The

appellant also took issue with the district judge’s findings on the reliability of

Zhang’s evidence, pointing out that the district judge did not apply the same

reasoning to Zhang’s evidence and that she ‘was, after all, Yu’s

subordinate and would, by a parity of reasoning, tailor her evidence to favour Yu.’</p>
<p align="justify">42        I did not see any merit in

these arguments. In her grounds of decision, the district judge did consider Zhang’s

position in relation to Yu, and the possibility that she might have an incentive to

protect either herself or Yu. She found that despite that, Zhang had been frank on the

witness stand and she chose to accept her testimony. As for the evidence of Capt Suraj and

Capt Kumar, my perusal of the notes of evidence disclosed a somewhat rehearsed nature to

their testimony. Capt Kumar, for one, appeared very confident that Yu had written laycan

dates on the envelope Exh P13:</p></font><font size="3" xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Q. You said sometime after this, Yu wrote something on it?</p>
<p align="justify">A. Yes.</p>
<p align="justify">Q. Did you notice what he was writing?</p>
<p align="justify">A. I didn’t go close to see. But at that time, the discussion was

    laycan of Singapore/Surabaya Service. So he wrote the laycan mentioned by Captain Wong.</p>
<p align="justify">Q. Did you see him write down the laycan dates? Are you sure he wrote

    down the laycan dates?</p>
<p align="justify">A. Yes. I am sure he was writing the laycan dates stated by Wong.</p>
<p align="justify">Q. Did you see him write down laycan dates?</p>
<p align="justify">A. As Captain Wong spoke, he was writing down laycan dates.</p>
<p align="justify">Q. Would I be correct to say you assumed he was writing the laycan?</p>
<p align="justify">A. No.</p>
</blockquote></blockquote></font>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">43        It is apparent even here

that this exchange seems not to ring true. Moreover, I did not have, as the district judge

did, the additional benefit of observing these witnesses give testimony during the trial.

Coupled with the fact that in his statement to the CPIB, the appellant claimed not to know

what the dates were for, and the appellant’s own performance on the stand during

trial, the district judge’s finding that Capt Suraj and Capt Kumar both gave

testimony designed to corroborate the appellant was perfectly reasonable. Again, I saw

absolutely no reason to disturb the district judge’s findings.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Conclusion on the appeal against conviction</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">44        There was no denying the

fact that Yu was not devoid of wrongdoing on his own part in giving the appellant the

bribes and, <i>inter alia</i>, forging receipts in furtherance of that enterprise.

However, I found the district judge’s conclusions to be perfectly sound. In the

absence of any compelling indications to the contrary, and in view of the fact that the

district judge had the distinct advantage , as I did not, of observing the witnesses at

trial, I was not persuaded that I should disturb any of the district judge’s findings

of fact.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The appeal against sentence</p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">45        At the hearing before me,

counsel for the appellant raised the following argument against the sentence imposed by

the district judge. This argument was not canvassed in the proceedings below. Counsel

argued that the sentence of 10 months’ imprisonment for the nine amended charges had

been wrongly imposed as a matter of law, as s 71(1) of the Penal Code (Cap 224)

(‘PC’) applied in this case so that a <i>single</i> sentence should be imposed

for what was in reality a composite offence. Section 71(1) reads:</p>
<font size="3" xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Where anything which is an offence is made up of parts, any of which

    parts is itself an offence, the offender shall not be punished with the punishment of more

    than one of such his offences, unless it be so expressly provided.</p>
</blockquote></blockquote></font>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">46        In support of this

contention, counsel cited my judgment in <i>Zeng Guoyuan v PP (No. 2)</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=11246&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1997] 3 SLR 883</a>. Relying, in the main, on these authorities, counsel sought to persuade me that the

appellant’s receipt of the bribe monies on nine different occasions really

constituted the reward for a single act of recommending the charter of the Da Fu to Sea

Consortium. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">47        I found that this argument

had no merit whatsoever. This was not a case where s 71(1) was applicable. In the

premises, counsel’s argument that the district judge would have imposed a lesser

sentence had she been apprised of s 71(1) was wishful thinking on his part. She was

entitled in law to sentence the appellant to a total of 10 months’ imprisonment for

the nine amended charges, and in my view she had correctly exercised her discretion to do

so. The total gratification received by the appellant, amounting to US$90,377, was not a

paltry figure. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">48        As such, I dismissed the

appeal against sentence.</p>
