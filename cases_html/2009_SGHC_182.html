<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">1       In the 23 May 2008 edition of The Straits Times (“the Newspaper”), the defendant published an article entitled “<i>13-month-old boy critically ill in hospital</i>” (“the Article”). The 13-month-old boy in the Article, [B], had contracted hand, foot and mouth disease (“HFMD”). The Article appeared prominently on the first page of the Newspaper’s Home section at a time when HFMD was prevalent in schools and kindergartens. The plaintiff was named in the Article. In this action, the plaintiff seeks general and aggravated damages for libel in respect of the Article, as well as an injunction to restrain the defendant from further publishing articles which are defamatory of the plaintiff.</font></span></p>

<p class="judg-quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB">A SECOND child in Singapore</span> is critically ill following complications from hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD). Doctors fear he may have encephalitis, or inflammation of the brain.</p>
<p class="judg-quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB">[B], who turned 13 months old yesterday, was diagnosed with the childhood infection last Friday. He had a fever, no appetite and a rash.</span></p>
<p class="judg-quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB">By Saturday, the normally active infant was refusing to eat or drink. That night, he woke up crying several times.</span></p>
<p class="judg-quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB">The next day, his father, [F], 39, a technical officer with [xxx], took [B] to KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital (KKH), where he was warded.</span></p>
<p class="judg-quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB">On Monday night, while his parents were with him, little [B] had a seizure and stopped breathing momentarily; his blood pressure plummeted and his heart rate raced up.</span></p>
<p class="judg-quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB">Said his mother, [C], 29, an executive officer with the [xxx]: “It's a blessing that we took him to the hospital early. If it had happened at home, I wouldn't have known what to do.”</span></p>
<p class="judg-quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB">[B] was resuscitated and has been in intensive care since.</span></p>
<p class="judg-quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB">Dr Chong Chia Yin, head and senior consultant of infectious diseases at KKH, said yesterday that it was too early to know how he will fare, though his blood pressure has improved and he is now less dependent on a ventilator for breathing.</span></p>
<p class="judg-quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB">But she added: “He had a new seizure this morning.”</span></p>
<p class="judg-quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB">Dr Chong said [B] has fever, mouth ulcers and rashes on his palms, soles and buttocks. He throws up what he eats and is also drowsy.</span></p>
<p class="judg-quote-1"><i><span lang="EN-GB">[C], who is expecting her second child in October, said [B] probably caught the bug from his older cousin</span></i><span lang="EN-GB">.</span></p>
<p class="judg-quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB">The cousin's mother, who looks after [B] while his parents are at work, called on Wednesday night last week to say that her son had HFMD. So [C] took leave the next day to look after her son at home. “But it was too late,” she sighed.</span></p>
<p class="judg-quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB">More than 13,000 children here have come down with HFMD this year, including 156 who have been hospitalised.</span></p>
<p class="judg-quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB">While the epidemic seems to be tailing off – with a 25 per cent drop in cases from 1,246 for the week ending May 10 to 940 cases last week – the danger is not over yet.</span></p>
<p class="judg-quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB">This is because the number of kids getting infected with the virulent EV71 virus is still on the rise. So far, 32 per cent of all children infected here were hit by the EV71 bug – up from 29 per cent a week ago.</span></p>
<p class="judg-quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB">This is the virus that infected [B].</span></p>
<p class="judg-quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB">Seven-year-old [G], the other child who suffered from encephalitis, was infected by one of the other 80 HFMD viruses. She has recovered fully and is back at school.</span></p>
<p class="judg-quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB">It was the spread of the EV71 bug that caused the Health Ministry to compel childcare centres to close if they have more than a certain number of children infected over 15 days or more.</span></p>
<p class="judg-quote-1"><i><span lang="EN-GB">So far, 24 schools have been told to close, and another 75 urged to do so. The school that [B]'s cousin goes to, [the Centre] in [address redacted], is not among them</span></i><span lang="EN-GB">.</span></p>
<p class="judg-quote-1"><i><span lang="EN-GB">[C] was upset that the centre did not inform parents that it had some children down with this illness, so parents could keep their children away. The centre operator could not be reached for comment last night.</span></i></p>
<p class="judg-quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB">HFMD is usually a mild childhood illness which is passed from child to child through bodily fluids such as saliva or nasal mucus.</span></p>
<p class="judg-quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB">The number of HFMD cases here has been climbing steadily in recent years, from about 6,000 a year in 2003 to just over 20,000 last year.</span></p>

<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">7       The plaintiff’s complaint is that the Statements are defamatory of it in its trade and/or business. The plaintiff pleaded that the Statements, in their natural and ordinary meaning, meant and/or were understood to mean that:</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(a)    The plaintiff did not take any, or any reasonable steps to protect their students from HFMD.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(b)    The plaintiff did not take any, or any reasonable steps in the prevention and control of HFMD as was required of the plaintiff by the Ministry of Health.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(c)    The Centre had some children infected with HFMD and the plaintiff did not take any reasonable steps to warn or notify parents of all children who attend the Centre.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(d)    [B]’s cousin contracted HFMD from the Centre and as a result, infected [B] and caused him to contract HFMD.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(e)    Like the 24 kindergartens that were told to close down and the other 75 that were urged to do the same, the Centre should be amongst the same category.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(f)     The plaintiff tried to avoid the press intentionally because the plaintiff failed to take any or any reasonable steps or alert and warn parents of children who attend the Centre.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(g)    It was the plaintiff’s negligence in the management of HFMD amongst the children who attend the Centre that ultimately caused [B] to contract HFMD and suffer life-threatening conditions.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(h)    The plaintiff was negligent in maintaining the health and hygiene standard of the Centre.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(i)      But for the plaintiff’s negligence, [B]’s illness could have been avoided.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">8       The plaintiff submitted that the Statements read together with the Headings and the Pictures create the impression that the plaintiff caused [B]’s illness and predicament. The plaintiff argued that there is no evidence to suggest that [B] contracted HFMD from [D] (who, as mentioned above, attended the Centre). Further, there is also no proof that [D] caught HFMD whilst at the Centre. In addition, the plaintiff also contended that it was untrue that the plaintiff failed to notify parents that certain children who attended the Centre had taken ill with HFMD. The plaintiff asserted that it took all reasonable steps to notify the parents. In fact, the plaintiff maintained that it quarantined the children who fell ill during the material period until doctors had certified that they were free from the HFMD virus.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">9       Further, the plaintiff took issue with Statement 3, which it submitted, suggested that the plaintiff was avoiding the press intentionally. It was not disputed that Salma (representing the defendant) attempted to contact the Centre at least twice in the evening via telephone but there was no one at the Centre to answer the calls. The plaintiff was aggrieved over the fact that the defendant reported in the Article that the plaintiff was unavailable for comment. According to the plaintiff, this gave an implication “by way of ominous conclusion that the Plaintiff was avoiding the press.”</font><a href="#_ftn1" id="_ftnref1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 1]</font></span></span></span></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">10     Finally, the plaintiff also contended that the publication of the Article was actuated by malice.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">The defendant’s case</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">11     The defendant submitted that, first and foremost, the Statements, in their natural and ordinary meaning, were not defamatory. Secondly and in the alternative, even if the Statements were defamatory, the defendant can avail itself of the defence of justification. Finally, and again in the alternative, the defendant submitted that the Article was published on an occasion of qualified privilege.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">12     Before I turn to address these issues, it would be helpful to first set out the background (as illustrated in the defendant’s evidence) in relation to how both [D] and [B] contracted HFMD. In doing so, it will be revealed exactly what the impetus for the Article was.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><strong><em><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Events relating to how both [D] and [B] contracted HFMD</font></em></strong></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">13     [C] deposed that, at all material times, when she and her husband were away at work, [B] would spend the day at [E]’s house from 7.30am to about 6.00pm. [E] herself has three young children, who as at May 2008, were aged five, nine and 11 respectively. The youngest among [E]’s children is [D] who would usually play together with his cousin, [B], when [B] was at [E]’s house.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">14     [E] also deposed that, at the material time, [D] attended the Centre every weekday from about 10.00am to 2.00pm.

<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">15     On or around 14 May 2008, [D] was diagnosed with HFMD. On 16 May 2008, [B] himself developed a fever. The following day, [B]’s condition took a turn for the worse and on 18 May 2008, he was admitted to KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital (“KK Hospital”). On 19 May 2008, [B]’s blood pressure dropped and he fainted. He was then transferred to the Intensive Care Unit (“ICU”). There, [B] suffered a seizure and stopped breathing for about 15 minutes before he was resuscitated. [B] spent the next 11 days at the ICU.</font></span></p>

<p class="judg-quote-2"><span lang="EN-GB">- Cover mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing;</span></p>

<p class="judg-quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB">7       Parents should consult a doctor early if their child has fever, mouth ulcers and rashes on the palms, soles or buttocks. Children with HFMD should remain at home until all the blisters have dried up. During this period, contact with other children should be avoided until the child recovers. The child should not be brought to any public or crowded places. Proper hygiene should also be practiced at home so as to prevent transmission to other family members.</span></p>

<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">19     Salma’s evidence is that it was not uncommon for the defendant to receive such communication from MOH as the defendant, during the material period, was working with MOH in updating and alerting the general public on the HFMD situation in Singapore. After Salma saw the Press Release on 22 May 2008, she started her preparations (by using the information gathered in the Press Release) for the drafting of the Article. Salma intended to publish the Article the following day (ie 23 May 2008). To this end, Salma made arrangements to interview [B]’s parents at KK Hospital on 22 May 2008 itself (the very same day she received the Press Release).</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">20     During the interview on 22 May 2008 at KK Hospital (“the Interview”), [C] informed Salma that [B] probably contracted HFMD from [D], who himself was diagnosed with HFMD on 14 May 2008. The reason for [C]’s belief was that [B] had been playing with [D] at [E]’s house when [C] and her husband were at work, a point which I alluded to at [13] above. [C] also told Salma that she was upset over the fact that parents in general, and [E] in particular, were not informed that there were HFMD cases at the Centre. [C]’s position was that had [E] known of existing HFMD cases at the Centre, she would not have allowed [D] to attend the Centre.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">21     After the Interview, Salma returned to her office at around 6.00pm. Salma’s evidence is that at or around this time, she attempted to contact the Centre to seek its comment for the purposes of the Article which the defendant intended to publish in the following day’s edition of the Newspaper. Salma said she made at least two attempts to contact the Centre by telephone. As it turned out, there was no one at the Centre to pick up Salma’s calls.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">22     Bearing in mind that the Press Release indicated that the information stated therein was “for immediate release” to the public (see above at [17]), Salma proceeded to draft the Article based on the information that she gathered from the Press Release itself and the Interview. The Article was published on 23 May 2008 in the Newspaper. Further, as the defendant usually did with most articles, an electronic copy of the Article was published online.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">The issues in this action</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">23     There are three issues in this case, the first of which is, what is the natural and ordinary meaning of the Statements? Further, do the Statements (in their natural and ordinary meaning) bear the defamatory meaning (with respect to the plaintiff’s trade and/or business) pleaded by the plaintiff or some lesser defamatory meaning? (collectively “Issue 1”). The second issue is whether the defence of justification is made out (“Issue 2”). The third issue is whether the defendant can avail itself of the defence of qualified privilege; in this regard, it is also necessary to consider whether the publication of the Article was actuated by malice such that the defendant is precluded from this defence (collectively “Issue 3”).</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><strong><em><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Issue 1: Is the natural and ordinary meaning of the Statements defamatory to the plaintiff’s trade and/or business?</font></em></strong></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">24     In respect of Issue 1, the plaintiff’s submissions pertained only to the last meaning as pleaded in [8] of its Statement of Claim (see above at [7]). This stated that “but for the plaintiff’s negligence, [B]’s illness could have been avoided”. In other words, the last meaning is that [B]’s illness was caused by the plaintiff’s negligence. I therefore proceed on the basis that the plaintiff has not made any submissions on the first eight meanings pleaded and only deal with the last pleaded meaning. I turn now to consider the natural and ordinary meaning of the Statements.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">25     The general principles applicable in determining the natural and ordinary meaning of the alleged defamatory words were neatly summarised in the Court of Appeal decision of <i>Microsoft Corp v SM Summit Holdings Ltd</i> <nobr>[1999] 4 SLR 529</nobr> (“<i>Microsoft Corporation</i>”) as follows (at [53]):</font></span></p>

In this regard, it is instructive to refer to the remarks made in <i>Griffiths v Benn</i> (1911) 27 TLR 346 at 350 where Cozens-Hardy M R stated what a plaintiff has to show in order to prove that the words are defamatory of its trade and/or business:</font></span></p>

I formed this impression with Statement 1 (in particular) at the back of my mind. To this extent, I agree with the plaintiff. The plaintiff, however, went further and contended that Statement 2 conveys an ordinary and natural meaning to the reader that “[l]ike the 24 kindergartens that were told to close down and the other 75 that were urged to do the same, the Centre should be amongst the same category”. I cannot agree with the plaintiff that Statement 2 gives an ordinary and reasonable reader the impression that the Centre should have also closed down like the other 24 kindergartens (that were closed down) and another 75 (which were urged to do so).

<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">35     The Statements, taken as a whole, are defamatory of the plaintiff’s trade and/or business because, read with the entire Article, they would ordinarily lead reasonable people to believe that the plaintiff conducted its business in an <i>improper and negligent</i> manner. It cannot be disputed that the Centre itself had the <i>responsibility and duty to inform and update</i> the parents of the latest developments on the HFMD situation at the Centre, and more importantly, whether there were any new cases of their students contracting HFMD. Reading the Article in its entirety, it appears that the meaning which is being portrayed is that the sole source of [B]’s predicament and illness appears to be the plaintiff’s negligence in failing to inform the parents that the Centre had students who were ill with HFMD.

<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">40     To succeed in a plea of justification, the defendant need not prove the truth of every detail of the words published. He need only prove the truth of the “sting of the charge”; see <i>Lim Eng Hock Peter v Lim Jian Wei</i> <nobr>[2009] SGHC 31</nobr> at [127]. I have held in [28] above that the Statements bore the meaning pleaded by the plaintiff, namely that “[b]ut for the plaintiff’s negligence, [B]’s illness could have been avoided”. In my view this is essentially the same as the meaning pleaded in the defence that the defendant sought to justify, namely that “the Plaintiff did not take due care in the prevention and control of HFMD, including taking reasonable steps in warning parents of the children under their charge, and that as a result [B]’s cousin contracted HFMD”. However I do not find that the defendant had proved its case of justification as there was no evidence to prove that [D] contracted HFMD whilst at the Centre, and that in turn, [B] himself contracted HFMD from [D]. Consequently, the defence of justification clearly fails.</font></span></p>

<p class="judg-quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB">A <i>Reynolds</i>-type defence does not require the existence of “special facts” so long as “responsible journalism” is practised in the publication. As stated at [73] above, that is not the law in Singapore</span>. In <i>Reynolds</i>, the publishers of a newspaper were sued by the former Prime Minster of Ireland on the grounds that the article in question imputed that the latter had deliberately and dishonestly misled the Irish House of Representatives and his coalition cabinet colleagues, especially the Deputy Prime Minister. The defendant argued that a new category of privilege for the discussion of “political information” ought to be recognised. The House of Lords rejected this proposition and held that no generic privilege attached to publications of “political information” or other matters of “serious public concern”, as such a generic privilege would not provide adequate protection of reputation. The House of Lords in <i>Reynolds</i> was, however, influenced by Art 10 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (4 November 1950), Eur TS No 5, 213 UNTS 221, 1953 UKTS No 71 (entered into force 3 September 1953) (“the European Convention”) and s 12 of the UK Human Rights Act 1998 (c 42), which was then about to come into effect in England, into giving the media more latitude in its reporting provided “responsible journalism” was practised, consistent with the principles of freedom of expression: see <i>Gatley on Libel and Slander</i> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 10th Ed, 2004) at para 14.84. It is to be noted that Art 10 of the European Convention is by its terms distinguishable from Art 14 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (1999 Rev Ed). The Court of Appeal in <i>Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin v Lee Kuan Yew</i> ([73] <i>supra</i>) noted at 330–331, [56] and [58] that:</p>
<p class="judg-quote-2"><span lang="EN-GB">[56] … The terms of art 14 of our Constitution differ materially from … art 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights. … [T]he right of free speech and expression under cl 1(a) of art 14 is expressly subject to cl 2(a) of the same article, and the latter provides that Parliament may by law impose on the rights of free speech and expression conferred by cl 1(a) two categories of restrictions: first, such restrictions as it considers <i>necessary and expedient</i> in the interest of the security of Singapore or any part thereof, friendly relations with other countries, public order or morality; and second, <i>restrictions designed</i> to protect the privileges of Parliament or <i>to provide against</i> contempt of court, <i>defamation</i> or incitement to any offence. While the first category of restrictions must satisfy the test of necessity and expediency in the interest of the various matters specified therein, the second category of restrictions is not required to satisfy any such test. Thus, Parliament is empowered to make laws to impose on the right of free speech restriction designed to provide against defamation. … [I]t is true that the wording in para 1 [of art 10 of the European Convention of Human Rights] is similar to cl 1(a) of art 14. However, para 2 of art 10 is in no way similar to cl (2) of art 14: para 2 provides that the exercise of the freedom under para 1 is subject to ‘restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are <i>necessary</i> in a democratic society … for the protection of the reputation or rights of others …’.

<p class="judg-quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB">Generally, qualified privilege is available to newspapers as much as to any other person. Privilege for publication in the press of information of general public interest is <i>limited to cases where the publisher has a legal, social or moral duty to communicate</i>. The law does not recognize an interest in the public strong enough to give rise generally to a duty to communicate in the press<i>; such a duty has been held to exist on special facts,</i> and there is no general ‘media privilege at common law’ …</span></p>

<p class="judg-quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB">In addition, <i>the duty must be a duty to publish to the public at large and the interest must exist in the public at large to receive the publication.</i> It is insufficient if only a section of the public is concerned with the subject matter of the publication …</span></p>
<p class="judg-quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB">The relevant factors are by whom and to whom, when, why and in what circumstances the publication is made, and whether these things establish a relation between the parties which gives rise to a social or moral duty, and the consideration of these things may involve the consideration of questions of public policy. <i>It does not follow that publication of all matters of public interest is in the public interest such that it would give rise to a duty to publish them.</i> The right of a publisher of a newspaper to report truthfully and comment fairly on matters of public interest must not be confused with a duty of the sort that gives rise to an occasion of qualified privilege: per Cartwright J in <i>The Globe And Mail Ltd v Boland</i> (1960) 22 DLR (2d) 277 at pp 280–281.</span></p>

<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">47     In light of the foregoing legal principles, the question which I have to address now is whether qualified privilege extends to an occasion where the publication relates to information concerning <i>public health</i>. In this regard, the defendant has drawn my attention to two cases namely, <i>Allbutt v The General Council of Medical Education and Registration</i> [1889] 23 QBD 400 (“<i>Allbutt</i>”) and <i>Camporese v Parton</i> (1984) 150 DLR (3d) 208 (“<i>Camporese</i>”). In <i>Allbutt</i>, it was held that the medical council had a social or moral duty to publish the name of a doctor who had been taken off the medical register. Consequently, the medical council could avail itself of the defence of qualified privilege. In <i>Camporese</i>, it was held that a published warning of possible food contamination from canning lids in a newspaper article fell within the ambit of the defence of qualified privilege.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times"><span lang="EN-GB">48     As I have noted earlier,</span> <span lang="EN-GB">the categories of qualified privilege are not closed. It is important, in my view, to note that there is no magic formula (comprising of a standard assortment of criteria) that would enable the court to ascertain whether an article is published on an occasion of qualified privilege. In the final analysis, the actual decision as to whether the defence of qualified privilege is applicable is largely dependent on the precise factual matrix of the case itself.</span></font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">49     Having said that, in accordance with the legal principles as set out in <i>Aaron</i> (see above at [46]), there are two indispensable elements that must be present <i>together</i> before an article in a newspaper can be said to be published on an occasion of qualified privilege. First, that article must pertain to a subject and contain information of <i>prima facie</i> <i>general public interest</i>. That is the minimum threshold; a mere general public interest in the information published is however never enough to found the defence of qualified privilege (see further <i>Evans on Defamation</i> at pp 120 and 131; <i>Gatley</i> at para 14.1). Secondly, and equally as important, the publisher must have a <i>legal, social or moral duty</i> to communicate the information to the general public. Coupled with this duty to communicate is a <i>corresponding interest</i> (on the part of the public) to receive the information. Therefore a general public interest by itself is not sufficient to give rise generally to a duty to communicate. In this regard, such a duty has been held to exist only on <i>special facts</i> (see <i>Aaron</i> at 651–652). With these legal principles in mind, I shall now discuss whether these two elements are in fact present in this case.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">50     It cannot be disputed that the Article conveyed information on the HFMD situation in Singapore, which at the material time was plainly an issue of public health of great concern to the public at large and in particular to parents of young children. In this regard, the defendant had also drawn my attention to the fact that the Press Release was one among a series of press releases (ten in total) that had been posted on MOH’s online website between 27 March 2008 and 3 June 2008 informing the public of the HFMD situation in Singapore.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">51     Further, according to the “Weekly Infectious Disease Bulletin” (for the week starting 23 March 2008) which is published by the MOH, the epidemic threshold for HFMD is surpassed when the total number of active HFMD cases exceeds 600. In the week ending 24 May 2008, the total number of HFMD cases notified to MOH was 729 (see in this regard the MOH press release dated 27 May 2008), and was clearly past the epidemic threshold. Consequently, as at 23 May 2008 when the Article was published, there was in fact an HFMD epidemic in Singapore.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">52     I note that the plaintiff had also made certain concessions relating to the seriousness of HFMD. First, at para 4 of its statement of claim, it acknowledged that:</font></span></p>

First, as acknowledged by the plaintiff itself, HFMD is an infectious disease and although mild and self-limiting, it has nevertheless been associated with deaths due to heart and nervous system complications. Second, as again accepted by the plaintiff itself, children under five years of age are especially susceptible to HFMD. This is the reason why outbreaks of this infectious disease occurred across childcare centres, kindergartens and schools throughout Singapore.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">54     In the circumstances, it is clear that, at the time the Article was published, it was in the public interest for information pertaining to the HFMD situation in Singapore to be disseminated. It cannot be disputed that HFMD is a subject of public health which, in my view, is a subject of <i>general public interest</i>. Consequently, in view of the fact that the Article was published so as to alert and update the public on the HFMD situation in Singapore, the first element of general public interest is indeed present in this case.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">55     With regard to the second element of the publisher having a <i>duty</i> to communicate the information to the general public who, in turn, must have a corresponding <i>interest</i> to receive the information, this is essentially a question of fact that must be determined based on the evidence before me.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">56     In this regard, the defendant’s evidence is that the Article was one of many articles published in the Newspaper between April 2008 and May 2008 reporting on the HFMD situation in Singapore. During this period, the health team of the Newspaper (“the Health team”) was working intimately with MOH in updating and alerting the public on the HFMD situation in Singapore. To this end, the Health team would regularly receive from MOH important updates and information on the HFMD situation for dissemination to the general public. An example of such an update is the Press Release received by Salma via an e-mail from Miss Lim on 22 May 2008 (see above at [17]–[18]).</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">57     It bears emphasising that the Press Release was titled “Update on Hand Foot and Mouth Disease (HFMD) Situation in Singapore”. It is also apposite to reiterate that there was an underlined notation in bold (at the top left hand corner of the Press Release) depicting that it was “<i>For Immediate Release</i>”. The Press Release has been set out in full above at [18], and the material parts therein emphasised accordingly in italics. In particular, the Press Release made a specific reference to a 13-month old boy (“the boy”) who had been hospitalised for suspected encephalitis. As it turned out, the boy is [B] himself. The Press Release also mentioned that the boy was in contact with his cousin who had HFMD and attended a kindergarten with an active HFMD cluster. Seen in this light, there is no doubt in my mind that the Press Release in fact formed the impetus for the Article.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">58     Taking into account the fact that MOH had conspicuously and intentionally denoted (in underlined bold font) that the Press Release (pursuant to which the Article was written and published in the Newspaper) was “for immediate release”, it is clear to me that MOH itself was of the view that the Press Release contained information which the public should be informed of <i>immediately</i> (or at least on an <i>urgent</i> basis). As alluded to earlier at [53], HFMD is a disease which is not only infectious but one that young children are especially susceptible to. Further, there was also in fact an HFMD epidemic at or around the time of the publication of the Article. In the circumstances, I would accept that parents and schools responsible for the care and well-being of young children must be kept well-informed of the HFMD situation and the possibly dire consequences of contracting this potentially fatal disease. In this regard, I am of the view that the Newspaper and therefore, the defendant (as the owner and publisher of the Newspaper) has a <i>duty</i> to publish the Article on an urgent basis (in this case, the Article was published on the very next day following the receipt of the Press Release by Salma) to the general public who in turn have an <i>interest</i> in receiving the information contained in the Article.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">59     In light of the legal principles as set out above from [46] to [47], and my decision as to whether the two elements of the defence of qualified privilege are present in this case (see above at [54]–[58]), it is my view that the Article was in fact published on an occasion of qualified privilege.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">60     However, this is not an end to the matter as the plaintiff also alleged that the publication of the Article was actuated by malice. Indeed, it is a well-settled principle of law that a plaintiff can defeat the defence of qualified privilege by proving that the publication of the alleged defamatory words was actuated by malice, <i>ie</i> with some improper or indirect motive, which the plaintiff usually proves by way of evidence that the defendant knew the statement to be untrue, or was recklessly indifferent as to the truth (see further this court’s decision in <i>Hytech Builders Pte Ltd v Goh Teng Poh Karen</i> (“<i>Hytech Builders</i>”) <nobr>[2008] 3 SLR 236</nobr> at [35]–[39]).</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">61     The starting position of any analysis of the defence of qualified privilege must be the House of Lords decision in <i>Horrocks v Lowe</i> [I975] AC 135 (“<i>Horrocks</i>”), which has recently been adopted and applied by this court in <i>Hytech Builders</i>. In <i>Horrocks</i>, Lord Diplock observed that the defendant’s <i>motive</i> in publishing the defamatory statements plays a critical role in the court’s decision of whether the defendant can avail itself of the defence of qualified privilege in the following manner at 149F:</font></span></p>

<td valign="top" width="95%">
<p class="Judg-Quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB">So, the motive with which the defendant on a privileged occasion made a statement defamatory of the plaintiff becomes crucial. The protection might, however, be illusory if the onus lay on him to prove that he was actuated solely by a sense of the relevant duty or a desire to protect the relevant interest. So he is entitled to be protected by the privilege unless <i>some other dominant and improper motive</i> on his part is proved. “Express malice” is the term of art descriptive of such a motive. Broadly speaking, it means <i>malice in the popular sense of a desire to injure the person who is defamed</i> and this is generally the motive which the plaintiff sets out to prove. But to destroy the privilege the desire to injure must be the dominant motive for the defamatory publication; <i>knowledge that it will have that effect is not enough if the defendant is nevertheless acting in accordance with a sense of duty or in bona fide protection of his own</i> legitimate <i>interests.</i> [emphasis added]</span></p>

If it be proved that he did not believe that what he published was true this is generally conclusive evidence of express malice, for no sense of duty or desire to protect his own legitimate interests can justify a man in telling deliberate and injurious falsehoods about another, save in the exceptional case where a person may be under a duty to pass on, without endorsing, defamatory reports made by some other person.</span></p>
<p class="judg-quote-1"><span lang="EN-GB">Apart from those exceptional cases, what is required on the part of the defamer to entitle him to the protection of the privilege is <i>positive belief in the truth of what he published or,</i> as it is generally though tautologously termed, <i>“honest belief.”</i> If he publishes untrue defamatory matter recklessly, without considering or caring whether it be true or not, he is in this, as in other branches of the law, treated as if he knew it to be false. But <i>indifference to the truth of what he publishes is not to be equated with carelessness, impulsiveness or irrationality in arriving at a positive belief that it is true</i>. …</span></p>
<p class="judg-quote-1"><i><span lang="EN-GB">Even a positive belief in the truth of what is published on a privileged occasion—which is presumed unless the contrary is proved—may not be sufficient to negative express malice if it can be proved that the defendant misused the occasion for some purpose other than that for which the privilege is accorded by the law</span></i><span lang="EN-GB">. …</span></p>
<p class="judg-quote-1"><span lang="EN-AU">Judges and juries should, however, be very slow to draw the inference that a defendant was so far actuated by improper motives as to deprive him of the protection of the privilege unless they are satisfied that he did not believe that what he said or wrote was true or that he was indifferent to its truth or falsity. The motives with which human beings act are mixed. They find it difficult to hate the sin but love the sinner. Qualified privilege would be illusory, and the public interest that it is meant to serve defeated, if the protection which it affords were lost merely because a person, although acting in compliance with a duty or in protection of a legitimate interest, disliked the person whom he defamed or was indignant at what he believed to be that person’s conduct and welcomed the opportunity of exposing it. It is only where his desire to comply with the relevant duty or to protect the relevant interest plays no significant part in his motives for publishing what he believes to be true that “express malice” can properly be found.</span></p>

<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">63     For easy reference, the principles stated in <i>Horrocks</i> can be summarised (very broadly) as follows:</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(a)    A defendant is entitled to the defence of qualified privilege unless some <i>dominant and improper motive</i> on its part is proved. In general, <i>motive</i> here equates to the use of a privileged occasion for some purpose other than that for which the privilege is accorded by law. It bears emphasising that in order for the defence to be defeated, the desire to injure the plaintiff must be the <i>dominant</i> motive for the defamatory publication.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(b)    As long as the defendant is acting in accordance with a sense of duty or in <i>bona fide</i> protection of his own legitimate interests, its knowledge that a statement will injure the plaintiff does <i>not</i> destroy the defence.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(c)    If the defendant publishes untrue defamatory statements <i>recklessly</i>, <i>ie</i> without considering or caring whether these statements are true or not, it will be deemed to have known that they are false. In this regard, carelessness, impulsiveness or even irrationality in arriving at a belief that the statements are true is <i>not</i> to be equated with recklessness.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(d)    Notwithstanding a positive belief in the truth of what is published, the defence will be defeated if it can be proved that the defendant misused the occasion for some purpose other than that for which the privilege is accorded by law.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">64     In my view, there is no evidence to suggest that the publication of the Article was actuated by malice. Indeed Salma testified that she positively believed in the truth of what [C] told her during the Interview (<i>ie</i> that the Centre failed to inform the parents on the HFMD cases at the Centre). This can be seen from Salma’s evidence as adduced under her cross-examination:</font></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">65     Further, counsel for the plaintiff, in the course of cross-examining Salma, sought to establish the <i>present</i> state of Salma’s belief as to the truth of the Statements. This, however, is irrelevant in my view. It is obvious that, in determining whether there was any malice present in the publication of the Article, the mental state of Salma must be determined <i>at the time the Statements were published</i> and not at trial (almost 11 months after the Article was published in the Newspaper).</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">66     I also accept that the defendant was not reckless or indifferent as to the truth of the Statements, and that Salma did believe in the veracity of the Statements on the basis of the information provided by [C] during the Interview even though she did not conduct an independent check to verify it. In my view it was not unreasonable for Salma, in the circumstances, to accept as true information provided by [C]. In this regard, I also note that Salma attempted to contact the plaintiff by telephone for its comment as soon as she returned to her office following the Interview. It was unfortunate that there was no one at the Centre to take the calls. In the circumstances, the Article duly reflected the fact that the plaintiff could not be contacted the night before the Article was published. It was not unreasonable, given the urgency of the matter to publish the article the following day without the benefit of the plaintiff’s response.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">67     The plaintiff’s assertion that the publication of the Article was “a tactic to increase the sales of the Newspaper by naming a Centre and creating drama that [the plaintiff] tried to avoid the press” is therefore a bald one which is unsupported by any evidence. In my view, there is nothing to show that the true impetus for the publication of the Article was anything other than the urgent need to alert and inform the public of the latest developments on the HFMD situation in Singapore.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Conclusion</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">68     For the reasons set out above, the plaintiff fails in its claim against the defendant and its action must be dismissed. I will hear parties on the question of costs.</font></span></p>
