<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an action by the
                    plaintiff See Toh Siew Kee (“See Toh”) against
                    three defendants claiming damages for injuries caused to See
                    Toh on 13 February 2008 at 9/11 Tuas Basin Close
                    (“9/11 TBC”). That address was apparently
                    changed to 13 Tuas Basin Close subsequently.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Parties to the dispute</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       See Toh was at the material
                    time a service engineer with Norsk Marine Electronic, and
                    was engaged by TCH Marine Pte Ltd (“TCH
                    Marine”) as an independent contractor to service the
                    radar on board its tugboat <em>Fortune
                        II</em>. Up till the time of the accident, See Toh
                    had for about 26 years been attending vessels about once to
                    thrice a week to repair and maintain radar
                equipment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       
          <em>Fortune
                        II</em> was at the material time used by TCH
                    Marine to tow the barge <em>Namthong
                        27</em>, also owned by TCH Marine, from 9/11
                    TBC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       9/11 TBC was at the material
                    time leased by the first defendant Ho Ah Lam Ferrocement
                    (Private) Limited (“HAL”) from Jurong Town
                    Corporation. HAL is in the business of building and
                    repairing ships and other ocean going vehicles. <em>Namthong 27</em> was at HAL’s
                    premises to collect wood chips to be delivered to TCH
                    Marine’s customer Biofuel Industries Pte Ltd
                    (“Biofuel”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The second defendant, Lal
                    Offshore Marine Pte Ltd (“Lal Offshore”), had
                    entered into a Cooperation Agreement with HAL dated
                    14 April 2007 (the “Cooperation
                    Agreement”). At the material time, Lal Offshore was
                    using part of 9/11 TBC to fabricate a set of living quarters
                    for Keppel FELS Ltd (“KFELS”) which would
                    eventually be delivered to an offshore oil
                rig.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       KFELS had in turn engaged
                    the third defendant, Asian Lift Pte Ltd (“Asian
                    Lift”), to take delivery of the living quarters at
                    9/11 TBC and bring it to the offshore oil rig. Asian Lift
                    decided to use a crane barge, <em>Asian
                        Hercules</em>, for this purpose.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The following witnesses were
                    called to testify at trial:</p>

                        adjacent to 9/11 TBC, <em>ie</em>,

                        At the time of the trial, he was no longer an employee

                        another crane barge, the <em>Smit
                            Typhoon</em>, owned by Asian
                    Lift.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">See Toh’s version of the facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       According to See Toh’s
                    version of the facts, he went first to 15 TBC on
                    13 February 2008 at about 3.30pm. He was there to
                    enquire about <em>Fortune
                    II</em>’s location because Andrew Tay had called
                    him, either on the morning of 13 February 2008 or the
                    day before, to check the radar on board <em>Fortune II</em>. See Toh believed that
                        <em>Fortune II</em> could be
                    located at 15 TBC because he had previously attended to
                    other vessels belonging to TCH Marine at 15 TBC.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> 15 TBC was
                    occupied by Catermas both presently and at the material
                    time. When See Toh went to the main office of Catermas, he
                    was informed by their manager (Puay Choon) that <em>Fortune II</em> was not berthed there but
                    was berthed next door.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       See Toh then left 15 TBC
                    through 15 TBC’s main gate and proceeded to enter what
                    he then thought was HAL’s gate but which was actually
                    a second gate of 15 TBC (“second gate”). The
                    second gate was a sliding gate whereas the main gate of 15
                    TBC was a swing gate. See Toh said that he did not know that
                    the gate through which he entered was 15 TBC’s second
                    gate because there was no sign outside the second
                        gate.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> Further,
                    he said that he saw some people, whom he believed were
                    workers, standing outside the second gate who told him to
                    look for <em>Fortune II</em> inside
                    without asking for his shipyard safety pass.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> The shipyard
                    safety pass is supposedly issued to everyone who has
                    attended a mandatory shipyard safety course for all workers
                    who want to enter or work in a shipyard. See Toh had
                    attended such a course.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     After entering the second
                    gate, See Toh then walked to the shore. He said there was a
                    tall fence (leading from the side of the second gate to the
                    shore). There were structures in front of the fence. After
                    the fence ended at the shore, there was an open space of
                    about five metres.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> Seeing that <em>Fortune II</em> was not one of the
                    several barges berthed along the shoreline, See Toh then
                    called Andrew Tay to verify <em>Fortune
                        II</em>’s location. Andrew Tay informed
                    See Toh that <em>Fortune II</em>
                    was in that area, but did not specifically inform
                    See Toh of the exact address where <em>Fortune II</em> was berthed. Andrew Tay also told
                    him that his supplier had gone to <em>Fortune
                        II</em> that day and he had no problem locating
                    the vessel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     After reaching the end of
                    the fence, See Toh said that he crossed through the space
                    between the end of the fence and the shoreline.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> When referred to a
                    photo in 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant’s
                    Bundle of Documents (“1DBD”) Vol 2 p 11
                    during cross-examination, See Toh said that the end of the
                    fence was a very low grey corrugated iron sheet (on the
                    right of the photo and not the larger blue and grey
                    corrugated iron sheet seen in the middle of the photo). That
                    photo and the other photos in 1DBD Vol 2 were taken on
                    29 August 2011 by Mr Nagaraja S Maniam, counsel for
                        HAL.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> I would add that the photos
                    taken by Mr Maniam and those found in 1DBD Vol 2 at
                    pp 1 and 3 show the fence (made of corrugated metal) as
                    seen from the side of 9/11 TBC and the huge cylindrical
                    structures on the side of 15 TBC which perhaps were the
                    structures See Toh had some difficulty
                describing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     See Toh’s evidence
                    on this point was different from the evidence of his own
                    witness Puay Choon who was a director of Catermas, the
                    occupier of 15 TBC at the material time. Puay Choon said
                    that the height of the fence at that time was the height of
                    the grey and blue one depicted in the middle of the photo
                    and not the height of the very low grey one depicted at the
                    right side of p 11.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> The length of the fence
                    was extended after the accident by two metres.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> Even then, a
                    person could still go around the extended fence especially
                    at low tide.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> Puay Choon said that the
                    distance from the second gate to the seashore was about 70
                        metres.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> Puay Choon also said
                    that the number “15” was painted on the left
                    of the second gate.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> The
                    size of that number was similar to the number
                    “15” shown in Exhibit P2 photo 5. Exhibit P2
                    was an email and a collection of five photos taken by Puay
                    Choon on 6 September 2011. It seemed to me that the
                    size of the number “15” was rather
                    large.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Puay Choon also said that
                    the main gate of 9/11 TBC was perpendicular to and less than
                    ten metres away from 15 TBC’s second gate. There was a
                    signboard with HAL’s name displayed beside the main
                    gate of 9/11 TBC which was elevated and facing the direction
                    of a public road.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     See Toh said that he did
                    not know that he had crossed into someone else’s
                        premises<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> and claimed that
                    he had never been to 9/11 TBC prior to the date of the
                    accident. However, he conceded during cross-examination that
                    it was his duty to check if he had crossed into someone
                    else’s premises.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> After entering 9/11
                    TBC, See Toh continued walking a short distance along the
                    shore when he saw a barge. While See Toh claimed in para 12
                    of his affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”)
                    that he did not know the name of the barge as he could not
                    see its name, he eventually said during cross-examination
                    that he did see the name of the barge, being <em>Namthong 27</em>.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     See Toh said he then saw
                    two Chinese men standing on the shore next to <em>Namthong 27</em>’s ramp which was
                    lowered down onto the shore at the material time. He saw a
                    thick metal cable lying on the shore very close to those two
                    Chinese men and near the ramp of <em>Namthong
                        27</em>. However, when See Toh made a drawing of
                    the relative positions of the Chinese men, the metal cable,
                    the ramp and himself (Exhibit P3) at trial, he drew the
                    metal cable as lying across a small part of the ramp. See
                    Toh claimed that he did not know what the thick metal cable
                    was used for and he did not see the cable being attached to
                    anything on the shore. He also observed that the thick metal
                    cable was not stressed, that is, it was not under great
                    tension and was not vibrating. This thick metal cable was
                    referred to by all counsel as “the mooring
                    wire” (of <em>Asian
                        Hercules</em>) and I will use that same
                    description. See Toh also said he did not notice <em>Asian Hercules</em>, notwithstanding its
                    huge size which I will elaborate on later.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     When See Toh was about
                    five to six metres away from the men and the mooring wire,
                    he asked them whether <em>Fortune
                        II</em> was “up”
                    <em>Namthong 27</em>. The men, although
                    facing him, appeared not to have seen or heard him because
                    they were talking with each other and the place was very
                    noisy. Seeing that there was no warning sign, cordon, or
                    anyone there giving him any warning, See Toh decided to walk
                    towards <em>Namthong 27</em>’s
                    ramp to take a look. However, when he was about two metres
                    away from the ramp and had just taken one or two steps
                    towards the ramp, he suddenly heard a loud bang and felt
                    himself being hit by what he believed was the thick metal
                    cable he earlier saw on the shoreline. See Toh only found
                    out after the accident that the thick metal cable was
                    actually <em>Asian Hercules</em>’
                    mooring wire. See Toh said that he was still standing on the
                    shore of 9/11 TBC and not on the ramp when he was hit. After
                    being hit by the mooring wire, See Toh fell to the ground
                    face up, and could not move his body. His mouth was also
                    covered with blood and he was only able to speak very slowly
                    and weakly as he was seriously injured.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> Shortly
                    after, an ambulance was called to take See Toh to a
                    hospital.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">HAL’s version of the facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     According to HAL’s
                    version of the facts, Lal Offshore had completed the
                    fabrication of a living quarters structure for KFELS prior
                    to 13 February 2008. KFELS had engaged Asian Lift to
                    take delivery of the living quarters, and Asian Lift had
                    sent <em>Asian Hercules</em> to 9/11
                    TBC to lift the structure and carry it back to KFELS’
                    yard first.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Sun Kiang said that HAL
                    and its servants and agents did not give permission to See
                    Toh to enter 9/11 TBC and that HAL had no knowledge of See
                    Toh’s exact location until the accident occurred and
                    was reported to HAL. Further, Sun Kiang said that at all
                    material times, the main gate to 9/11 TBC was closed in
                    accordance with his instruction<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span>
                    and the premises of 9/11 TBC was fenced off by a fence which
                    ran three sides of the perimeter of 9/11 TBC leaving only
                    the seafront unfenced. Visitors to 9/11 TBC had to go
                    through a security check-point at HAL’s main gate
                    before being allowed into the premises. HAL had hired guards
                    to guard the premises of 9/11 TBC. Sun Kiang also said in
                    his AEIC that although the premises of 9/11 TBC had been
                    fenced up to the area at the seashore, access into 9/11 TBC
                    could still be gained from the seashore.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> Sun Kiang
                    agreed that HAL did not place employees to guard the area
                    around the seashore and had not put any warning sign at or
                    near the seashore about the lifting operations.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> However,
                    Sun Kiang did explain that HAL had people all around the
                    premises generally and that they would report any suspicious
                    characters seen.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> Sun Kiang said that
                    safety supervision of 9/11 TBC at the time of the operations
                    was Chua’s responsibility.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Although Chua was the
                    Project Manager of Lal Offshore, he was giving evidence for
                    HAL. Chua was aware that access into 9/11 TBC could be
                    gained through the seashore after the end of the fence
                    (“the Seafront Access Point”). However, Chua
                    said that this access point was not under his control and
                    that he did not place anyone at the Seafront Access Point
                    because it was a dangerous area.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> He did not
                    elaborate whether the area was dangerous because of the
                    intended lifting operation or some other
                reason.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Before the lifting
                    operation commenced, Chua had also, on Sun Kiang’s
                    instructions, set up a barricade comprising one row of metal
                    stands with safety tape running through to alert people
                    coming from the back end of the premises not to cross into
                    the seafront end of the premises where the lifting operation
                    would take place.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> Chua had positioned
                    himself at the barricade to ensure that none of HAL’s
                    or Lal Offshore’s workers would enter the lifting
                    operation site. Chua further said that, besides himself, no
                    other worker from HAL or Lal Offshore had been present at
                    the site where the lifting was to take place. He had
                    instructed all other workers of HAL and Lal Offshore to stop
                    work and to stand behind the barricade. He had also
                    instructed the guard at the entrance to 9/11 TBC to stop
                    anyone from entering.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     After arriving at the
                    shoreline of 9/11 TBC, the crew of <em>Asian
                        Hercules</em> intended to affix two metal mooring
                    wires from <em>Asian Hercules</em> to
                    bollards on the shore of 9/11 TBC. While the crew of
                        <em>Asian Hercules</em> were in the
                    process of mooring the first mooring wire to a bollard
                    onshore, the mooring wire got stuck at the ramp of <em>Namthong 27</em>. The crew of Asian Lift
                    used the word “fouled”, which I will adopt to
                    describe a stuck mooring wire. According to Chua, one crew
                    member of <em>Asian Hercules</em>,
                    Songyot, then went to free the fouled wire with a crowbar
                    and it was at this time that Chua suddenly noticed See Toh
                    walking into 9/11 TBC from the direction of the seafront on
                    Chua’s right. He said See Toh was walking inwards in
                    the direction of the barricade, <em>ie</em>, away from the sea.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> Chua said that he
                    immediately shouted repeatedly and loudly in the Hokkien
                    dialect for See Toh to run but did not gesticulate to him to
                    do so. However, See Toh continued walking towards the
                    barricade. The mooring wire then suddenly sprung up in See
                    Toh’s direction and hit him. Chua initially stated in
                    his AEIC that the impact of the blow flung See Toh
                    forward, causing See Toh to land on the ground. However, he
                    later amended his AEIC to say that the impact of the blow
                    had flung See Toh backwards instead.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Lal Offshore’s version of the
                facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     I come now to Lal
                    Offshore’s version. Vijelal agreed that Lal Offshore
                    had finished fabrication works of a living quarters
                    structure for KFELS and that KFELS had engaged Asian Lift to
                    lift and transport the structure from 9/11 TBC to
                    KFELS’ yard on 13 February 2008. Asian Lift was
                    using <em>Asian Hercules</em>. Vijelal
                    said that Lal Offshore and its servants and agents were not
                    supposed to be involved in the lifting operation and that
                    the crew of Asian Lift conducted the lifting
                    operation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Vijelal said that the
                    premises of 9/11 TBC was at all material times under the
                    control and management of HAL, being the tenants and
                    occupiers of 9/11 TBC, and that Lal Offshore, as mere
                    licensees of HAL conducting marine fabrication works in a
                    demarcated site of 9/11, had no control and management of
                    9/11 TBC. Vijelal also said that Lal Offshore had no
                    knowledge of See Toh’s presence at the material time.
                    He had believed that See Toh was at 9/11 TBC in connection
                    with works carried out by HAL because <em>Namthong 27</em> was being repaired by HAL at
                    9/11 TBC at the material time. However, this belief turned
                    out to be incorrect. See Toh later explained the purpose of
                    his presence at 9/11 TBC, as stated above, and this part of
                    See Toh’s evidence was not challenged by
                    anyone.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Vijelal also said that Lal
                    Offshore had barricaded three sides of the living quarters
                    structure to keep workers away from the lifting operation,
                    leaving only the side facing the seafront unfenced, and that
                    the waterfront and the berthing facilities there were at all
                    material times controlled and managed by HAL. However, the
                    former piece of evidence was incorrect. According to Chua,
                    he had arranged to barricade only one side in order to stop
                    those not involved in the lifting operation from entering
                    the area of the lifting operation. Chua’s evidence on
                    this point was not disputed by anyone.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Asian Lift’s version of the facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     I come now to Asian
                    Lift’s version of the facts. Asian Lift alleged that
                    after receiving instructions from KFELS and a copy of the
                    lifting concept for the lifting operation of the living
                    quarters structure, <em>Asian
                        Hercules</em> left Tuas Finger Pier West and
                    berthed at 9/11 TBC at about 3.00pm on 13 February
                    2008. Upon arrival at 9/11 TBC, <em>Asian
                        Hercules</em> had to be securely moored and
                    positioned for the lifting operation by, <em>inter alia</em>, attaching the starboard forward
                    and port forward mooring wires to bollards onshore. I shall
                    refer to this portion of activity as the mooring operation.
                    I will refer to the areas of the mooring and the intended
                    lifting operation as the “Operations
                    Site”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     With its boom lifted up,
                        <em>Asian Hercules</em> is about
                    100 metres high. A brochure with its specifications can be
                    found at Agreed Bundle pp 153A to 156A. Puay Choon said that
                    the boom was still high before the accident.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> He could see
                    the crane barge from his office at 15 TBC which was used to
                    allow parking on the first level. He could also see it from
                    ground level. He described it as “a very big
                    structure, very towering”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span>
                    According to Asian Lift, the mooring wire (see Exhibit 3D2)
                    is 32 millimetres in diameter and heavy. It requires six or
                    seven men to carry it from the shore to the relevant
                        bollard.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Captain Hamid and
                    Dzainudin were at all material times standing at the mooring
                    console of the bridge of the <em>Asian
                        Hercules</em>. Dzainudin was the one operating the
                    controls of the winching device on Captain Hamid’s
                    instructions. Both said that they did not have a constant
                    direct line of sight of the starboard mooring wire which was
                    lying across part of the loading ramp of <em>Namthong 27</em>. Thus, Captain Hamid had given
                    clear instructions to the crew of both KFELS and Lal
                    Offshore that the Operations Site must be cleared of all
                    personnel and obstruction. Captain Hamid had also instructed
                    about seven to eight crew members of <em>Asian Hercules</em>, including Songyot, to go
                    onshore to coordinate the mooring and lifting operations and
                    to ensure that the Operations Site was clear. Songyot was
                    also instructed to keep watch by the bollard to which the
                    starboard mooring wire of <em>Asian
                        Hercules</em> was tied (“Bollard A”)
                    and ensure that the area around Bollard A was clear of
                    personnel. Songyot was also the only on-shore crew member
                    holding onto a handheld walkie-talkie device. He was
                    standing near <em>Namthong
                    27</em>’s ramp to watch over the mooring wire
                    and to have Captain Hamid stop the winching process should
                    the mooring wire get fouled in the ramp.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     After looping the end of
                        <em>Asian Hercules</em>’
                    starboard mooring wire around Bollard A and seeing that the
                    area around Bollard A was clear of personnel, Songyot
                    notified Captain Hamid by way of handheld walkie-talkies
                    held by both of them that the mooring area was clear.
                    Captain Hamid then instructed Dzainudin to start tensioning
                    the mooring wire. About five minutes later, Songyot noticed
                    that the starboard mooring wire, which was lying across part
                    of <em>Namthong 27</em>’s ramp,
                    was fouled on the ramp. Songyot then informed Captain Hamid
                    that the mooring wire was fouled on the ramp. Captain Hamid
                    then instructed Dzainudin to stop winching the mooring wires
                    and instructed Songyot to clear the fouled mooring
                    wire.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Songyot said that he went
                    over to the fouled wire and cleared it using his hands. It
                    was at this time that Songyot saw See Toh walking along the
                    shoreline from outside 9/11 TBC towards <em>Namthong 27</em>. Songyot then shouted and told
                    See Toh to stop and not proceed further because there was a
                    wire and it was dangerous. See Toh then told Songyot that he
                    wanted to go onto the barge (<em>ie</em>,<em>Namthong
                        </em><em>27</em>) to check it
                    anyway, but stopped moving towards the barge after Songyot
                    warned him a second time. Seeing that See Toh had
                    stopped moving forward towards the barge, Songyot then
                    focused his attention towards the living quarters structure
                    to ensure that the lifting operation was proceeding
                    properly. When he turned his attention back to See Toh
                    about less than five minutes later, Songyot saw See Toh
                    standing on <em>Namthong
                    27</em>’s ramp, and he also noticed that the
                    mooring wire had become fouled on the ramp a second time.
                    Within a split second, the fouled wire became free due to
                    the momentum of <em>Asian Hercules</em>
                    moving forward, and the wire hit See Toh. Songyot elaborated
                    that the wire hit See Toh in the stomach causing See Toh to
                    bend over the wire. See Toh was then swung out over the sea
                    and then brought back when he landed on the
                        shore.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">See Toh’s main claims</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     See Toh claimed that all
                    three defendants were negligent. See Toh also claimed that
                    HAL and Lal Offshore were in breach of their duty of care
                    owed by each of them as occupier of the Operations Site. As
                    can be seen, See Toh’s claim against HAL and Lal
                    Offshore assumed that a claim in negligence is different
                    from a claim on the basis of occupier’s liability and
                    that both such claims can be made
                concurrently.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     HAL and Lal Offshore
                    denied liability for both negligence and for
                    occupiers’ liability while Asian Lift denied liability
                    for negligence. All three defendants alleged contributory
                    negligence on the part of the other parties as an
                    alternative defence. Asian Lift also relied on the defence
                    of a time limitation under s 8(1) of the Maritime
                    Conventions Act 1911 (Cap. IA3, 2004 Rev Ed)
                    (“MCA”).</p>

                    conclusion on the facts as they are likely to have a

                    with the applicable law and then apply the applicable law to
                    the facts.</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether Namthong 27 is a “ship”
                under the MCA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Unlike most typical ships,
                        <em>Namthong 27</em> is a flat top
                    barge which is unable to self-propel and has to be tugged by
                    tugboats like <em>Fortune II</em>. The
                    MCA provides no definition of a “ship”, but s
                    2(1) of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 2002 Rev Ed)
                    provides that a “‘ship’ includes every
                    description of vessel used in navigation not exclusively
                    propelled by oars or paddles”. Since it is clear that
                        <em>Namthong 27</em> is not
                    exclusively propelled by oars or paddles, the operative
                    phrase to be contended with is whether <em>Namthong 27</em> is “used in
                    navigation”. There are no helpful authorities in
                    Singapore interpreting this term, so I refer to authorities
                    in the UK interpreting the equivalent of the
                MCA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     In <em>Steedman v Scofield</em> [1992] 2 Lloyd's Rep 163
                    at 166, Sheen J was of the view that the phrase “used
                    in navigation” as understood in the Merchant Shipping
                    Act 1995, which contains a limitation section substantially
                    similar to s 8(1) MCA, “conveys the concept of
                    transporting persons or property by water to an intended
                    destination.” Since <em>Namthong
                        27</em> was constructed for navigation at the
                    material time (though not being to navigate on her own) and
                    it was meant to transport wood chips for Biofuel from one
                    port to another,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> I find that it is a
                    vessel “used in navigation” and may be a
                    “ship” within the meaning of s 8(1) of the
                    MCA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Is <em>Namthong 27</em>’s inability to self-propel
                    fatal to its classification as a “ship” within
                    s 8(1) MCA? I do not think so. The learned authors of
                    Halsbury’s Singapore, vol 17(2) (Shipping Law) at para
                    220.0058 state that “it is not necessary that a ship
                    is able to propel itself or navigate under its own power. A
                    ship may therefore be a ‘dumb’ barge, that is, a
                    barge without an engine”. This was also the view
                    taken by the Irish Supreme Court in <em>The
                        Von Rocks</em> [1998] 2 Lloyd's Rep 198 which held
                    that “[t]he preponderance of judicial opinion would
                    support the view that, provided the craft was built to do
                    something on water and, for the purpose of carrying out that
                    work, was so designed and constructed as to be capable of
                    traversing significant water surfaces and did in fact
                    regularly so traverse them, it is capable of being
                    classified as a ‘ship’, despite the absence of
                    any form of self-propulsion or steering mechanism, such as a
                    rudder.” Therefore, I find that a dumb barge like
                        <em>Namthong 27</em> is a
                    “ship” under s 8(1) MCA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether See Toh was standing on the ramp of
                Namthong 27 when the mooring wire hit him</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Having found that the
                    barge <em>Namthong 27</em> is a
                    “ship” under the MCA, I have to next consider
                    if the injuries suffered by See Toh were inflicted when he
                    was on board <em>Namthong 27</em>, or
                    more specifically, on board the ramp of <em>Namthong 27</em> which is affixed to the vessel.
                    It was accepted by both See Toh and Asian Lift that if See
                    Toh was on that ramp, then he would have been on board
                        <em>Namthong 27</em> for the
                    purpose of s 8(1) MCA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     On the one hand, See Toh
                    said that he was not on the ramp when he got hit by the
                        <em>Asian Hercules</em>' mooring
                    wire. This was the position taken in his first statement of
                    claim. I note that See Toh subsequently amended his
                    statement of claim to include the possibility of him being
                    at the shore “and/or on a barge” (Statement of
                    Claim Amendment No 1), but this added portion was then
                    removed in the Statement of Claim (Amendment No 2) after
                    See Toh had received Asian Lift’s statement of
                    defence pleading the limitation defence in s 8(1) MCA.
                    During the cross-examination of See Toh by counsel for Asian
                    Lift, counsel suggested that the only reason why the words
                    “and/or on a barge” were deleted was because
                    Asian Lift applied to strike out See Toh’s claim
                    by relying on the limitation period in s 8(1) MCA.
                    See Toh explained that the words “and/or on a
                    barge” were added to his Statement of Claim
                    (Amendment No 1) by his counsel and not at his own
                        instance,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> and that See Toh at
                    the outset never claimed that he was on the ramp of
                        <em>Namthong 27</em> when he was
                    hit by the mooring wire (as evidenced by his initial
                    statement of claim). See Toh also said during
                    cross-examination that the addition of the words
                    “and/or on a barge” to his Statement of Claim
                    (Amendment No 1) was to cover the possibility that he was on
                        <em>Namthong 27</em> when he was
                    hit by the <em>Asian
                    Hercules</em>’ mooring wire.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span>
                    See Toh’s explanation for this was that a medical
                    report from Tan Tock Seng Hospital (“the TTSH
                    Report”) relied on by Asian Lift seemed to have
                    stated that See Toh was on <em>Namthong
                        27</em>’s ramp when he was hit.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Besides relying on the
                    pleadings of See Toh, Asian Lift relied on other evidence to
                    establish See Toh’s location when he was
                hit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Its witness, Songyot,
                    testified that he saw See Toh standing at the fourth or
                    fifth rung of the ramp when the mooring wire hit See
                        Toh.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Songyot also testified
                    that See Toh was on the extreme right of the ramp. As
                    mentioned at <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a> above,
                    he said he saw the mooring wire spring up and hit See Toh in
                    the stomach which caused See Toh’s body to bend over
                    the wire. The wire brought See Toh out towards the sea
                    and then brought him back. See Toh then fell onto the
                    shore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Asian Lift also sought to
                    rely on various documentary reports made in relation to the
                    accident which they submit corroborates Songyot’s

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     These were included in the
                    parties' agreed bundle (see AB2-AB9). Counsel for Asian Lift
                    submitted that these reports either suggested expressly or
                    impliedly that See Toh was on the ramp of <em>Namthong 27</em> when he got hit. The relevant
                    excerpts from the reports are as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_43-p2_a"></a>(a)     In the Police
                        Report (at AB 2): “Just as I was stepping on the
                        first step of the ram[p] leading to the ship, I heard a
                        loud bang and all of a sudden, I felt something hit onto
                        me &amp; I fell backwards”. I should mention that
                        the Police Report mentioned only a ship by the name of
                            <em>Fortune II</em>. One might
                        think that the “ramp leading to the ship”
                        in the relevant sentence was a reference to the ramp of
                            <em>Fortune II</em> but, on the
                        undisputed facts before me, the only relevant ramp was
                        the ramp of <em>Namthong 27</em>.
                        It seemed to me that at the time See Toh made this
                        report, he still had not realised that the barge was
                            <em>Namthong 27</em>. Although
                        he said in cross-examination during the trial that he
                        saw the name of <em>Namthong
                            27</em> on the side of the barge before the
                        accident, I noted his hesitancy before giving this
                        evidence. He also muttered that the letters of the name
                        were so big before giving this evidence. It seemed to me
                        that he wanted to say that he did not notice the name
                        (and indeed that was what he had said in para 17 of his
                        AEIC) but when he realised (from a photo at AB 161A) how
                        big the letters and numbers of “<em>Namthong 27</em>” were on the
                        barge, he felt that it would be foolish for him to say
                        that he did not notice. Hence, he then said that he did
                        notice the name when in fact he did
                    not.</p>

                        fell backwards while walking on a
                    ramp”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     See Toh initially said
                    that each of the sentences (in the various reports) which
                    were relied upon by Asian Lift was incorrect.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_a"></a>(a)     For the Police
                        Report, he said that the relevant sentence should read
                        that he was “walking towards the
                            ramp”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_b"></a>(b)     For the NUH
                        Report, he said that the relevant sentence should read
                        that he was hit by a cable “on the way to the
                        ship” or “on the way to work on the
                            ship”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_c"></a>(c)     For the TTSH
                        Report, he said that the relevant sentence should read
                        as his “travelling towards the ship
                            ramp”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_d"></a>(d)     For the Ambulance
                        Report, he did not elaborate on what the relevant
                        sentence should read.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Then on the next day of
                    cross-examination, he pointed out that for the Police
                    Report, the relevant sentence stated “Just as I was
                    stepping on the first step…”. According to See
                    Toh, this did not mean that he had already stepped onto the
                        ramp.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     See Toh also said that the
                    account of the accident given to the ambulance crew which
                    conveyed him to the hospital was given when he was in a
                    state of serious injury and that his speech was temporarily
                    impaired because of the tongue laceration he had suffered
                    from the accident.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     I will deal first with the
                    four reports which Asian Lift was relying on.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     As mentioned above, See
                    Toh appeared eventually to accept that the relevant sentence
                    in the Police Report was a correct record of what he had
                    said but his point was that it did not assist Asian Lift. I
                    agree that the relevant sentence therein did not
                    unequivocally place See Toh on the ramp before he was
                    hit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     As for the sentences in
                    the other three reports, it was not clear whether See Toh
                    accepted that he was the source of the information contained
                    therein and that the reports correctly reflected what he had
                    said but that he had made a mistake, or that he disputed
                    that he was the source, or that he disputed the accuracy of
                    what he had allegedly said, if he was the source.
                    Unfortunately, no proper clarification was sought from him.
                    Furthermore, if he was the source of the information, the
                    persons who obtained the information from him were not
                    called to give evidence. Counsel for Asian Lift appeared to
                    have assumed that it was sufficient to tender reports
                    without requiring the person who recorded the reports to
                    give evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     In this regard, I would
                    like to take the opportunity to remind solicitors that
                    documents included in the parties' agreed bundle only show
                    that parties have agreed to the authenticity, but not the
                    accuracy or truth of the contents therein. If the contents
                    of a report are disputed then the evidence of the persons
                    who actually wrote the contents in the report should be
                    obtained.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Here, See Toh was
                    disputing the accuracy of the relevant sentences in the
                    other three reports. It does not help Asian Lift to say that
                    the reports were disclosed by See Toh himself. He may
                    have sought to rely on them for other aspects of his
                    claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     In the circumstances, I
                    give no weight to the relevant sentences of the other three
                    reports even if the reports are admissible in evidence by
                    virtue of their being included in an agreed bundle of
                    documents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     As for See Toh’s
                    pleadings, I am of the view that the first amendment in his
                    statement of claim to include the possibility that he might
                    have been on <em>Namthong 27</em> by
                    the words “and/or on a barge” was done with
                    See Toh’s consent. Nevertheless, I am of the view that
                    the amendment was done more as a matter of caution in case
                    See Toh was already standing on that barge at the time of
                    the accident. The relevant clause read that “[See
                    Toh] was at 9 and/or 11 Tuas Basin Close <u>and/or on a barge</u> or thereabouts”.
                    There was still no unequivocal assertion as to where he was.
                    See Toh and his solicitors must have thought that they were
                    being careful to include that amendment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Unfortunately, the
                    amendment backfired. It gave Asian Lift a chance to rely on
                    a limitation defence and to apply to strike out the claim
                    against Asian Lift. I agree that it was because of Asian
                    Lift’s application to strike out that See Toh then
                    amended his Statement of Claim to take out the phrase
                    “and/or on a barge” that he had
                    inserted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Nevertheless, the earlier
                    insertion was not unequivocal as I have said.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     I come now to
                    Songyot’s evidence that See Toh was standing on the
                    fourth or fifth rung of the ramp when See Toh was hit by a
                    mooring wire.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Ironically, this time it
                    was the initial defence filed by Asian Lift on
                    27 October 2010 that worked against it. The material
                    part of para 3 of the initial defence stated,
                    “Despite the warnings, [See Toh] failed to heed the
                    said warnings and attempted to and/or continued to attempt
                    crossing the mooring lines and fell off the barge into the
                    sea”. Significantly, there was no mention then that
                    See Toh had been hit by a mooring wire. Asian Lift’s
                    current defence, <em>ie</em>, Defence
                    (Amendment No 2), accepts that See Toh was hit by a mooring
                    wire from <em>Asian Hercules</em>. No
                    reason was given as to why the initial defence omitted
                    mentioning that See Toh was hit by a mooring wire if indeed
                    Songyot saw See Toh being hit by the mooring wire. The
                    omission is even more glaring when the case for Asian Lift
                    is that Captain Hamid had prepared an incident report dated
                    13 February 2008, <em>ie</em>, the
                    date of the accident, in which the cause of the accident was
                    stated on the first page to be “Hit by mooring
                    wire”. Captain Hamid’s report was based on what
                    Songyot had allegedly told him. Furthermore, how is it that
                    the initial defence stated that See Toh had fallen off the
                    barge and into the sea when he did not fall into the sea? I
                    also find Songyot’s oral evidence of the mooring wire
                    hitting See Toh in the stomach, causing See Toh to bend
                    over the mooring wire and being swung out to an area over
                    the sea and bringing See Toh back quite incredible. I note
                    that See Toh suffered no injuries to his abdominal area and
                    this account was not even posed to See Toh or to Chua.
                    It was an embellishment that Songyot suddenly came up with.
                    Indeed, the allegation in para 3 of the Defence (Amendment)
                    No 2 of Asian Lift is that the mooring wire whipped See Toh
                    in the chest and not in the stomach. The only witness for
                    Asian Lift who had allegedly seen the accident was Songyot.
                    In my view, he did not even notice See Toh before or when
                    the mooring wire hit him. In fear that he or his employers
                    might be blamed for the accident, he conjured up a story
                    about how he initially saw See Toh and asked him to stop and
                    that he then later saw See Toh on the ramp and how See Toh
                    was hit by the mooring wire. He was not a reliable witness
                    and I reject his evidence in respect of See
                Toh.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     The burden of proof is on
                    Asian Lift to establish that See Toh was already standing on
                    the ramp when he was hit. In my view, it failed to discharge
                    this burden. Hence, the time bar defence
                fails.</p>

                        coming lawfully there, then he is an 'occupier' and the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     One instance where a party
                    could have sufficient degree of control to make it an
                    occupier of premises is when it has the power of permitting
                    or prohibiting the entry of other persons into the premises
                    (see <em>Wheat</em> at 578-579 and
                        <em>Chandran a/l Subbiah v Dockers Marine
                        Pte Ltd (Owners of the Ship or Vessel "Tasman Mariner",

                    (HC) at [35]). In
                    the present action, it is not disputed that aside from the
                    crew members of KFELS and the <em>Asian
                        Hercules</em>, no other employee of HAL or Lal
                    Offshore was present at the Operations Site save for Chua,
                    the project manager of Lal Offshore. It was Chua who
                    instructed the other employees of HAL and Lal Offshore to
                    keep behind the barricade set up to cordon off the
                    Operations Site, and it was Chua who instructed HAL’s
                    guard at 9/11 TBC’s main entrance to prevent anyone
                    entering 9/11 TBC once the lifting operation
                        commenced.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span> In these
                    circumstances, I find that Lal Offshore was an occupier of
                    the Operations Site at the material time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Even though HAL did not
                    have its supervisors at the Operations Site and thus did not
                    have immediate supervision and control over who could or
                    could not enter the Operations Site, I still have to
                    consider if HAL was a co-occupier of the Operations Site
                    because the power to prohibit entry is not determinative of
                    the legal status of occupier in and of itself, that is, the
                    absence of immediate supervision and control does not
                    necessarily lead to the cessation of duty as an occupier in
                    law: see <em>Amus bin Pangkong v Jurong

                        [28]-[29].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     In <em>Jurong Shipyard</em>, the appellant worker was
                    employed by the second respondent (“the
                    employer”) to carry out blastering work in a tank of
                    a vessel at the shipyard of the first respondent
                    (“shipyard owner”). The shipyard owner had
                    subcontracted the blastering work to the employer. While
                    carrying out blastering work on a scaffolding platform about
                    9.5 metres from the bottom of the tank, the worker
                    accidentally fell to the bottom of the tank and suffered
                    injuries. He then claimed damages for personal injuries
                    suffered as a result of, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, the negligence of the shipyard owner
                    and/or the employer. The District Court in <em>Jurong Shipyard</em> found that although
                    the shipyard owner was an occupier of the shipyard itself,
                    it could not be considered an occupier of the interior of
                    the tank because it did not have control over the conditions
                    within the tank. However, on appeal to the High Court, Lai
                    Siu Chiu J found that the shipyard owner was also an
                    occupier of the interior of the tank because, as an owner of
                    the shipyard, the owner must have had some degree of control
                    and interest over the works on vessels in its shipyard.
                    Further, the shipyard owner was ultimately responsible for
                    approving the erection of the necessary
                scaffolding.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     In <em>Shun
                        Shing Construction</em>, the plaintiff was injured
                    when an uncompleted site office at a construction site
                    collapsed onto him. The construction site belonged to the
                    Housing and Development Board ("HDB"), which had awarded the
                    construction contract in relation to the site to the
                    defendant main contractors, Shun Shing. Shun Shing had in
                    turn subcontracted the whole of the construction works to
                    Sources Construction Pte Ltd (“Sources”),
                    Sources had in turn subcontracted the carpentry works to
                    Hood Seng Construction Engineering (“Hood
                    Seng”), and Hood Seng had in turn subcontracted part
                    of the carpentry works to Quick Start Construction
                    (“Quick Start”). The plaintiff then commenced
                    a suit against HDB, Shun Shing, and Quick Start, claiming
                    damages for personal injury caused by, <em>inter alia</em>, the defendants’
                    negligence. Lim Teong Qwee JC found that Shun Shing had a
                    sufficient degree of control over the whole of the
                    construction site including the part where the site office
                    was under construction notwithstanding that the
                    subcontractors (Sources, Hood Seng, and Quick Start) might
                    also have had some degree of control over that part of the
                    construction site. This was because Shun Shing (a) had
                    possession of the construction site, (b) had its supervisors
                    at the site and (c) further had an interest in the
                    construction of the site office because (i) the site office
                    was part of the main contract works, (ii) Shun Shing would
                    be paid for the works, and (iii) Shun Shing’s
                    professional engineer was required by HDB to supervise the
                    construction and submit a Certificate of Supervision upon
                    completion of the works.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     From the cases of
                        <em>Jurong Shipyard</em> and
                        <em>Shun Shing Construction</em>,
                    it can be seen that even where a party has no immediate
                    control over the section of premises where an accident
                    occurred, some form of general control over the premises
                    coupled with an interest in the activity that is taking
                    place at the accident site is sufficient to make the party
                    an “occupier” for the purposes of determining
                    occupiers’ liability. In the present action, I find
                    that HAL was also an occupier of the Operations Site despite
                    not having immediate supervision and control over the site.
                    First, it is not disputed that at the material time HAL had
                    the power of permitting or prohibiting the entry of other
                    persons into the premises of 9/11 TBC generally. Visitors to
                    9/11 TBC had to go through a security check-point manned by
                    HAL’s security guards before being allowed in. Indeed,
                    even though Sun Kiang was not present at the Operations Site
                    on the day of the accident, he had retained some degree of
                    control via instructions to Chua. Sun Kiang had given
                    instructions to HAL’s employees to clear the
                    Operations Site when <em>Asian
                        Hercules</em> arrived, and had further given
                    instructions to barricade the Operations Site, to clear the
                    Operations Site, and to close the main gate of 9/11 TBC when
                        <em>Asian Hercules</em> arrived.
                    Secondly, like the shipyard owners in <em>Jurong Shipyard</em>, HAL as lessees of 9/11 TBC
                    must have had some degree of control and interest over all
                    works in their premises, including the fabrication and
                    lifting of the living quarters structure.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     Thus, I find that both HAL
                    and Lal Offshore were co-occupiers of the Operations
                    Site.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether See Toh knowingly trespassed onto 9/11
                TBC and, if so, whether he had a reasonable excuse for doing
                so</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     See Toh eventually
                    admitted during the trial that he had trespassed onto 9/11
                    TBC but alleged that he did so unknowingly.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     See Toh claimed that after
                    he had left 15 TBC through 15 TBC’s main gate, he
                    proceeded to enter through the second gate. He then thought
                    that that was a gate of 9/11 TBC. See Toh claimed that he
                    did not know that that second gate was 15 TBC’s second
                    gate because there was no sign outside this gate to indicate
                    as such.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> See Toh claimed
                    that when he crossed over from 15 TBC to 9/11 TBC from the
                    Seafront Access Point, he did not realise that he was
                    crossing from one address to another. He still thought he
                    was on 9/11 TBC since he had thought that the gate he had
                    used was a gate of 9/11 TBC. However, as mentioned above (at
                        <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a>), Puay Choon
                    gave undisputed evidence at trial that the main gate of 9/11
                    TBC was perpendicular to and less than ten metres away from
                    15 TBC’s second gate. There was also a signboard with
                    HAL’s name displayed beside the main gate of 9/11 TBC
                    and the signboard was elevated and facing the direction of a
                    public road. Since See Toh said he had approached the second
                    gate from 15 TBC’s main gate by travelling along the
                    public road, I find it likely that he would have seen the
                    signboard showing HAL's name next to the main gate of 9/11
                    TBC. Furthermore, contrary to See Toh’s evidence, Puay
                    Choon said that there was a number “15” (which
                    was large in size) next to the second gate which I accept.
                    In my view, it was likely that See Toh would also have seen
                    this number and known that the second gate which he had gone
                    through was of 15 TBC and not 9/11 TBC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Also, as See Toh entered
                    the second gate and walked towards the shore, there was a
                    side fence made up of corrugated metal sheet which would
                    have been on the left side of See Toh. I accept Puay
                    Choon’s evidence that the height of the fence was not
                    as low as See Toh said it was. Puay Choon was a more steady
                    witness than See Toh. To be fair, much of the fence would
                    have been blocked by the huge cylindrical objects I
                    mentioned at <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a>
                        above.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span>
                    Nevertheless, See Toh did not say that he did not notice the
                    fence which he described as “tall” (see
                        <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a> above). Also,
                    he would still have seen the end of the fence at the
                    Seafront Access Point. He must have known that the fence was
                    demarcating two separate premises.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     It is significant that in
                    See Toh’s AEIC, his version was different from that of
                    his oral evidence at trial. In his AEIC, See Toh said that
                    he had gained access to the shore of 9/11 TBC through a gate
                    of 9/11 TBC. He did not say that he had entered through a
                    gate of 15 TBC thinking that it was a gate of 9/11 TBC.
                    Neither did he say in oral evidence that he had discovered
                    the true facts only after he had executed his AEIC. Instead,
                    he attempted to give a strained interpretation of his AEIC
                    on this point to show that it was consistent with his oral
                    evidence. I need not elaborate on his attempt except to say
                    that I found it wholly unconvincing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     In my view, See Toh had
                    realised that he could not substantiate the initial
                    allegation in his AEIC that he had entered 9/11 TBC lawfully
                    as there was evidence that the main gate of 9/11 TBC was
                    closed and the guard there had been told not to allow entry
                    into 9/11 TBC at the material time. So See Toh had to
                    reveal that he had entered 9/11 TBC from 15 TBC through the
                    second gate and then through the Seafront Access
                    Point.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     In closing submissions,
                    See Toh relied on the evidence of Sun Kiang who said during
                    cross-examination that he agreed that See Toh had entered
                    9/11 TBC unknowingly. This was a reference to Sun
                    Kiang’s evidence as recorded in the Notes of Evidence
                    of 9 September 2011 at p 76 lines 8 to 29 and at
                    p 77 lines 20 to 22. However, Sun Kiang had no personal
                    knowledge as to how See Toh in fact came to enter 9/11 TBC.
                    He was not even at 9/11 TBC at the time when See Toh entered
                    9/11 TBC. Furthermore, while Sun Kiang’s attention was
                    drawn during cross-examination to the absence of a signboard
                    at or near the Seafront Access Point, his attention was not
                    drawn to the actual route that See Toh had taken or the
                    factors I mentioned above at <a href="#p1_68">[68]</a> to <a href="#p1_70">[70]</a>. I gave little weight to the inference
                    that he was drawing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     After considering all the
                    evidence, I conclude that See Toh knew that he was entering
                    through a second gate of 15 TBC and not the gate of 9/11 TBC
                    and he knew that he was crossing over from 15 TBC to 9/11
                    TBC through the Seaside Access Point.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     In my view, See Toh was
                    anxious to get his job over and done with. He had already
                    been told by Puay Choon that <em>Fortune
                        II</em> was not at 15 TBC (see <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> above). As he left the main
                    gate of 15 TBC and headed towards 9/11 TBC, something must
                    have deterred him from entering through the main gate of
                    9/11 TBC. According to Sun Kiang, the gate of 9/11 TBC was
                    closed at that time to prevent access during the lifting
                    operation (see <a href="#p1_18">[18]</a>
                    above). If the gate was not closed, the guard there would
                    have stopped See Toh from entering 9/11 TBC as instructed by
                    Chua. It seemed to me that See Toh realised he had to wait.
                    Instead of waiting, he made a deliberate decision to enter
                    through the second gate, walked pass the corrugated iron
                    fence and then gained access into 9/11 TBC from 15 TBC
                    through the Seaside Access Point. Thereafter, he was hoping
                    to quickly locate <em>Fortune II</em>,
                    do his job, and then leave without further
                ado.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     Although See Toh did not
                    actually climb over the fence and instead went around it, he
                    was, in my view, akin to a trespasser who deliberately
                    climbed over a fence. I find that See Toh had knowingly and
                    unlawfully entered HAL's premises of 9/11 TBC as a
                    trespasser. He had no reasonable excuse for doing so. He
                    could and should have waited for the main gate of 9/11 TBC
                    to be opened and to be allowed to have access into 9/11
                    TBC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     As for the knowledge of
                    HAL and Lal Offshore, neither See Toh nor Andrew Tay
                    had sought the consent of HAL (or anyone else) for
                    See Toh to enter the premises to 9/11 TBC. However, I
                    also considered whether HAL and/or Lal Offshore knew that it
                    was likely that See Toh or others might use the Seafront
                    Access Point to enter 9/11 TBC. 9/11 TBC was a shipyard. It
                    was not a public venue. Neither was it situated near to a
                    public venue. Only adults who had some specific reason to be
                    there would be there. There was a side fence separating the
                    two. However, Mr Lawrence Lee, counsel for See Toh,
                    relied on the following evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     Firstly, Sun Kiang and
                    Chua were aware that people can enter 9/11 TBC through the
                    Seafront Access Point.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     Secondly, Puay Choon had
                    said that there had previously been a theft case where some
                    workers had brought something from 9/11 TBC into 15 TBC and
                    hid the item near a tower staircase at the seashore of 15
                    TBC. Although Puay Choon did not specifically say that the
                    thieves had used the Seafront Access Point, I am prepared,
                    for present purposes, to infer that that was what he
                    meant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     Thirdly, after Puay Choon
                    had learned about the accident, he had himself crossed over
                    to 9/11 TBC on the same day, by using the Seafront Access
                    Point, to see what had happened.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     Mr Lee then submitted, at
                    para 27 of his closing submission, that HAL and Lal Offshore
                    owed a duty of care to anyone, including See Toh, who might
                    enter 9/11 TBC through the Seafront Access
                Point.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     In my view, Mr Lee’s
                    submission was a quantum leap. He seemed to assume that the
                    evidence he was relying on was sufficient to establish that
                    HAL and Lal Offshore knew that it was likely that adults
                    would use the Seafront Access Point (and that such knowledge
                    alone would be sufficient to give rise to a duty of care).
                    In my view, the evidence only established that they knew
                    that such access was possible and perhaps, that it had been
                    used before, but not that it was frequently used. Indeed,
                    the evidence suggested that such access was seldom used. In
                    my view, neither HAL nor Lal Offshore knew that it was
                    likely that anyone would use the Seafront Access Point at
                    the material time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     As for the knowledge of
                    the crew of <em>Asian Hercules</em>, it
                    was the evidence of Captain Hamid that he had given
                    instructions through KFELS that the Operations Site must be
                    cleared of all personnel and obstruction.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span> This part of his evidence
                    was unchallenged. Therefore, in my view, Asian Lift did not
                    know that it was likely that someone else other than those
                    involved in the mooring and lifting operations would be
                    present at the material time.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether Songyot saw See Toh before the accident
                and shouted any warning to See Toh</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     Songyot said that after
                        <em>Asian Hercules</em>’ crew
                    members were sent to the shoreline of 9/11 TBC to moor the
                    mooring wires, he was instructed to keep watch by Bollard A
                    and ensure that the area around Bollard A was clear of
                    personnel. When the mooring wire first got fouled in
                        <em>Namthong 27</em>’s ramp,
                    Songyot said he went over to the fouled wire and cleared it
                    using his hands. Songyot claimed that it was at this time
                    that he saw See Toh walking along the shoreline from outside
                    9/11 TBC towards <em>Namthong 27</em>.
                    Songyot said that he then shouted and told See Toh to stop
                    and not proceed further because there was a wire and it was
                    dangerous.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     For the reasons stated at
                        <a href="#p1_57">[57]</a> above, I do not
                    believe that Songyot had seen See Toh on the day of the
                    accident before See Toh was hit by the mooring wire or
                    shouted any warning at him.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether Chua saw Songyot using a crowbar to
                remove a foul and whether Chua saw See Toh before the accident
                and shouted any warning to See Toh</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     Chua asserted that he had
                    noticed Songyot trying to remove the foul with a crowbar.
                    Upon seeing See Toh walk up from the shoreline in the
                    direction of the barricade, he shouted loudly in Hokkien at
                    See Toh for See Toh to run, but See Toh continued
                        walking.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span> Chua gave further
                    evidence that he had shouted about two or three times at See
                    Toh for him to run and that the time interval between the
                    shouting and See Toh being hit by the mooring wire was only
                    about two to three seconds.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span> However, Chua said
                    he did not gesticulate to See Toh. On the other hand, See
                    Toh’s evidence was that no one gave him any warning
                    when he was approaching <em>Namthong
                        27</em>’s ramp.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span> Chua’s
                    evidence was also in contrast to Songyot’s evidence
                    that he did not hear anyone other than himself shouting at
                    See Toh as See Toh was approaching <em>Namthong 27</em>’s ramp.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span>
                    Importantly, counsel for HAL failed to put or suggest to See
                    Toh or to Songyot that Chua had shouted two or three times
                    for See Toh to run away from the ramp when See Toh was
                    approaching it. It was also unlikely that Chua would have
                    shouted without any gesticulation bearing in mind that he
                    allegedly shouted more than once.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     Another related factual
                    dispute is whether or not the area around <em>Namthong 27</em>’s ramp was so noisy that
                    See Toh would not be able to hear any shouts directed at
                    him. When Mr Lee asked Chua whether the area around
                        <em>Namthong 27</em>’s ramp
                    was noisy at the material time, Chua replied that it was
                        not.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span> This was
                    corroborated by Songyot’s evidence during his
                    cross-examination that the area around <em>Namthong 27</em>’s ramp was not noisy at
                    the material time.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span> Both Chua’s
                    and Songyot’s evidence in this regard is in contrast
                    to See Toh’s evidence in his affidavit<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_52" id="Ftn_52_1"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span> and his
                    oral testimony in court<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_53" id="Ftn_53_1"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span> that the area was very noisy
                    at the material time although See Toh stopped short of
                    saying that it was too noisy to hear shouts. Unfortunately,
                    when See Toh was on the witness stand, both counsel for HAL
                    (for which Chua was a witness) and counsel for Asian Lift
                    (for which Songyot was a witness) again did not put these
                    conflicting claims to See Toh.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     In the light of the
                    evidence before me, I find that Chua did not shout at See
                    Toh to run from the danger created by the mooring wire. If
                    Chua did shout the alleged warnings, he would probably also
                    have gesticulated to See Toh to run but Chua said that
                    there was no gesticulation from him. Also, if Chua had
                    shouted some warnings, this would mean that he was alert to
                    the danger of the fouled mooring wire springing up. This
                    could possibly be explained if I accept that he saw Songyot
                    trying to clear the foul with a crowbar. However, it seems
                    strange to me that if Songyot was trying to do that, there
                    was no evidence from any person about Songyot’s
                    reaction when the mooring wire sprung up. Did Songyot move
                    backwards or sideways to avoid the mooring wire? Chua did
                    not say. Songyot himself did not give any evidence of such a
                    reaction because it was his evidence that he was not trying
                    to remove the foul then. In my view, HAL has failed to
                    establish that Chua had noticed Songyot trying to remove the
                    foul with a crowbar and that Chua had shouted warnings to
                    See Toh to run. In view of the unsatisfactory evidence from
                    Songyot and Chua, I am unable to conclude what caused the
                    mooring wire to spring up.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     Furthermore, Chua’s
                    evidence that he saw See Toh walking in the direction of the
                    barricade (see <a href="#p1_21">[21]</a>
                    above) was inconsistent with See Toh’s version
                    that See Toh was looking for <em>Fortune
                        II</em> and was walking towards the ramp of
                        <em>Namthong 27</em>. Indeed, all
                    counsel appeared to accept that See Toh was walking
                    towards the ramp. I am of the view that HAL has failed to
                    establish that Chua even saw See Toh before the accident
                    occurred.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">See Toh’s conduct</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     I come now to See
                    Toh’s conduct.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     See Toh was someone
                    familiar with the typical operations which might take place
                    at a shipyard. Prior to the date of the accident,
                    See Toh had attended a shipyard safety course which is
                    mandatory for all workers who enter or work in a shipyard.
                    Having attended vessels to repair their radar equipment for
                    many years, See Toh also agreed that he was familiar with
                    the safety precautions needed to be taken when embarking on
                    a vessel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     As mentioned above, I have
                    concluded that See Toh knowingly and without reasonable
                    excuse trespassed onto 9/11 TBC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     See Toh claimed that when
                    he was on the seafront of 9/11 TBC searching for <em>Fortune II</em>, he had seen a thick
                    metal cable (<em>Asian
                    Hercules</em>’ mooring wire) on the ground near
                        <em>Namthong 27</em>’s ramp.
                    However, he said that he did not see any bollard to which
                    the wire was tied and did not see <em>Asian
                        Hercules</em>.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_54" id="Ftn_54_1"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span> I find
                    that See Toh was not paying attention to his surroundings.
                    If he was, he would have noticed the crane barge. <em>Asian Hercules</em> was about
                        ten<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_55" id="Ftn_55_1"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span> to
                    twenty five<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_56" id="Ftn_56_1"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span> or
                        thirty<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_57" id="Ftn_57_1"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span> metres apart from
                        <em>Namthong 27</em>. Furthermore,
                        <em>Namthong 27</em>’s
                    sideboards were only about two to three metres tall when
                    measured from its deck<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_58" id="Ftn_58_1"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span> and were
                    not tall enough to block See Toh’s view of the
                        <em>Asian Hercules</em> from the
                    ground level. As mentioned at <a href="#p1_26">[26]</a> above, the crane barge (together with
                    the crane) was a very huge structure. Puay Choon said he
                    could see the crane barge from his office at 15 TBC and from
                    ground level.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_59" id="Ftn_59_1"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     Although See Toh said in
                    cross-examination that he did see the name of <em>Namthong 27</em> on that barge, this was
                    contrary to what he had said in his AEIC (see <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a> above). Indeed, as
                    mentioned in <a href="#p1_43">[43]</a> above,
                    I noticed that he changed his evidence in cross-examination
                    only because he saw how big the letters and numbers of
                        <em>Namthong 27</em> were. It seems
                    to me that he also did not notice that name because he was
                    not paying attention to his surroundings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     As regards the question
                    whether See Toh saw that the mooring wire was tied to
                    Bollard A, I accept his evidence that he did not see the
                    bollard. The bollard was situated further inland and was not
                    right at the shoreline. However, See Toh ought to have seen
                    the mooring wire extending from <em>Asian
                        Hercules</em>. If he was paying attention he would
                    have realised that the mooring wire was not just one loose
                    wire lying on the ground but was a mooring wire extended
                    from <em>Asian Hercules</em> which
                    might be looped over a bollard. If he was paying attention,
                    he would also have seen that the mooring wire was caught on
                    the ramp of <em>Namthong 27</em> and
                    been more careful to check to see if it was safe for him to
                    go near it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     Indeed, See Toh also ought
                    not to have entered 9/11 TBC through the Seafront Access
                    Point. He took this route knowing it was not the proper
                    route for entry into 9/11 TBC.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The applicable law in Singapore</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Law on Occupiers’ Liability</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     The law on
                    occupiers’ liability in Singapore is derived from
                    English common law prior to 1957 (as regards the duty to
                    lawful entrants) or 1984 (as regards the duty to
                    trespassers). In <em>Industrial Commercial
                        Bank Ltd v Tan Swa Eng</em> [1995]
                    2 SLR(R) 385 (“<em>Industrial Commercial Bank</em>”), the
                    Court of Appeal observed at [15]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The law on occupiers' liability in Singapore is
                        derived from English common law. However, legislation in
                        England has been passed which has made significant
                        changes to the common law. In Singapore, there is no
                        such parallel legislation, and the English statutes on
                        occupiers’ liability are not applicable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     The Court of Appeal,
                    however, did not specify the English statutes which have
                    made significant changes to the common law but which have no
                    parallel in Singapore legislation. In this regard, I find it
                    useful to refer to Michael Rutter’s <em>Occupiers’ Liability in Singapore and
                        Malaysia</em> (Butterworth &amp; Co (Asia):
                    Singapore, 1985) (“Rutter”). Rutter lists and
                    explains the various English statutes which have modified
                    the common law in England but which are not applicable in
                    Singapore under the <em>Application of
                        English Law Act</em> (Cap 7A,
                    1994 Rev Ed), s 4(1), and which find no
                    counterpart in Singapore (Rutter at pp 5-8). However, only
                    two pieces of legislation listed in Rutter’s book are
                    of relevance to the present dispute, namely, the
                    Occupiers’ Liability Act 1957 (covering lawful
                    entrants) and the Occupiers’ Liability Act 1984
                    (covering persons other than visitors, including
                    trespassers). In this regard, Rutter observes (Rutter at
                    6):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Two English statutes – the Occupiers’
                        Liability Act 1957 (covering lawful entrants) and the
                        Occupiers’ Liability Act 1984 (covering
                        trespassers) – have codified the duties of
                        occupiers towards persons injured on premises. There
                        has, to date, been no equivalent legislation in
                        Singapore and Malaysia. This means that English
                        textbooks and decisions of English Courts rendered since
                        1957 must be read with caution, since to the extent that
                        they are based on the English statues they are not
                        directly relevant in Singapore and Malaysia.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     The <em>locus </em><em>classicus</em> is <em>British
                        Railways Board v Herrington</em> [1972] 1 AC 877
                        (“<em>Herrington</em>”). <em>Herrington</em> is supposed to be authority for
                    the following propositions:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_98-p2_a"></a>(a)     An occupier owes
                        a duty of care to a trespasser only if the occupier knew
                        about the presence of the trespasser or as good as knew
                        about the likelihood of trespass; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_98-p2_b"></a>(b)     In that event, the
                        standard of the duty of care owed by the occupier to the
                        trespasser is not the usual duty under the tort of
                        negligence to take reasonable care to avoid acts or
                        omissions which one can reasonably foresee would be
                        likely to injure one’s “neighbour”
                        (see <em>Donoghue v Stevenson</em>
                        [1932] AC 562 at p 580). Rather, it is a
                        duty to act with common or ordinary humanity which is a
                        lower standard than the usual duty of
                    care.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     The law on
                    occupiers’ liability has been the subject of much
                    comment in various textbooks.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    For example, Rutter
                    states (at pp 10-12) that the older cases on
                    occupiers’ liability were decided before the general
                    rules for the tort of negligence became well-settled. He
                    suggests that after the tort of negligence was developed it
                    would have covered occupiers’ liability but this did
                    not happen. The rules on occupiers’ liability remained
                    intact and distinct. Nevertheless, he suggests that the
                    cause of action for unintentional damage suffered on
                    premises is still an action in negligence although with
                    special rules for an occupier’s liability. I add that
                    in <em>Herrington</em>, Lord
                    Wilberforce said at p 912 that “[t]here can be
                    no doubt that the law regarding occupiers' liability forms
                    part of the general law of negligence.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    On the other hand, the
                    author in Gary Chan’s <em>The Law of
                        Torts in Singapore</em> (Academy Publishing
                    Singapore, 2011) (“Chan”), seems to disagree
                    with such a view. Chan argues that the close connection
                    between occupiers’ liability and the tort of
                    negligence is not sufficient in itself to warrant the former
                    being entirely subsumed under the latter (Chan at para
                    10.048). Apparently, in Australia, occupiers’
                    liability is so subsumed although Chan highlights the
                    dissenting judgment of Brennan J in <em>Australian Safeway </em><em>Stores
                        Pty Ltd v Zaluzna</em> (1987)
                    162 CLR 479 on the utility of retaining the
                    special duties of occupiers (Chan at para 10.052). Yet,
                    it is not clear whether Chan is suggesting that occupiers
                    have concurrent liabilities one as occupier and another
                    under the tort of negligence or only one as occupier and
                    none under the tort of negligence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    Halsbury’s
                        <em>Laws of Singapore</em>
                    vol 18 (Butterworths Asia, 2009 Reissue)
                    (“Halsbury’s Singapore vol 18”)
                    does not cover the point as to whether the law on
                    occupiers’ liability is part of the law of
                    negligence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    
          <em>Clerk
                        &amp; Lindsell on Torts</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell,
                    15th Ed) (“<em>Clerk &amp;
                        Lindsell</em>”) states, at para 12-52
                    that <em>Herrington</em> fails to give
                    clear guidance as to the applicable principle for which an
                    occupier is liable for negligent injury to a trespasser. At
                    para 12-55, they also criticize the foreseeability test
                    (from the point of view of factual foreseeability) and go on
                    to say in respect of adult trespassers:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“It is submitted that the correct approach is
                        this. The occupier ought in principle to be liable to a
                        trespasser who is injured by the occupier’s breach
                        of duty towards his lawful visitors, if there are any;
                        but, as a substantive rule of law—a qualification
                        upon <em>Herrington</em>’s
                        case—an occupier ought not to be so liable to an
                        adult who trespasses knowingly and without any
                        reasonable excuse for doing so.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1">I will refer to this as the <em>Clerk &amp; Lindsell</em> approach.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    The <em>Clerk &amp; Lindsell</em> approach was suggested
                    before the enactment of The Occupiers’ Liability Act
                    1984 and was therefore still relevant to Singapore in
                    respect of non-lawful entrants. Generally, <em>Clerk &amp; Linsell</em> also appear to
                    treat occupiers’ liability under the common law as
                    being part of the law of negligence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    In <em>Lim Seow Wah and another v Housing &amp; Development
                        Board and </em><em>another</em> [1990] 2 SLR(R) 760
                        (“<em>Lim Seow
                    Wah</em>”), Chan Sek Keong J was also dealing
                    with a case of occupiers’ liability. He found that the
                    plaintiff there was not a trespasser but even if he were a
                    trespasser, Chan J found that the second defendant
                    (which was the remaining defendant in the action)
                    “ought to have foreseen” such a trespasser on
                    the facts before him. He cited with approval the <em>Clerk &amp; Lindsell</em> approach. Chan
                    J concluded that the plaintiff there did not know of the
                    danger and had a reasonable excuse to come into the
                    site.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    Mr Lee relied on
                        <em>Lim </em><em>Seow Wah</em> which in turn adopted the <em>Clerk &amp; </em><em>Lindsell</em> approach. Nevertheless, <em>Lim Seow Wah</em> did not suggest that an
                    occupier is subject to the concurrent liabilities discussed
                    above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    As it was, Mr Lee did
                    not elaborate or adequately elaborate in his submission on
                    the issue of concurrent liabilities and whether the law of
                    occupiers’ liability forms part of the law of
                    negligence. Neither did counsel for Lal Offshore. Both
                    seemed to assume that the law of occupiers’ liability
                    was separate and distinct from the law of negligence as they
                    had submissions for each.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    As for counsel for HAL,
                    he submitted that “there should be no separate duty
                    in negligence against an occupier. This is because the law
                    on occupiers’ liability had taken into account the
                    neighbour principle in the context of occupier’s
                        [<em>sic</em>] of land” (see
                    para 227 of his closing submissions).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    As mentioned above,
                    Rutter is of the view that occupiers’ liability is
                    part of the law of negligence. The cases cited by Rutter at
                    p 12 support this view. So does Lord
                    Wilberforce’s statement in <em>Herrington</em> (which I have cited above at
                        <a href="#p1_100">[100]</a>). I see no
                    reason why an occupier should have concurrent liabilities
                    when others have only one. I conclude that an occupier does
                    not have concurrent liabilities and his liability is part of
                    the law of negligence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    What then is the
                    approach to determine whether an occupier owes a duty of
                    care to a trespasser?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    It seems to me that
                    while the <em>Clerk &amp; Lindsell</em>
                    approach appears more predictable, there will still be
                    difficulties in applying it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    Take for example, a
                    canteen in a school which is known to serve cheap and good
                    food. The canteen is meant for the students and staff of the
                    school. However, members of the public make their way
                    uninvited into the school premises to partake of the food.
                    This is not an unrealistic situation in Singapore. Are such
                    members of the public trespassing and do they know they are
                    trespassing? I would think so on both counts, unless a court
                    were to conclude that they have implied consent from the
                    school authority who knew of such an activity and did not
                    take any active steps to stop or protest against it. Such an
                    approach may be criticised as an attempt by the court to
                    conclude artificially that there is implied consent in order
                    to do justice. Must then all schools put up noticeable signs
                    in the premises to state that members of the public, other
                    than students, staff and authorised workers, are trespassers
                    unless express consent to entry is obtained? Would that be
                    enough or would a court still be inclined to find implied
                    consent? If there is no implied consent, is it a reasonable
                    excuse for members of the public to say that they entered
                    uninvited into the school premises to savour cheap and good
                    food? I think not.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    On the other hand, the
                        <em>Herrington</em> approach puts
                    the focus on the knowledge of the occupier rather than on
                    the knowledge of the trespasser which seems to be unfair.
                    This means that the more blatant and the more frequent the
                    trespass the more likely the imposition of a duty of care on
                    the occupier. Why should this be so? To ameliorate this
                    outcome, <em>Herrington</em> then
                    prescribes a lower standard for the duty of care, that is,
                    the duty to act with common humanity. That in turn gives
                    rise to nice distinctions between the duty to act reasonably
                    and to act with common humanity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    I think the <em>Clerk &amp; Lindsell</em> approach is
                    preferable. It throws the onus on the trespasser to show
                    that he trespassed unknowingly or had reasonable excuse to
                    do so. I will adopt that approach.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    I have the following
                    additional observations about the <em>Clerk
                        &amp; Lindsell</em> approach and <em>Lim Seow Wah</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    First, the approach
                    applies to adult trespassers, not child trespassers. It
                    remains to be seen whether it will be extended to the
                    latter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    Secondly, as enunciated,
                    the <em>Clerk &amp; Lindsell</em>
                    approach does not take into account the occupier’s
                    knowledge or lack of knowledge of the presence of the
                    trespasser or the likelihood of trespass. It is not clear to
                    me whether Chan J intended to qualify the <em>Clerk &amp; Lindsell</em> approach when
                    he stated that the second defendant before him ought to have
                    foreseen the presence of the trespasser or whether he
                    considered that the knowledge of an occupier was part of the
                        <em>Clerk &amp; Lindsell</em>
                    approach.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    Thirdly, in so far as
                    Chan J referred to the fact that the plaintiff in
                        <em>Lim Seow Wah</em> did not know
                    of the danger, this is not relevant under the first limb of
                    the <em>Clerk &amp; </em><em>Lindsell</em> approach. Under the first
                    limb, the question is whether a plaintiff knew that he was
                    trespassing. Perhaps this part of <em>Lim
                        Seow Wah</em> can be explained on the basis that
                    the absence of knowledge of the danger was a factor in
                    considering the second limb, that is, whether the plaintiff
                    there had a reasonable excuse to come onto the site. I also
                    add that, in my view, <em>Lim Seow
                        Wah</em> was not suggesting that a
                    trespasser’s absence of knowledge of the danger in
                    question necessarily constitutes a reasonable excuse for the
                    trespass.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    Fourthly, the <em>Clerk &amp; Lindsell</em> approach is
                    silent as to who the burden of proof is on. Is it for a
                    defendant to prove that a plaintiff was a trespasser and
                    that he trespassed knowingly and without reasonable excuse
                    or is it for the plaintiff to prove that he trespassed
                    unknowingly or that he had a reasonable excuse to do so? I
                    have assumed that the burden should be on the plaintiff to
                    establish his status as it is for him to establish that the
                    defendant owes him a duty of care. If he was a trespasser,
                    it is for him to establish that he trespassed unknowingly.
                    If he trespassed knowingly, then it is for him to establish
                    that he had a reasonable excuse for doing so. Is it then
                    necessary for a plaintiff who trespassed unknowingly to also
                    establish that he had a reasonable excuse? I think so
                    although in most instances he is likely to have a reasonable
                    excuse once he establishes that he did not trespass
                    knowingly.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    Fifthly, <em>Lim Seow Wah</em> apparently preferred
                    the <em>Clerk &amp; Lindsell</em>
                    approach to <em>Herrington</em>
                    although the latter was adopted by the Federal Court of
                    Malaysia in <em>Lembaga </em><em>Letrik Negara, Malaysia v
                        Ramakrishnan</em> [1982] 2 MLJ 128
                        (“<em>Ramakrishnan</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    Sixthly, it seems that
                    the <em>Clerk &amp; Lindsell</em>
                    approach deals with the existence of a duty of care rather
                    than the standard of a duty of care. The latter is dealt
                    with elsewhere in <em>Clerk &amp;
                        </em><em>Lindsell</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    I come now to the
                    standard of the duty of care owed by an occupier to an adult
                    trespasser. <em>Clerk &amp;
                        Lindsell</em> criticizes the duty of common
                    humanity under <em>Herrington</em>
                    which is supposed to be lower than a duty to take reasonable
                    care. They also suggest at para 12-52, that after <em>Southern Portland Cement Ltd
                        </em><em>v Cooper</em> [1974]
                    AC 633, there is little difference between the two even at a
                    purely theoretical level.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    The reasons for a lower
                    duty of common humanity towards a trespasser appear to be
                    that the relationship of a “neighbour” is
                    forced onto an occupier by a trespasser and there is a
                    concern not to impose unnecessary or onerous burdens on an
                    occupier. As discussed above, the lower duty was to mitigate
                    the imposition in the first place of a duty of care on an
                    occupier <em>vis-a-vis</em> a
                    trespasser. I am of the view that the usual standard of
                    reasonable care should apply. The above concerns for an
                    occupier are addressed to a large extent by the point that
                    there must first be a duty of care owed to the trespasser.
                    The bar for the latter has been raised under the <em>Clerk &amp; Lindsell</em>
                    approach.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    The adoption of the
                    standard of reasonable care will also align occupiers’
                    liability closer to the rest of the law of negligence. It
                    will also render fine distinctions between the standard of
                    reasonable care and that of common humanity
                    unnecessary.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The law on Non-Occupiers’
                Liability</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    I come now to the
                    position of Asian Lift. As mentioned above, See Toh did
                    not allege that it was an occupier. Neither did Asian Lift
                    make this allegation. Nevertheless, counsel for Asian Lift,
                    Ms Chew, submitted that it should not be in a different
                    position from an occupier and that if HAL and/or Lal
                    Offshore did not owe See Toh a duty of care, then neither
                    would Asian Lift. In equating a non-occupier with an
                    occupier, Ms Chew relied on a passage in the judgment
                    of Ormerod J in <em>Davis v St
                        Mary’s Demolition and Excavation Co Ltd</em>
                    [1954] 1 WLR 592 (QBD) (“<em>Davis</em>”). The relevant passage
                    reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Applying that test, which appears to me to be the
                        proper test to apply in the present circumstances, I
                        have to ask myself whether the defendants are in the
                        same position vis-a-vis the plaintiff as they would be
                        if they were the occupiers of the land in question? Do
                        they owe no other duty to the plaintiff than the
                        occupier of the land would owe to a trespasser, or are
                        the defendants in these particular circumstances in such
                        a position in relation to the plaintiff that in spite of
                        the fact that he is a trespasser they owe to him a duty
                        to take care so far as this building is concerned?
                            <em>I think any decision which puts
                            the defendants in a different position from the
                            occupier of the land is one which must be considered
                            with very great care</em> [emphasis added by
                        counsel for Asian Lift]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    However, it must be
                    remembered that Ormerod J nevertheless concluded that, on
                    the facts before him, the non-occupier defendant did owe a
                    duty of care to the trespasser whereas an occupier would not
                    have in view of the state of the law then.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    Ormerod J’s
                    decision in <em>Davis</em> is preceded
                    by Morris J’s decision in <em>Buckland v Guildford Gas, Light &amp; Coke
                        Co</em> [1949] 1 KB 410
                        (“<em>Buckland</em>”). <em>Buckland</em> is authority for the proposition
                    that a non-occupier is not in the same position as an
                    occupier <em>vis-a-vis</em> others who
                    come onto a property. A non-occupier owes the general duty
                    of care as stated by Lord Atkinson in M’alister (Or
                        <em>Donoghue) </em><em>(Pauper) v Stevenson</em>
                    [1932] AC 562 at 580 and a trespasser may be a
                    neighbour giving rise to a duty of care on the non-occupier.
                    The decisions in <em>Buckland</em> and
                        <em>Davis</em> were followed by
                    Ashworth J in <em>Creed v John McGeoch
                        &amp; Sons Ltd</em> [1955]
                    1 WLR 1005.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    However, this trilogy of
                    cases were decided before <em>Herrington</em>. <em>Winfield and
                        Jolowicz on Tort</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell,
                        11<sup>th</sup> Ed) (“<em>Winfield and Jolowicz</em>”)
                    refers, at p 214 footnote 85, to the three
                    judgments of Lords Wilberforce (p 914), Pearson
                    (p 929) and Diplock (p 943) from <em>Herrington</em> and conclude that the
                    balance of dicta from these three judgments points toward
                    the removal of any sharp distinction between occupiers and
                    non-occupiers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    Actually, Lord
                    Wilberforce appeared to be in favour of a similar, if not
                    necessarily the same, duty for occupiers and non-occupiers.
                    Lord Pearson clearly disagreed with any differentiation
                    between the two categories. Lord Diplock appeared to be of
                    the view that there should be such a differentiation but
                    decided that <em>Herrington</em> was
                    not an appropriate case to give his view
                thereon.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    In <em>Ramakrishnan</em>, the Federal Court referred to
                    the judgment of the three law Lords in <em>Herrington</em> and to <em>Winfield and Jolowicz</em> and concluded that the
                    non-occupier defendant’s duty was that of an occupier
                    towards the plaintiff trespasser, although it must be
                    remembered that the Federal Court adopted the approach in
                        <em>Herrington</em> and not the
                        <em>Clerk &amp; Lindsell</em>
                    approach in determining the existence of an occupier’s
                    duty of care. For completeness, I would also mention that
                    the Federal Court eschewed any suggestion of concurrent
                    liabilities for an occupier. The Federal Court also appeared
                    to accept that an occupier’s liability is part of the
                    law of negligence but an occupier is subject to the lower
                    standard of common humanity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    
          <em>Lim
                        Seow Wah</em> did not discuss the question of
                    whether a non-occupier owes a similar, if not the same, duty
                    as an occupier.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132    As discussed, the
                        <em>Clerk &amp; Lindsell</em>
                    approach deals with the existence of a duty of care in
                    respect of an occupier. They appear to be silent as to
                    whether such an approach applies to a
                non-occupier.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a>133    In <em>Buckland</em>, Morris J was of the view that
                    a distinction should be drawn between an occupier and a
                    non-occupier because a non-occupier does not have the same
                    knowledge as an occupier of the extent to which others may
                    come onto the property. I am not persuaded that the
                    difference on the extent of the knowledge should cause a
                    difference in approach between the two categories. In any
                    event, as I have adopted the <em>Clerk &amp;
                        Lindsell</em> approach, knowledge of the occupier
                    to the likelihood of trespass is irrelevant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a>134    In my view, the approach
                    to determine whether a duty of care arises is the same for
                    Asian Lift as for the other two occupier defendants.
                    Likewise, the standard is the duty to take reasonable care
                    and not the lower duty to act with common
                humanity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_135"></a>135    Is there then any
                    distinction in the standard of the duty of care between the
                    static condition of the land and activities conducted on it?
                    For example, should an occupier’s standard of the duty
                    of care for activities which he carries on on the land be
                    different from the standard for the static condition? The
                    Privy Council in <em>Quinlan</em>
                    thought not (at p 829). In <em>Herrington</em>, Lord Morris thought not (at
                    p 910) and Lord Pearson also thought not (at
                    p 929). I am inclined to thhink that there should be no
                    distinction, although the fact of and the nature of an
                    activity may yield a different result when one considers
                    whether an occupier or non-occupier has in fact breached his
                    duty of care. However, it is not necessary for me to reach a
                    conclusion on this point.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Applying the law to the facts</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The claim against HAL and Lal Offshore</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_136"></a>136    As mentioned above, Mr
                    Lee relied on <em>Lim Seow Wah</em>
                    which in turn adopted the <em>Clerk &amp;
                        Lindsell</em> approach. Counsel for each of the
                    defendants urged me to adopt the <em>Herrington</em> approach.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137"></a>137    It seems to me that Mr
                    Lee relied on the <em>Clerk &amp;
                        Lindsell</em> approach because he realised that it
                    was difficult to say that HAL and Lal Offshore knew of the
                    presence or the likelihood of the presence of See Toh.
                    Accordingly, he sought to persuade me that See Toh had
                    trespassed unknowingly and that he had a reasonable excuse
                    to do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a>138    As I have concluded
                    differently on the facts, it follows that even with the
                        <em>Clerk &amp; Lindsell</em>
                    approach which I have adopted, HAL and Lal Offshore owed no
                    duty of care to See Toh.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a>139    In the event that I am
                    incorrect in the above conclusion, I will also deal with the
                    question of whether HAL or Lal Offshore had breached its
                    duty to take reasonable care. For this purpose, I will deal
                    with See Toh’s allegations of breach of
                    occupiers’ liability and of negligence
                    together.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_140"></a>140    The closing submissions
                    for See Toh alleged (at paras 52 and 53) that HAL and Lal
                    Offshore were liable under occupiers’ liability
                    because there was no guard or personnel from HAL or Lal
                    Offshore at the Seaside Access Point to stop See Toh from
                    entering. There was also no notice or sign.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_141"></a>141    The Statement of Claim
                    (Amendment No 2) did not specifically plead these
                    allegations under the claim for occupiers’ liability.
                    The relevant particulars of para 3 thereof only referred

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_142"></a>142    It seems to me that
                    particulars (a) and (f) were too vague to assist
                    See Toh who was not entitled to try and introduce the
                    allegations about an absence of guards or personnel or
                    notices or signs in his closing submissions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_143"></a>143    If See Toh was entitled
                    to rely on such allegations, I am of the view that HAL and
                    Lal Offshore did not fail in their duty. See Toh is an
                    adult. 9/11 TBC is not near to any area to which the public
                    has access. The main gate of 9/11 TBC was closed. The
                    security guard had been instructed to stop anyone from
                    entering. In addition, Chua had caused a barricade
                    comprising one row of metal stands with safety tape running
                    across to alert anyone coming from the back end of the
                    premises not to cross into the Operations Site. There was no
                    reason to think that an adult would try to cross over from
                    15 TBC to 9/11 TBC from the seashore without warning when
                    there was a proper entrance through the main gate of 9/11
                    TBC and a fence which ran down to the seashore. Although the
                    fence did not completely preclude access from the seashore,
                    it seems to me nearly impossible to do so when one is
                    dealing with a shipyard. Also, there was insufficient
                    evidence to establish that the seashore was being used
                    frequently as a means of access between the two
                    properties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_144"></a>144    In the circumstances, I
                    am of the view that neither HAL nor Lal Offshore should be
                    required to place someone or any sign at the Seafront Access
                    Point to stop or deter trespassers from
                entering.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_145"></a>145    If there was a breach by
                    reason of the absence of a guard or personnel or a sign at
                    the Operations Site, the breach would probably be that of
                    both HAL and Lal Offshore. Sun Kiang should then have given
                    instruction for the same to be present and Chua should, on
                    his own initiative, have also done likewise. If someone had
                    been stationed at or near the Seafront Access Point to
                    specifically stop trespassers, he would probably have
                    stopped See Toh from entering 9/11 TBC. That omission
                    might have caused or contributed to See Toh’s presence
                    there.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_146"></a>146    However, as for the
                    absence of a sign, it was not clear from the closing
                    submissions for See Toh what the sign should say. If Mr Lee
                    was referring to a sign at the seashore to state the address
                    of 9/11 TBC, I am of the view that that would have made no
                    difference to See Toh because I have found that he was aware
                    that he was crossing into 9/11 TBC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_147"></a>147    If Mr Lee was referring
                    to a sign to tell the public to keep out or to inform the
                    public that a dangerous operation was being undertaken, I am
                    of the view that it is likely that See Toh would have
                    disregarded the sign. He already knew that the main gate was
                    closed. He knew something was going on. Instead of checking
                    with the security guard at 9/11 TBC as to what was happening
                    he decided to make his own way to try and locate <em>Fortune II</em> at 9/11 TBC. Furthermore,
                    the presence of <em>Asian
                    Hercules</em>, the ramp of <em>Nampthong </em><em>27</em>
                    and the mooring wire were clearly visible. In other words,
                    the absence of either sign did not cause See Toh to enter
                    9/11 TBC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_148"></a>148    See Toh also pleaded a
                    host of particulars of the negligence against all the
                    defendants without trying to relate each act or omission to
                    specific defendants. It was a machine-gun approach, that is,
                    spraying bullets randomly without focus. In para 28 of
                    the written submissions for See Toh, Mr Lee relied on the
                    following allegations of negligence against HAL or Lal
                    Offshore:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_148-p2_a"></a>(a)     Failing to keep
                        any or any proper lookout or to have any or any
                        sufficient regard for the presence of [See
                            Toh];<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_60" id="Ftn_60_1"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_148-p2_b"></a>(b)     Failing to ensure that the
                        area surrounding the [mooring wire] was properly and
                        safely cordoned off;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_61" id="Ftn_61_1"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span>
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_148-p2_c"></a>(c)     Failing to give any or any adequate
                        warning of the presence of the [mooring
                            wire].<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_62" id="Ftn_62_1"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(a)   Failing to keep any or any proper
                lookout or to have any or any sufficient regard for the presence
                of See Toh</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_149"></a>149    As already mentioned,
                    there is insufficient evidence to establish that HAL or Lal
                    Offshore knew about the likelihood of the presence of See
                    Toh.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(b)   Failing to ensure that the area
                surrounding the mooring wire was properly and safely cordoned
                off</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_150"></a>150    Allegation (b) refers to
                    a failure to surround or cordon off the mooring wire, not
                    the Operations Site. Para 34 of See Toh’s closing
                    submissions alleged that HAL or Lal Offshore ought to have
                    set up a three-sided barricade around the area of the
                    lifting operations. That is quite different from saying that
                    they ought to have set up such a barricade around the
                    mooring wire which is what was pleaded. The pleaded
                    allegation fails because there is no logic in cordoning off
                    the mooring wire as such.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_151"></a>151    There was also no
                    evidence that it is usual to cordon off the Operations Site
                    on all three sides when there is a perimeter fence on the
                    relevant side.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(c)   Failing to give any or any adequate
                warning of the presence of the mooring wire</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_152"></a>152    As regards allegation
                    (c), Mr Lee’s closing submissions alluded only to the
                    absence of any warning sign without elaborating what the
                    warning sign should have said. Allegation (c) refers to
                    “warning of the presence of the [mooring
                    wire]” specifically. However, the mooring wire was a
                    heavy and thick wire, being 32mm in diameter. Neither was it
                    hidden. It was clearly visible to anyone who was paying
                    attention.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_153"></a>153    If HAL and Lal Offshore
                    were obliged to put up a warning sign or signs specifically
                    about the mooring wire, then they would also have been
                    obliged to put up warning signs about every other item or
                    equipment that might cause injury, for example, the ramp
                    (over which someone might trip). In my view, that would be
                    an unrealistic and unfair burden.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_154"></a>154    If the allegation was
                    meant to mean that there should have been a sign at or near
                    the Seafront Access Point to warn about the lifting
                    operation and/or the mooring operation, I am of the view
                    that the mooring operation is a common one undertaken at
                    shipyards and is undertaken frequently and openly without
                    the need for any warning sign.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_155"></a>155    Mr Lee’s point was
                    that there should be some sort of warning sign at or near
                    the Seafront Access Point. Here again, the absence of
                    evidence about the frequency of access and knowledge of such
                    frequency comes into play.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_156"></a>156    In the circumstances, I
                    would have found that neither HAL or Lal Offshore breached
                    its duty of care to See Toh.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The claim against Asian Lift</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_157"></a>157    As for Asian Lift, I
                    find that it also did not owe See Toh a duty of care.
                    However, I would have found Asian Lift to be in breach of
                    its duty to take reasonable care for the reasons stated
                    below, if there had been such a duty in the first
                    place.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_158"></a>158    In the present case, See

                            27</em> by not getting the ramp of <em>Namthong 27</em> out of the way
                        before commencing the lifting
                    operation;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_159-p2_j"></a>(j)     only one crew member was deployed to
                        the area between Bollard A and the ramp of <em>Namthong 27</em> when it was
                        expecting that the mooring wire would become stuck on
                        the ramp; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_159-p2_k"></a>(k)     Songyot released the foul from

                        presence of See Toh.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_160"></a>160    Mr Lee appeared to
                    suggest that allegations (i) to (k) had in themselves
                    established allegations (a) to
                    (h) (Plaintiff’s closing submissions
                    para 67). That was a rather simplistic
                approach.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_161"></a>161    As I have found that
                    Songyot and the other <em>Asian

                    over the mooring wire and there was insufficient evidence to
                    prove that Songyot released the mooring wire when it got
                    fouled before springing up, I do not find it necessary to
                    deal with allegations (e) and (g).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_162"></a>162    I come back to the
                    remaining allegations of negligence against Asian Lift which
                    I can deal with together.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_163"></a>163    In my view, this was not
                    a case of Asian Lift failing to keep any or any proper
                    lookout or to have any or any sufficient regard for the
                    presence of See Toh (allegation (a)). He had snuck in
                    quietly through the Seaside Access Point.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_164"></a>164    It was also not so much
                    a case of failing to ensure that the mooring wire was
                    properly or safely secured (allegation (b)). The eye of the
                    loop was properly placed around Bollard A.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_165"></a>165    It was also not a case
                    of failing to give any or adequate warning about the
                    presence of the mooring wire (allegation (d)). As previously
                    mentioned, the mooring wire was clearly
                visible.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_166"></a>166    
          <em>Res
                        </em>
<em>ipsa </em>
<em>loquitur</em> (allegation (h)) also does
                    not apply on the facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_167"></a>167    This leaves allegations
                    (b) and (f) which overlap.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_168"></a>168    It is pertinent to note
                    that in para 9 of his AEIC, Captain Hamid said that it
                    is “a common and recurring matter” for mooring
                    wires to get fouled. Although he did not have a clear line
                    of sight of the entire starboard mooring wire, he was
                    apparently aware that part of it was lying on the ramp of
                        <em>Namthong 27</em> and he had
                    expected that it would “in all likelihood, get
                    fouled”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_169"></a>169    It is also important
                    that Dzainudin agreed that Captain Hamid was careless
                    in not asking for the ramp to be lifted up before proceeding
                    with the mooring operation.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_65" id="Ftn_65_1"><sup>[note: 65]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_170"></a>170    Further, when asked why
                    they decided to continue with the mooring operation despite
                    knowing that part of the mooring wire was lying across the
                    ramp, all that Captain Hamid could say was that there were
                    no other mooring points available on the shore of 9/11 TBC
                    to be used.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_66" id="Ftn_66_1"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span> Captain Hamid
                    probably also wanted to complete the lifting operation by
                    the same day and was willing to run the risk of the mooring
                    wire being fouled on <em>Namthong 27</em>’s ramp and springing
                    up after being freed. Dzainudin also said that the reason
                    why he did not suggest to Captain Hamid to ask for <em>Namthong 27</em>’s ramp to be
                    lifted was that they just wanted to get the job
                        done.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_67" id="Ftn_67_1"><sup>[note: 67]</sup></a></span> Songyot’s
                    testimony in court was that having the ramp removed would
                    require an additional one to two days and that they had
                    instructions to finish the lifting operation within the same
                    day because the yard was rented.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_68" id="Ftn_68_1"><sup>[note: 68]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_171"></a>171    Under such
                    circumstances, Captain Hamid should either not have begun
                    the mooring operation until the ramp was lifted up so that
                    the mooring wire would not lie across the ramp or if it was
                    too late to do that, he should have stationed someone at the
                    ramp to ensure that no one else came near the ramp then.
                    Even if I accept his allegation in para 12 of his AEIC
                    that he had instructed about seven to eight crew members,
                    including Songyot, to coordinate the mooring operations and
                    to ensure that the Operations Site was clear, it seems that
                    there had been no specific instruction for a crew member to
                    be stationed at the ramp all the time to ensure that no one
                    came near it. If there had been such an instruction, it was
                    not carried out. That was why Songyot did not notice See Toh
                    until he was hit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_172"></a>172    I would have found that
                    allegations (b) and (f) were established. However, as
                    indicated above at <a href="#p1_89">[89]</a>
                    to <a href="#p1_95">[95]</a>, I would also
                    have found that See Toh was negligent too for entering
                    9/11 TBC by the route he had taken and for not paying
                    attention to the surrounding after that. On this point, I
                    note that Halsbury’s Singapore vol 18 states at para
                    240.289 that “[t]he fact that the plaintiff is a
                    trespasser does not make him contributorily negligent, and
                    has no bearing on whether the defendant has the defence of
                    contributory negligence”. This is a very wide
                    statement. I think that it means that the mere fact of
                    trespass does not necessarily make a trespasser negligent.
                    In my view, See Toh was negligent in fact and in law and his
                    negligence contributed to the accident.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_173"></a>173    Therefore, if Asian Lift
                    owed a duty of care to See Toh, I would have apportioned
                    liability for the accident as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_173-p2_a"></a>(a)     See Toh - 65%
                        liable; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_173-p2_b"></a>(b)     Asian Lift - 35%
                    liable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_174"></a>174    In the circumstances, I
                    dismiss See Toh’s claim against all the
                    defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_175"></a>175    I will hear parties on
                    costs which I may decide to fix.</p>
