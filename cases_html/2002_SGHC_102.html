<p align="left" xmlns=""><font color="#800000"><u><strong>GROUNDS OF DECISION</strong></u></font></p>
<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p></p></font>1.    Central Bank of India ("CBI"), the plaintiff in

this consolidated hearing, is a bank incorporated in India. Natsyn Fibres Pte Ltd

("Natsyn"), the 3<sup xmlns="">rd</sup> defendant in Suits No. 1045/99 and 1046/99 and

the defendant in Suit No. 1047/99, is a company incorporated in Singapore. Hemant Bansal

("Bansal") and his wife Aneeta Bansal, the 1<sup xmlns="">st</sup> and 2<sup xmlns="">nd</sup>

defendants respectively in Suits No. 1045/99 and 1046/99 (referred to collectively as

"the Bansals"), were the only shareholders and directors of Natsyn.

<p xmlns="">2.    On 3 August 2001, a few days prior to the commencement of these

hearings, a winding-up order was made against Natsyn. As a consequence all proceedings

against Natsyn were, by reason of s 263(3) of the Companies Act, stayed. Accordingly, the

hearings before me proceeded only in respect of the claims against the Bansals in

Suits No. 1045/99 and 1046/99.</p>
<p xmlns="">3.    Natsyn, in late 1997, had purchased various goods from Bhagwati

Cottons Ltd ("Bhagwati") and GPB Fibres Ltd ("GPB"). Bhagwati – a

public listed company in India – was founded by Bansal’s father. Bansal’s

father had passed away in 1986 but Bansal and other members of his family continued to

hold substantial interests in Bhagwati. Bansal was a director of Bhagwati.</p>
<p xmlns="">4.    GPB was also an Indian company. Bansal and other members of his

family had substantial equity interest in GPB. GPB, at about the time of these

transactions, was amalgamated into Bhagwati. In view of the close relationship between GPB

and Bhagwati, the parties in the proceedings before me did not seek to make any

distinction between the two companies. All references to Bhagwati in this judgment will

therefore, where appropriate, be references to GPB.</p>
<p xmlns="">5.    To pay for the goods purchased from Bhagwati, Natsyn, through

Campagnie Financiere De Cic Et De L’Union Europeene in Singapore ("CF

Bank") and Mees Pierson NV in Singapore ("MP Bank") had opened various

letters of credit ("LCs") in favour of Bhagwati. The LCs were subject to UCP 500

and credit was available by negotiation.</p>
<p xmlns="">6.    Bhagwati, upon receipt of the LCs referred to above, approached

CBI and discounted the bills under the LCs with CBI by presenting the requisite banking

and shipping documents to CBI. Bhagwati received about US$2.8 million from CBI pursuant to

such negotiations. It was CBI’s pleaded case that after negotiation CBI,

at Bhagwati’s request, handed the negotiated documents to Bhagwati for Bhagwati

to courier to CF Bank/MP Bank in Singapore. The documents did not, however, find their way

to either CF Bank or MP Bank. It was pleaded that the documents, instead, found their way

to the Bansals (and Natsyn) who then proceeded to arrange for the collection of the

goods comprised in the documents without payment to CBI of the sums due under the LCs.</p>
<p xmlns="">7.    In their defence, the Bansals did not specifically deny CBI’s

allegation that the documents had been handed to Bhagwati for transmission to CF Bank and

MP Bank. The position the Bansals took (as stated in paragraph 3 of the Defence) was:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant [ie Bansal] has no detailed

  knowledge of the business relationship between GPB, Bhagwati and the Plaintiff. The 2<sup>nd</sup>

  and 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants [ie Aneeta Bansal and Natsyn] have no knowledge of the

  relationship between GPB, Bhagwati and the Plaintiff."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Most significantly, there was no denial by the Bansals that they had

received the negotiated documents from Bhagwati and had collected the goods comprised

therein.</p>
<p xmlns="">8.    CBI’s claimed that the Bansals were accountable to CBI for

the goods/monies received on the following grounds:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(a) <u>Conspiracy</u>: conspiring with Bhagwati to injure CBI by

  inducing CBI to part with the said documents purportedly for the purpose of delivering the

  documents to CF Bank or MP Bank when the Bansals and Bhagwati had no intention of so

  doing;</p>
<p align="justify">(b) <u>Conversion</u>: unlawfully obtaining possession of the goods

  represented by the said documents without CBI’s consent and appropriating those goods

  in conversion of the same; and</p>
<p align="justify">(c) <u>Constructive trust</u>: by knowingly receiving the documents

  and/or the goods, the Bansals become constructive trustees for CBI of all monies received

  that relate to the documents/goods;</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Alternatively, CBI claimed damages for the loss of the goods and/or

bills.</p>
<p xmlns="">9.    The claim against the Bansals in Suit No. 1045/99 was for

US$1,190,893.28 and the claim in Suit No. 1046/99 was for US$274,319.04 making a total

claim of US$1,465,212. This figure was arrived at after giving the Bansals and Natsyn

("the defendants") credit for the sum of US$1,325,033 (being US$1,291,694 in

respect of Suit No. 1045/99 and US$33,339 in respect of Suit No. 1046/99) which sum

the defendants had, it was alleged, paid to CBI on or about 11 December 1997 in part

settlement of CBI’s claims in respect of these transactions. The Bansals, in their

Defence and in the cross-examination of CBI’s witness, did not seek to deny that such

part-payments had, in fact, been effected.</p>
<p xmlns="">10.    The claims against the Bansals in the two suits were almost

identical in nature. So were the Defences filed. The Bansals were content, in their

defence, merely to deny the alleged conspiracy, conversion and constructive trust. They

did not seek to put forward any positive case as to why they were not accountable to CBI

for the goods or the proceeds of sale thereof. However, in the course of the hearing,

under pressure from Mr Tan Teng Muan, counsel for CBI, the Bansals amended their Defence.

In their Amended Defence, they alleged that Natsyn had purchased the goods from Bhagwati

under terms which included the following:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(a) LCs would be opened with GPB/Bhagwati as the beneficiaries;</p>
<p align="justify">(b) The LCs would have certain conditions [which counsel referred to as

  "pre-conditions"] apparent on the face of them, which would have to be fulfilled

  for payment to be made. The effect of these conditions was that, if the conditions were

  not met, the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant had the commercial option to make payment outside

  the LC, through banking channels; and</p>
<p align="justify">(c) In prior transactions, as well as in some of the transactions

  relevant to the present proceedings, payments outside the LCs (through banking channels)

  had been made and accepted by GPB/Bhagwati with the knowledge of CBI.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Mr N. Sreenivasan, counsel for the Bansals, indicated that the reason

his clients had been tardy in pleading a positive case was because of fears of adverse

reactions in India from the foreign exchange regulatory authorities.</p>
<p xmlns="">11.    From the amendments made and from the questions put to CBI’s

witness by Mr Sreenivasan, I gathered that the Bansals were alleging that under the terms

under which Natsyn had purchased the goods from Bhagwati, Natsyn was at liberty to either

pay for the goods under the LCs or, at its option, deliberately fail to meet the

pre-conditions contained in the LCs and instead make payments for the goods directly.</p>
<p xmlns="">12.    The "pre-conditions" identified by Mr Sreenivasan in

the course of his cross-examination of CBI’s witness were cl 7 in the LCs from MP

Bank and Special Condition 3 in the LCs from CF Bank. Clause 7 of the LCs from MP Bank

stated:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"Inspection certificate issued by the applicant, duly signed by

  the authorised signatories of the applicant whose signatures must be verified by the

  issuing bank prior to negotiation, stating that the goods are strictly in accordance with

  the terms of the contract."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">whilst cl 3 of the LCs from CF Bank stated:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"Discharge port and notify party will be advised later by way of

  amendment to this credit." </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">From the questions asked, the suggestion appears to be that CBI was

privy to this arrangement wherein Natsyn had such an option. It was suggested to

CBI’s witness that the release of the documents to Bhagwati by CBI (in the

transactions related to the present proceedings as well as in some earlier transactions)

signalled CBI’s willingness to receive payments outside the LC. It was further

suggested that it was in this context that the part-payments amounting to US$1,325,033

(referred to earlier) were made to CBI.</p>
<p xmlns="">13.    CBI called only one witness in support of its claim.

This was Vijay Kumar Bhandari ("Bhandari"), the General Manager since 1996

of the Head Office of CBI situate at Mumbai (India). In that capacity, Bhandari had

supervisory powers over the Branch Offices at Mumbai. The accounts of Bhagwati relevant to

the transactions in the present cases were maintained at one of the Mumbai Branch Offices.

As Bhandari was stationed at the Head Office, he had no personal knowledge of the

matters related to these claims. His evidence on the circumstances surrounding the release

of the documents to Bhagwati was therefore based entirely on what he could gather from the

documentation available at the office. In particular, he sought to adduce in evidence a

pile of documents known as "Process Notes". Process Notes were notes kept by

officers of CBI of conversations with customers and others having dealings with CBI.</p>
<p xmlns="">14.    In the Process Notes that Bhandari sought to produce to the court

the officers of CBI who had been involved in the requests by Bhagwati for the discounted

documents had allegedly noted the reasons for the requests and sought the directions of

the Senior Manager at the Branch – one Peter Soundararajan – on these requests.

CBI, however, did not call any of these officers (or Peter Soundararajan) to testify.</p>
<p xmlns="">15.    Mr Sreenivasan objected to the admission of these Process Notes

or to any testimony from Bhandari on the contents of the Notes. Mr Sreenivasan pointed out

that it was incumbent on CBI, in support of their allegation of conspiracy, to prove that

the documents were released as a result of some misrepresentations by Bhagwati. This, he

submitted, CBI could properly do only through the officers to whom those representations

had allegedly been made. He submitted that in the absence of the testimony of those

officers the Process Notes allegedly made by them were hearsay and therefore inadmissible.

Mr Sreenivasan also pointed out that the Notes were, in the main, illegible and submitted

that the court should not engage itself in speculating what those officers had intended to

write in the Process Notes.</p>
<p xmlns="">16.    Mr Tan conceded that in the absence of the testimony of the

persons who wrote the Process Notes, the contents of the Notes would prima facie be

hearsay and inadmissible. He sought, however, to persuade the court that the

provisions of s 32(b) and s 34 of the Evidence Act were applicable in this case and that

the Process Notes were admissible in evidence under those provisions.</p>
<p xmlns="">17.    The criteria for the admission of any statement, oral or written,

under the provisions of s 32 is that the statement must be made by –</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"… a person who is dead or who cannot be found, or who has

  become incapable of giving evidence, or whose attendance cannot be procured without an

  amount of delay or expense which under the circumstances of the case appears to the court

  unreasonable ..."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">For CBI to be permitted to adduce the Process Notes under s 32(b), CBI

would have to satisfy the court that the case fell within the above criteria. <i>Sarkar on

Evidence</i> (14<sup>th</sup> Ed 1993, Vol I, at 559), in dealing with similar provisions

in the Indian Evidence Act, states:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"The general ground of reception of such evidence is that in the

  cases in question no better evidence is to be had. Such statements are admitted on the

  principle of Necessity. The person whose statement is offered being dead or not available,

  no better evidence can be had. <i>Before reception of this kind of evidence, the first

  condition of admissibility, viz death, etc must be proved to the satisfaction of the judge</i>."<br/>

  (Emphasis added.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">There was, in the present case, no evidence led on behalf of CBI to

show that the makers of the Process Notes fell within the stipulated criteria. To the

contrary, it appeared from the evidence of Bhandari that no serious effort was made

by CBI to procure their attendance.</p>
<p xmlns="">18.    The other provision in the Evidence Act relied on by CBI, namely

s 34, was also, in my view, of no assistance to CBI. Section 34 is a very limited

provision that applies only in respect of books of account. In the present case, whilst

some of the Process Notes appear to have some figures scrawled on them, those scrawls

could not, in my view, have the effect of converting those Process Notes into books of

account.</p>
<p xmlns="">19.    For the above reasons, I ruled that the contents of the Process

Notes, in the absence of the testimony of the persons who wrote them, would not be

admissible in evidence.</p>
<p xmlns="">20.    Encouraged perhaps by the fact that this ruling in effect meant

that there was an absence of any direct evidence that the documents were handed over on

the representation by Bhagwati that Bhagwati would, on behalf of CBI, courier the

documents to CF Bank and MP Bank in Singapore, the Bansals, at the close of CBI’s

case, elected not to adduce any evidence in defence of the claims but rely only on a

submission of no case.</p>
<p xmlns="">21.    A decision by a defendant not to adduce evidence in his defence

is a decision that ought not to be lightly taken. Where a defendant makes such an

election, the result will be that the court is left with only the plaintiff’s version

of the story. So long as there is some prima facie evidence that supports the essential

limbs of the plaintiff’s claim/s, then the failure by the defendant to adduce

evidence on his own behalf would be fatal to the defendant.</p>
<p xmlns="">22.    In their text-book: "<i>Litigation: Evidence and Procedure</i>"

(16<sup>th</sup> Ed), at page 732, Aronson and Hunter summarise the effect of making such

a submission as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"A no case to answer submission by a defendant or accused will

  succeed only if the evidence supporting the case of the plaintiff or prosecution

  (respectively) is fatally flawed. It is so flawed only if there is a complete absence of <i>any</i>

  evidence which could lead to an inference that a critical fact exists. If there is some

  evidence on each critical element, there is a case to answer, no matter how slender

  or unbelievable the judge might think it to be.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">…</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">However, if the defence leads no evidence where there is a case to

  answer, its silence could (depending on the facts) be taken to strengthen the

  opposing case. In particular, circumstantial evidence which could cut both ways might well

  look stronger if the defendant or accused is in a position to dispel the doubt, but

  refuses to go into evidence: <i>May v O’Sullivan</i> (1955) 92 CLR 654; and <i>Weissensteiner

  v R</i> (1993) 178 CLR 217."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">This text was drawn to my attention by Mr Tan.</p>
<p xmlns="">23.    Mr Sreenivasan described Aronson and Hunter’s book as a

"somewhat obscure Australian text" and urged me to reject that summary of the

legal position and rely instead on what was said by the English Court of Appeal in <i>Storey

v Storey</i> [1960] All ER 279. In particular, Mr Sreenivasan drew my attention to

the following passage in the judgment of Ormerod LJ in that case (at page 282):</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"There are, however, two sets of circumstances under which a

  defendant may submit that he has no case to answer. In the one case there may be a

  submission that, accepting the plaintiff’s evidence at its face value, no case has

  been established in law, and in the other that the evidence led for the plaintiff is so

  unsatisfactory or unreliable that the court should find that the burden of proof has not

  been discharged."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Mr Sreenivasan submitted that the evidence led by CBI did not satisfy

either of the circumstances referred to by Ormerod LJ.</p>
<p xmlns="">24.    In <i>Storey v Storey</i>, the Court of Appeal was considering

the circumstances in which an appeal court can, in a case where a submission of no case

had been upheld, direct that a new trial be held. This appears from the paragraph

following the above quoted passage where Ormerod LJ states:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"There can, we think, be no doubt that in the former type of

  submission a defendant is bound by his election, and there can be no new trial. This rule,

  in our opinion, however, does not of necessity apply to the second type of case where the

  judge is invited to dismiss the case because of the unsatisfactory or unreliable nature of

  the evidence. In some cases it may well be that the appellate court will be able to decide

  the case without sending it back, but in others, and this in our judgment is certainly

  one, justice could not be done without a re-hearing.</p>
<p align="justify">…</p>
<p align="justify">In our opinion, if the submission of no case is based on the

  unsatisfactory or unreliable nature of the evidence led by the plaintiff, and the

  appellate court finds itself unable on the findings of the court below to come to a just

  conclusion, the only course to be adopted in the interests of justice is to order a new

  trial, even if the defendant has elected to stand on his submission."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">It was in that context that Ormerod LJ highlighted the two

circumstances in the passage quoted in paragraph 23 above.</p>
<p xmlns="">25.    It may be that the view taken by Aronson and Hunter was too

restrictive and that a submission of no case to meet may also be upheld where the evidence

adduced by the plaintiff is so unsatisfactory or unreliable that the court is able to find

that the burden of proof on the plaintiff has not been discharged. But that said, I

nevertheless consider the summary by Aronson and Hunter a helpful one. </p>
<p xmlns="">26.    In the present case, CBI was the negotiating bank and as

negotiating bank had given value for the shipping and other documents presented to them by

Bhagwati. Having given value, the documents belonged to CBI and it was CBI that was

entitled to the possession and use of the goods represented by the documents. However, the

documents found their way to Natsyn and it was not in dispute that the goods represented

by the documents were dealt with by Natsyn. Evidence was given by Bhandari that whenever

CBI negotiated documents, it would rubber-stamp the documents with a unique rubber stamp

that made it clear that the documents had been taken up by CBI. Natsyn in receiving the

documents would therefore have had notice of CBI’s interest in the documents. In any

event, Natsyn would have known that it had received documentation that should, since the

goods were to be paid for by LC, have been received by CF Bank or MP Bank. As the Bansals

were the only shareholders/directors of Natsyn, it is not an unreasonable inference to

draw that Natsyn received and dealt with the documents with their full complicity.</p>
<p xmlns="">27.    There was no evidence before the court of the circumstances under

which the documents had been handed over to Bhagwati by CBI. That being so, it could

justifiably be said that there was, at the close of CBI’s case, no evidence before

the court to support the allegation of conspiracy. But conspiracy is only one of the three

heads of claim raised by CBI. The other two were conversion and constructive trust and one

needs to consider whether, at the close of CBI’s case, there was prima facie evidence

to support CBI’s claims under these two heads.</p>
<p xmlns="">28.    At the close of the case for CBI, there was evidence on which the

court could come to the conclusion that the Bansals knew, when they (through Natsyn) dealt

with the goods covered by the documents, that the documents were the property of CBI. In

proceeding to deal with the goods despite that knowledge, the Bansals could well be liable

in conversion and/or as constructive trustees. But, by electing not to testify, the

Bansals have elected not to put before the court their explanation of the events that

happened. In these circumstances, I can only conclude that they had no defence to these

claims. I therefore give judgment in favour of CBI in the sum of US$1,190,893.28 in Suit

No. 1045/99 and US$274,319.04 in Suit No. 1046/99. I also order that the Bansals pay

the costs of the two suits and pay interest on the judgment sum at 6% per annum from date

of writ.</p>
