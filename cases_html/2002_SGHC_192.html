<strong>Judgment</strong>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font color="#800000" face="Times New Roman"><u><strong>GROUNDS OF

DECISION</strong></u></font></p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The parties</font></p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">1.

        The plaintiff is a bank. The first defendant

was a customer of the plaintiff with credit facilities in the form of a revolving credit

facility and an overdraft facility. The second defendant was the guarantor for the

facilities.</font></p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The action</font></p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">2.

        The plaintiff claimed against the second

defendant as guarantor sums due under the facilities. The plaintiff obtained summary

judgment in the first instance that the second defendant was to pay it</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">1.    the aggregate of the

  sums of US$3,102,254.71 and S$1,990,311.67;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">2.    interest on the sums

  of US$3,102,254.71 and S$1,990,311.67 at the rates of 3.5% p.a. above the Plaintiff’s

  prevailing US$ Cost of Funds and 5% p.a. above the Plaintiff’s S$ Prime Rate

  respectively from 1 December 2000 to judgment.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">3.

        The second defendant appealed to a judge in

chambers and succeeded to the extent that it was ordered on 29 June that the judgment sums

were reduced to US$3,100,937.72 and S$1,957,756.05 with interest thereon as previously

ordered.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">4.

        The second defendant appealed further to the

Court of Appeal. The appeal was allowed in part when the Court ordered that interlocutory

judgment be entered against the second defendant for principal and simple interest to be

assessed by the Registrar, and that unconditional leave be given to the second defendant

to defend the plaintiff’s claims for compound interest and default interest.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">5.

        The matter then went before an Assistant

Registrar for the assessment of the sums payable. On 19 April 2002 after hearing witnesses

and counsel the Assistant Registrar ordered that</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">1.    Final judgment for

  the Plaintiff against the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">a.    in relation to the

    revolving credit facility for the principal sum assessed at US$2,935,250.24. for simple

    interest from 9 May 2000 to 30 November 2000 assessed at US$115,518.31 and for further

    simple interest on the sum of US$2,935,250.24 at 6% per annum from 1 December 2000 to date

    of judgment; and</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">b.    in relation to the

    overdraft facility for the principal sum assessed at S$1,609,688.51, for simple interest

    from 7 November 1995 to 30 November 2000 assessed at S$256,866.81 and for further simple

    interest on the sum of S$1,609,688.51 at 6% per annum from 1 December 2000 to date of

    judgment;</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">2.    Nothing in this order

  shall preclude the Plaintiff from expressly claiming as against the 2<sup>nd</sup>

  Defendant any charges or commission or expenses, howsoever described, after amending its

  Statement of claim to identify such sums as may be claimed, or to apply for summary

  judgment on such claims;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">3.    Nothing in this order

  shall preclude the Plaintiff from pursuing the claims that have not been allowed in this

  assessment at the trial of the action.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">6.

        The second defendant was dissatisfied with the

order and brought the present appeal before me.</font></p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The appeal</font></p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">7.

        There were two matters under appeal. The first

related to a 1.5% spread in the revolving credit facility. Counsel for the second

defendant argued that "(i)n the computation furnished by the Plaintiffs’ lawyers

in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility … the Plaintiffs had charged "All-in

interest rates" at Cost of Funds ("COF") plus 1.5% spread …" and

that "(i)t is to be noted that the Facility Letter makes no reference whatsoever to

the Spread of 1.5%. All that the Plaintiffs can show in support of their claim are <i>the

letters from the Borrower who had agreed to an "aggregate" rate of interest</i>

or the total sum of interest for the period from 9 May 2000 to 2 August 2000."

(Emphasis added)</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">8.

        Counsel contended that the spread should not be

permitted because </font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(1) there is no specific agreement by

  Borrowers for Spread; and</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(2) the Second Order which sets out the

  parameters for the assessment makes no reference to this Spread of 1.5%;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(3) notwithstanding the fact that the

  Borrower has agreed to pay an aggregate rate of interest, the Court has excluded default

  interest, from the computation. Similarly the 1.5% Spread should be removed as it is not

  simple interest.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">9.

        The second matter under appeal is order 3 of 19

April 2002. The second defendant’s grievance was that "(a)lthough the [order]

may appear to accord with approach of the Assistant Registrar that he proceeded with the

assessment on the basis that it is a Order 14 hearing, nevertheless there is a significant

difference. In the assessment witnesses were called gave evidence and cross-examined under

oath. In the premises there is no reason for the Plaintiffs to have a second bite at the

trial to claim for COF."</font></p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The entitlement to the spread</font></p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">10.

        The 1.5% spread arose in the interest charged

in the revolving credit facility. The plaintiff charged interest based on the cost of

funds plus 1.5%.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">11.

        The second defendant was correct in its

contention that there was no reference to the spread in the facility letter offering the

facilities. The facility letter had provided that "Advances for periods of 1, 2, 3 or

6 months at your option on a rollover basis at mutually agreed rates to be determined on

the date of drawdown, subject to availability of funds."</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">12.

        However it was not the plaintiff’s case

that the spread was specifically referred to and agreed upon. Its case was that the spread

was a component of the interest charged. This was explained by its solicitors to the

second defendant’s solicitors on 25 March 2002 that "the spread of 1.5% per

annum that was charged was part of what was agreed with the borrower and was rightly

charged to and paid by the borrower." This was also reflected in the plaintiff’s

Statement of Principal and Simple Interest, which referred to the "All-in interest at

COF + 1.5%." Furthermore the plaintiff’s Head of Corporate Banking deposed in an

affidavit that the all-in interest rates charged by the plaintiff were agreed to by the

first defendant. Letters evidencing the borrower’s confirmation of the rates for the

period for which interest on the all-in interest rates was awarded were exhibited thereto.

</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">13.

        On the evidence, it was clear that the interest

rates were agreed to. It was not open to the borrower or the guarantor to object to them

now, whether in full or to any component thereof. There is no merit in the second

defendant’s argument that the 1.5% spread should be removed from the agreed interest

rates.</font></p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The right to proceed with the claim for

cost of funds</font></p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">14.

        The order under appeal was in broad terms with

no reference to the cost of funds -</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Nothing in this order shall preclude the

  Plaintiff from pursuing the claims that have not been allowed in this assessment at the

  trial of the action.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">15.

        The Assistant Registrar was directed by the

Court of Appeal to assess the principal sums and simple interest owing and payable by the

second defendant. It really did not need saying that his assessment of those two sums

cannot affect any other claims the plaintiff may have. The assessment was consequential to

a summary judgment obtained by the plaintiff. A summary judgment does not shut out any

part of a plaintiff’s claims; what it does is to obviate trials of those claims for

which judgments are given. Any other claim that the plaintiff wishes to pursue shall go

for trial, and its success or failure will be determined there.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">16.

        The Assistant Registrar was stating the

obvious. The only matters that had been conclusively determined were the principal sums

owing and the simple interest accruing on them. The plaintiff having made its claim for

costs of funds as an element of the interest it charged is not allowed to revisit this at

the trial. There was no indication of any further claims for cost of funds. To the

contrary, counsel for the plaintiff confirmed in the appeal before me that the plaintiff

will not claim for cost of funds at the trial.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">17.

        On the basis of the foregoing, the second

defendant’s appeal was dismissed. The Court of Appeal will rule on these issues when

it hears the second defendant’s appeal against my decision.</font></p>
