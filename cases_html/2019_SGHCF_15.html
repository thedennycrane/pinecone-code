[UWP] was 89 years old at the time of the application and brought the action against [BUV], her youngest son, and [BXD] Bank (“the Bank”) for orders relating to moneys held in an account at the Bank. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The second application in Originating Summons (Family) No 1 of 2017 (“OSM 1/2017” or “the MCA application”) was by [BUV] pursuant to the Mental Capacity Act (Cap 177A, 2010 Rev Ed) (“the MCA”) against [UWP] and [BUU], her eldest son, for a declaration that [UWP] is unable to make decisions as to her personal welfare and her property and affairs because of an impairment of or a disturbance in the functioning of her mind or brain, and for a consequential order that deputies be appointed to make all decisions relating to her property and affairs on her behalf. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 While MCA proceedings are generally heard in the first instance in the Family Justice Courts, the two matters were clearly connected. Indeed, the MCA application grew out of a failed application by the plaintiff for an order that the second defendant be found incapable of conducting the civil suit in OS 1096/2016. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 I determined that [UWP] is not mentally capable within the meaning of ss 4 and 5 of the MCA. Subsequent hearings were necessary to determine the consequential appointment of the deputies. Time for appeal was extended in the meantime. [BUU] has since appealed against my decision.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 In the present grounds of decision, I take the MCA application as the primary application, and use the terms plaintiff and defendants accordingly.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 [UWP] (“the second defendant”) is the mother of [BUU] (“the first defendant”) and [BUV] (“the plaintiff”). The first defendant and plaintiff are retirees. The second defendant did not receive a formal education and is illiterate, but is able to understand and speak in the Teochew dialect.

The plaintiff invoked the court’s powers under s 18 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) (“the SCJA”) read with para 19 of the First Schedule of the SCJA. On 22 December 2016, I denied this application as insufficient evidence had been adduced to justify infringing upon the second defendant’s autonomy in the manner prayed for.

He was also given unrestricted authority to dispose of her property by making cash gifts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 The 2016 Will disposed of the second defendant’s assets in the following proportions: the jewelleries, as marked; $20,000 to her youngest daughter (“Youngest Daughter”); $1,250 each to nine of her grandchildren; and the remaining moneys to the first defendant after all debts were paid out of her estate. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The procedure adopted and the evidence adduced</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 The MCA application was conducted as a judge-led process and involved the taking of evidence from the following persons:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) two court-appointed medical experts who gave evidence on the second defendant’s mental capacity and her ability to manage her own affairs, namely, Professor Kua Ee Heok (“Prof Kua”), a psychiatrist, and Dr Tang Kok Foo (“Dr Tang”), a neurologist;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) a neuropsychologist, Dr Yeo Hong Huang Donald (“Dr Yeo”), who adduced a report and gave testimony on what transpired during his psychological testing of the second defendant; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the second defendant, the first defendant, the plaintiff and a number of other family members; the evidence of the family members largely concerned their interactions with the second defendant, as well as various events relating to the second defendant’s disposal of property and assets.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The parties’ cases in OSM 1/2017</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The plaintiff’s case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 The plaintiff argued that the evidence of the medical experts showed that the second defendant suffered from mental impairment. This was supported by her performance on the stand, which showed that she could not retain, understand, use and weigh information or communicate decisions as to her own personal welfare and her property and affairs. She also lacked the capacity to litigate. Undue influence, which is relevant to a determination of mental capacity following <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">BKR </span>[2015] 4 SLR 81 (“<span class="font-italic">Re BKR</span>”), was presumed and was not rebutted on the evidence. These factors together evidenced her lack of mental capacity. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 The plaintiff also prayed for the 2016 LPA and Will to be revoked or found ineffectual, and for deputies to be appointed to act for the second defendant in respect of her property and affairs.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The defendants’ case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 The defendants argued that the second defendant did not lack capacity despite her dementia, as supported by the earlier medical evidence from 2016. Even the medical experts appointed by the court concluded that she did not lack capacity. The second defendant through her own testimony showed that she was able to make decisions for herself. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 The 2016 LPA and Will were properly executed by the second defendant, who was aware of her actions. This was supported by evidence from the other family witnesses and the medical evidence. The second defendant chose to have the first defendant be her caregiver. A conspiracy existed against the first defendant, involving the plaintiff, the second defendant’s Third Son and her Daughter-in-Law, in respect of the closing of bank accounts which the second defendant had prior to June 2016, and the allegations made against the first defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Finally, there was no evidence of any undue influence, such allegations being only speculative. The second defendant was still able to make independent decisions despite her dementia, and she was not subject to any undue influence in the making of the 2016 Declaration of Intention, LPA and Will, which were simple documents. If anything, it was the plaintiff and the second defendant’s Third Son who had exerted undue influence on her. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">My decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Bearing in mind the evidence and submissions, I was satisfied that the second defendant lacked mental capacity in respect of decisions pertaining to her personal welfare and her property and affairs because of a disturbance in the functioning of her mind. There was sufficient medical evidence, particularly from Prof Kua, that indicated that she did not have sufficient capacity. I generally preferred Prof Kua’s evidence to Dr Tang’s. In addition, I also considered the witnesses’ testimony in court, particularly that of the second defendant herself, which caused me considerable concern as to her capacity. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 To my mind, that lack of capacity affected the execution of her 2016 Will. Furthermore, despite Prof Kua’s testimony that the 2016 LPA could have been properly made by her, I found that the second defendant did not have the capacity to do so. My finding of incapacity also affected the second defendant’s ability to give instructions with regard to OS 1096/2016 and to litigate it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 As for the question of the appropriate deputy for the second defendant, the appointments prayed for by the plaintiff – being the plaintiff and the second defendant’s Daughter-in-Law – were difficult. I adjourned the determination of the appointment of deputies to arrive at a solution, extending the time for appeal in the meantime.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 As it was, on 1 November 2018, I appointed the second defendant’s Youngest Daughter and Daughter-in-Law as joint deputies to make decisions on her behalf.

Section 5(3) specifies that the fact that a person is able to retain information relevant to a decision for a short period only does not prevent him from being regarded as able to make the decision.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 As decided in <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">BKR</span>, the test for capacity in s 4(1) of the MCA has a functional and clinical component, the functional aspect being that the subject must be unable to make a decision, and the clinical aspect being that this inability must be caused by a mental impairment: at [134]. While expert evidence may address the clinical component of the test, it is not determinative. The expert evidence tells the court what view of the subject’s mental impairment emerges from her symptoms, but the functional component is a judgment for the court to make based on the evidence as to the degree her mental functioning is compromised:<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [134]. To this end, answers in cross-examination should be considered in assessing the functional component, to shed light on (a) whether the subject is able to retain, understand, use and weigh information relevant to decisions and (b) her symptoms as might shed light on the nature of her mental impairment: at [154]. As noted at [134] and [135]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [The court is] able to form our own assessment from the evidence … [T]hat competence derives essentially from the knowledge and experience that we as rational human beings have of the process of thinking and reasoning. It does not require the specialised expertise of a medical professional to see whether P has, for instance, poor memory or difficulty in understanding sophisticated concepts. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [Clinical interviews and cross-examination] afford us an insight into the extent to which she is able to retain, understand, use and weigh information, and hence furnish us with evidence upon which we determine whether she is able to make decisions; but at the same time, they also reveal symptoms, such as a decline in memory or executive function, which a medical expert might use in a clinical diagnosis as to the nature and degree of her mental impairment. We rely on experts to tell us what view of her mental impairment emerges from her symptoms, but questions such as whether she is able to retain, understand, use and weigh information relevant to the decisions she makes are matters that are within our capability to assess and do not call for expert assistance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Additionally, I would note that the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Re BKR</span> [2013] 4 SLR 1257 (“<span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">BKR (HC)</span>”) held at [71] that the requirements under ss 5(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) to 5(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) are to be read conjunctively, following the English approach articulated in <span class="font-italic">Re F</span> [2009] EWHC B30 (Fam) (at [21]). A person must be able to understand, retain, and weigh the relevant information, and then communicate his decision if he is found able to make a decision. A deficiency in any one of these requirements would mean he lacks mental capacity. I understood from this guidance that the court’s assessment as to mental capacity should be made holistically. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 The principles as laid down in ss 3(2) to 3(6) of the MCA were also material to my assessment. These provisions specify as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2)    A person must be assumed to have capacity unless it is established that he lacks capacity.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3)    A person is not to be treated as unable to make a decision unless all practicable steps to help him to do so have been taken without success.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(4)    A person is not to be treated as unable to make a decision merely because he makes an unwise decision.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(5)    An act done, or a decision made, under this Act for or on behalf of a person who lacks capacity must be done, or made, in his best interests.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(6)    Before the act is done, or the decision is made, regard must be had to whether the purpose for which it is needed can be as effectively achieved in a way that is less restrictive of the person’s rights and freedom of action.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Of these, s 3(3) was raised specifically in the present case. Dr Tang, in particular, was concerned that it should not be too readily inferred that the second defendant could not make decisions in respect of the 2016 LPA as she could have been given assistance when executing it. But as will be discussed below, I was concerned that this principle could not be taken too far; the possibility of assistance rendered will not be able to correct for any deficit in capacity if a subject is found to be mentally incapable. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The relevance of undue influence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 I accepted the plaintiff’s argument that it was relevant to consider if there was some interaction between the second defendant’s mental impairment and the exertion of undue influence on her by her family members. The proven or potential presence of undue influence is relevant to the issue of mental capacity in three ways (<span class="font-italic">Re BKR </span>at [125] and [126]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [First, it is] material whether P is able to retain, understand or use the information that relates to whether there might be undue influence being applied, for instance whether P can understand that a third person may have interests opposed to his; and if not, whether that inability is caused by mental impairment. [Second,] it must be considered whether P’s susceptibility to undue influence is caused by mental impairment; if so, and if the result of such undue influence is that P’s will is so overborne that he is unable to use and weigh information relevant to the decision in question, P would be unable to make decisions “because of” mental impairment.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The third way in which undue influence is relevant is that it might mean that P cannot realistically hope to obtain assistance in making decisions. In such a situation, P may be found to lack capacity because of a mental impairment operating together with that lack of assistance. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 To this end, the plaintiff referenced <span class="font-italic">Royal Bank of Scotland v Etridge (No 2)</span> [2002] 2 AC 773, which distinguished between classes of actual and presumed undue influence. This categorisation has recently been affirmed in the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">BOM v BOK and another appeal</span> [2019] 1 SLR 349 (“<span class="font-italic">BOM</span>”). Although <span class="font-italic">BOM</span> was published after my decision in this case was rendered, it does not change the approach that is to be taken. Presumed undue influence, or “Class 2” undue influence, which was relied upon here, arises where the following conditions are met (<span class="font-italic">BOM </span>at [101]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… It suffices for the plaintiff to demonstrate (i) that there was a relationship of trust and confidence between him and the defendant; (ii) that the relationship was such that it could be presumed that the defendant abused the plaintiff’s trust and confidence in influencing the plaintiff to enter into the impugned transaction; and (iii) that the transaction was one that calls for an explanation. This class of undue influence is further divided into “Class 2A” and “Class 2B” undue influence, as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(ii) Under “Class 2B” undue influence, the plaintiff must prove that there is a relationship of trust and confidence. If it is shown that there was such a relationship and that the transaction calls for an explanation, then there is a <span class="font-italic">rebuttable</span> presumption of undue influence.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the second defendant lacked capacity in relation to her personal welfare, property and affairs</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 I first considered whether the second defendant was able to make decisions in relation to her personal welfare and her property and affairs because of a mental impairment. The declaration of incapacity that the plaintiff urged me to make was broad: see the Court of Appeal’s comments in <span class="font-italic">Re BKR </span>at [129]. This necessitated a wide-ranging assessment of the evidence in the round. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Accordingly, I took the second defendant’s cross-examination and the expert evidence into account. I also considered the circumstances in which the second defendant’s decisions were made, focusing in particular on the legal documents which she executed in 2016, and the possibility that she had been subject to the undue influence of her children at the time. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 In my weighing of the evidence, I gave little weight to the evidence relating to the second defendant’s relationship with her family members, Dr Yeo’s psychological assessment of her capacity, her previous medical assessments and the testimony given by her other family members. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 I now consider each factor in turn.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The second defendant’s cross-examination</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 The plaintiff argued that the second defendant’s testimony showed that she was incapable of retaining, understanding and using information that she had.

Both Dr Tan and Dr Fones opined that the second defendant was not suffering from any psychiatric disorder. The defendants also relied on Dr Tang’s conclusions as to the second defendant’s mental competence. They emphasised that Prof Kua’s conclusions were that persons with mild dementia would still be able to remember and weigh information and communicate decisions, and that the second defendant wanted the first defendant to continue taking care of her.

</div> This difference was not large: Prof Kua’s finding that the second defendant had mild-moderate dementia was just a shade beyond Dr Tang’s assessment that she had mild dementia. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Both experts found that the second defendant had capacity to make the 2016 LPA, but Prof Kua differed from Dr Tang in determining that she did not have capacity to make her 2016 Will. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Finally, although Prof Tang found that the second defendant’s financial capacity is impaired, Dr Tang concluded that she had the capacity to decide on her personal welfare and her property and affairs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 I ultimately concluded that the medical evidence showed that the second defendant was at the very least impaired in her judgment and mental abilities. In reaching this view, I did not rely on the second defendant’s performance on the stand, so as to avoid begging the question. I generally preferred Prof Kua’s evidence and accepted his conclusion that the second defendant’s memory retention was mildly impaired and that she was unable to make judgments or solve problems, given his more detailed and granular assessment through the tests conducted. I also observe the following.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 First, I took guidance from the Court of Appeal’s comments about the utility of cognitive test results in <span class="font-italic">Re BKR </span>at [149]. The results of the tests administered in <span class="font-italic">Re BKR </span>showed that there were deficiencies in [BKR]’s memory and executive functioning; however, the Court of Appeal cautioned that her performance on the tests did not disclose much as to whether she had capacity for the purposes of ss 4 and 5 of the MCA. For instance, the clock-drawing tests indicated only that [BKR]’s executive function was far from good; they assisted the Court little in its task of determining whether she was able to make decisions. Imperfect clock-drawing skills did not relate specifically to her ability to make decisions as she would encounter in the circumstances of her life (at [146]). To that end, cross-examination and clinical interviews were also relevant to the Court’s analysis. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Second, the concerns raised by the plaintiff about Dr Tang’s conclusions militated against my acceptance of his conclusions. I had to accept that the strength of his evidence was affected by his departure from the MOH guidelines on the administering and scoring of the AMT. Dr Tang’s primary conclusion appeared also to be influenced by his view that some of the second defendant’s difficulties with the AMT stemmed from her lack of education and age.

</div> But, as identified by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Re BKR </span>at [148], whether a subject is to be regarded as “normal” is not useful; the real focus is whether her executive function is impaired. In this regard, I did not find it helpful to postulate whether the cognitive tests were tailored to the second defendant’s specific demographic or educational profile. Instead, it was critical to observe that on both occasions when Dr Tang administered his version of the AMT, the second defendant was only able to recall one of three objects she was instructed to remember after 10 minutes had elapsed.

</div> On the whole, I did not think that this particular act of assistance was inappropriate; Dr Tang’s provision of some assistance when the second defendant was working out mathematical problems would not have affected his conclusion on her mental capacity and judgment to a significant degree. He had not coached her on the answers she should give nor prompted and guided her answers: see <span class="font-italic">Re BKR </span>at [152]. I emphasise only that the medial expert’s role is not to construe the requirements of the MCA, but to provide the assessment called for. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Fourth, although Prof Kua was of the view that the second defendant could have executed the 2016 LPA properly as it was a simple document, I could not in the circumstances allow the LPA to stand. I did not endorse Dr Tang’s conclusions as to the 2016 Will for similar reasons. I elaborate upon this below.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The legal documents executed in 2016 </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 I found, based on the second defendant’s cross-examination and the medical evidence, that the second defendant had an impairment or disturbance in the functioning of her mind. This manifested in her inability to recall short-term information and an impairment in her ability to use and understand information. In this section, I consider whether her mental impairment rendered her unable to make decisions in her daily life, scrutinising her execution of the 2016 Declaration of Intention, LPA and Will and highlighting the circumstances which did not appear consistent with her stated intentions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 I qualify that the conclusions I drew from the second defendant’s performance under cross-examination and the 2017 medical reports were not directly relevant to the question of whether she had capacity at the time she executed the relevant legal documents in 2016. Her dementia would have developed over time, and these <span class="font-italic">post facto</span> observations would not necessarily reflect her earlier condition. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The 2016 Declaration of Intention</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 The 2016 Declaration of Intention was not an operative instrument which the plaintiff sought to set aside directly; it was rather sought to be used by the plaintiff as an indication of undue influence exerted upon the second defendant by the first defendant. The document stated that the second defendant intended to “appoint and entrust [the first defendant] alone” to manage her money and other assets, and that it was her wish that her other three sons did not become involved with or make decisions or manage her assets. This document appeared to have been intended to address misunderstandings and to resolve tensions between the second defendant’s sons.

</div> The defendants argued that the evidence showed that the Will was properly executed, with independent advice being given by Mr Koh Mong Poo Sam (“Mr Koh”), counsel for the defendants in OSM 1/2017. Dr Tang had also assessed the second defendant as having the capacity to execute the 2016 Will, and his evidence was to be preferred to Prof Kua’s assessment, as he had testified that he had experience evaluating more complex wills. There was no evidence of any undue influence in relation to the 2016 Will. The second defendant’s difficulties in court in explaining the circumstances in which the 2016 Will was executed were explained by her mild dementia, age, low education and illiteracy in English.

Undue influence was made out as the two elements were present: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, there was presumed undue influence in the relationship between the defendants. The second defendant reposed trust and confidence in the first defendant, whom she had lived with from June 2016 onwards.

The first defendant also exercised dominion and control over her: he was her primary caregiver and would direct her as to what to do (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, to affix her signature on documents she was asked to sign).

On the facts, the parent-child relationship had been reversed as the mother was illiterate and feeble through old age and ill health; she placed much trust and reliance on the second defendant, who was the only son close to her. The transaction in question (a mortgage) was manifestly one-sided and not readily explicable by the mother-son relationship. In executing the mortgage, the mother placed her main asset to secure loans granted to the second defendant alone. There was no agreement on the use and repayment of the loans, and she had no say in these matters. The mortgage was clearly beneficial to him and disadvantageous to her. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 The facts in the present case were similar to those in <span class="font-italic">Tan Teck Khong</span>. The evidence showed that the second defendant reposed a great deal of trust and confidence in the first defendant, and that she was dependent and vulnerable beyond a normal degree. By the first defendant’s evidence, the second defendant was unable to look after herself because of her age and medical conditions.

</div> I took the view that it was extremely unlikely that the second defendant would have been aware of or familiar with these legal concepts, especially given that she could not even recall the contents of her affidavit or the circumstances she made it in. Given these facts in their totality, I found that a rebuttable presumption of undue influence arose, with the first defendant appearing to have had a hand in many of these events.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 This presumption was not rebutted by the arguments and evidence relied upon by the defendants. The defendants could only point to the fact that the second defendant favoured the first defendant and approved of his actions. Such evidence did not counteract any presumption of undue influence that might have arisen through their relationship, nor did it demonstrate that the second defendant was able to exercise independent judgment, which was at issue here. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 I would further note that much of the evidence relied upon by the defendants were assertions that the effect of the 2016 legal documents cohered with the second defendant’s intentions, and that it was in fact the plaintiff and the second defendant’s Third Son who had exerted undue influence on her by frightening her into moving her moneys into the Bank Account.

Dr Yeo eventually dispensed with a formal neuropsychological assessment. He instead provided Prof Kua with a report on the informal cognitive testing that he carried out, which Prof Kua elected not to include in his final report as it was inadmissible.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 I was of the view that Dr Yeo’s evidence could not be given much weight. I agreed with the plaintiff that it was the opinion of medical experts that was relevant to the court’s inquiry under the MCA. Psychologists are not medical professionals, even if their psychological assessments may feed into a medical practitioner’s assessments. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The evidence from the second defendant’s family members</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 While some of the second defendant’s family members, namely, one of her brothers (“Younger Brother”), her Third Son and her Daughter-in-Law, gave evidence about her mental capacity, I did not attach much weight to their testimony. The testimony from her family members varied considerably and was largely subjective. No objective evidence, such as in the form of videos or other recordings, were adduced that could have shed light on her behaviour and capacity in an out-of-court setting. Given the strong feelings that both sides of the family had as regards the present proceedings, I found that it was safer to reach a conclusion on what I perceived in the courtroom and what was observed by the medical experts.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on mental capacity</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 For the reasons above, I gave primary consideration to the second defendant’s performance in court and the medical experts’ opinions, and Prof Kua’s expert evidence in particular. Both factors established that she suffered from a mental impairment that manifested in a deterioration of memory and an inability to understand and use information. But a different conclusion could have been reached, if, for instance, her cross-examination was taken on its own and against strongly favourable expert opinion, and if it was shown that her performance on the stand did not accurately reflect her abilities.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 Relatedly, I found that the second defendant lacked the capacity to execute the 2016 legal documents. I did note that Prof Kua found that her capacity to make the 2016 LPA was not affected as he considered the LPA to be a simpler document than the 2016 Will. However, considering her performance on the stand, I was of the view that the second defendant’s ability was generally compromised. Adding to this substratum, the presumption of undue influence was unrebutted. This was relevant as regards the issue of mental capacity in the three ways identified in<span class="font-italic"> Re BKR</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [125] and [126]. The second defendant’s mental impairment affected her ability to discern whether undue influence was being exerted upon her; made her more susceptible to undue influence; and resulted in her inability to receive assistance, given that the party exerting the influence was also her primary caregiver. Taken together, the evidence pointed to a clear lack of capacity at the material times. The fact that these documents were nonetheless executed raised a distinct probability that the transactions in question were at least tainted by undue influence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 Considering the evidence as a whole, I was satisfied that the second defendant’s mental abilities fell short of what was stipulated in ss 5(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) to 5(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the MCA. Section 5(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the MCA, which concerned the second defendant’s ability to communicate decisions, was not at issue here. But this was not determinative; as noted in <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">BKR (HC) </span>at [71], the requirements in ss 5(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) to 5(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) are usually considered together. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 The nature of the second defendant’s difficulties also put into doubt the possibility that assistance of the sort contemplated under s 3(3) of the MCA would have made a difference. Section 3(3) states that a person is not to be treated as unable to make a decision unless all practicable steps to help him do so have been unsuccessful. I read this stipulation as geared towards facilitative assistance, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that which enables a person to make a decision. This could entail the use of simplifying language, memory aides, and the like: see also s 5(2) of the MCA. In other words, the assistance conceived of in ss 3(3) and 5(2) of the MCA is aimed at helping a person retain her existing decision-making ability. Given the second defendant’s performance in court, I had grave doubts that such facilitative assistance would be helpful to her. What was of concern here was that the second defendant’s ability was compromised to begin with: her inability to understand and retain information and to remember what was said minutes or hours before would prevent her from benefiting from any level of assistance that fell short of a substitution of judgment on her behalf. What she needed was not assistance under s 3(3) of the MCA, but a deputy to make decisions concerning her property and affairs on her behalf. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 For completeness, the defendants highlighted the fact that the second defendant is not educated and is illiterate.

</div> While it is perhaps true that her lack of education may hamper her at any age or at any level of dementia, sufficient judicial notice may be taken of the ability of many less educated persons who are able to get by and prosper even without formal schooling, by sheer dint of natural intelligence or experience.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 Finally, the possibility of the medical experts sitting in court and giving further opinions based on the second defendant’s performance on the stand was raised but not pursued, given the disposition of the case. On hindsight, that may have been a better way of disposing the matter, albeit at greater cost to the parties, who would have had to pay for the attendance of the experts in court. The other possibility would have been to have other doctors assess the second defendant’s mental capacity, but this was not pursued in these proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Consequential orders to be made</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 As permitted under s 19(1) of the MCA, I declared that that the second defendant lacked capacity to make decisions for herself in relation to matters concerning her personal welfare and her property and affairs because of an impairment of or a disturbance in the functioning of her mind or brain. In particular, she lacked capacity to make decisions in respect of the Bank Account and to commence and continue proceedings in OS 1096/2016. The following orders were consequential upon my declaration.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Revocation of the 2016 LPA and Will</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The 2016 LPA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 Section 17(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) read with s 17(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) of the MCA provides that the court may revoke an LPA if the donor lacks the capacity to do so, where undue pressure induced the donor to create the LPA. Given that I found that the 2016 LPA had been created in circumstances where the second defendant was under undue influence by the first defendant, I granted the plaintiff’s prayer in OSM 1/2017 seeking the revocation of the 2016 LPA.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The 2016 Will</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 The Court of Appeal has clarified that the definitions of capacity under ss 4 and 5 of the MCA are consistent with the common law principles regarding testamentary capacity: <span class="font-italic">Chee Mu Lin Muriel v Chee Ka Lin Caroline (Chee Ping Chian Alexander and another, interveners)</span> [2010] 4 SLR 373 (“<span class="font-italic">Muriel Chee</span>”) at [45]. For a will to be found valid, the testator must (a) have the mental capacity to make a will; (b) have knowledge and approval of the contents of the will; and (c) be free from undue influence or the effects of fraud: at [37]. The burden of proving that the testator possessed testamentary capacity falls on the propounder of the will: at [40]. Testamentary capacity will generally be presumed when the testator is not suffering from any kind of mental disability and the will was duly executed in “ordinary circumstances”: <span class="font-italic">UAM v UAN and another</span> [2018] 4 SLR 1086 at [57], citing <span class="font-italic">Muriel Chee </span>at [46]. This presumption does not arise where there are suspicious circumstances surrounding the execution of the will which would raise a well-grounded suspicion that the will did not express the mind of the testator; in these circumstances, the propounder must prove affirmatively that the testator knew and approved the contents of the will: <span class="font-italic">UAM </span>at [57] citing <span class="font-italic">Muriel Chee </span>at [48]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 This was not strictly a case that involved a propounder of a will seeking to prove its validity. But it followed from my findings above as to the second defendant’s lack of capacity at the material time and the presence of undue influence that she did not have testamentary capacity in relation to the 2016 Will. I therefore granted the plaintiff’s prayer in OSM 1/2017 for the 2016 Will to be set aside.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Appointment of deputies</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 I was empowered by s 20(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) read with s 20(1) of the MCA to appoint a deputy to make decisions on the second defendant’s behalf in relation to her property and affairs. My preferred option was to appoint as deputy a family member who was generally acceptable to the second defendant and her family members. Unfortunately, but not unexpectedly, this was not possible: the only real candidate was the second defendant’s Younger Brother, who declined to be appointed. I did not press this alternative further as he was fairly elderly himself, and his appointment would no doubt have added an additional burden to him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 The other option I considered was the appointment of a professional deputy, as permitted under s 24(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(iii) of the MCA. The statutory mechanism for doing so was not in effect at the time of my decision, but in any case, such appointment would not have been appropriate as it would have eaten into the second defendant’s funds, which were not really that large to begin with. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 As it was, I considered that the best option was to appoint two joint deputies, namely, the second defendant’s Youngest Daughter and Daughter-in-Law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 To date, I recognise that the two deputies are trying to execute their duties to the best of their abilities and their understanding of their roles. I do not know how long this may continue. An option that may have to be triggered would be the appointment of a single deputy, namely, the second defendant’s Daughter-in-Law, although the second defendant may not be on good terms with her and may not wish to deal with her. It may also come to pass that fairly intrusive orders need to be made, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, to remove the second defendant from her current care arrangements. It is hoped that these measures will be avoided. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Decision on the civil application</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 Based on the above evidence before me on her mental capacity, I was of the view that the second defendant did not have capacity to manage her moneys. A person lacking capacity may not bring a claim in any proceedings, except by his litigation representative: O 76, r 2 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R5, 2014 Rev Ed). Accordingly, I made no order in respect of the civil application in OS 1096/2016 by the second defendant for the return of the moneys in the Bank Account to her. In any case, I note that the second defendant has since closed the Bank Account and transferred the moneys that were in it to a new account at the same Bank.
