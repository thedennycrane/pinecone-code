font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Introduction</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">1 The touchstone for the grant of remedies under s 216 of the Companies Act 1967 (2020 Rev Ed) (“Companies Act”) is commercial unfairness. This is a broad concept that covers all dealings between shareholders concerning the affairs of a company. It is assessed in light of the commercial agreement between the parties. This matter raises the question whether unfairness on the part of one shareholder in negotiating changes to the arrangements between shareholders may potentially found the grant of remedies to the other shareholder, particularly where agreement to the changes was obtained by economic duress or undue influence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 In this matter, the eponymous owner of a restaurant business, together with her son and daughter, brought into the company as 50% shareholder (via his wholly-owned corporate vehicle) a man with an apparent track record of elevating family brands, including taking them beyond Singapore. At the time of his entry, the first three were working in the company and drawing modest salaries. In the years that followed, they raised their own salaries, staying within reasonable bounds. They did not tell the new shareholder of these increases. When he discovered these increases, he demanded changes to the shareholder arrangements. This included making an entry in the company’s accounts of a “loan” from the new shareholder’s corporate vehicle that exceeded in amount the total salaries paid to the first three since his entrance. If the company failed to repay this “loan” it would potentially be converted into equity for the new shareholder’s corporate vehicle, giving him a majority shareholding. The eponymous owner and her children agreed, and a new shareholders’ agreement was executed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 In these proceedings, the new shareholders’ agreement has been challenged on grounds of duress and undue influence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 At the heart of this case is the question whether the new shareholder’s outrage upon discovering the increases in salary was feigned or exaggerated to frighten and intimidate his fellow shareholders so as to secure unfair advantages for himself. If it was, does this amount to commercial unfairness?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 Assuming the claimants succeed, then a further question of appropriate remedy arises: should the court order a compulsory sale of shares by the substantive defendants as prayed for, rather than the more typical remedy of a compulsory purchase of the claimants’ shares by the defendants? Alternatively, is the most appropriate remedy a winding up of the company? </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 These proceedings are also impugned on the ground that they constitute an abuse of process, principally as an offer had been made to purchase the claimants’ shares by the substantive defendants, but also as a circumvention of an alleged exit mechanism.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 The claimants in both matters before me are the same. The first claimant is Ms Oon Swee Gek, known more widely as “Violet Oon”. I shall refer to her as “Ms Oon”. The second and third claimants are Ms Oon’s children, Ms Tay Su-Lyn and Mr Tay Yiming.

The claimants also submit that the 2019 Agreements were obtained by duress or undue influence and thus should be set aside. Alternatively, the claimants apply to court to wind up the Company on the basis of ss 125(1)(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) and 125(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) of the IRDA. However, they do not want the Company to be wound up if the court would instead grant them an order that Group MMM sell its shares to them. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 In opposition to the claimants’ submissions, the defendants contend that the claim under s 216 of the Companies Act should not succeed as there is no personal relationship between the claimants and Mr Murjani. Hence, there were no legitimate expectations which arose, and there was no commercial unfairness toward the claimants. Additionally, the 2019 Agreements should not be set aside as there was no duress or undue influence. If the court is satisfied that the claim under s 216 of the Companies Act is made out, the order should be for sale of the claimants’ shares to Group MMM and/or Mr Murjani as the “party with legal control of the Company”.

Commercial unfairness is the touchstone of a claim under s 216 of the Companies Act: see <span class="font-italic">Over &amp; Over Ltd v Bonvests Holdings Ltd and another </span>[2010] 2 SLR 776 (“<span class="font-italic">Over &amp; Over</span>”) at [81]. The commercial agreement between the parties sets the frame against which commercial unfairness is to be judged. This commercial agreement need not be enforceable as a matter of contract law to be worthy of protection under s 216 of the Companies Act. It is an agreement in the broadest sense as it may be found in informal understandings and assumptions attendant to the parties’ personal relationship: <span class="font-italic">Over &amp; Over</span> at [84] and [87]. In assessing commercial fairness, the court is therefore entitled to consider not only the parties’ legal rights, but also their legitimate expectations (<span class="font-italic">Sakae Holdings</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [82]). In this context, the term “legitimate expectation” describes the correlative “right” that the claimant shareholder is entitled to protect, a right that arises from the personal relationship between the parties: <span class="font-italic">Re Saul D Harrison &amp; Sons</span><span class="font-italic"> plc </span>[1995] 1 BCLC 14 at 19–20 and <span class="font-italic">O’Neill v Phillips</span> [1999] 1 WLR 1092 at 1100–1102).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 In this case, parties entered into a written agreement, namely the 2014 SHA. Prior to its execution, Mr Tay consulted a lawyer. On that lawyer’s advice, Mr Tay suggested changes that Mr Murjani accepted. Moreover, the 2014 SHA contained an entire agreement clause at cl 4.7. Legitimate expectations, however, are not the same as contractual terms. Failure to honour legitimate expectations does not give rise to contractual remedies such as damages. Rather, it grounds the possible grant of relief under s 216 of the Companies Act. In this case, the entire agreement clause did not purport to exclude understandings. Nonetheless, once parties have entered into a written agreement regulating their relationship as shareholders, it would be difficult to find that legitimate expectations co-existed with it unless they were both consistent with the written agreement and supported its spirit. Moreover, if what is put forward as a legitimate expectation is something that parties would be expected to record in a written agreement if they had that expectation, then its non-recording is an indication that there was no such expectation. Ultimately, this is a question of fact.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 I would add two general points. First, while legitimate expectations are not contractual terms and so not subject to the requirement of certainty, they do, if they exist, form the foundation and framework for the parties’ relationship in the company in which they are shareholders. For this reason, a legitimate expectation must be reasonably clear and straightforward. The more complicated, qualified, hedged, vague, or ambiguous a contended-for expectation is, the less likely it is that it operated as a legitimate expectation. Second, expectations must not be confused with “hopes” or “aspirations”. A legitimate expectation should set an objective baseline of behaviour or establish a clear red line that parties should not cross. If it is merely something parties hope will happen if all goes well, it will not amount to a legitimate expectation. Again, these points relate to factual analysis of the claim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 I have listed and labelled the alleged legitimate expectations at [22] above. Before I discuss them individually, I explain my views and state my findings on the extent to which the Company was founded on a personal relationship of mutual trust and confidence. The defendants would point to such matters as Mr Murjani being a professional and serial investor, and the parties’ shared ambition to professionalise what was, in origin, a family business (including with a view to growth beyond Singapore and potential sale in part or in whole to the profit of the parties), as indicating it was not a quasi-partnership. Instead, their position is that the parties shared, in essence, a business relationship governed only by its corporate constitutional documents and the 2014 SHA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 I agree that, given these elements, the Company was not a quasi-partnership. It was grounded in a personal relationship of trust. But that, in itself, does not make the Company a quasi-partnership. At the same time, shareholders in a company that is not a quasi-partnership may nonetheless on the facts share certain legitimate expectations concerning its governance. That the parties’ relationship began in trust is part of the context for determining whether on the facts there were understandings shared by the parties that were not fully articulated in the 2014 SHA and which were capable of giving rise to legitimate expectations. I have come to this view that there was a personal relationship of trust based on the evidence concerning how the parties’ relationship began, as well as how the 2014 SHA was drafted. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Mr Murjani came into the Company very much because of the personal characteristics of Ms Oon as an esteemed and well-reputed doyenne of Singapore Peranakan cuisine. Ms Oon and the other claimants, at a time described by the former as a “lovefest”, chose to partner Mr Murjani because he expressly presented himself to them as someone respectful and supportive of founders, and who was personally enthused by Ms Oon’s vision. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 While it is true that Mr Tay sought input from a lawyer for the 2014 SHA, it is also clear that this was a limited review that elicited only general suggestions for the draft that had come from Mr Murjani. I find that on 4 November 2014, there was an important discussion between the parties in-person and that, notwithstanding the entire agreement clause, the 2014 SHA was not intended to be exhaustive. That it was not exhaustive and there was no comprehensive legal review undertaken by either side is demonstrated by the fact that a key point, namely the relationship between Ms Oon and the Company that bore her name, was not addressed beyond a clause providing that Ms Oon’s activities, such as writing cookbooks or conducting cooking shows, should be channelled through the Company on terms to be agreed. There was no specification of whether and on what terms the Company was entitled to use Ms Oon’s name. For avoidance of doubt, the question of the relationship between Ms Oon and the Company, beyond her employ (see [9] above), is not agreed between parties and is a dispute outside the scope of this litigation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 I now turn to the asserted legitimate expectations. In relation to the 50/50 Shareholding LE, the presence of clauses contemplating the entry of third parties or external buyout (see cll 7, 8, and 9 of the 2014 SHA) militate against there being any such legitimate expectation. Parties started at 50/50, but this could change if the appropriate corporate processes were followed. There is no room for any different expectation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 In relation to the Co-Investing LE, I accept that both parties had the expectation at the start that there would be broad fairness and equality in how parties approached the sharing of financial responsibility and risk. Indeed, such an expectation follows from parties being equal shareholders, unless something has been said to the contrary at the initial stages of the relationship. I specifically find that Mr Murjani did not tell the claimants at the start that he would not give personal guarantees for any financing that might be required, and only told them this later when there was a need for bank borrowings.

</div> However, an expectation of broad fairness and equality leaves room for parties to make different contributions or have different responsibilities on different aspects, so long as overall this happens on broadly fair and equal terms.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 In relation to the Branding LE, I accept that both parties had the legitimate expectation that the branding would remain rooted in Ms Oon’s personal story and heritage. Naturally, in Ms Oon’s email dated 12 November she described it as “strongly rooted in Peranakan cuisine - the exquisite cooking of my culture - that of the Peranakans”.

</div> I do not accept that this meant that Ms Oon, or the other claimants, had any kind of veto over branding, or how the Company’s story would be told or its products marketed. Indeed, the claimants expected Mr Murjani to bring to bear his own marketing acumen to take the brand, if not global, at least overseas. I do not find that the content of cl 6.3 of the 2014 SHA, which provided that Ms Oon’s activities such as writing cookbooks or conducting cooking shows should be channelled through the Company on terms to be agreed, takes this point any further. This clause is really just a place marker for how parties should seek to agree terms whenever Ms Oon had opportunities that related to the brand value of the Company.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 I do not accept the Succession LE. While parties may have anticipated a continuing role beyond Ms Oon for her children, and perhaps especially for Mr Tay, this would have been dependent on performance and the circumstances in which the Company found itself. The 2014 “Successors” video certainly identified Ms Tay and Mr Tay as “heirs and heiresses” of the family business.

</div>
</div> I will consider what Mr Tay’s mental state was when I come to the arguments on economic duress and undue influence, but for the moment it suffices to say that Mr Tay’s failure to mention it does not, in my view, mean that it did not happen.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 I find that the word “nominal” or something like it was used during the meeting to describe the claimants’ initial salaries: see [12] above. The word “nominal” could mean not rising to the level of substantial, but in my view, what was meant was that they would not initially be receiving salaries commensurate with the work they were doing. In other words, their initial salaries were significantly less than what they deserved, constituting a form of voluntary contribution to the future growth of the Company. I do not find that there was any suggestion that the salaries would not increase, whether to reduce the gap between what was paid and what was commensurate with the work, or to reflect the Company’s growth. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Indeed, I go further and find that there was a discussion of how salaries would increase over time with a general road map for their increase being discussed in broad accordance with Ms Oon’s aide-memoire for the meeting. I accept her evidence on this point. I do not find, however, that the parties agreed that the claimants’ salary increases were simply to be at their discretion. I do not accept that this was said, in part because if it was said, it is hard to imagine that Mr Murjani would simply have agreed to this. It would be natural for him to have expected to be consulted when the time came for any increase, notwithstanding this not being the case for the other employees of the Company. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 I accept that for the foreseeable future the claimants expected to remain employees and directors of the Company with involvement in day-to-day operations and that Mr Murjani likewise expected them to do so, unless mutually agreed otherwise. Not only was the brand of the Company deeply associated with Ms Oon, but the expertise and experience relevant to a business rooted in Peranakan culture lay with her and her children. Thus, not only were they working in the Company, but they and Mr Murjani expected them to continue doing so because this was what was needed for the Company to operate and grow. Their working in the Company was clearly linked to their continuing roles as directors thereof. This point is distinct from whether there was a legitimate expectation of succession, which I have not accepted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 While I do not accept the Salaries LE entirely as framed, it is clear that the claimants legitimately expected (and Mr Murjani understood) that the claimants would continue to work and should be rewarded fairly for the work they put in, meaning that their remuneration would increase over time. In other words, the gap between what they were paid and the amount they ought to be paid on a commercial basis would ultimately narrow or disappear. This is consistent with the general point that it would not be fair for only one side to do the work if not remunerated reasonably for it. This is a key finding, because the fact that the increases were expressly foreshadowed and implicitly anticipated is material to how I view Mr Murjani’s reaction to his alleged discovery of them.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Turning to the Parties’ Roles LE, I accept that Mr Murjani held himself out as having expertise in branding and in bringing local brands overseas, and that this was a material reason why the claimants wanted him to join the Company as a shareholder (via his corporate vehicle(s)). I also accept that Mr Murjani was expected in a general sense to mentor the claimants in his areas of expertise. However, I do not see how this rises to the level of a legitimate expectation. It was more an aspiration in the context of a hopefully successful coming together of parties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Finally, the Parties’ Duties LE is, in my view, wholly otiose and redundant. There is no need for a separate legitimate expectation that other expectations will be honoured. As for the expectation that parties will act in the best interests of the Company or behave in accordance with their duties owed to the Company, this would appear to relate to their roles as directors, and such duties exist regardless of any legitimate expectation. Moreover, in appropriate cases, breaches of directors’ duties (or indeed prejudicial exercise of directors’ powers) may found relief under, among others, s 216 of the Companies Act independently of any legitimate expectations. There is no need to introduce an additional legitimate expectation in order that directors be accountable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 From this discussion, my conclusion is that there were only limited firm legitimate expectations underpinning the Company. As I have noted in the course of the discussion above, I accept that there was a shared legitimate expectation of broad fairness and equality in taking on financial responsibility and risk and a shared legitimate expectation that the claimants would work in the Company and be fairly remunerated for that work, such remuneration increasing over time. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Commercial unfairness </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The thrust of the claimants’ case is that Mr Murjani feigned outrage over the claimants’ increase in their salaries to pressure Mr Tay to agree to different arrangements, namely the 2019 Agreements, that were substantially more advantageous to the defendants. In their submission, Mr Murjani sought to take advantage of their vulnerability, including their exposure on personal guarantees that he did not have (see [11] above), as well as fear of potential civil or criminal liability. The claimants contend that Mr Murjani’s conduct amounted to duress or the exercise of undue influence.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether 2019 Agreements may be avoided on ground of economic duress</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 I begin with duress. Economic duress has long been recognised as a vitiating factor: <span class="font-italic">Third World Development Ltd v Atang Latief </span>[1990] 1 SLR(R) 96, where the Court of Appeal cited with approval the following <span class="font-italic">dicta</span> from the Privy Council decision (on appeal from Hong Kong) in <span class="font-italic">Pao On and others v Lau You Long and others </span>[1980] AC 614:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Duress, whatever form it takes, is a coercion of the will so as to vitiate consent. Their Lordships agree with the observation of Kerr J in <span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Occidental Worldwide Investment Corporation v Skibs A/S Avanti</span> [1976] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 293, 336 that in a contractual situation commercial pressure is not enough.

In determining whether there was a coercion of will such that there was no true consent, it is material to inquire whether the person alleged to have been coerced did or did not protest; whether, at the time he was allegedly coerced into making the contract, he did or did not have an alternative course open to him such as an adequate legal remedy; whether he was independently advised; and whether after entering the contract he took steps to avoid it.

Prakash J subsequently went on to consider categories of circumstances when a threat of lawful action is illegitimate as set out in <span class="font-italic">Enonchong</span>, including (at [50]):</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) where the threat is an abuse of legal process; </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) where the demand is not made <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span>; </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) where the demand is unreasonable; and </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(d) where the threat is considered unconscionable in the light of all the circumstances. </div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Prakash J’s view was that, once illegitimate pressure is established, the burden lies on the defendant to “prove that the pressure had not contributed to the plaintiff’s decision to execute the agreement”: <span class="font-italic">Tam Tak Chuen </span>at [62], following the Privy Council decision in <span class="font-italic">Alexander Barton v Alexander Ewan Armstrong</span><span class="font-italic"> and others </span>[1976] AC 104 (“<span class="font-italic">Barton v Armstong</span>”). This was followed in <span class="font-italic">E C Investment Holding Pte Ltd v Ridout Residence Pte Ltd and another (Orion Oil Ltd and another, interveners) </span>[2011] 2 SLR 232 (“<span class="font-italic">E C Investment</span>”) at [48], with the elaboration that this is a question of fact that is determined with reference to the circumstances of the case: <span class="font-italic">DSND Subsea Ltd v Petroleum Geo-Services ASA </span>[2000] BLR 530 at 545, <span class="font-italic">per </span>John Dyson J. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 In <span class="font-italic">E C Investment</span>, Quentin Loh Sze-On J (as he then was) generally agreed with the principles espoused by, among others, Prakash J (at [48]). However, Loh J cautioned that the doctrine of unconscionability could “open the door to uncertainty” and that “there remains a distinct and discernible difference between what is ‘illegitimate’ and what is ‘unconscionable’ and it is worth remembering that what is unconscionable is not necessarily illegitimate” (at [49]). Loh J further noted that “it certainly will be a very rare case indeed for a contract to be set aside for duress when only lawful means or pressure was used” (at [51]). Quoting Treitel, <span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract </span>(Edwin Peel ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 12th Ed, 2007) (“Treitel”)at para 10-005, Loh J emphasised, first, that there must be a distinction between “<span class="font-italic">agreements which are the result of mere ‘commercial pressure’, and those which are the consequence of unfair exploitation</span>” [emphasis in original]. The same passage that he cited from Treitel continued with the postulation that “<span class="font-italic">for economic duress</span>[,] <span class="font-italic">the minimum requirement before it can be said that the threat was a significant cause is to satisfy the ‘but for’ test, i.e. that the agreement would not have been made at all or on the terms it was made</span>” [emphasis in original]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 That postulation of the “but for” test in cases of economic duress differed from the position taken in <span class="font-italic">Tam Tak Chuen</span>, with which Loh J had appeared to agree at [48], namely that “once the plaintiff had proved that illegitimate pressure had been exercised on him, it was up to the defendant to prove that the pressure had not contributed to the plaintiff’s decision to execute the agreement”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 While there was an appeal on other aspects of Loh J’s decision, there was no appeal concerning economic duress: see <span class="font-italic">E C Investment Holding Pte Ltd v Ridout Residence Pte Ltd and others another appeal</span> [2012] 1 SLR 32 at [16]. Consequently, the question whether the burden of proof lies on the person said to have exerted pressure to prove that the pressure had not contributed to the decision to execute the agreement has only been considered at the level of the High Court. Moreover, such consideration was not strictly part of the <span class="font-italic">ratio</span> of those cases.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 In my respectful view, I do not agree that the burden of proof shifts in this way. Such a shift in the burden of proof would align the position for economic duress with that of duress to the person, but diverge from how another similar doctrine operates, namely misrepresentation, where the party seeking to avoid the contract must satisfy the “but for” test. The shift in the burden of proof is ordinarily justified for one of two policy reasons:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) persons in the position of the party to whom the burden shifts are likely to have special knowledge of that aspect of the case; or</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) to signal societal disapproval of the conduct that triggers the shift in the burden of proof.  </div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The party found to be exerting economic duress would not have better knowledge of the victim’s state of mind. While applying economic duress is far from laudable, it is hard to see why it would merit opprobrium more than the making of misrepresentations. The seriousness and reprehensibility of duress to the person is of a different order from economic duress. Thus, in this matter, I will not shift the burden of proof to the defendants. Rather, I will need to consider whether the claimants have satisfied the “but for” test.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 I appreciate that on this issue I depart from the position in <span class="font-italic">Tam Tek Chuen</span> at [62] <span class="font-italic">and E C Investment</span> at [48], which opined that after illegitimate pressure is proved by the claimant, the burden shifts to the defendant to prove that this pressure did not cause the victim to enter into the agreement. As noted at [50] above, Prakash J in <span class="font-italic">Tam </span><span class="font-italic">Tek Chuen</span> referred to the Privy Council decision in <span class="font-italic">Barton v Armstrong</span>, but in that decision one aspect of the duress took the form of threats to the person, including death threats. In that context of duress to the person, the shift in the burden of proof is settled law. In that context, it marks the law’s opprobrium for threats of physical harm as a means to coercing another’s signature to a contract or deed. The English law position on causation now clearly differs between duress to the person and economic duress, as summarised in <span class="font-italic">Chitty</span> <span class="font-italic">On Contracts</span> (Vol 1) (Hugh Beale ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell 34th Ed, 2022) at para 10-034, such that for economic duress there is no shift in the burden of proof and a “but for” test is applied: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">‘but for’ </span>In <span class="font-italic">Dimskal Shipping Co SA v I.T.W.F.</span> Lord Goff said that there may be duress where ‘the economic pressure may be characterised as illegitimate and has constituted a significant cause inducing the plaintiff to enter the relevant contract”. This dictum indicates that, as cases of duress of goods, the victim will not have the benefit of the reversed burden of proof in the same way as the victim of duress to the person, nor will it suffice that the threat was merely ‘one reason’ for his actions or ‘present to his mind’. As Mance J said in <span class="font-italic">H</span><span class="font-italic">uyton v Cremer</span>, by “significant cause” Lord Goff meant that what the judge termed the ‘relaxed view’ of causation in special context of duress to the person does not apply to economic duress. Mance J said: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">‘… the minimum basic test of subjective causation in economic duress ought … to be a “but for” test. The illegitimate pressure must have been such as actually caused the making of the agreement, in the sense that it would not otherwise have been made either at all or, at least, in the terms in which it was made. In that sense, the pressure must have been decisive or clinching.

</div>
</div> The exertion of pressure on Ms Oon and Ms Tay by Mr Murjani was mostly “second-hand”, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, communicated to them by Mr Tay, who was in primary contact with Mr Murjani leading up to the 2019 Agreements. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 I now elaborate on each of these, starting with the threats. Specifically, the claimants submit that, among other things, Mr Murjani made “direct oral threats to sue the [c]laimants and wind up the Company, and/or implicit or veiled threats to take action against the Company and/or the [c]laimants, to their detriment, if Mr Murjani’s demands were not met”.

</div> The defendants contend that because Mr Tay introduced, during cross-examination, new information about the alleged threats made by Mr Murjani that were not specified in his affidavits that Mr Tay was embellishing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 I do not accept this criticism of Mr Tay’s evidence and accept his evidence on this aspect of the case. It is not surprising that Mr Tay’s recollection of the threats is not specific or precise. People do not always or necessarily remember what exactly was said so much as the impression it had on them. I accept that Mr Tay understood that Mr Murjani was threatening to wind up the Company and expose him and his family members to claims on the personal guarantees, an exposure which Mr Murjani did not have. In my view, Mr Murjani made his meaning clear without being explicit. From my observation of him in the witness box, he appears to be someone equipped with an ability to manipulate others emotionally without spelling things out. His email dated 19 February 2019 shows how he made a veiled yet clear threat:

</div> </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… I do not want there to be any misunderstanding here.

I explain this further below at [69] to [74] but for the moment I simply note that even on Mr Murjani’s own position at the time, more than half of the moneys received by the claimants was at the quantum of salary as originally agreed to by him knowing and understanding that it was “nominal” by comparison with the work required of the claimants: see [37]–[39] and [41] above. Mr Murjani has also accepted that there was nothing unreasonable about the revised amounts and they were commensurate with the work done. On my reading of his email, Mr Murjani was deliberately frightening Mr Tay by referring to the whole amount and putting it in terms of “taking”. Plainly, when he went on to say that he was willing not to pursue the matter and sought a way forward that would not affect the claimants or the Company, he was also saying that if the claimants did not agree to what he wanted, he would pursue the matter and thereby affect both them and the Company.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 My assessment that Mr Murjani deliberately unsettled and intimidated Mr Tay by making allegations of serious misconduct that he knew to be untrue is additionally supported by his later behaviour in May 2022 in coupling a demand that Mr Tay “resign from being involved … in the management” with the accusation that Mr Tay was “using the company and its funds as if it [was his] own and [his] own piggy bank”.

</div> They say that such a suit or application to wind up would not be a criminal or civil wrong. But that is too simplistic. It overlooks two points. First, Mr Murjani knew and understood from the meeting on 2 November 2014, some four years before, that the claimants were not receiving salaries commensurate with their work and responsibilities, and that the plan was to increase those salaries as the Company grew. I also infer that he accepted that the increases were not unjustified or disproportionate as he has never attempted to suggest otherwise. Given his knowledge that increases were planned and his acceptance that the quantum of increases were themselves reasonable, any suit he might bring in the name of the Company would have no merit. Nor would a winding up application. I infer that he knew that at the time. Accordingly, he was implicitly threatening legal action that he knew had no merit. In his meetings with Mr Tay, he would have observed the effect that these threats had on Mr Tay and behaved in a calculated fashion to take advantage of Mr Tay’s weakness.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Mr Murjani’s second tactic was to exaggerate what the claimants had been “overpaid”. Based on the quantum of salaries the parties agreed the claimants were to draw upon the execution of the 2014 SHA, the total monthly payout for each of the claimants, consisting of the claimants’ take-home pay and additional CPF contributions from the Company were approximately (excluding any further deductions for whatever reasons) (the “Original Salaries”): </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Ms Oon: $5,850 per month; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Ms Tay: $1,170 per month; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Mr Tay: $5.265 per month.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The claimants periodically increased their respective salaries between January 2015 and November 2018.

</div> Mr Murjani’s evidence is that he became aware of these increases in December 2018. He then began discussions with the claimants, represented by Mr Tay, that ultimately culminated in the execution of the 2019 Agreements. In the course of these discussions, claims were made concerning the total amount of moneys which the claimants had allegedly “overpaid” themselves, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the total amount received by the claimants, collectively, in excess of their Original Salaries.

At this juncture, it suffices to reiterate that this sum included the figure of $1,666,667 that the claimants had allegedly overpaid themselves. Against this backdrop, Mr Murjani made several more proposals to resolve the salaries dispute and other disagreements between Mr Murjani and the claimants.

</div> the total amount received by the claimants in the form of salary increases, inclusive of CPF contributions from the Company on the increased salary quantum, amounts to $345,150. Second, and most importantly, there is no basis for the figures asserted by Mr Murjani. Based on the same spreadsheets, the total amount received by the claimants from December 2014 to November 2018 was $1,279,980. Further, although Mr Murjani claimed to have relied on a spreadsheet provided by Mr Tay for his estimate that the total amount “overpaid” was $1,250,000, this appears to be a deliberate misinterpretation of the information in said spreadsheet. Indeed, the spreadsheet does include the figure “$1,244,931.63”, however, it is unclear how this figure was derived. Regardless, the spreadsheet clearly states, “Total Overpayment + Interest (estimate) = $511,804.13”. Mr Murjani also admitted that some of the figures he quoted were of the entire amount, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, salaries, CPF, overpayments, and all, paid to the claimants, as opposed to just “overpayments”.

He was contriving a way for the Company to be required to pay Group MMM a balancing amount. Mr Murjani really had no explanation of how he arrived at the figures that he did. Not only is he well-educated and obviously highly intelligent, but he is also an experienced businessman. In fact, Mr Murjani admitted his awareness of the fact that the overpayments totalled only $330,000, claiming that he had suggested to resolve this issue by having the claimants pay back this sum to the Company.

After all, he is a university graduate with training in accountancy. If he had stopped to think for a moment, he might have understood that not only was Mr Murjani being unfair but that he was being unfair in order to frighten Mr Tay, at which point he could have gathered his resolve. Indeed, the claimants’ evidence is that they knew that Mr Murjani’s position was incorrect and, specifically, that the “overpayment” figures he estimated were fictitious.

</div> I accept her evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 In short, Mr Murjani, by pretending that he was outraged by the claimants’ increases in salary, sought to bully and confuse Mr Tay into ceding control of the Company to him. Mr Murjani exploited the situation to manoeuvre the claimants into agreeing to the invention of a “loan” that if not paid would be converted into equity for Group MMM. There were a number of difficulties with this. First, if the claimants had truly overpaid themselves, any moneys owed would be owed from the claimants to the Company. There is no legal basis for the amount that the claimants were paid, and more, to be treated as a shareholders’ loan owed by the Company to Group MMM. Second, the 2019 Terms provided, among other things, that Group MMM would receive the same amount of compensation as that received by the claimants collectively from 1 December 2018 onwards.

</div> As mentioned in the previous paragraph, the claimants’ compensations were paid to and received by them <span class="font-italic">qua </span>employees, as opposed to <span class="font-italic">qua </span>members. There is no basis for Group MMM, a corporate entity, <span class="font-italic">qua </span>member, to receive the same compensation as the claimants <span class="font-italic">qua </span>employees. Mr Murjani, being a seasoned businessman who has invested in several companies prior to the Company should be well-aware that there was no basis for Group MMM to receive funds from the Company in the manner he had suggested. Accordingly, regardless of whether his demands were lawful, they were, at minimum, unreasonable and not made in good faith. They smacked of attempted exploitation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 For clarity, I add that I do not accept that it is open to shareholders of a company, even acting unanimously when the company is solvent, to invent a loan owed from the company to a shareholder. This is what Mr Murjani attempted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 The only incontrovertible benefits enjoyed by the claimants following the execution of the 2019 Agreements are: (a) an increase in monthly salary for Ms Oon and Mr Tay; and (b) no threat of winding up of the Company and/or litigation by Mr Murjani and/or Group MMM as at the execution of the 2019 Agreements. The defendants have attempted to characterise the continuation of equal shareholding between Group MMM on one hand and the claimants on the other as another benefit enjoyed by the claimants, as opposed to converting $4,000,000 in alleged value of Group MMM’s contributions to the Company into a 70% shareholding in favour of Group MMM. This argument is, in my view, untenable. Putting aside the issue of whether there was a valid legitimate expectation of equal shareholding which constituted, in part, the commercial agreement between the parties in 2014, the basis of this benefit is Mr Murjani’s <span class="font-italic">unsubstantiated estimations</span> that Group MMM and himself had contributed $5,200,000 in value to the Company. Furthermore, the alleged “benefit” of continued equal shareholding was contingent on Group MMM receiving $1,550,000 and interest thereon from the Company within three years of the date of the 2019 Terms. Failing which, “[a]ny unpaid amount thereafter or in the event of capital being raised in the company prior to the 3 years will be converted to equity at the original value of the company”.

</div> The argument is that Mr Tay remained capable of deciding whether to enter the 2019 Agreements as he negotiated for the shareholding to remain equal between the parties. However, the question is whether the claimants would have entered into the 2019 Agreements taken as a whole, if not for the illegitimate pressure exerted. In my view, it clear that they would not have done so, but for the fear of the Company being wound up and their personal guarantees being called on, as well as other deeply unpleasant consequences. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 Thus, I find that the elements of economic duress, sufficient for vitiating the 2019 Agreements, are made out. I set aside the 2019 Agreements. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the 2019 Agreements may be avoided on the ground of undue influence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 The claimants also submit that the 2019 Agreements were obtained by undue influence. Having found that there was economic duress, I do not have to consider this alternative contention. However, it is helpful to consider the doctrine of undue influence in application to the facts because, while its starting point is different from economic duress, it sometimes traverses the same ground. The law may consider the facts through different lenses, but the victim may experience both pressure and influence from a wrong-doer at or about the same time. Consequently, in order to do justice in the round, both vitiating factors are often properly considered together. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 Undue influence divides into proved actual undue influence, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Class 1 undue influence, and presumed undue influence, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Class 2 undue influence. The latter subdivides into undue influence rebuttably presumed from an irrebuttably presumed relationship of trust and confidence, such as solicitor-client relationships, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Class 2A undue influence, and undue influence rebuttably presumed from a proved relationship of trust and confidence, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Class 2B undue influence. In relation to actual undue influence, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">BOM v BOK </span>expounded that (at [103], referencing <span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract in Singapore </span>at para 12.123): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the heart of the inquiry is <span class="font-italic">whether the person exercising the undue influence has ‘exercised such domination over the plaintiff victim’s mind that his independence of decision was substantially – or even totally – undermined’</span> … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 For actual undue influence, it must be shown that the influencer had the capacity to influence the victim in the circumstances prevailing at the time of the transaction. Such capacity to influence may lie in vulnerabilities of the victim that the influencer exploits, or in the victim’s misplaced trust that overall, the influencer is acting in the victim’s best interests. Here, the main contention of the claimants is that Mr Murjani was a mentor to Mr Tay and used this relationship to manipulate Mr Tay. As I have found above at [88], Mr Murjani exerted illegitimate pressure on Mr Tay and, by extension, the claimants as a whole. This pressure resulted in the latter agreeing to, among other things, onerous terms, such as the Company owing Group MMM an additional $300,000, to maintain the existing shareholding structure. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 I have found that the claimants made these decisions because of illegitimate pressure exerted by Mr Murjani. This is not inconsistent with Mr Murjani having exercised undue influence over Mr Tay, whom the former insisted on negotiating with to the exclusion of Ms Oon and Ms Tay. I accept that the claimants were aware that Mr Murjani’s allegations were false

Such ignorance was implausible, given his evident high proficiency in the English language. Moreover, there are many examples in the written record which give a strong indication of how he would have spoken to Mr Tay as well. I cite some examples from Mr Murjani’s email to Mr Tay sent at 9.32pm on 19 February 2019.

</div> and this was particularly clear in the case of Mr Tay. This fact supports my finding that Mr Murjani exercised actual undue influence over Mr Tay.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 Having found the claimants have successfully proved, based on the material before me, that Mr Murjani in fact exercised undue influence over Mr Tay, I do not need to determine whether Mr Murjani’s mentorship rose to the level of a relationship of such trust and confidence that gives rise to a rebuttable presumption of undue influence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 Mr Murjani was one person, the claimants three. Mr Murjani directly exerted undue influence only on Mr Tay. As I have found at [63(d)] and [82], this was a deliberate strategy on Mr Murjani’s part. Nonetheless, it raises the question whether Ms Oon and Ms Tay should be entitled to rely on actual undue influence of Mr Tay to avoid the 2019 Agreements. While the economic duress applied to Mr Tay plainly affected mother and sister too, only Mr Tay was directly besieged with emotional bullying and manipulation. The law expects adults who are not incapacitated or vulnerable to take responsibility for their own interests. However, the facts of this case are special. I am satisfied that both Ms Oon and Ms Tay were deeply disturbed by the toll on Mr Tay and just wanted the nightmare to stop. In this way, the reach of Mr Murjani’s undue influence extended to them as well.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Abuse of process </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 The defendants submit that both OC 301 and CWU 195 constitute an abuse of process on the claimants’ part and hence the latter are disentitled from bringing OC 301 and CWU 195.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">OC 301</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 Both the claimants’ and the defendants’ submissions on the issue of abuse of process rely on the two-stage framework set out in <span class="font-italic">Kroll, Daniel v Cyberdyne Tech Exchange Pte Ltd and others </span>[2023] 4 SLR 484 (“<span class="font-italic">Daniel Kroll</span>”) at [135] (“<span class="font-italic">Kroll </span>Framework”).

</div> It is not a clause that the claimants could unilaterally operate nor obtain specific performance of. Moreover, Mr Murjani did not express interest to be bought out by the claimants. The claimants for their part have been adamant about not wanting to be bought out by Mr Murjani. The parties did not enter into negotiations. Such a clause effectively does no more than mandate negotiations, presumably to be undertaken in good faith.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 I agree with her concession. Section 216(2) of the Companies Act mandates making such order as the court thinks fit “with a view to bringing to an end or remedying matters complained of”, as well as providing by s 216(2)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) specifically for the purchase of shares in the company without limiting this to shares of the applicant. Section 125(3) of the IRDA similarly permits the court to order the purchase of shares without limiting it to shares of the applicant: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…if it is of the opinion it is just and equitable to do so, make an order for the interests in shares of one or more members to be purchased by the company, or by more other members, on terms to the satisfaction of the Court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 One argument against making this order on the present facts is that my setting aside the 2019 Agreements has put an end to the matters complained of. On this view, the parties can continue in the Company on the basis of their original arrangements. Moreover, setting aside the 2019 Agreements means that:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the Company is under no liability in relation to the Group MMM Loan, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Company does not owe $1,550,000 to Group MMM, (although in my view it is not open to shareholders even of a solvent company and even acting unanimously to invent a liability for the company to one of their number: see [84] above); </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Group MMM will no longer receive the same amount of compensation as the sum totalling the claimants’ monthly salaries; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Mr Murjani would no longer be Chairman of the Company’s board and CEO of the Company; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Ms Oon and Ms Tay would rejoin the Company’s board.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 Nonetheless, I do not agree that the cat can be put back in the bag in this way. I find that the claimants’ concerns about continuing to work with Mr Murjani are wholly reasonable. Mr Murjani’s professed willingness to work with the claimants does not solve the problem. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 Another point might be that the Company should be wound up. It might be said that the general principle that a company which remains a going concern should not ordinarily be wound up merits an exception where this would achieve some other end for the parties, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, the possibility of an open bidding process for the company’s business that both sets of shareholders could participate in. However, in this case neither truly seeks a winding up, at least not other than as a last resort. Making such an order would risk the Company losing enterprise value which is not in the interests of either the claimants or the defendants. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 I accept that ordering the defendants to an oppression action to sell their shares should be rare. It involves an interference with their property rights. However, I hold that this is one such rare case. I consider it material that the Company carries the name of Ms Oon. It was very much a family business. All three claimants were and are involved “hands-on”. Moreover, it represents Ms Oon’s legacy, in a general sense of the word. Both son and daughter legitimately and reasonably wish to uphold and continue their mother’s legacy. I further consider that Mr Murjani will not be punished by such an order, as the purchase price for Group MMM’s shares will be determined by valuation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 I turn now to the question of valuation. The defendants contend that any purchase of Group MMM’s shares must be at fair value, presumably on a going concern basis. I accept this contention. However, parties have not fully addressed the basis of valuation. I have in mind two points (but there may be others): </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) whether there should be a premium factored in for control; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) whether there should be any discount for lack of marketability.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 My provisional view is that there should be a premium for control and no discount for lack of marketability. Were the parties to negotiate freely on a buy-out, there would have to be a premium applied because the buyer would achieve control as a result of the purchase. As Group MMM is a reluctant seller, it would not be fair to discount its shares for lack of marketability when it has not wanted to market its shares anyway. Nonetheless, if the parties are not able to agree on these or other aspects of the basis for valuation, they are at liberty to apply and I will hear them.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 There remains one other aspect of the basis for valuation. That is how the valuation should treat the Company’s rights to use and exploit its name. Belatedly, the claimants have contended that Ms Oon is in the position of licensor and is entitled to charge for use and exploitation of her name, notwithstanding that she has never done so. As I have indicated at [29], what the position is in law is not an issue before me. However, I do have power to make directions concerning the basis of valuation. In my view, regardless of the true legal position between Ms Oon and the Company, it is fair that Group MMM’s shares be valued on the basis that the Company has the right to use and exploit the name in connection with its business without payment of any fee to Ms Oon.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 Turning to the identity of the valuer, parties should seek to agree on an independent valuer, failing which parties may refer the choice of independent valuer back to me.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 I make no order on CWU 195. My order for the purchase of the Group MMM’s shares is made in OC 301 pursuant to s 216 of the Companies Act.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Costs </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132  Parties are to seek to agree both the incidence and amount of costs, bearing in mind that there are two separate proceedings. Failing agreement within 14 days of this judgment, either party may write in for me to determine incidence and assess the costs. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 I am satisfied that Mr Murjani exerted economic duress and undue influence in order to change the shareholder arrangements with a view to his taking control of the Company. While I have set aside the changes, this does not completely remedy or bring to an end the matters complained of. Moreover, the court should not leave the shareholders to stew in distrust, enmity, and potential deadlock. The appropriate remedy is for the claimants to buy-out the defendants’ interest in the Company at fair value. </div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Philip Jeyaretnam <br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Meryl Koh Junning, Justin Lai Wen-Jin, Shahera Safrin, and Daniel Wong Sheng Jie (Drew &amp; Napier LLC) for the claimants in HC/OC 301/2022 and HC/CWU 195/2022;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">The first defendant in HC/OC 301/2022 and HC/CWU 195/2022 absent and unrepresented;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Thio Shen Yi SC, Chew Xizhi Stephanie, and Phoon Wuei (TSMP Law Corporation) for the second and third defendants in HC/OC 301/2022.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
