At the trial before me on 18 October 2016, the prosecution proceeded on the first charge, which is punishable by death. That charge (“the Charge”) was as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-underline">1ST CHARGE</span> on 12 October 2011, at about 11:50 am, inside a car (registration number SGW 5275 L), at Jurong West Street 52, Singapore, did traffic in a controlled drug specified in Class '”A” of the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act, Cap 185 (“MDA”), <span class="font-italic">to wit</span>, by having in your possession for the purposes of trafficking,  fifteen (15) packets and six (6) bundles containing <span class="font-weight-bold">not less than</span> <span class="font-weight-bold">61.75 grams of </span><span class="font-weight-bold">diamorphine</span>, without any authorisation under the said Act or the regulations made thereunder, an offence under s 5(l)(a) read with s 5(2), MDA and punishable under s 33(1), MDA, and further upon your conviction, you may alternatively be liable to be punished under s 33B, MDA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 After the Charge was read to the accused, he pleaded guilty. However, s 227(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”) states that, where the offence is punishable with death, the court shall not record the plea of guilty unless evidence is led by the prosecution to prove its case at trial. Accordingly, I called upon the prosecution to give evidence to prove the Charge.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The prosecution gave evidence by way of a statement of agreed facts (“SAF”) to be used as a formal admission under s 267 of the CPC. Counsel for the accused confirmed that the accused agreed to the contents of the SAF and its use under s 267 of the CPC.

They were informed to look out for a male Malay known by the nickname “Boy”, who was suspected of involvement in drug activities. The CNB officers then proceeded to the vicinity of Blk 336 Woodlands Avenue 1, and kept observation. At about 11.16am, the accused, who fitted the description of “Boy”, was seen walking at the ground floor of Blk 336 with a sling bag and a plastic bag. He then entered a car bearing registration number SGW 5275L (“the Car”) which was driven by another person.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">3 The CNB officers then followed the Car from Blk 336 Woodlands Avenue 1 to the car park at Blk 4 and Blk 5 Marsiling Road. At the car park, near to Blk 5 Marsiling Road, the accused handed an envelope, which he knew contained heroin, to an unknown female Chinese. The Car left the car park at about 11.30am. The officers continued following the Car until it reached the car park behind Blk 525 and Blk 527 Jurong West Street 52, Singapore, which was in the vicinity of Blk 523.

Both the accused and Anuar knew that “L1” and “L1A” contained heroin;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(ii) wait for a call from a Malaysian male who would provide further instructions on when and who to deliver “L1” and “L1A” (with the 6 bundles) to; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(iii) take envelopes, which both the accused and Anuar knew that each envelope contained heroin, from the storeroom of the Flat. Anuar informed the accused that he would provide further details on the delivery of these envelopes later in the day.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The accused proceeded to assist Anuar. After retrieving the relevant items from the storeroom, the accused put “L1A” (with its contents) inside “L1”. He also placed the said envelopes into his black sling bag.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) Subsequently, the accused received a call from an unknown Malaysian male who instructed him to deliver “L1” and “L1A” to one “Hassan” at Blk 523 Jurong West. The accused acknowledged the said instructions. The call was made from a Malaysia-registered phone line. The said Malaysian male informed the accused that “Hassan” was a male Chinese and also provided the latter’s contact number which the accused saved in his mobile phone as “Hassan (JW)”.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) At about 11am, Anuar called the accused and told him to deliver one of the envelopes to an unknown female Chinese at Blk 5 Marsiling Road before proceeding to Jurong West. The accused acknowledged what the accused had conveyed to him.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">15 At about 11 am, the accused left the Flat carrying his black sling bag (containing the envelopes of heroin) and “L1” (containing 6 bundles of heroin). At about 11.16am, the accused boarded the Car, driven by Hairil, and sat in the front passenger seat. Hairil then drove the Car to the car park at Blk 4 and Blk 5 Marsiling Road. There, the accused delivered one of the envelopes to the said unknown female Chinese, as earlier told to do so by Anuar.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">16 The accused then requested Hairil to drive the Car to Jurong West. At about 11.30am, the Car left the said Marsiling Road car park. At about 11.50 am, the Car reached the car park behind Blk 525 and Blk 527 Jurong West Street 52, which was in the vicinity of Blk 523. There, CNB officers stopped the Car and placed the accused under arrest.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">17 As at the time of his arrest on 12 October 2011, the accused was not authorised under the MDA or the regulations made thereunder to traffic in a controlled drug.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 Upon admission of the SAF in evidence, the prosecution rested its case. I found that the prosecution had made out a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case and called upon the accused to give his defence in accordance with s 230(1)(<span class="font-italic">m</span>) of the CPC. The accused elected to remain silent. Thereafter, I found that the evidence before me was sufficient to prove the accused’s guilt and convicted him of the Charge.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The prosecution tendered a certificate by the Public Prosecutor stating that the accused had substantively assisted the Central Narcotics Bureau in disrupting drug trafficking activities within or outside Singapore. After hearing submissions by counsel, I agreed that the evidence showed that the accused’s involvement in the offence was restricted to transporting, sending or delivering the controlled drug which was the subject of the Charge. Accordingly, by operation of s 33B(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA, this court had a discretion to impose a sentence of life imprisonment with caning instead of the death penalty.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 After considering the accused’s antecedents and his counsel’s plea in mitigation, I found that this was an appropriate case to exercise the discretion to impose the lesser punishment. Accordingly, I sentenced the accused to life imprisonment with effect from the date of his arrest on 12 October 2011 and to the mandatory minimum of 15 strokes of the cane.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Lee Seiu Kin<br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Lau Wing Yum and Tan Yanying (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the public prosecutor;<br/>Masih James Bahadur (James Masih &amp; Company), Prasad s/o Karunakarn (K Prasad &amp; Co) and Christopher Anand s/o Daniel (Advocatus Law LLP) for the accused.<br/></div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
