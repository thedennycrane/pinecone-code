<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This judgment deals with the petitioner
                    wife’s claim to a share in the matrimonial assets and maintenance
                    post-divorce.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The parties were married in 1956. Thereafter,
                    they had four children born between 1956 and 1967. All the children are
                    independent and self-supporting. In April 2005, the wife presented a petition
                    for divorce on the ground of adultery between the husband and the party cited.
                    The decree nisi was granted in July 2005. For various reasons, the ancillary
                    matters did not come up for hearing until September last year.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       At the time of the hearing, the wife was 71
                    years old while the husband was 73 years old. The husband is a man of
                    substantial means but the wife made many allegations relating to inadequate
                    disclosure on his part, allegations that he strongly refuted. The need to
                    consider these allegations carefully led me to reserve judgment. In the
                    meantime, however, the wife asked that an interim order be made against the
                    husband to make a payment to account of her share of the assets. It appeared
                    from the husband’s submissions that he was worth at least $52m and that he
                    considered that the wife should be awarded 20% of the matrimonial assets.
                    Conveniently, there was a sum of $11m in court. Having considered the
                    submissions, I decided that the wife would be entitled to at least $11m as her
                    share of the matrimonial assets and I therefore ordered that this sum be paid
                    out of the money held in court to the wife forthwith to account of her share in
                    such assets as the same was thereafter determined.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The following account of the marriage and of the
                    parties is largely undisputed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The parties had only primary school education.
                    The husband’s first job was as a hawker’s assistant. In 1952, he
                    joined the Singapore Harbour Board (subsequently the Port of Singapore Authority
                    (“PSA”)) as a tally clerk. In 1970, the husband set up a firm
                    known as Sea Well Industrial and Ship Supply Company (“Swissco”)
                    which was a sole proprietorship carrying on business as a ship-chandler. He left
                    the PSA in 1970 to concentrate on Swissco and it gradually expanded. In November
                    1970, it was converted into a private limited company called Swissco Pte
                    Ltd.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The husband’s first office was rented from
                    the wife’s elder brother and it was a small space in Chow House in
                    Robinson Road. There was no telephone line in the office and the husband used
                    the home telephone line to receive purchase orders from his customers and to
                    communicate with them. At that time, the wife would take these telephone calls
                    and relay messages to the husband. In the initial stages of the business, there
                    were occasions when the husband took the wife along to dine with his customers.
                    On other occasions, she took the customers’ wives out for sightseeing and
                    shopping.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       According to the wife, apart from entertaining
                    customers, she also accompanied the husband on his trips to deliver goods.
                    Additionally, she often cooked and delivered lunch meals to the office staff.
                    The wife also asserted that in the late 1960s, she had borrowed $20,000 from her
                    mother and passed the sum to the husband to assist him in meeting the start up
                    costs for the business. The husband was also able to obtain favourable credit
                    terms from a company known as Wah Hong Pte Ltd which was a major ship supplier
                    belonging to the wife’s father because of his relationship with the
                    wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The wife did not hold paid employment after
                    marriage. Her main role was as homemaker and mother. The husband paid all the
                    expenses of the home and the children’s upbringing. He paid for them to
                    obtain tertiary education overseas and for their travels abroad. He also paid
                    the expenses for the domestic maids employed by the family.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       In 1975, the husband transferred his business to
                    a new company called Swissco Offshore (Pte) Ltd (“Swissco
                    Offshore”). In January 1979, he incorporated another company, Yeo
                    Holdings Pte Ltd (“YHPL”) to buy and sell shares in Singapore. In
                    July 1979, YHPL bought a property known as No 14 Lornie Road which the
                    parties moved into and occupied as their matrimonial home. It remained as such
                    until the wife moved out after filing her divorce petition in April
                2005.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Due to the husband’s unceasing and
                    tireless efforts, he was able to build up an extremely profitable and diverse
                    business in the marine industry. On 29 January 2004, the husband procured
                    the incorporation of a new holding company, Swissco International Ltd
                    (“SIL”). The main shareholder in this company was YHPL. In late
                    2004, the husband was instrumental in the restructuring of his group of marine
                    companies and listing SIL on the Singapore Stock Exchange. The initial public
                    offer of the shares was at 0.28 cents per share and at its peak in 2008, the
                    price of the shares reached $1.50 per share. By September 2009, the shares were
                    valued at 0.84 cents each. At this time, YHPL held 107,976,797 SIL shares which
                    were therefore then worth $90,700,509.48.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The assets of the parties as disclosed</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The wife</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The wife disclosed rather meagre assets. She
                    said this was because she was a homemaker all her married life. The assets that
                    she disclosed are as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Pursuant to an order of court made in June
                    2005, the wife was receiving monthly maintenance of $6,000. She was living with
                    one of her daughters at the time of the hearing and had no home of her own. When
                    queried by the husband as to why she had not disclosed her jewellery as part of
                    the matrimonial assets, her response was that the items had been given to her by
                    the husband and she regarded them as gifts.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The husband</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The husband declared that he had the following
                    assets which were part of the matrimonial property:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The husband declared liabilities totalling
                    $9,853,735.17. Slightly over $3m of these liabilities related to his
                    hire-purchase obligations in respect of the vehicles he owned and the
                    outstanding balances on two overdraft accounts which he had in respect of the
                    Wak Hassan Drive and Andrews Terrace properties. The balance of $6.8m related to
                    an overdraft liability of YHPL. The husband took responsibility for this
                    overdraft as guarantor and shareholder of YHPL.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     On the husband’s estimation of assets
                    that could be classified as matrimonial assets, his total holdings (less the
                    YHPL overdraft of $6.8m) had a value of $51.2m. The husband also estimated the
                    wife’s assets as having a total value of $860,000. The difference between
                    his figure and the wife’s figure came from the fact that he valued the
                    wife’s 100,000 shares in Swissco Marine Pte Ltd at $600,000 whilst the
                    wife did not give them a value. Even if the wife’s assets were to be
                    valued in accordance with the husband’s estimation, it is clear that her
                    worth is only a tiny fraction of his.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Was there a lack of full and frank disclosure on the part of the
                husband?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The wife argued that the husband’s
                    disclosure in the proceedings had been less than forthcoming. For instance, he
                    had attributed several figures to various assets in his ancillary matters
                    affidavits. These, however, were mostly estimates with little supporting
                    documentation. In the Declaration of the Value of Matrimonial Assets filed by
                    the husband on 15 June 2009, he had failed to set out several assets
                    mentioned in his earlier affidavits. A property known as 6 Chestnut Close had
                    been mentioned under “outstanding liabilities” but there was no
                    mention of it in the section pertaining to the assets. Further, the husband had
                    not given any account of assets which had been purportedly disposed
                of.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     In his first ancillary matters affidavit filed
                    on 21 September 2005, the husband had failed to disclose a substantial
                    number of assets. He claimed that he did not own any movable property in his own
                    name or jointly with any other person, failed to disclose that he had an account
                    with the ANZ Bank and also claimed that he had no other shares apart from his
                    shares in YHPL. All these statements were not true. Even in his third affidavit
                    filed on 30 July 2008 (“the July 2008 affidavit”), he took
                    the position that the only assets that YHPL held were its 98,160,75 shares in
                    SIL and the $11.5m which had been injuncted. This was despite the fact that on
                    1 April 2008, consequent to a bonus issue, the shareholding of YHPL in SIL
                    was increased to approximately 107 million shares. Further, the property known
                    as 6 Chestnut Close had been purchased for $10.5m in October 2007 by YHPL.
                    Although the court had ordered discovery of several documents and information in
                    respect of YHPL and related companies such as Swissco Marine Pte Ltd and Swissco
                    Structural &amp; Mechanical Pte Ltd as early as September 2006, the documents
                    have not been disclosed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The wife submitted that the court should draw
                    adverse inferences against the husband for such failures of discovery. The
                    husband did not respond in detail to these allegations. It appears to me that he
                    has no substantive answer to them. This is a matter that I will bear in mind as
                    I consider the issues.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Should adjustments be made to the values of the parties’
                assets?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     I must now deal with the arguments in relation
                    to the valuation of the husband’s assets because the wife does not accept
                    that the husband is worth only $52m.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Value of YHPL shares</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The husband’s most substantial asset is
                    his interest in YHPL. Before the bonus issue referred to at <a href="#p1_18">[18]</a> above, the records of YHPL showed that the
                    husband owned 5,592,298 ordinary shares in YHPL out of an issued share base of
                    9,478,472 ordinary shares. This amounted to 59% of the shareholding of YHPL. The
                    remaining shares were registered in the names of the children as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The wife submitted that the husband should be
                    treated as owning the entire issued share capital of YHPL. She said that he was
                    the alter ego of YHPL and effectively controlled YHPL and through it SIL. That
                    YHPL was the controlling shareholder and substantial shareholder of SIL had been
                    stated in the prospectus that SIL issued at the time of listing. Further, the
                    husband had himself stated in one of his affidavits that when he incorporated
                    his companies, he had put the wife’s as well as his children’s and
                    siblings’ names down as shareholders and sometimes as directors. However,
                    he asserted that he was the one who ran the business and the wife and the
                    children never paid him for the shares which were in their names. He explained
                    that he could not have become the sole shareholder or director of his companies
                    as at the relevant time, the Companies Act did not permit this and therefore it
                    was not uncommon to use the names of family members as
                shareholders.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The husband also stated in the July 2008
                    affidavit that his daughters had failed to pay to YHPL the respective amounts
                    that they owed it in respect of the shares and had continued to refuse to make
                    payment despite a legal demand for the same made by his previous solicitors. He
                    went on to say that in view of their refusal he would exercise his rights over
                    the allotted shares in due course. It should be noted that in his
                    solicitors’ letter of 18 December 2006, the husband’s solicitors had
                    stated that since neither daughter had paid for the shares, the husband would be
                    taking steps “to rescind the … allotment and exercise his rights
                    as beneficial owner of the said shares”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The wife drew my attention to the fact that,
                    at the beginning of 2004, she was a registered shareholder of YHPL in respect of
                    1,885,966 shares whilst the husband held 3,901,604 shares. In or about November
                    2004, without the wife’s knowledge or consent, the husband had procured
                    the transfer of the wife’s shares in YHPL to himself and to their daughter
                    Catherine Yeo by forging the wife’s signature on the transfer forms. It is
                    significant that the husband admitted to this forgery. As a result of the same,
                    the husband’s registered shareholding in YHPL was increased to 5,592,298
                    shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The husband had claimed in the July 2008
                    affidavit that he did not beneficially own all the shares in YHPL that were
                    registered in his name. He asserted that around the time that SIL was listed, he
                    promised his brother, Yeo Chong Boon, and his sister, Yeoh Ai Tin Anna, that
                    they would each be entitled to ten percent of the total issued and paid up
                    capital of YHPL for their hard work in assisting him in building up the
                    business. He exhibited two written declarations of trust which he had executed
                    in favour of his siblings and further stated that each of them was entitled to
                    947,847 ordinary shares which meant that his net holding should be adjusted to
                    3,696,534 ordinary shares. The wife argued that if the trust documents had
                    indeed been executed in November 2004, the husband would not have failed to
                    indicate the existence of such trusts in his earlier affidavits. However, he had
                    mentioned the trusts for the first time only in the July 2008 affidavit which
                    was filed three years after the commencement of the proceedings. The wife
                    contrasted the husband’s statement in this affidavit with his assertion in
                    his earlier affidavit of 18 November 2005 that the shares in YHPL in the
                    wife’s name “are not owned by [the wife] in the first place. The
                    shares are also not owned by the family members or even by my
                    siblings”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In his final submissions, the husband declared
                    the full number of shares registered in his name as being part of his own
                    assets. He did not contend that the value of only 3,696,534 shares out of the
                    5,592,298 shares should be ascribed to him. I think therefore that the
                    husband’s assertion that his siblings were the beneficial owners of part
                    of his shareholding can be disregarded.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The wife also relied on the husband’s
                    behaviour in relation to certain injunctions granted by the court to bolster her
                    point that the husband had complete control of YHPL and had to be regarded as
                    its controlling shareholder. On 21 June 2005, the court had granted an
                    order which restrained the husband in his capacity as managing director and
                    shareholder of YHPL from, by himself or through his agents, disposing of,
                    dealing with or diminishing the value of the assets held by YHPL, in particular,
                    No 14 Lornie Road. Despite that, on 6 March 2006, the husband called for an
                    extraordinary general meeting of YHPL and passed a resolution to approve the
                    sale of No 14 Lornie Road. As the only attendee at the EGM, the husband
                    authorised himself (on behalf of YHPL) to sign all the documents in respect of
                    the sale of the said property despite the existing order of court which
                    prohibited him from undertaking such an action. The husband thereafter signed
                    the document which granted Clydesbuilt Capital Pte Ltd an option to purchase
                    No 14 Lornie Road at a price of $15m.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     It is clear from the husband’s own
                    actions and his statements that whilst on the face of it there may appear to be
                    several shareholders in YHPL, the husband is not only the legal and beneficial
                    owner of the shares in his name but also considers himself to be the beneficial
                    owner of the shares in his children’s names, or at the least, in the
                    shares held by his daughters (a total of 1,516,556). If his daughters’
                    shares are added to his own, the husband would have a total of 7,108,854 out of
                    9,478,472 shares or 75% thereof. That translates to 75% of the 107,976,797 SIL
                    shares or 80,982,597.75 shares worth $68,025,382.11. I accept the wife’s
                    arguments that the husband must be treated as the beneficial owner of the
                    daughters’ shares since he not only regards himself as the same but saw no
                    reason not to deal with the shares as he wished, to the extent of forging his
                    wife’s signature in order to transfer the shares into Catherine
                    Yeo’s name. There is no direct evidence as to how the husband regards the
                    shares in his son’s name but it is probable that he has a similar attitude
                    to them and that as far as he is concerned, the son holds the shares at the
                    husband’s pleasure. If the husband were regarded as the beneficial owner
                    of the son’s shares as well, then the value of his interest in SIL would
                    be increased to $90,700,509.48.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     In this regard, I am fortified by the
                    observation of Munby J in <em>W v H</em> [2001]
                    1 All ER 300 at 310 that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… as can be seen from [<em>Nicholas v
                            Nicholas</em> [1984] FLR 285] (at 287, 292), and
                            [<em>Green v Green</em> [1993] 1 FLR 326]
                        (at 337, 340), where property is vested in a one-man company which is the
                        alter ego of the husband, the Family Division will pierce the corporate
                        veil, disregard the corporate ownership and, without requiring the company
                        to be joined as a party, make an order which has the same effect as the
                        order that would be made if the property was vested in the husband. Indeed,
                        the court can and will adopt this approach even where there are minority
                        interests involved if they are such that they can for practical purposes be
                        disregarded.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Moreover, as Thorpe LJ’s forthright observations in [<em>Purba v Purba</em> [2000] 1 FCR 652] (at
                        654-655), and [<em>Khreino v Khreino (No 2) (Court’s

                        185), show, the court will not allow itself to be bamboozled by husbands who
                        put their property in the names of close relations in circumstances where,
                        taking a realistic and fair view, it is apparent that the recipient is a
                        bare trustee and where the answer to the real question – Whose
                        property is it? – is that it remains the husband’s
                        property.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Value of other assets included by the husband</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The second item in the husband’s list
                    represented his share of the amount deposited in court. The husband valued his
                    share at $5,415,384 on the basis of his declared interest in YHPL to which part
                    of the money belonged. It should be noted that the total sum deposited was
                    $11,689,761.81 which was made up of:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_a"></a>(a)     $8,688,372.58 being net sale
                        proceeds of No 14 Lornie Road after payment of the

                        being proceeds from the sale of the husband’s 300,000 shares in SIL;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_f"></a>(f)     $91,333.23
                        being interest and part of the fixed deposits held by CTCL Law Corporation
                        which was paid into court thereafter and which the husband treated as
                        belonging to YHPL.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Items (a), (b), (c) and (f) above
                    amount to $9,587,256.20 and belong to YHPL. Since I have found that the husband
                    is most probably the beneficial owner of all the YHPL shares, the said sum of
                    $9,587,256.20 must be regarded as part of the matrimonial assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     As for item (e) above, the husband accepted
                    that the sum of $142,384.72 belonged to him and had to be accounted for in the
                    division of the matrimonial assets. The husband did not accept that item (d)
                    formed part of the matrimonial assets. I will deal with this in the next section
                    of this judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The husband’s valuation of $4,800 for
                    his 20,000 shares in Asia Enterprise was based on an account statement from The
                    Central Depository (Pte) Limited (“CDP”) dated 31 August
                    2009. He had previously exhibited a document which showed that in May 2008, the
                    same shares were worth $8,000. However, as the ancillary matters came on for
                    hearing in September 2009, I think it is appropriate to take the August 2009
                    valuation of $4,800. There were similar dispute over the values of other
                    shareholdings but in each case I think that the latest figure should be
                    accepted. Therefore, generally speaking, I accept the husband’s valuations
                    of his share portfolio.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Assets which the husband submitted should not be part of the
                matrimonial property</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The first of these is the sale proceeds of
                    202A Lornie Road. The situation with this property was a little complicated. At
                    first, the husband said that the property had been purchased by YHPL.
                    Subsequently, however, he asserted that the property had been purchased in his
                    name as trustee for YHPL. At the hearing of the ancillary matters, the husband
                    did not argue that the property belonged to YHPL but stated that it should not
                    be included as a matrimonial asset because it had been purchased in May 2005
                    after the wife left the matrimonial home and after the divorce proceedings were
                    started. He argued that as the wife did not contribute to the acquisition of the
                    property, she should not be entitled to a share in its proceeds. A similar
                    argument was made in respect of 9 Wak Hassan Drive which was purchased in the
                    joint names of the husband and the party cited pursuant to a contract dated
                    24 November 2005 and in respect of 74 Andrews Terrace which was bought in
                    2008. His submission was that assets acquired after separation should not form
                    part of the pool of matrimonial assets. In this respect, the husband relied on
                    my observation in <em>Lim Ngeok Yuen v Lim Soon Heng
                        Victor</em> [2006] SGHC 83 (“<em>Lim
                        Ngeok Yuen</em>”) in relation to a piece of property purchased
                    by the wife in that case after the parties had separated. In that case, I stated
                    that (at [45]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I exempted the wife’s interest in the Arcadia property from the
                        division since she had bought this property sometime after the parties
                        separated and after the husband had ceased to make contributions to the
                        family, although technically it did form a matrimonial asset.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">He also cited <em>Yap Hwee May Kathryn v Geh Thien Ee
                        Martin and another</em> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 663 where Kan Ting
                    Chiu J held that the operative date for division of the assets should be
                    the date the decree nisi was issued. Kan J observed that the alternative
                    date, the date when the decree absolute was issued, should not be employed as
                    the operative date for the division on the basis that such date could not be
                    ascertained at the time of division since the decree nisi would not be issued
                    until after the ancillary matters had been settled. I agree with Kan J that
                    the grant of the decree nisi should be taken as the cut off date.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The property at 9 Wak Hassan Drive was
                    purchased in November 2005, some four months after the grant of the decree nisi
                    in July 2005. It cost $1.659m and a substantial part of the purchase price, $1m,
                    was financed by an overdraft facility obtained by the husband and the party
                    cited and therefore did not come from the husband’s existing assets. In
                    all the circumstances, I think that this property cannot be included as part of
                    the matrimonial assets. The same goes for 74 Andrews Terrace since it was bought
                    in 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The situation is different in regard to 202A
                    Lornie Road which was purchased by YHPL just after these proceedings were
                    instituted and before any decree had been issued. The purchase price for this
                    property must have come from assets that YHPL had at the time of separation and
                    which would have been included as part of the value of YHPL for the purposes of
                    assessing the value of the husband’s shares in YHPL. Whilst the court has
                    the discretion to exclude any particular asset from the pool, a discretion that
                    I exercised in the <em>Lim Ngeok Yuen</em> case, I do not
                    consider that it would be correct to exercise a similar discretion in respect of
                    202A Lornie Road given the circumstances of its acquisition. There was not a
                    long enough break between the end of the marriage and the acquisition of the
                    property to justify its exclusion. In <em>Ong Boon Huat Samuel v
                        Chan Mei Lan Kristine</em> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 729, a property
                    which would otherwise have formed part of the matrimonial assets was excluded
                    because the wife there had not wanted anything to do with the acquisition of the
                    same. That was a special circumstance that does not exist in the present case.
                    The proceeds of sale of 202A Lornie Road amounting to $1,960,121.12 will
                    therefore be included in the computation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     All the cars listed were bought in 2008 or
                    2009 and were bought on hire purchase. According to the husband, most of them
                    had negative values. I accept that these cars should not form part of the
                    matrimonial assets. However, at the time the marriage ended, the husband did
                    have some vehicles. These were subsequently disposed of. He did not account for
                    the proceeds of sale.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     As for his shares in SIL, the husband stated
                    that as of 31 August 2009, he had 614,000 shares in SIL bought at different
                    times or subscribed to by him from the share options given to him. He valued the
                    shares at $524,970 and said that as they were all acquired after the wife left
                    the matrimonial home in April 2005, they should be excluded from the assets. The
                    husband, however, provided no proof of the dates of acquisition of these shares.
                    Accordingly, I will include them in the pool at the value given to them by the
                    husband.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The final item under this category is the
                    husband’s option to subscribe for 500,000 shares in SIL. The evidence
                    shows that he was granted this option in April 2009. That was long after the
                    decree nisi and I agree that the value of this option should not be
                    included.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The documents produced by the husband showed
                    that he held 800,000 shares in a company called Roxy-Pacific Holdings Ltd. The
                    husband’s position was that these shares should not be counted as they
                    were not his but were held on trust for a friend, one Richard Chiang. The
                    evidence showed that this company was listed in March 2008. Although there was
                    no direct evidence as to when the husband acquired these shares, since they were
                    held for him by the CDP prior to being sold in 6 August 2009, it is
                    probable that they were acquired only after March 2008. Accordingly, they were
                    acquired after the decree nisi and should not be included in the
                pool.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Other assets</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The wife submitted that other assets should be
                    included in the pool. First, she referred to a sum of $6m which was received
                    from the sale of 22.5m shares that YHPL held in SIL. This sale took place during
                    the public offer exercise in November 2004. The wife alleged that this sum was
                    received by the husband. The husband’s response was that $6m from the sale
                    price was paid to YHPL and a further $6m was paid to SIL itself. The husband did
                    not explain what had happened to the $6m that was received by YHPL. As the
                    husband is the alter ego/sole beneficial owner of the shares of YHPL, he should
                    be treated as being the owner of the $6m that YHPL received from the sale and
                    this amount must be added to his assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The wife alleged that the husband had sold
                    some properties in Australia to his siblings at heavily discounted prices in
                    1994. I take the view that such sales and the proceeds thereof fall outside the
                    purview of the present exercise as they were effected more than ten years before
                    the parties parted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     On 14 August 2006, in Originating Summons
                    No 835 of 2006 (“OS 835”), the High Court decided that the
                    husband and Catherine Yeo, were the legal and beneficial owners of the property
                    at 6 Shamah Terrace, Singapore as tenants-in-common in equal shares. The order
                    of court provided for the property to be sold and for the net proceeds received
                    by the husband to be paid by way of a donation to the Spastic Children’s
                    Association of Singapore. The husband did not declare his half share in 6 Shamah
                    Terrace as part of his assets nor did he provide a valuation of that share. It
                    is apparent from the documents filed in OS 835 that this property was purchased
                    by the husband in 1991 and that he and Catherine Yeo were still its registered
                    owners at the time the divorce proceedings commenced. Accordingly, the
                    husband’s share in the property must be considered as part of the pool.
                    Unfortunately, I am unable to attribute a value to this share in view of the
                    lack of evidence. The fact that the husband had decided to donate his share of
                    the prospective proceeds of sale to charity cannot remove this asset from the
                    calculation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The wife discovered that YHPL had purchased
                    the property known as 6 Chestnut Close in November 2007 for $10.5m and argued
                    that this property should be included as a matrimonial asset. I do not agree
                    since the property was acquired more than a year after the decree
                nisi.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The wife also produced the certificate of
                    title of a property in Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia which showed that the
                    husband had been registered as the owner of the same on 25 July 2001. The
                    husband stated in his affidavit of 21 September 2005 that this property was
                    an apartment unit and its estimated value was A$260,000. In a subsequent
                    affidavit filed on 18 November 2005 he said that land in Queensland
                    belonged to Swissco Offshore Pty Ltd which paid all the expenses related
                    thereto. The husband produced copies of documents entitled “Notice of
                    Contributions” issued by a company called Body Corporate &amp; Community
                    Administration Services Pty Ltd which showed that various amounts had been paid
                    to it by Swissco Offshore Pty Ltd between February 2002 and October 2005 in
                    respect of a property described only as Lot No 6/Unit No 6. It is not
                    possible for me to tell whether that piece of property is the same as the one
                    shown in the certificate of title produced by the wife. There may be a second
                    piece of property which is owned by Swissco Offshore Pty Ltd. In any case, the
                    certificate of title is sufficient evidence to establish the husband’s
                    interest in at least one piece of property in Queensland. This property must be
                    included but there is no independent evidence to support the husband’s
                    estimate of its value as being A$260,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The wife also alleged that the husband should
                    be treated as the owner of two units in a development called Blue Horizon Tower
                    C. She produced documents to show that the party cited had lodged a caveat in
                    respect of one of these properties. The caveat showed that the party cited had
                    agreed to purchase the property on or about 18 February 2005 at a price of
                    $663,800. The husband consistently denied being the owner or having an interest
                    in the units. There is insufficient evidence to attribute these units to
                    him.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Conclusion on the value of the assets</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     As a result of the above discussion, I find
                    that the husband’s assets comprise the following:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     When the known values are added together, the
                    husband’s worth would be $111,429,816. I would round this off to $111.5m.
                    I have also concluded that the husband has not been full and frank in his
                    disclosure. I think it is fair in the circumstances to attribute a further $11m
                    or ten percent of the disclosed assets as being the value of the husband’s
                    undisclosed assets. All together therefore, the value of the husband’s
                    matrimonial assets would amount to $122.5m. As against this figure I would
                    deduct $6.8m being YHPL’s overdraft liability. The balance is therefore
                    $115.7m.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     As far as the wife is concerned, I am content
                    to accept the husband’s estimation that her assets are worth $860,000. The
                    husband argued that the wife had failed to disclose her substantial jewellery
                    collection. The wife’s jewellery would constitute part of the matrimonial
                    assets but there is no evidence to substantiate the contention that the same is
                    very valuable. The husband did not describe individual pieces that the wife
                    owned, much less ascribe a value to the same. Even if the jewellery was worth
                    something in the range of a quarter million to half a million dollars, the value
                    of the same would not add substantially to the matrimonial assets taken as a
                    whole. In the circumstances I would not include the jewellery as part of the
                    matrimonial assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Division of the assets</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The husband submitted that the wife should be
                    given no more than 20% of the matrimonial assets. He emphasised that he had been
                    wholly responsible for the acquisition and improvement of the matrimonial
                    assets. He had set up YHPL and the business in the Swissco group of companies
                    under SIL. He had been responsible for the acquisition and maintenance of the
                    real properties, for the acquisition of shares and for the acquisition of all
                    the other assets. From the time the husband became the sole proprietor of
                    Swissco in 1970 up to the present day, he had worked long hours to build up the
                    assets and wealth of the Swissco group. Without him at the helm, the group would
                    not exist. He had expanded the group’s marine operations and services by
                    creating many subsidiaries and associated companies in Singapore and abroad. The
                    success of the Swissco group, including SIL, was due to the husband’s
                    business acumen, special skills and knowledge of the marine
                industry.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     On the other hand, the wife had not worked in
                    the business at all. She had rendered some peripheral help in entertaining
                    customers’ wives and answering phone calls but had not claimed to have
                    done this throughout the business. Even if the wife had procured the alleged
                    loan of $20,000 for which the husband denied, the significance of the same was
                    minimal. The husband submitted that less weight should be placed on this initial
                    contribution to the business in the light of all the other relevant factors and
                    contributions made over the 39 years from the time the business was set up. He
                    argued that over such a long period of time, the initial contribution by way of
                    the loan of $20,000 would have become diluted or diminished. In support of his
                    submission, the husband cited the views of the Australian Family Court to the
                    effect that the longer the duration of the period of marriage, the less weight
                    need be given to the initial contribution of capital by either spouse at the
                    beginning of the marriage (see <em>Peter Sinclair Bremner v
                        Sandra Sylvia Mary Bremner</em> (1995) FLC 92-560 which
                    reproduced, at [11], the views expressed in an earlier decision <em>viz In the marriage of Crawford</em> (1979)
                    5 FamLR 106 at 111).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The husband emphasised that although he spent
                    most of his time in the business, he had contributed significantly to the
                    welfare of the family. He had maintained the wife and four children and had
                    borne all education expenses. These included university fees, lodging and food
                    and cars for use overseas. He had also provided for the upkeep and outgoings of
                    the matrimonial home. On the other hand, the wife’s contributions had
                    started in 1956 upon marriage and continued till about 1981 when the youngest
                    child left for the United Kingdom for his high school education in a boarding
                    school. The wife’s contribution extended to being a parent, a homemaker
                    and a caregiver. After the children left home, the wife was relatively free from
                    home duties and motherly duties. From then on, she had led a luxurious life
                    engaging in ballroom dancing, singing lessons and having tea with her friends.
                    She had the help of domestic maids and a gardener.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     The wife on the other hand argued for an equal
                    distribution of the pool of matrimonial assets. She cited the case of <em>Yow Mee Lan v Chen Kai Buan</em> [2000]
                    2 SLR(R) 659 (“<em>Yow Mee
                    Lan</em>”) where an equal distribution of assets had been ordered.
                    In that case, the relevant factors were that (at [35] – [36]):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_52-p2_a"></a>(a)     it was a long marriage of 26
                        years;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_52-p2_b"></a>(b)     the
                        prosperity of the parties increased over the period of the
                    marriage;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_52-p2_c"></a>(c)     when the
                        parties married, their educational qualifications were not high and they had
                        no assets in their names;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_52-p2_d"></a>(d)     the husband turned out to be an enterprising and capable
                        person who was able to capitalise on the knowledge that he acquired in the
                        timber industry and translate this into a very profitable consultancy
                        business;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_52-p2_e"></a>(e)     the
                        wife, though not as capable professionally and academically, did her utmost
                        to support the husband both at home and in the business;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_52-p2_f"></a>(f)     the wife worked continually throughout
                        the marriage and looked after the home and their three children;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_52-p2_g"></a>(g)     the
                        wife’s commitment to her family and the marriage had been total and
                        unstinting.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The wife submitted that apart from the fact
                    that she had not worked during the marriage, the other factors relied on in
                        <em>Yow Mee Lan</em> also applied in the present case.
                    She had done her utmost to be supportive, preparing meals for office staff,
                    joining the husband in dinners and trips and in entertaining his customers. She
                    had been unwavering in her commitment to the husband throughout the 49-year
                    period of the marriage despite the husband’s instances of violence towards
                    her.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     In <em>Yow Mee Lan</em>,
                    I stated (at [43]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[M]arriage is not a business where, generally, parties receive an economic
                        reward commensurate with their economic input. It is a union in which the
                        husband and wife work together for their common good and the good of their
                        children. Each of them uses (or should use) his or her abilities and efforts
                        for the welfare of the family and contributes whatever he or she is able to.
                        The partners often have unequal abilities whether as parents or income
                        earners but, as between them, this disparity of roles and talent should not
                        result in unequal rewards where the contributions are made consistently and
                        over a long period of time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     The court’s power to order division of
                    matrimonial assets under s 112 of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353,
                    1997 Rev Ed) is a power that must be exercised to obtain a result that is
                    “just and equitable”. The court must, in exercising this power,
                    have regard to “all the circumstances of the case”. This means
                    that each case must be decided on its own facts though guidance can be sought
                    from previous decisions in which similar facts were involved. There would,
                    however, always be the need to determine whether the particular case at hand has
                    distinguishing factors which require a different treatment from that meted out
                    in a previous decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     In this case, one of the significant factors
                    is the length of the marriage: 49 years is a very long period of time. During
                    that time, the wife contributed to the family and the marriage to the best of
                    her ability by taking on the role of homemaker and mother. In the early years,
                    this role must have been more arduous as the parties started out in poor
                    circumstances and could not have afforded any domestic assistance. As the
                    husband’s business grew in prosperity, the physical demands on the wife
                    would have been reduced but the emotional demands would have remained. Although
                    the husband attempted to denigrate her contributions to a certain extent, he
                    could not deny that she had been a good wife and mother and had fully met the
                    demands of this role. In the later years of the marriage, after the children
                    grew up and left home, there was less for the wife to do but this was obviously
                    a traditional marriage and the husband could not have expected her to take on
                    any other role. Notwithstanding this, the wife’s contributions were
                    confined to the domestic sphere and this is a factor that must be borne in mind.
                    The contributions she made to the business were simply a slight extension of her
                    domestic duties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The husband fulfilled his role as husband and
                    father by providing for all the material needs of the family to the best of his
                    ability. He took pride in declaring that he had been able to provide his
                    children with overseas education and at the same time provide them with material
                    comforts like good accommodation and their own cars. The husband was, however, a
                    self-confessed workaholic, to the extent that even at the time of the hearing (a
                    time when the husband had reached the age of 73) the husband was still spending
                    long hours at work building and maintaining his business empire. During the
                    earlier years of the marriage, it is safe to assume that the husband’s
                    attention and time were almost fully devoted to his business and therefore the
                    main emotional burden of the family would have fallen on the wife. Having said
                    this, I must also recognise the husband’s unusual drive and ability. He
                    started out as a simple tally clerk with only basic education and he is now a
                    leading business figure with a substantial fortune and a thriving and diverse
                    business. The husband’s contributions to the family’s fortunes have
                    therefore been extraordinary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Having considered all the circumstances and
                    the size of the pool of assets (approximately $116,560,000 ($115,700,000 +
                    $860,000)), I consider that an equitable division of the assets would be to
                    award the wife a 35% share thereof which would result in a dollar figure of
                    $40,796,000. The wife has already received $11m and has in hand $860,000. The
                    husband must pay her the balance of $28,936,000. Raising such an amount may take
                    some time and I therefore order the husband to pay the balance within six months
                    from the date hereof. In the meantime, the remaining amount in court shall be
                    released to the wife in part satisfaction of the husband’s
                    liability.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Maintenance</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     The husband is currently paying the wife
                    $6,000 a month as maintenance pursuant to an order of court made on 21 June
                    2005. The wife submitted that this amount was grossly insufficient because it
                    did not enable her to afford a home of her own and to pay the attendant costs of
                    running her own house or of acquiring a car and a driver. She also did not have
                    sufficient money to pay for holidays.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     The wife is now aged 71. She has already
                    received $11m as part of the matrimonial assets and will shortly hereafter
                    receive a further $28,936,000. One of the factors that the court has to take
                    into consideration when making an order for maintenance is the property and
                    financial resources which each of the parties to the marriage has. In this case,
                    I consider this factor to be the overriding factor. The wife as a person with a
                    share in the matrimonial assets worth some $40,796,000 is a person with
                    considerable financial resources. Her financial resources are more than adequate
                    to meet the financial needs, obligations and responsibilities which the wife has
                    or is likely to have in the foreseeable future and to provide for the standard
                    of living that she enjoyed before the marriage broke down. Further, these
                    financial resources are unlikely to be exhausted in the wife’s
                    lifetime.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     In these circumstances, I think it entirely
                    unnecessary to make an order for maintenance. The existing maintenance order
                    will end when this judgment is issued since it was only an interim order.
                    However, until such time as the husband has paid the full amount due to the wife
                    as her share of the assets, he shall pay her a monthly sum of $25,000 and this
                    sum shall be paid at the beginning of each month and shall be set off against
                    the amount payable in respect of the assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     I will hear the parties on
                costs.</p>
