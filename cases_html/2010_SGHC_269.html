<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       In this application before the court, the
                    plaintiff requested for a stay of execution of a decision by Assistant Registrar
                    Ang Ching Pin (“AR Ang”) pending appeal. Amongst other matters,
                    that decision had to do with the release of a vessel from arrest. Having heard
                    submissions from both parties, I was of the view that a stay of execution was,
                    in the circumstances, appropriate and allowed the application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       In many respects, the above application, and the
                    resulting decision, is not uncommon. Accordingly, it might be thought that all
                    the principles relevant thereto would have already been established. However,
                    both sets of counsel assured me that this was not so. During the hearing for the
                    determination of the application, both sets of counsel informed me that there
                    was no local authority dealing directly with the issue at hand - when a stay of
                    execution should be granted over a decision to release a vessel from arrest.
                    Further, the nature of the application also meant that any appeal to a High
                    Court Judge was unlikely to be filed in this specific instance; it might also be
                    ventured that the same could be said of future similar applications. For these
                    reasons, I am persuaded that it would be helpful for me to render the basis of
                    my decision for scrutiny. I shall nevertheless endeavour to be
                brief.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The factual background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       In Admiralty in Rem No. 121 of 2010
                    (“Adm 121/2010”), the plaintiff claimed, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, against the defendant for delivery of 41,000 metric tons of
                    Iron Ore Fines (“the cargo”). The facts underlying that claim are
                    uncomplicated; even so, it is only necessary for present purposes to provide a
                    bare skeleton of those facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The plaintiff is an Indian company carrying on
                    the business of manufacturing and exporting iron ore. In the course of its
                    business, it had chartered a vessel “Shen Ming Hong 7”
                    (“the Vessel”) to transport the cargo from Mormugao, Goa, India to
                    Tianjin, China. The Vessel was owned by the defendant, a company incorporated in
                    Panama. As is typical of shipping companies, the defendant is a one-ship company
                    whose only asset of any value was the Vessel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       In time, a dispute arose between the plaintiff
                    and the defendant arising out of the transport of the cargo. The plaintiff
                    alleged that the defendant had wrongfully delivered the cargo to a third party
                    instead of the plaintiff. The defendant denied that allegation and asserted that
                    the plaintiff had, instead, failed to come forward to claim the cargo at
                    Tianjin, China. The result was that the cargo was, and still is, stored under
                    the supervision of the Chinese customs authority.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       In order to recover the cargo (or,
                    alternatively, damages), the plaintiff commenced Adm 121/2010; the vessel was
                    arrested on 14 July 2010 as security for the plaintiff’s claims.
                    Slightly more than one month after the arrest, on 17 August 2010, the
                    defendant responded by applying to set aside the Writ of Summons as well as
                    Warrant of Arrest and sought damages for wrongful arrest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       AR Ang heard the defendant’s application
                    on 1 September 2010; her decision was delivered the following day. She
                    ordered that the Warrant of Arrest be set aside and the Vessel be released.
                    Costs were also awarded to the defendant. However, she made no order in relation
                    to the defendant’s other prayers. Specifically, she did not award any
                    damages for wrongful arrest nor was she inclined to strike out the Writ of
                    Summons. Against that decision both the plaintiff and the defendant appealed.
                    The plaintiff’s appeal is currently scheduled, on an urgent basis, to be
                    heard on 13 September 2010. Presumably, the defendant’s appeal would
                    be fixed to be heard at the same time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       To prevent the Vessel from leaving Singapore
                    waters pending the determination of the appeals, the plaintiff prayed, <em>inter alia</em>, for the following relief in Summons 4163 of
                    2010:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">That the order made by the Assistant Registrar Ms. Ang Ching Pin on
                        2 September 2010 that the Warrant of Arrest be set aside and the vessel
                        “SHEN MING HONG 7” be released from arrest, be stayed pending
                        the determination of the Plaintiffs’ appeal against the said order to
                        a Judge in Chambers.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Parties’ submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The plaintiff essentially had only one main
                    argument in support of its application for a stay of execution. It was argued
                    that without a stay of execution, the plaintiff’s appeal against AR
                    Ang’s decision would be nugatory. By the plaintiff’s reckoning, the
                    contract value of the cargo alone is US$2,898,126.86. As such, the plaintiff had
                    sought security for its claims against the defendant for the sum of US$3.892
                    million. However, the defendant stated that it was financially unable to put up
                    the security; the plaintiff took this to be indicative of the fact that the
                    defendant was in poor financial standing. More pertinently, the plaintiff
                    emphasised that the defendant was a foreign company with only one notable asset
                    – the Vessel. There was no evidence to indicate that the Vessel has any
                    sister ships or that the defendant possesses any other assets located anywhere
                    in the world. For these reasons, it was submitted that the plaintiff was
                    unlikely to be provided with any other security if the Vessel was allowed to
                    leave Singapore waters. As such, even if the plaintiff was to succeed in its
                    appeal against AR Ang’s decision, it would obtain no more than a paper
                    judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The defendant, on its part, underlined that it
                    had obtained a judgment in its favour. As such, it was incumbent on the
                    plaintiff to demonstrate special circumstances to justify the grant of a stay of
                    execution. Relying heavily upon the case of <em>Harte Dennis
                        Mathew v Tan Hun Hoe and another</em> [2001] SGHC 19
                        (“<em>Harte Dennis Mathew</em>”), the
                    defendant argued forcefully that the mere fact that the judgment creditor
                        (<em>i.e</em>. the defendant in the present case) is a
                    foreign company was insufficient to justify a stay of execution. That fact,
                    alone, did not lead irresistibly to the conclusion that the appeal would be
                    nugatory. In addition, the fact that a large amount of money was involved did
                    not also, by itself, constitute a special circumstance. On the other hand, the
                    defendant contended that an order of a stay of execution would cause undue
                    hardship upon the defendant. Far from denying that the defendant was in poor
                    financial shape, the defendant instead relied upon that fact to argue that the
                    mounting arrest costs and expenses would put the defendant in an extremely
                    prejudicial position. It was estimated that the defendant would have to fork out
                    an additional US$546,000 if a stay of execution was granted. For these reasons,
                    the court was urged to dismiss the plaintiff’s application.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision of the court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     As is well known, an appeal does not operate
                    as a stay of execution: see O 57 r 15 of the Rules of Court
                    (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) and s. 41(1) of the Supreme
                    Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed). The order of a stay of
                    execution may, however, be made on the application of a litigant. While the
                    decision to order a stay of execution is entirely at the discretion of the
                    court, this discretion is to be exercised in accordance with well-established
                    principles. Two foremost, and competing, principles immediately leap to mind.
                    First, the court should not deprive a successful litigant of the fruits of his
                    litigation pending an appeal. On the other hand, when a party is exercising his
                    undoubted right of appeal, the court ought to see that the appeal, if
                    successful, is not nugatory. All of the above have been outlined in <em>Lee Sian Hee (t/a Lee Sian Hee Pork Trader) v Oh Keng Soon (t/a Ban
                        Hon Trading Enterprise)</em> [1991] 2 SLR(R) 869 (at [5]).
                    For ease of reference, I will henceforth refer to the successful litigant as the
                    “judgment creditor” and the unsuccessful one as “judgment
                    debtor”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     As a result of the interplay between the
                    above-mentioned principles, it is generally said that in order for a judgment
                    debtor to obtain a stay of execution, he must first demonstrate the existence of
                    special circumstances justifying the granting of a stay: see, for instance,
                        <em>Cathay Theatres Pte Ltd v LKM Investment Holdings Pte
                        Ltd</em> [2000] 1 SLR(R) 15 (at [13]) (“<em>Cathay Theatres</em>”) and <em>Lee Kuan
                        Yew v Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin</em> [1990] 1 SLR(R) 772
                    (at [6]) (“<em>Lee Kuan Yew</em>”). What,
                    however, qualifies as special circumstances? It has also been said that
                    “[i]t is not possible to give a catalogue of all the circumstances that
                    would qualify to be considered as special” (see <em>Cathay
                        Theatres</em> (at [13])). Nonetheless, a (non-exhaustive) list of
                    instances where the court had found that special circumstances warranting the
                    grant of a stay of execution existed may be helpful to ascertain the crux of the
                    matter. These include situations where:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     A common thread underlies all of the
                    above-enumerated situations – they are all instances where the appeal, if
                    successful, may be rendered nugatory due to the prevailing circumstances.
                    Indeed, it may be said that the special circumstances necessary for the grant of
                    a stay of execution are no more than circumstances which made it difficult, if
                    not impossible to reverse the execution of the underlying judgment. As was
                    declared in <em>TC Trustees Ltd v JS Darwen Ltd</em> [1969]
                    2 QB 295 (at 302), “[t]he circumstances... are circumstances
                    which go to the enforcement of the judgment: and not those which go to its
                    validity or correctness.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     That the heart of the matter is the
                    reversibility of the underlying judgment – and not any other special
                    circumstances - may be simply explained. It must be remembered that preceding
                    every application for a stay of execution is a judgment in favour of the
                    judgment creditor. The court, in laying down this judgment, did not order a stay
                    of execution. From that moment to the time the applicant, thereafter, applies
                    for a stay of execution, the only material change in circumstances is usually
                    the filing of an appeal against the judgment. Given that, the basis for granting
                    a stay of execution must logically stem from the appeal. From there, it is not
                    difficult to conclude that it is the teeth of a successful appeal that is in
                    issue. As to what special circumstances must prevail before a court will grant a
                    stay of execution, the court is looking for circumstances that will render the
                    appeal nugatory; the circumstances are only “special” because the
                    court assumes that, ordinarily, any judgment handed down may be reversed, both
                    in law and in substance, on appeal. Hence, any circumstances that demonstrate
                    that that presumption is, on the balance of probabilities, rebutted will usually
                    suffice as special circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     In the present case, I agreed with the
                    defendant’s submission that the fact that the judgment creditor was
                    ordinarily resident out of jurisdiction was, alone, insufficient to grant a stay
                    of execution. Nor did the fact that the claim in Adm 121/2010 involved a large
                    sum of money change that position. However, to my mind, that the judgment
                    creditor (<em>i.e</em>. the defendant) is a company with no
                    assets in the world, save for the one ship ordered to be release, was crucial.
                    This fact meant that the usual forces ensuring that the subsequent appeal would
                    not be hollow – such as the ability of the judgment debtor to seize the
                    judgment creditor’s assets or garnish the judgment creditor’s
                    sources of income if the appeal is allowed – were no longer of much bite.
                    Once the Vessel is released, there was nothing to stop the defendant from
                    causing the Vessel to leave Singapore waters. There were simply no real adverse
                    consequences to deter the defendant from pursuing this cause of action. Indeed,
                    from the defendant’s argument that the Vessel was incurring substantial
                    costs by remaining in Singapore, it may be inferred that the defendant had
                    intentions to take the Vessel out of Singapore and put it to work. If so, it
                    would be improbable that the plaintiff would be able to obtain any security for
                    their claim in Adm 121/2010 should they succeed on appeal. I will venture
                    further; in my opinion, it would also be improbable, without the grant of a stay
                    of execution, that the plaintiff would be able to obtain any relief if they
                    succeeded in Adm 121/2010 at the end of the day. In short, both the appeal
                    against AR Ang’s decision as well as the claim in Adm 121/2010 itself
                    would be rendered nugatory.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     It might be argued that that the fact the
                    judgment creditor is a one-ship company could hardly be considered a special
                    circumstance. It is a feature of the industry that, for liability-insulation
                    purposes, most ship-owning companies only own one ship and hardly anything else.
                    This is a common phenomenon. However, I have explained earlier that whether the
                    circumstances are special, for the purposes of stay of execution applications,
                    is not to be measured by the ordinariness or particularity of the situation but
                    by whether the prevailing circumstances are likely to render the appeal
                    toothless. On this view, the present circumstances might be said to be
                    “special”, even if they were ordinary by any other
                measure.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     That, however, was not the end of the matter.
                    Establishing that the judgment debtor will suffer from severe prejudice if a
                    stay of execution is not granted is merely one side of the equation. If, on the
                    other hand, the judgment creditor will also suffer from serious harm, if not
                    irreparable damage, upon the grant of a stay of execution, the court should not
                    ordinarily grant the stay. This is because the balance of justice is no longer
                    in the judgment debtor’s favour. If so, the <em>status
                        quo</em> must remain and the judgment already obtained by the judgment
                    creditor should be respected.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     In the present case, I accepted the
                    defendant’s contention that it would incur additional financial costs if a
                    stay of execution was ordered, though I noted that it had taken more than a
                    month after the Vessel was arrested before applying to set the arrest aside. I
                    was also mindful that ordinarily the defendant should be able to obtain damages
                    for wrongful arrest if the arrest was indeed unwarranted. Indeed, the defendant
                    has filed an appeal against AR Ang’s decision not to award damages for
                    wrongful arrest. That being the case, if the defendant is right about the arrest
                    being completely unwarranted, the defendant should be able to recover the said
                    financial costs from the plaintiff, whose financial status has not been put into
                    question by the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     For the above reasons, I allowed the
                    plaintiff’s application for AR Ang’s decision to be stayed pending
                    appeal. Costs were reserved to the Judge hearing the appeal against AR
                    Ang’s decision.</p>
