<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This action concerns the sale of a property
                    known as Villa 2, Ayara Surin, Phuket, Thailand (“the Property”).
                    The present litigation brought into sharp focus the uniqueness of Thai law where
                    ownership of the land is separate from that of the house built on the land.
                    Under Thai law, separate transfers and registrations are required before legal
                    ownership of both land and house can validly and effectively change hands. The
                    sale transaction was plagued by troubles encountered along the way, which gave
                    rise to misplaced suspicion and mistrust in the minds of the parties stemming
                    from the unappreciated difference between Thailand’s and Singapore’s
                    property law; it certainly did not originate from the parties’ desire to
                    take advantage of each other. The plaintiffs, Colin Ng (“Colin”)
                    and Maria Ng (“Maria”) (collectively, “the Ngs”) are
                    the sellers of the Property. The first defendant, Hat Holdings Pte Ltd
                    (“Hat”) is the purchaser of the Property. Samuel Foy Colflesh
                    (“Samuel”) and the second defendant, Bolliger Hans Peter
                    (“Bolliger”) are the directors of Hat. The Property was purchased
                    by Hat for the use of Bolliger and his family.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> Samuel was the key person who represented
                    Hat in the sale transaction.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts giving rise to the dispute</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Ngs’ acquisition of the Property</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       On 8 October 2000, the Ngs entered into a
                    Reservation Contract with Southern Land Development Co Ltd (“Southern
                    Land”) to purchase the Property for Thai Baht 27.3m.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> According to the Ngs,
                    construction of the two-storey house on Ayara Surin (hereafter known as
                    “Villa 2”) started in late November or early December
                        2000.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>
                    However, the Ngs only entered into a contract with Southern Land to purchase the
                    lease of the Ayara Surin land (“the Land”) under a “Vacant
                    Land Lease Agreement” (“the 2001 Lease”) on 23 April
                        2001.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> In addition, the
                    Ngs entered into a construction contract with the builders, JV MIT Co Ltd
                    (“JV MIT”), on 28 May 2001.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> Subsequently, Southern Land registered in
                    favour of the Ngs, at the Talang District Land Office (“the Phuket Land
                    Office”), the 2001 Lease and the right of superficies for the Land. By
                    way of explanation, the right of superficies is a right granted by the freehold
                    landowner (here, Southern Land) to the superficies right holder (here, the Ngs)
                    to own buildings and structures on the land in question (see s 1410 of the
                    Civil and Commercial Code of Thailand).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> Notably, there is no dispute that the
                    Ngs paid for the Land and the construction costs of Villa 2, and that they had
                    exclusive possession, use and enjoyment of the Property for over six years
                    before deciding to sell it to Hat.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       On 22 April 1999 (before the Ngs bought the
                    Property), Sarot Tantipatanaseri (“Sarot”), an architect who
                    worked with (but was not an employee of) Southern Land, was issued a license to
                    construct several houses, including Villa 2 (“the Construction
                    Permit”). The Construction Permit stated that Sarot was the owner of
                    Villa 2, and that the permit was “valid until” 21 April
                        2001.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> The Construction
                    Permit was purportedly transferred to the Ngs (“the Assigned Construction
                    Permit”) on 23 March 2006. It is undisputed that the events giving
                    rise to the dispute in this action started after 3 March 2008 when the
                    Phuket Land Office rejected as defective the Assigned Construction Permit
                    because it came into being after the Construction Permit had
                        expired.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> I now move to the events in
                2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Negotiations leading up to the signing of the Agreement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Bolliger first contacted Colin to ask if the
                    Property was available for sale in October 2007. Thereafter, Maria negotiated
                    the sale terms with Bolliger and, later, Samuel, both directly and through
                    e-mail.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       After some negotiations, the parties agreed on
                    the terms of the sale and executed an agreement on 12 December 2007. While
                    the document was entitled an “Option to Purchase”, it was actually
                    a sale and purchase agreement (“the Agreement”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> The salient terms of the Agreement are as
                        follow:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_a"></a>(a)     The sale price for the Property was
                        fixed at US$1.85m. Of this sum, US$1m was in respect of the Land, and the
                        remaining sum of US$850,000 was in respect of Villa 2 and the fixtures
                        attached thereto (“the Villa 2 Purchase
                    Price”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
                        title shall be free from encumbrances and the Property was sold “as
                        is where is”;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_c"></a>(c)     The completion date was fixed for 4 February 2008, but this
                        could be extended for up to 14 days at Hat’s
                    request;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_d"></a>(d)     Hat was
                        deemed to have “full notice of the actual state and condition of the
                        [Property] in all respects” and “shall not be entitled to
                        raise any objection or requisition whatsoever in respect
                        thereof”;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_e"></a>(e)     The Agreement was to be construed in accordance with the laws of Singapore,
                        “without regard to any principles on conflicts of law”. The
                        parties agreed to irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
                        Singapore court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">On 14 December 2007, Hat transferred to the Ngs a total sum of
                    US$277,500, purportedly as the deposit and option money for the
                        Property.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Events leading to the first variation of the Agreement </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       After the Agreement was executed, the parties
                    exchanged the contacts of their respective Thai lawyers.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> The Ngs were
                    represented by Surasak Pittisuree (“Surasak”) while Hat was
                    represented by Pornchai Srisawang from the law practice of Tilleke &amp; Gibbins
                    International Ltd (“T&amp;G”). On 4 January 2008, Maria sent
                    Samuel and Bolliger an e-mail setting out the advice she had received from
                    Surasak, namely that:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_a"></a>(a)     the registration process for the
                        Property had to be bifurcated (with the transfer of Villa 2 taking one month
                        to complete due to the need to post a notice of the transfer application for
                        30 days at Villa 2 and elsewhere as designated by the local authorities);
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_b"></a>(b)     Surasak had
                        copies of the Title Certificate, the Assigned Construction Permit and House
                        Registration Book and he confirmed that they were ready for
                        registration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Additionally, Maria suggested postponing the date of completion to
                    11 February 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       T&amp;G conducted due diligence on the Property
                    and prepared a due diligence report dated 10 January 2008 for Samuel
                    (“the DD Report”). The DD Report concluded that the freehold land
                    was owned by Southern Land and leased to the Ngs under the 2001 Lease. The DD
                    Report also recognised, in respect of Villa 2, the existence of both the
                    Construction Permit and the Assigned Construction Permit.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> On
                    20 January 2008, Samuel sent an e-mail to the Ngs and Bolliger, describing
                    the outcome of the due diligence exercise as
                        “satisfactory”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       In February 2008, numerous unsuccessful attempts
                    were made to complete the sale transaction. (The reasons for the failed attempts
                    are not material for this judgment.) On 28 February 2008, T&amp;G informed
                    Samuel that it had arranged to meet the Ngs’ lawyers and Southern
                    Land’s representatives on 3 March 2008 with a view to register the
                    lease and superficies (for the Land) and to file an application to register the
                    sale of Villa 2.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span>
                    However, the Phuket Land Office rejected the application to register the
                    transfer of Villa 2 on that day as the Assigned Construction Permit was invalid
                    (see <a href="#p1_3">[3]</a> above).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> The officers at the Phuket Land Office
                    suggested that Sarot transfer Villa 2 to the Ngs in order for the Ngs to
                    transfer Villa 2 to Hat.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       As a result, two suggested solutions to this
                    problem emerged. T&amp;G suggested that Sarot transfer Villa 2 to the Ngs, and
                    then from the Ngs to Hat (“the Two-Steps Process”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> Maria adopted and proposed
                    her Thai lawyer’s suggestion, which was for Sarot to transfer Villa 2
                    directly to Hat to save time and costs (“the One-Step
                        Process”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span>
                    Samuel agreed to the One-Step Process. The context in which this agreement was
                    reached is important. The Ngs asserted that Hat (through Samuel), at the time of
                    agreeing to the One-Step Process, was not concerned as to whether Sarot had good
                    title to transfer, relying on the e-mail sent by Samuel to Maria on 5 March 2008
                    at 9.08am to support their argument.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> However, I do not think there is
                    evidence to support such an interpretation. First, Samuel had, in that e-mail,
                    clearly stated his understanding (based on the Construction Permit) that Sarot
                    was the named owner of Villa 2 and that he would need to seek an expert’s
                    opinion on this matter. In addition, in an earlier e-mail dated 4 March
                    2008 (timed at 10.34pm), Samuel also sought clarification on how the One-Step
                    Process would “[apply] to the effective conveyance”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> It is true that
                    paragraph 5 of Samuel’s e-mail dated 5 March 2008, read alone,
                    suggests that Samuel was happy to receive whatever title Sarot could transfer to
                    Hat, and he was even willing to personally assist in getting Sarot to effect the
                    transfer. However, in the light of his earlier observations and comments, in all
                    fairness, it cannot be said that Hat was not concerned, at that point of time,
                    with whether the title that Sarot could transfer was good or otherwise
                    imperfect. I should add that, at all material times, the parties, on the advice
                    of their respective Thai lawyers, had proceeded with the application to register
                    Villa 2 on the premise that Sarot was the correct person to transfer Villa 2 as
                    he was named as the owner on the Construction Permit. It was only well into this
                    litigation that the defendants, under the advice of a different set of Thai
                    lawyers, adopted the current position that Southern Land, and not Sarot, was and

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The transfer of Villa 2 did not materialise on
                    7 March 2008 as Sarot was worried about his potential income tax liability
                    arising from his purported sale of Villa 2<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> (which was based on a standard form
                    Sale and Purchase of House Agreement<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span>). On 10 March 2008, the Ngs
                    provided Sarot with a Letter of Guarantee to cover any duty, fee, commission or
                    tax arising from the “sale” of Villa 2.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> Sometime around
                    31 March 2008, Sarot provided a power of attorney (dated 12 March
                    2008) in favour of Adul Chueasaman, who was one of the Ngs’ lawyers in
                    Thailand at that time, to facilitate the transfer of Villa 2 to Hat.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> During this period
                    of time, the parties agreed to work towards handing over Villa 2 on 2 April
                        2008.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> Hat arranged to

                    for the second quarter of 2008 sometime on or around 23 April

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     On 13 March 2008, Colin wrote to Samuel
                    requesting part-payment for Villa 2 before its actual transfer.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> The Ngs’ rationale for
                    requesting early payment was that the Land had already been transferred. This
                    request triggered questions as to when registration of the transfer for Villa 2
                    would take place and there were extensive discussions on this point between
                    Maria and Samuel.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> On 19 March 2008, Colin wrote to Samuel
                    and Bolliger to inquire when the Ngs could expect payment (in part) for Villa
                        2.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> This inquiry
                    prompted Bolliger to write a long e-mail to Samuel on 25 March 2008. In
                    this e-mail, Bolliger questioned the legality of the Ngs’ title to Villa 2
                    and the physical structure of Villa 2 itself, whether Villa 2 could be made
                    legal, and also whether Hat should be paying the Ngs when the latter was not the
                    party transferring title to Villa 2.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> On 29 March 2008, Bolliger asked
                    Samuel further questions relating, again, to the legality of Villa 2 and the
                    implications of taking over possession of Villa 2 in the
                        circumstances.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span>
                    Bolliger also stated that he was happy to delay taking possession of Villa 2.
                    Samuel’s reply on the same day was that he was not sure why title to Villa
                    2 had not been transferred to the Ngs, and that the difference between having an
                    illegal and legal house was only money.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span> Samuel further opined that Hat taking
                    possession of Villa 2 was the “best scenario” as it would remove
                    the Ngs from their only possible claim (for possession), leaving Hat and
                    Southern Land to resolve any consequential problems. Samuel concluded by stating
                    that he was relaxed because: (a) the Land was in Thailand; (b) Hat had
                    title to the Land; (c) Hat had not paid the US$850,000 over to the Ngs; and
                    (d) Southern Land was professional.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The attempts to conclude the transfer of Villa
                    2 and for Hat to enter possession of Villa 2 hit a snag on 2 April 2008,
                    when Samuel offered to pay only 20% of the Villa 2 Purchase Price upfront and
                    the remaining 80% on completion. Colin refused to allow Hat into possession of
                    Villa 2 as he felt insulted by the offer.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span><sup></sup>Subsequently, Colin suggested that Singapore lawyers (as
                    stakeholders) hold the US$850,000, or that Hat pays 50% of the Villa 2 Purchase
                    Price upfront with the remaining 50% to be paid after expiry of the 30-day
                    notice period required for Villa 2.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span> Samuel agreed, on 4 April 2008,
                    that 50% of the Villa 2 Purchase Price would be paid on the first Friday after
                    successful application at the Phuket Land Office, and the remainder on the first
                    Friday following final completion.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> The parties’ respective Thai
                    lawyers then arranged to meet at the Phuket Land Office on 9 April 2008 as
                    Hat’s Thai lawyers were unable to attend earlier.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Bolliger was forwarded a copy of
                    Samuel’s e-mail to the Ngs dated 4 April 2008, and again, he wrote to
                    Samuel to record his discomfort over the legality of Villa 2 in the light of the
                    expired Construction Permit.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span> Samuel’s response was that
                    Hat’s Thai lawyers would ensure that it obtained a legal building before
                    the sale was completed, and the deal as structured “[would] ensure this
                    so long as it [went] as planned on 9 April”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span> Further, Samuel stated that
                    Hat would approach the “owner” (presumably, Southern Land (see
                        <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a> above)) directly if the transaction
                    failed on 9 April 2008, and that the “only difference between legal
                    and illegal [in Thailand]” was money.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     On 9 April 2008, Samuel and the
                    parties’ respective Thai lawyers successfully filed an application to
                    register the sale and purchase of Villa 2 at the Phuket Land Office.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span> On 11 April 2008,
                    Bolliger sent Samuel yet another e-mail to question if he should ask the Ngs why
                    they were selling a structure that was illegal, and whether Colin could be
                    banned from practicing law in Singapore for selling something that did not
                    belong to him.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span></p>

                    2008, when Samuel asked Maria how he should go about arranging for payment to

                    Sarot was the “registered house owner” who had executed a Power of

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_b"></a>(b)     Hat would pay 50% of the Villa 2 Purchase Price, with the remaining amount

                        if the Ngs would provide a “statement of joint liability” and

                    explained that his greater concern was “non-performance”
                    (presumably by Sarot), and not whether the Ngs or Hat would be able to defeat

                    payment of 50% of the Villa 2 Purchase Price while the Ngs executed an indemnity
                    in Hat’s favour in the event of any claim by Sarot, and further agreed to

                    Summons No 890 of 2008 (“OS 890/2008”) to restrain the Ngs
                    from winding it up. In Samuel’s affidavit in support of Hat’s
                    application, he alleged that the parties had reached an Oral Agreement for Sarot
                    to issue a receipt to Hat (see <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a> above),
                    and that the Ngs’ failure to procure such a receipt meant that they were
                    not entitled to Final Payment.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_66" id="Ftn_66_1"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span> Kan J ordered Hat to pay the Final Payment
                    into court on 15 July 2008. OS 890/2008 was withdrawn upon
                payment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     On 28 July 2008, the Ngs procured from
                    Sarot a letter resembling the terms of the receipt that Hat alleged the Ngs did
                    not produce. Sarot’s letter (“Sarot’s Receipt”) stated
                    that he (Sarot) was “happy that [Villa 2] had been transferred out of
                    [his] name” (having been a nominee holder to the Ngs hitherto) and that
                    he was “not claiming money from anyone (be it [the Ngs] or [Hat]) for the
                        transfer.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_67" id="Ftn_67_1"><sup>[note: 67]</sup></a></span> In
                    addition, the Ngs replaced the personal guarantee originally provided to Sarot
                    (see <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a> above) with a charge over the
                    Ngs’ bank account in Thailand that had an account balance of Thai Baht
                        2m.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_68" id="Ftn_68_1"><sup>[note: 68]</sup></a></span> On 26 August
                    2008, the Ngs (through its solicitors) made a without prejudice offer to
                    Hat’s solicitors to pay the taxes and expenses associated with the
                    transfer of Villa 2 and to provide the receipt and confirmation sought for (see
                        <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a> above), but Hat did not respond to
                    the offer.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_69" id="Ftn_69_1"><sup>[note: 69]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues arising from the dispute </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The Ngs’ case is that the parties had
                    agreed (on 14 April 2008) that the Final Payment (<em>ie</em>, US$425,000) would be paid on the first Friday following the
                    date of registration of the sale and purchase of Villa 2.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_70" id="Ftn_70_1"><sup>[note: 70]</sup></a></span> The registration of the sale and
                    purchase of Villa 2 was completed on 23 May 2008, and the Final Payment
                    became due and payable on 30 May 2008.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_71" id="Ftn_71_1"><sup>[note: 71]</sup></a></span>
                    However, in breach of the Agreement, Hat failed to pay the Final Payment, but
                    instead, sought to tender payment of S$336,936.00 as “full and final
                    settlement” of the purchase of Villa 2 on 11 June 2008.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_72" id="Ftn_72_1"><sup>[note: 72]</sup></a></span> As such, the Ngs claim for the Final
                    Payment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Hat’s defence is two-fold. First, Hat
                    argues that it was an implied term or warranty of the Agreement that the Ngs
                    would transfer “good, proper and perfect legal and beneficial
                    title” to it.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_73" id="Ftn_73_1"><sup>[note: 73]</sup></a></span> After Hat became aware that
                    Sarot was the purported registered owner of Villa 2, it was agreed that the Ngs
                    would procure Sarot to transfer legal ownership to Villa 2 to Hat. Hat claims
                    that the parties entered into an oral agreement (“the Oral
                    Agreement”) on or about 14 April 2008, and that the Ngs were in
                    breach of the terms of the Oral Agreement in failing to:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_74" id="Ftn_74_1"><sup>[note: 74]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_a"></a>(a)     pay all taxes, costs and other
                        expenses associated with the transfer of Villa 2 from Sarot to Hat;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_b"></a>(b)     procure a
                        receipt from Sarot evidencing payment by Hat, and/or confirmation from Sarot
                        that he has no further title, interest or any other claims in Villa 2
                        whatsoever.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As a result of the purported breach of the Oral Agreement, Hat claims to be
                    entitled to withhold the Final Payment. I will refer to this defence as the
                    “Oral Agreement Argument”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Next, Hat pleaded that it discovered, in April
                    2009, that Sarot’s title was defective and that “good, proper and
                    perfect legal title” to Villa 2 was not transferred to Hat despite the
                    purported registration on 23 May 2008. Sarot’s title to Villa 2 was
                    defective based on the following grounds: <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_75" id="Ftn_75_1"><sup>[note: 75]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_a"></a>(a)     Although Sarot was the holder of the
                        Construction Permit, he was not the proper applicant and/or holder of that
                        permit in respect of Villa 2.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_b"></a>(b)     The transfer of the Construction Permit from Sarot to the
                        Ngs on 23 March 2006 was not a valid way of transferring registered title to
                        Villa 2 as Villa 2 was already constructed at that time. In any case, Sarot
                        did not have good legal title to transfer, for the reason given above in
                        (a).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Consequently, Hat pleaded that the Ngs were in
                    breach of the Agreement (as varied) which required them to transfer
                    “good, proper and perfect legal title” to Villa 2. The Ngs were,
                    therefore, not entitled to payment until they transferred “good, proper
                    and perfect legal title” to Villa 2 to Hat.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_76" id="Ftn_76_1"><sup>[note: 76]</sup></a></span>
                    Hat’s counterclaim against the Ngs is in respect of: (a) their breach
                    of the Agreement in failing to provide “good, proper and perfect legal
                    title”, and (b) their breach of the Oral Agreement.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_77" id="Ftn_77_1"><sup>[note: 77]</sup></a></span> At the end of the trial, Hat elected to
                    claim solely for specific performance of the sale and purchase of Villa 2, and
                    for damages arising from the Ngs’ failure to procure or transfer title to
                    Villa 2 to Hat.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_78" id="Ftn_78_1"><sup>[note: 78]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     From the parties’ pleaded case, there
                    are two main issues for me to decide. The first is whether the Ngs were in
                    breach of the alleged Oral Agreement. The second is whether the Ngs had
                    transferred good title to Villa 2 to Hat. I will first consider the Oral
                    Agreement Argument.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">First issue: The Oral Agreement and the Ngs’ breach thereof </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Hat pleaded that the parties had reached an
                    oral agreement under which the Ngs were to provide, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, a confirmation from Sarot that he has no claims against Hat
                    in relation to Villa 2 (“Confirmation”), and a receipt from Sarot
                    evidencing payment by Hat of Thai Baht 7.5m
                        (“Receipt”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_79" id="Ftn_79_1"><sup>[note: 79]</sup></a></span> Hat submits that the Ngs remained
                    in breach of their duty to provide the Confirmation and Receipt. In its further
                    and better particulars filed on 8 August 2008, 21 August 2008 and
                    11 September 2008, Hat took the position that this Oral Agreement was
                    reached in a telephone conversation between the Ngs and Samuel in the afternoon
                    of 14 April 2008.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_80" id="Ftn_80_1"><sup>[note: 80]</sup></a></span> In trial, Samuel confirmed that such was the
                        case.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_81" id="Ftn_81_1"><sup>[note: 81]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In its closing submissions, Hat does not
                    dispute that the Sarot Receipt (see <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a>
                    above) satisfied the requirements of the Receipt and the Confirmation it sought.
                    Instead, Hat contends that the Ngs’ failure to provide Sarot’s
                    Receipt was a breach of their discovery obligations, and that the present
                    proceedings “would have been obviated” if it had been
                        disclosed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_82" id="Ftn_82_1"><sup>[note: 82]</sup></a></span> The
                    argument which Hat raised in respect of the Final Payment does not justify its
                    withholding the Final Payment; it has a bearing only on the question of costs
                    (if at all). On the existence of the alleged Oral Agreement, I make the
                    following observations. First, there is no record of any phone call between the
                    Ngs and Samuel on the afternoon of 14 April 2008 from Colin’s and
                    Maria’s phone-records.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_83" id="Ftn_83_1"><sup>[note: 83]</sup></a></span> Hat
                    provided no evidence of any such phone call that took place between the parties.
                    In addition, it is not obvious to me that the words “i.e. production
                    of”, as allegedly written by Colin on a printed copy of an
                        e-mail<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_84" id="Ftn_84_1"><sup>[note: 84]</sup></a></span> when
                    Samuel met to make payment for Villa 2, would necessarily suggest that the Ngs
                    had agreed to produce the Receipt. The sentence is incomplete and the written
                    words are too vague to lend itself to such an interpretation. Furthermore, the
                    failure to provide the Receipt and Confirmation was never explicated by Samuel
                    or Bolliger, at the material time, as the reason for withholding or discounting
                    the Final Payment. Notably, on 2 June 2008, Maria specifically asked Samuel
                    “[w]hat else do we [<em>ie</em>, the Ngs] need to
                    do” to receive full payment for Villa 2.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_85" id="Ftn_85_1"><sup>[note: 85]</sup></a></span> In subsequent communications between
                    the Ngs and Samuel, Samuel did not mention anything about there being no Receipt
                    or Confirmation. Indeed, Samuel did not provide any concrete reason at all for
                    unilaterally imposing a discount.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_86" id="Ftn_86_1"><sup>[note: 86]</sup></a></span> This is especially curious, since
                    Bolliger and Samuel were evidently trying to find ways to justify a discount on
                    the Purchase Price. The evidence strongly supports the Ngs’ submission
                    that the issue of the Receipt and the Confirmation was merely an afterthought.
                    For all these reasons, Hat’s defence based on the Receipt and Confirmation
                    is untenable and without merit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     I now turn to consider whether the Ngs were
                    obliged to pay the costs and taxes associated with the transfer of Villa 2 from
                    Sarot to Hat. The Ngs accept that they would have to pay for the costs and taxes
                    associated with the transfer of Villa 2, but argue that Hat did not demand
                    payment for the same.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_87" id="Ftn_87_1"><sup>[note: 87]</sup></a></span>
                    No completion accounts reflecting such costs or taxes including reimbursements
                    by way of deductions from the balance sale proceeds had been provided to the
                    Ngs, as would have been customary for a property transaction in Singapore. Hat
                    claims that it has paid Thai Baht 248,225 as personal income tax (with a receipt
                    to back its claim) and that the Ngs have not repaid them.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_88" id="Ftn_88_1"><sup>[note: 88]</sup></a></span> While the Ngs had agreed to
                    pay for such personal income tax, apparently, Hat had not made any demand for
                    repayment of such income tax. Notably, Hat did not rely on the unpaid income tax
                    as a ground for seeking a discount of the Purchase Price. In any case, the
                    unpaid income tax of Thai Baht 248,225 (which works out to approximately
                    S$10,000) was nowhere near the 10% deduction that Hat sought to unilaterally
                    impose on the Ngs. At best, Hat could deduct the equivalent sum to Thai Baht
                    248,225 from the Final Payment, leaving the balance payable to the Ngs.
                    Furthermore, the Ngs had offered to make payment of taxes but their offer was
                    ignored (see <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a> above). In the
                    circumstances, assuming that only the issue of taxes was alive, I would have
                    held that Hat was not entitled to rely on this issue alone to withhold the Final
                    Payment from the Ngs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Second issue: the Court’s jurisdiction to determine if good
                title was transferred to Hat</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Hat’s principal defence is that it did
                    not receive good title to Villa 2. The obligation to transfer good title
                    requires the Ngs to deliver Villa 2 free from encumbrances, subject to two
                    qualifications. Hat takes Villa 2 subject to any irremovable defects in title:
                    (a) which are patent; or (b) of which it knew at the time of
                    contracting (see Megarry &amp; Wade, <em>The Law of Real
                        Property</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell,
                    7<sup>th</sup> Ed, 2008) (“<em>M&amp;W</em>”) at para 15-074 -075 and the decision of
                    Chao Hick Tin J in <em>Lie Kee Pong v Chin Chow Yoon</em>
                    [1998] 1 SLR(R) 457 at <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a> and
                        <a href="#p1_17">[17]</a>). There is no dispute that the Ngs
                    were, at the time of entering into the Agreement, obliged to transfer good title
                    to Villa 2 to Hat. Indeed, Colin accepted as much during cross-examination and
                    the Ngs do not deny this in their submissions.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_89" id="Ftn_89_1"><sup>[note: 89]</sup></a></span> Furthermore, the duty to deliver Villa 2 free
                    from encumbrances is expressly provided for under cl 2 of the Agreement.
                    However, the Ngs dispute that they were remiss in their obligation to transfer
                    good title to Hat. They highlight that the test for whether good title is
                    transferred was described in <em>Manning v Turner</em>
                    [1957] 1 WLR 91 in the following terms (at p 94):<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_90" id="Ftn_90_1"><sup>[note: 90]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In my opinion, the test must always be: would the court, in an action for
                        specific performance at the instance of the vendors, force a title
                        containing the alleged defect upon a reluctant purchaser?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     During the course of the hearing, I asked, as
                    a preliminary query, whether this court could determine the issues relating to
                    title to Villa 2, since Villa 2 is located in Thailand. Both the Ngs and Hat
                    take the position that this court could determine the dispute because their
                    respective claims are founded in contract (<em>viz</em>,
                    the Agreement), and this would be so, notwithstanding, the issues raised
                    concerning title (to Villa 2) situated on foreign land.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     However, I note that an integral (and
                    strongest) part of Hat’s defence is that the Ngs did not have good title
                    and had failed to transfer good title to Villa 2 to it, and they were thereby in
                    breach of their obligation to transfer good title. In support of this defence,
                    in its closing submissions, Hat resolutely maintains that neither the Ngs nor
                    Sarot had title to Villa 2, or was capable of transferring good title to it. The
                    Ngs, however, deny that they were remiss in their obligation to transfer good
                    title to Hat. Their expert witness, Supasak Chirasavinuprapand, opined that, at
                    all material times, the Ngs, and not Southern Land, were the owners of Villa 2,
                    and Sarot’s transfer of Villa 2 to Hat was valid.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_91" id="Ftn_91_1"><sup>[note: 91]</sup></a></span> The Ngs also
                    point out that Hat was “in contact” with Southern Land at the time
                    Villa 2 was registered in Hat’s name on 23 May 2008 (see <a href="#p1_18">[18]</a> above), as indicated on the Agreement to Sell
                    Building that was lodged at the Phuket Land Office on that day.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_92" id="Ftn_92_1"><sup>[note: 92]</sup></a></span> This, in turn, raises questions as to
                    whether Announcement No 1522/2497, which requires the applicant (<em>ie</em>, Hat) to provide a letter from the freehold landowner
                        (<em>ie</em>, Southern Land, according to Hat’s
                    case) giving consent for the transfer of Villa 2, is notionally satisfied under
                    Thai law,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_93" id="Ftn_93_1"><sup>[note: 93]</sup></a></span>
                    and the implication of that, if any, on the experts’ opinion that
                    registration of a sale agreement between Southern Land and Hat for Villa 2 is
                    required. Furthermore, Hat’s expert witness on Thai law, Mr Pichitpon
                    Eammongkolchai (“Pichitpon”) points out that it is not settled
                    under Thai law whether ownership of an existing building can be transferred
                    through the grant of a right of superficies. As a result, in order for this
                    court to determine whether the Ngs have satisfied their contractual obligation
                    under the Agreement to transfer good title to Hat, it would have to determine a
                    myriad of issues, arising under Thai law, relating to whether the Ngs or Sarot
                    had title to transfer, and whether Hat had received good title to Villa
                    2.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     It is trite law that the court does not have
                    the jurisdiction to entertain proceedings involving determination of title to
                    foreign land (see Collins, <em>Dicey, Morris &amp; Collins on The
                        Conflict of Laws</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell,
                        14<sup>th</sup> Ed, 2006) (“<em>Dicey &amp; Morris</em>”) at para 23R-021). I will refer
                    to this principle as the “<em>Mocambique</em>
                    principle” (see <em>Companhia de Mocambique v British
                        South Africa Co</em> [1892] 2 QB 358). On the other hand, the
                    court can, in certain limited instances, make an order in an action, even if the
                    action may concern foreign land. One such instance is where personal equities
                    between the parties are involved (“the personal equities
                    exception”). The circumstances under which the personal equities
                    exception can arise were described by Parker J in <em>Deschamps v Miller</em> [1908] 1 Ch 856 as follows (at pp
                    863-864):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There are, no doubt, exceptions to the rule, but, without attempting to
                        give an exhaustive statement of those exceptions, I think it will be found
                        that <em>they all depend on the existence between the parties
                            to the suit of some personal obligation arising out of contract or
                            implied contract, fiduciary relationship or fraud, or other conduct
                            which, in the view of a Court of Equity in this country, would be
                            unconscionable</em>, <b><em>and do not depend for
                            their existence on the law of the locus of the immovable

                        contracts, foreclosure, or redemption of mortgages, or in the case of land
                        obtained by the defendant by fraud, or other such unconscionable conduct as
                        I have referred to, the Court may very well assume jurisdiction. <b><em>But where there is no contract, no fiduciary relationship, and

                            according to the law of the locus the claim of title set up by one
                            party, whether a legal or equitable claim in the sense of those words as
                            used in English law, would be preferred to the claim of another party, I
                            do not think the Court ought to entertain jurisdiction to decide the

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in italics and bold]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The distinction between the <em>Mocambique</em> principle and the personal equities exception was
                    clearly described and well illustrated by Peter Prescott QC (sitting as deputy
                    High Court judge) in <em>R Griggs Group Ltd v Evans</em>
                    [2005] 2 WLR 513 (“<em>Griggs</em>”), as
                    follows (at <a href="#p1_65">[65]</a>–<a href="#p1_66">[66]</a>):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">

                The Moçambique case was about rights in rem.
                            I do not doubt that if the British company had admittedly been the owner
                            of the land in Manica, but had agreed to sell it to the Portuguese
                            company, a court of equity might have decreed specific performance. For
                            that would have been to enforce a right in personam. The House of Lords
                            was not purporting to overrule a long line of equity cases to that
                            effect.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>66</b>
                The equitable jurisdiction in personam
                            touching land abroad has existed for at least 250 years. Notice the
                            difference. In the Moçambique case the Portuguese company was saying, in
                            so many words: "Please decide that under the local law we were <em>already</em> the owners of the Manica lands and
                            minerals." In contrast, under the in personam jurisdiction of equity,
                            the claimant would be saying:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">"I fully admit the defendant is the owner of this land. That's my very
                            complaint. You see, he has signed a contract to sell it to me. Please
                            compel him to fulfil his bargain."</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Then the court of equity would "act upon the conscience" of the
                        recalcitrant party by ordering him to transfer the land to the claimant
                        according to the forms of local law. The jurisdiction is not over the
                        property, but over the person. The defendant signs the requisite documents
                        for fear of being held in contempt of court, but the result is to alter the
                        ownership of foreign land all the same.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     I will now consider if the personal equities
                    exception to the <em>Mocambique</em> principle applies
                    here. On the facts of the present case, it is particularly significant that the
                    personal equity must not depend, for its existence, on the law of the locus of
                    the immovable property (see <a href="#p1_32">[32]</a> above). The
                    applicability of this requirement was considered in the following cases. In
                        <em>Tito v Waddell</em> (No 2) [1977] 1 Ch 106
                        (“<em>Tito</em>”) at p 263-264,
                    Megarry V-C took the view that the <em>Mocambique</em>
                    principle would not apply where it is necessary for the plaintiff to prove his
                    title to foreign land in order to establish his claim and enforce the equity. In
                    other words, the <em>Mocambique</em> principle does not
                    apply where proof of title is “incidental” to the main claim. On
                    the facts of the case in <em>Tito</em>, although it was
                    necessary for the plaintiff there to prove that he was a landowner, there was no
                    suggestion of any dispute that the plaintiff was, indeed, the landowner.
                    However, the opposite applies in the present case, as there is a substantial
                    dispute as to whether good title had passed to Hat, be it from the Ngs or Sarot.
                    This in turn raised questions as to whether the Ngs or Sarot had good title to
                    transfer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     In <em>Couzens v
                        Negri</em> [1981] VR 824 (“<em>Couzen</em>”), the Supreme Court of Victoria took the view
                    that the personal equities exception applied only where “no adjudication
                    touching on the laws of another nation is directly involved”. The facts
                    of this case are interesting. A liquidator sought directions from the court as
                    to whether the company in liquidation owned the land or held it on trust for
                    another company. The court dealt with the preliminary issue as to whether a
                    determination of the issue of trust would offend the <em>Mocambique</em> principle and decided it did not. This was because
                    (at p 828):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... what the court strictly speaking, is being asked is whether the
                        company here in liquidation had any and what fiduciary obligations in
                        respect of the New South Wales land and in turn whether the liquidator is
                        obliged to recognize them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In other words, the dispute was as to the rights and obligations of the two
                    companies <em>inter se</em> and did not relate to <em>legal</em> title to the land. No adjudication touching on the
                        <em>lex situs</em> of the land concerned was necessary.
                    Again, on this basis, <em>Couzens</em> is distinguishable
                    from the present case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     It is clear that the respective claims made by
                    the Ngs and Hat are caught by the <em>Mocambique</em>
                    principle. Quite plainly, the court will have to decide whether Hat had received
                    good title to Villa 2 to resolve the dispute between the parties. Borrowing the
                    language of Prescott QC (see <a href="#p1_33">[33]</a>
                    above), Hat’s case is, quite plainly: “Please decide that under
                    Thai law the Ngs or Sarot were never the owners of Villa 2 and that as a
                    consequence, we are not the current owners of Villa 2”. In other words,
                    the issue of title does not arise incidentally, but is, instead, the principal
                    issue in both of their claims (see, in this regard, the observations of
                    Professor Adrian Briggs in <em>Civil Jurisdiction and
                        Judgments</em> (LLP, 4<sup>th</sup> Ed, 2005) at
                    para 4.07). Indeed, this is also implicitly recognised in Fawcett and
                    Carruthers, <em>Cheshire, North &amp; Fawcett on Private
                        International Law</em> (Oxford University Press,
                        14<sup>th</sup> Ed, 2008), where the learned authors
                    suggest (at p 482) that the personal equities rule can only apply where the
                    contractual right “can only be pursued by an <em>uncontested</em> assertion of his title to foreign land”
                    [emphasis added].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The <em>Mocambique</em>
                    principle is one based on considerations of comity of nations. It recognises
                    that where land (and this includes the building thereon) is concerned, a
                    sovereign is entitled to assert a double prerogative, to make laws for its own
                    country and to have those laws adjudicated in its own courts exclusively (see
                        <em>Griggs</em> at [78]). If so, then it would make no
                    sense for this court to decide, based on Thai law, as to whether Hat had
                    received good title to Villa 2. A judgment either way would, in effect, decide
                    on a matter that should be left entirely to the prerogative of the Thai courts.
                    As observed by Lord Wilberforce, determinations as to foreign title
                    “[involve] possible conflict with foreign jurisdictions, and the possible
                    entry into and involvement with political questions of some delicacy”
                        (<em>Hesperides Hotels Ltd v Muftizade</em> [1979]
                    AC 508 at p 537). The present case goes further as the dispute to
                    title possibly involves issues relating to Thai custom and tradition of the
                    community given the expert witnesses’ evidence that under Thai law, there
                    is no official document to prove one’s title to a building, unlike the
                    case of one’s title to land. <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_94" id="Ftn_94_1"><sup>[note: 94]</sup></a></span>Furthermore, an estoppel could arise as between the
                    parties in Thailand subsequently, if this issue is finally decided by the
                    Singapore courts. In these circumstances, I do not think that it is wise or
                    expedient for this court to adjudicate on the issues of title that were raised
                    by the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     For completeness, I should state that I do not
                    find the cases relied on by Hat, <em>viz</em>, <em>Richard West and Partners (Inverness) Ltd v Dick</em> [1969]
                    2 Ch 424 (a decision of the Chancery Division) and <em>Ward
                        v Coffin</em> (1972) 27 DLR (3d) 58 (a decision of the New
                    Brunswick Queens Bench Division) to be on point. In neither of these cases was
                    the question of title disputed between the parties. In addition, I note that
                    there are cases which suggest that the parties can consent to the court
                    adjudicating on such disputes of title (see, for example, <em>The
                        Mary Moxham</em> (1876) 1 PD 107 and <em>Re Duke
                        of Wellington</em> [1948] Ch 118). However, given the
                    sensitivities involved (see <a href="#p1_34">[34]</a> and
                        <a href="#p1_37">[37]</a> above), I do not think that these
                    authorities ought to be followed. Instead, I would align with the view of
                    Somervell LJ in <em>The Tolten</em> [1946] P 135,
                    where he opined that (at p 166):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I do not think the conflicting dicta in <em>The Mary
                            Moxham</em> can be regarded as authority either way. All I wish to
                        say about that case is that if the claim fell under the rule as subsequently
                        laid down in the <em>Mocambique</em> case I doubt
                        whether a mere consent would have entitled the court to entertain the
                        claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">To conclude, both the Ngs’ claims and Hat’s counterclaim involve
                    the integral question of title that the court needs to resolve, and as such the
                    claims are non-justiciable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Other Arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The conclusion reached at <a href="#p1_38">[38]</a> above is not the end of the matter for the
                    Ngs. If the Ngs show that the issue of good title does not arise, for example,
                    by operation of some waiver, estoppel or acceptance by application of some
                    contractual principle, then arguably, it would not be in contravention of the
                        <em>Mocambique</em> principle for this court to decide
                    on the contractual dispute since no issue of good title would arise for
                    determination. In this regard, the Ngs appear to have raised a host of such
                    issues to resist Hat’s defence and counterclaim in their submissions,
                    which I should further observe, were not from a model of brevity. I will now
                    turn to consider these arguments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     As highlighted above, while the Ngs were
                    contractually obliged to transfer good title to Hat, this obligation does not
                    extend to patent defects or defects of which Hat knew about at the time of
                    contracting (see <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a> above). In addition,
                    the Ngs also argue that the defects alleged by Hat were matters of conveyance
                    rather than matter of title.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_95" id="Ftn_95_1"><sup>[note: 95]</sup></a></span> I will now consider if any of these exceptions
                    apply.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the defect in title was a patent defect</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The learned authors of <em>M&amp;W</em> describe the distinction between a latent and a patent
                    defect in the following manner (at para 15-070):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A defect is not patent merely because the purchaser has constructive
                        notice of it. It must be one “which arises either to the eye or by
                        necessary implication from something which is visible to the eye”.
                        Thus, an obvious right of way is likely to be patent, but a tenancy, a
                        restrictive covenant and a local land charge are all latent
                        incumbrances.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The defect here which Hat relies on is that
                    Sarot did not have title to Villa 2. In my view, this is not a patent defect.
                    The alleged defect was not one that was obvious to Hat, or arose by necessary
                    implication from something visible to the eye. In this regard, the Ngs are right
                    not to run an argument based on this ground.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether Hat knew of the defect in title through the due diligence
                report</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Given that Hat had conducted due diligence but
                    did not object to the transfer of title to Villa 2 to it, could it then be said
                    that Hat knew and had therefore accepted the defect? Hat highlights that the DD
                    Report was a “Land title due diligence report” as stated on its
                    cover page and did not concern itself with title to Villa 2. The DD Report
                    seemingly suggested that the Ngs owned Villa 2 as under the heading
                    “Chronology of Ownership of the Building”, it listed in detail the
                    Construction Permit and the Assigned Construction Permit. The DD Report’s
                    scope recognised that it was made for the purpose of the purchase of Villa 2.
                    However, I note that no direct conclusion was drawn with respect to Villa 2,
                    especially in the “Summary” Chapter, and that the title of the
                    report suggested that it related only to the Land.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The defect here is that Sarot did not have
                    good title and, therefore, had nothing to transfer to Hat, despite the
                    registration that took place on 23 May 2008. In this regard, it is not
                    possible for me to hold that Hat knew of this at the time of agreeing to the
                    One-Step Process or registration of Villa 2. The DD Report did not consider
                    whether Sarot had title to Villa 2, and indeed, did not have to so consider as
                    T&amp;G was only concerned with the Ngs’ title. At the time Samuel agreed
                    to the One-Step Process, as I found earlier, it was on the basis that Sarot had
                    good title based on the Construction Permit. Samuel did not, at that time,
                    proceed on the knowledge that Sarot had no good title to transfer. As a result,
                    I am unable to hold that Hat knew about the defect at the time of the variation
                    or transfer of title to Villa 2.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether Hat had accepted the defect in title</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     There remains the argument that Hat, through
                    its conduct, had waived its right to object to the defects in title, for
                    example, by performing an act that a prudent purchaser would not normally have
                    until the seller has shown good title (see <em>Emmet on
                        Title</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, Looseleaf Ed, 2010) at
                    paras 5.072-5.073). However, such acceptance of title will not be implied
                    if the purchaser had continued to insist upon his objections to title (see
                        <em>Burroughs v Oakley</em> (1819) 3 Swanst
                    159).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     
          <em>Bown v Stenson</em>
                    (1857) 24 Beav 631 is an example where such acceptance of title was found.
                    The purchaser there was contractually obliged to object to title within a
                    specific period, failing which title would be considered accepted. The court
                    found that the purchaser, after receiving the abstracts, had not raised any
                    objections, but instead, sought and obtained possession to the property.
                    Further, when asked by the seller’s solicitors for the draft conveyance,
                    the purchaser’s solicitors did not object to title and, instead, promised
                    part-payment of the purchase price. The court held (at p 636-637):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I am of the opinion that this was a waiver of all objections apparent upon
                        the abstracts delivered, <em>but it will not, it is true,
                            bind him as to objections to the title not appearing on those
                            abstracts</em>…. If [the purchaser] had said, “I
                        have since discovered such and such facts invalidating the title, of which
                        the abstract contains no information,” I should not compel him to
                        complete the purchase without having these objections removed. [emphasis
                        added].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     On the facts of the case here, there is no
                    evidence that Hat had completed registration of Villa 2 despite knowing that
                    Sarot did not have good title to Villa 2. Therefore, in my view, there is no
                    basis to hold that Hat had, in such circumstances, accepted or waived the defect
                    in title.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether Hat is precluded from raising defect in title by the terms of
                the Agreement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Clauses 2 and 3 of the Agreement outline
                    the parties’ respective obligations on the issue of title and they
                    state:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.    The title shall be free from encumbrances. The
                            property is a leasehold and is being sold “as is where
                            is”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.    The Purchaser shall not require the delivery or
                            production of any deeds or documents not in the possession of the Vendor
                            nor shall the Purchaser make any requisition or objection in respect
                            thereof.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Under cl 3 of the Agreement, Hat agreed
                    not to require production of documents that were not in the Ngs’
                    possession, and that it would not “make any requisition or objection in
                    respect thereof”. What then is the effect of this clause? Did it preclude
                    Hat from objecting to title? I am aware that this argument was neither pleaded
                    nor raised by the Ngs, but in the light of the decision that I will make, the
                    fact that it is not pleaded is no reason to refrain from making the observations
                    which follow. In <em>Re National Provincial Bank of England and
                        Marsh</em> [1895] 1 Ch 190 (“<em>Marsh</em>”), the court dealt with a clause of a similar
                    effect, which stated as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The title shall commence with an indenture of conveyance on sale dated the
                            23<sup>rd</sup> January 1869, and <em>the prior title</em>, whether appearing in any abstracted
                        document or not, shall not be required, investigated or objected to.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The purchasers subsequently discovered
                        <em>aliunde</em> that the seller’s title was
                    defective and sought to rescind the transaction. The court recognised that there
                    were two possible interpretations to such clauses, <em>viz</em> (at p 193):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_a"></a>(a)     the purchaser is precluded from
                        making requisitions upon or inquiries from the vendor as to the
                        latter’s title, but does not prevent the purchaser from showing that
                        the vendor’s title is defective;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_b"></a>(b)     the purchaser is precluded both from making requisitions
                        upon or inquiries from the vendor as to the latter’s title, and also
                        from making any inquiry or investigation to the vendor’s title
                        anywhere.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     On the facts of that case, the court found
                    that there were other terms in the contract to the effect that “title
                    should not be inquired into”. As a result, the only reasonable meaning of
                    the term would be that inquiry was “altogether precluded for every
                    purpose”, and that the title was accepted by the purchaser without
                    objection or inquiry (at p 195). Significantly, in one of the cases cited
                    by the court, <em>viz</em>, <em>Waddell v
                        Wolfe</em> (1874) 9 QB 515 (per Justice Blackburn), if the seller
                    meant to express that the purchaser was bound to accept whatever the title was,
                    he would need to do so in clear and unambiguous words (see <em>Marsh</em> at p 198 and, further, the decision of Chan Sek
                    Keong JC in <em>Algemene Bank Nederland NV v Tan Chin
                        Tiong</em> [1985-1986] SLR(R) 1154 at <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Here, I do not accept that Hat was precluded
                    from raising any objection to title by reason of cl 3 of the Agreement.
                    Clause 3 simply provides that Hat could not make any requisitions arising
                    from documents not in the Ngs’ possession and object as a consequence
                    – there is no language suggesting that Hat is precluded from independently
                    investigating the Ngs’ title. Indeed, cl 3 is silent about the issue
                    of title. In addition, a term that Hat was so precluded would contradict the
                    obligation (which the Ngs admit to owing, see <a href="#p1_37">[37]</a> above) to give good title to Villa 2. As such, even if the
                    Ngs had raised this issue, I do not think that it would have assisted their
                    case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Argument based on Promissory Estoppel</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The Ngs appear to argue that Hat is estopped
                    from asserting that it required them (the Ngs) to transfer good title, relying
                    (especially) on the e-mail sent by Samuel on 5 March 2008.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_96" id="Ftn_96_1"><sup>[note: 96]</sup></a></span> In that e-mail, Samuel
                    stated that Hat was seeking ‘“title” of some
                    “kind”’, and that if the Ngs were unable to procure
                    Sarot’s performance, they could transfer whatever they had to Hat, and
                    leave Sarot to Samuel’s “devices”. In short, the Ngs are
                    arguing that even if there was a mistake in using Sarot to procure the transfer
                    of title to Villa 2 under the One-Step Process, Hat would have been estopped
                    from requiring good title from the Ngs. It is trite principle that it is
                    necessary to show an unequivocal representation and reliance on the
                    representation in order to succeed under the doctrine of promissory estoppel
                        (<em>Chitty on Contracts</em> (Beale gen ed) (Sweet
                    &amp; Maxwell, 2008, 30<sup>th</sup> Ed) (“<em>Chitty on Contracts</em>”) at para 3-086). Here,
                    however, I do not think that Samuel had made an unequivocal representation that
                    Hat did not require good title. Samuel had, as I mentioned earlier, premised his
                    statements on the basis that Sarot had title to Villa 2 (see <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> above). In my view, this showed that Samuel was
                    not, as the words read on their own might suggest, waiving Hat’s right to
                    receive good title to Villa 2.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Even if it was possible to construe the
                    representation as unequivocal, the other difficulty is that there is no evidence
                    that the Ngs had relied on this representation. Maria’s subsequent reply
                    did not suggest that she had done anything in reliance of the representation.
                    Furthermore, I found it telling that the Ngs did not make express mention to
                    these representations made by Samuel in their respective Affidavits of
                    Evidence-in-Chief, and nothing was said in cross-examination to suggest that
                    they had relied on those representations. As such, even assuming that the Ngs
                    had properly pleaded the ground of promissory estoppel, their claim would have
                    failed on these grounds.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the defects relied on by Hat were matters of
                conveyance</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     A defect is considered a matter of conveyance
                    if it is removable as of right by the seller (see <em>Emmet on
                        Title</em> at para 5.007). These have to be acts that the seller
                    can perform immediately and independently of others’ consent (<em>id</em>). I find it difficult to see how the defects alleged
                    by Hat can be considered a matter of conveyance. To support its contention, the
                    Ngs submitted that “there was no doubt that the Plaintiffs were the
                    owners of [Villa 2]”, but did not explain how they could remove the
                    alleged defects as of right or independently of others’ consent. I
                    therefore dismiss this unmeritorious aspect of the Ngs’
                argument.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether Hat was concerned with good title to Villa 2</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     I will now deal with the Ngs’
                    submissions that Hat was not seeking to receive good title to Villa 2, relying
                    on the e-mails sent between Bolliger and Samuel, especially Samuel’s
                    responses (see above at <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a> and <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a>).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_97" id="Ftn_97_1"><sup>[note: 97]</sup></a></span> I am of the view that these e-mails have
                    little or no evidential value, insofar they are relied on to show that there was
                    no requirement under the Agreement to transfer good title, as they would not
                    have been probative of the objective intentions of the parties since they were
                    not sent or copied to the Ngs at the time of the transaction (see generally
                        <em>Zurich Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd v B-Gold Interior
                        Design &amp; Construction Pte Ltd</em> [2008] 3 SLR(R) 1029 at
                    [131]). Similarly, given that these e-mails were not made known to the Ngs, I do
                    not think that it can be relied on to constitute any waiver, estoppel or
                    acceptance by Hat.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Who is to complete the transfer of Villa 2 now?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Hat’s case is that Southern Land has
                    title to Villa 2. Its expert, Pichitpon, takes the position that regardless of
                    whether the Ngs ever held title to Villa 2, at the time of the purported
                    transfer of Villa 2 on 23 May 2008, Southern Land had and still has title
                    to Villa 2.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_98" id="Ftn_98_1"><sup>[note: 98]</sup></a></span> Hat
                    adopts the same view in its submissions.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_99" id="Ftn_99_1"><sup>[note: 99]</sup></a></span> For this very reason, Hat contends that
                    the Ngs were remiss in their obligation to transfer good title to it, for if the
                    Ngs had no title to Villa 2, they could not procure any transfer of good title
                    to it (<em>ie</em>, Hat). At this juncture, I must
                    emphasize that I cannot and do not make such a finding. Instead, I will consider
                    the merits of Hat’s defence and counterclaim, by taking (without deciding)
                    its case at its highest (<em>ie</em>, that Southern Land
                    has title to Villa 2).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     As I mentioned earlier, the Ngs were under an
                    obligation to transfer good title to Villa 2 to Hat. The mode of performance
                    originally contemplated by the parties is enshrined under cl 9 of the
                    Agreement, which states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[The Ngs] shall (at the request of [Hat] and at no cost to [the Ngs])
                        execute the usual Deed of Assignment in [Hat’s] favour. Provided that
                        nothing herein shall obliged [the Ngs] to participate in any claims or legal
                        proceedings against any party referred to in the Deed of Assignment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In other words, both parties contemplated, at the time of entering into the
                    Agreement, an <em>assignment</em> of the Ngs’
                    interest in the Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Insofar as the parties had originally
                    contemplated that the transfer of title to the Property was to be by way of an
                    assignment, it is clear that the intended mode of performance was subsequently
                    varied by the parties. On 4 January 2008, Maria wrote to inform Samuel that
                    Surasak, the Ngs’ Thai lawyers, had advised that the registration of the
                    Property be carried out in two parts, <em>viz</em>, the
                    Land and Villa 2.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_100" id="Ftn_100_1"><sup>[note: 100]</sup></a></span>
                    Samuel knew that the transfer would be bifurcated, as he was able to point out,
                    subsequently on 20 January 2008, that the completion date may have to be
                    pushed back due to the requirement to post a notice for 30 days in respect of
                    Villa 2.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_101" id="Ftn_101_1"><sup>[note: 101]</sup></a></span>
                    Colin also gave unchallenged evidence to this effect.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_102" id="Ftn_102_1"><sup>[note: 102]</sup></a></span> More
                    tellingly, on 1 February 2008, Samuel sent Maria an e-mail suggesting that
                    they meet up to “discuss an amendment to our [Agreement] which separates
                    the two transactions (Land and [Villa 2])”. An agreement on how the
                    Property would be transferred was eventually reached between the parties. On
                    5 February 2008, T&amp;G proceeded to inform Surasak (<em>ie</em>, the Ngs’ Thai lawyers) that it was preparing two
                    separate documents, first for Hat to purchase Villa 2 from the Ngs and, next,
                    for Hat to register the lease for the Land with Southern Land. T&amp;G also
                    asked Southern Land to prepare documents to register the lease and superficies
                    for the Land between Southern Land and Hat and stated that it (Hat) was
                    preparing a Land Lease Agreement (presumably to be entered into by Southern Land
                    and Hat).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_103" id="Ftn_103_1"><sup>[note: 103]</sup></a></span>
                    Those acts clearly evinced an intention to transfer Villa 2 and the Land
                    separately. Importantly, Samuel had agreed with Maria’s statement that the
                    parties agreed to split the payment into two parts, with one payment being due
                    when the Land was transferred and the other being due when Villa 2 was
                        transferred.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_104" id="Ftn_104_1"><sup>[note: 104]</sup></a></span> It
                    is therefore clear that the parties had agreed to vary the mode of performance,
                    such that the Property would be transferred in two tranches, one for Villa 2 and
                    another for the Land.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Although the inspiration for the bifurcation
                    came from Maria (on the advice of her Thai lawyers), it is clear that Hat was
                    the driving force in effecting the bifurcation. As highlighted above (at
                        <a href="#p1_59">[59]</a>), Hat (through its Thai lawyers)
                    contacted Surasak (the Ngs’ Thai lawyers) and Southern Land to complete
                    the necessary documentation. More importantly, in the two e-mails which T&amp;G
                    sent to Southern Land and Surasak (which I have already referred to in the
                    previous paragraph), T&amp;G implicitly suggested that the 2001 Lease and the
                    superficies agreement entered into between the Ngs and Southern Land would be
                    cancelled, and that in its place, Hat would enter into and register a fresh
                    lease and superficies agreement with Southern Land.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_105" id="Ftn_105_1"><sup>[note: 105]</sup></a></span> This was, in substance,
                    the procedure by which the transfer of title to the Land was eventually effected
                    on 7 March 2008 (see above at <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a>),
                    and no dispute arises from this transfer of title to the Land.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     It is noteworthy that the 2008 Land Lease
                    confers a number of valuable rights and imposes various obligations on Hat in
                    respect of Villa 2, as follow:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_61-p2_a"></a>(a)     Clause 4.3 – Hat was to
                        maintain Villa 2 and to keep it in good condition at its own
                    expense;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_61-p2_b"></a>(b)     Clause 4.4 – Hat was entitled to make any additions,
                        alterations, modifications or improvements to Villa 2 without Southern
                        Land’s prior consent, subject to the law, with Southern Land agreeing
                        to co-operate and sign all documents necessary to obtain a permit to do the
                        same;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_61-p2_c"></a>(c)     Clause 4.5 – Hat was to pay for the general utility
                        charges;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_61-p2_d"></a>(d)     Clause 5.1 – Hat was entitled to sublet or transfer Villa 2
                        without Southern Land’s consent;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_61-p2_e"></a>(e)     Clause 5.4 – Hat was entitled to insure Villa
                        2 throughout the term of the lease and would be the beneficiary of the
                        policy; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_61-p2_f"></a>(f)     Clause 5.9 – Southern Land admitted that Hat owned and had the
                        right to deal with (including demolishing) “the building, structures,
                        additions, alterations, modification or improvements constructed or made on
                        the [Land]”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The 2008 Land Lease is in <em>pari materia</em> with the
                    2001 Lease which the Ngs obtained from Southern Land. In this regard, two points
                    are noteworthy. First, Hat effectively received, under the 2008 Land Lease, the
                        <em>same</em> rights that the Ngs had <em>prior</em> to 7 March 2008 (when the 2001 Lease was
                    terminated). As such, Hat stepped into the Ngs’ shoes on 7 March 2008
                    by entering into the 2008 Land Lease with Southern Land. Second, from the terms
                    of the 2008 Land Lease (which took effect from 7 March 2008), it is clear
                    that Southern Land had conferred on Hat a longer lease than the Ngs had prior to
                    7 March 2008 as well as a number of valuable rights <em>in
                        relation to Villa 2</em>, rights which I should add are typically
                    conferred to the <em>owner</em> of a building. Indeed,
                    Pichitpon agreed during cross-examination that by cll 5.1 and 5.9 of the
                    2008 Lease, Southern Land recognised Hat as the owner of Villa 2 and that Hat
                    could do whatever it wanted.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_106" id="Ftn_106_1"><sup>[note: 106]</sup></a></span> However, the expert witnesses on Thai law
                        (<em>ie</em>, Pichitpon and Supachai Arunthamsakul
                    (Hat’s expert witnesses) and Supasak Chirasavinuprapand (the Ngs’
                    expert witness)), all agree that cl 5.9, by itself, did not confer legal
                    ownership of Villa 2 on Hat. In other words, Hat was the <em>de
                        facto</em> owner of Villa 2 and the only missing step towards Hat
                    obtaining “good title” to Villa 2 would be the proper registration
                    of a standard form sale and purchase agreement transferring title to Villa 2
                    into Hat’s name, as required by section 1299 of the Thai Civil and
                    Commercial Code.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_107" id="Ftn_107_1"><sup>[note: 107]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     At this juncture, again taking (without
                    deciding) Hat’s defence at its highest, if Southern Land was indeed the
                    legal owner of Villa 2, it would follow that the key to the present dispute was
                    the mistake made by the parties in purporting to transfer good title to Villa 2
                    using Sarot and his Construction Permit (be it through the One-Step Process or
                    the Two-Step Process). It follows that what ought to have been done on
                    7 March 2008 was for Southern Land to execute a standard form sale and
                    purchase agreement in respect of Villa 2 and to thereafter register the same at
                    the Phuket Land Office in order to transfer title to Hat.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     From that analysis, the next question which
                    arises is: on whom should the responsibility of procuring the registration of
                    the agreement to purchase Villa 2 by Hat from Southern Land rest? In my view,
                    this obligation would fall squarely on Hat for the following reasons. Before
                    entering into the 2008 Land Lease, it is clear that Hat was the driving force
                    behind procuring the transfer of title to the Land and Villa 2, having sent out
                    various e-mails seeking the relevant stakeholders to do the necessary. Once the
                    2001 Lease was terminated (<em>ie</em>, on 7 March
                    2008), the Ngs no longer had any contractual nexus with Southern Land. (There is
                    no suggestion that Thai law is different from Singapore law.) It could not
                    compel Southern Land to register title to Villa 2 in Hat’s name. Such
                    power would have been vested in Hat by virtue of the 2008 Land Lease, which, as
                    I have observed, conferred important rights and obligations, vis-à-vis Villa 2,
                    on Hat. It should be noted that this arrangement (to cancel the 2001 Lease and
                    execute the 2008 Land Lease) was suggested and put into practice by Hat and its
                    lawyers. With the benefit of legal advice, Hat should or ought to have known
                    that the implication of asking the Ngs to terminate the 2001 Lease and entering
                    into a fresh lease with Southern Land (<em>ie</em>, the
                    2008 Land Lease) would have been that the Ngs were no longer in the position to
                    ask Southern Land to register title to Villa 2 in Hat’s name. Hat itself
                    had recognised that it could ask Southern Land to transfer title to Villa 2 if
                    the One-Step Process failed (see <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a>
                    above). Having agreed to vary the mode of performing the Agreement to such an
                    extent, it could not now turn the tables against Ngs and accuse the Ngs of being
                    in breach of their obligation to confer good title, when Hat was the party that
                    had not sought out Southern Land to effect transfer of title to Villa 2. Quite
                    plainly, the Ngs had given Hat all the rights they had, and Hat was happy to
                    receive these rights, knowing (objectively speaking) that by this process, all
                    that remained was registration of title to Villa 2 with Southern Land which only
                    it (<em>ie</em>, Hat), and not the Ngs, could
                    effect.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     I must also point out that Hat had done
                    various acts which were consistent with that of the owner of Villa 2. First, it
                    entered into possession of Villa 2, as it had collected the keys to Villa 2 from
                    Maria on 3rd June 2008.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_108" id="Ftn_108_1"><sup>[note: 108]</sup></a></span> Furthermore, Hat paid for various
                    utility charges in respect of Villa 2 from 1 April 2008 onwards (see
                        <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a> above).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_109" id="Ftn_109_1"><sup>[note: 109]</sup></a></span> Again, these acts only serve to illustrate
                    that Hat was happy to receive rights to Villa 2 under the 2008 Land Lease and
                    that it had regarded itself as the <em>de facto</em> owner
                    to Villa 2.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     For the above reasons, it seems to me that Hat
                    has no case against the Ngs for breach of contract assuming one accepts its case
                    at its highest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     Even if, for the sake of argument, it was the
                    Ngs who were in breach of contract, I do not see how the remedy of specific
                    performance, which Hat is seeking, would be available. Where a person has agreed
                    to sell land which he does not own, the court will not compel the purported
                    owner to convey such land to him because it would be impossible for the
                    purported owner to do so (see <em>Chitty on Contracts</em>
                    at para 27-041 and <em>The Law of Contract</em> (Edwin
                    Peel gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 12<sup>th</sup> Ed,
                    2007) at para 21-033). As such, if Southern Land is the party with title to
                    Villa 2 (as Hat contends), it would necessarily follow that the Ngs do not have
                    title to Villa 2, and for this reason, no decree of specific performance can be
                    made in Hat’s favour against the Ngs. On the other hand, if the Ngs had
                    not been in breach of contract and the obligation to secure registration of
                    title to Villa 2 resided with Hat, it would seem to me, to the contrary, that
                    the order for specific performance ought to be made in the Ngs’ favour
                    against Hat, given (for the above reasons) that Hat was the only party that
                    could procure such registration from Southern Land.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Having reached the conclusion that the dispute
                    on title is non-justiciable on grounds of the <em>Mocambique</em> principle, the normal course would be for me to
                    dismiss the action. However, I note that the circumstances of the present case
                    are exceptional. Both parties had submitted, wrongly as I have concluded, that
                    the <em>Mocambique</em> principle would not infect the
                    present proceedings. In my view, resolution of the core dispute on title depends
                    on a determination of Thai law by the Thai courts, and this court ought not to
                    treat these questions of Thai law as questions of fact to be resolved based on
                    the experts’ evidence (see also <a href="#p1_37">[37]</a>
                    above). Looking back to the time of the trial, the issues before me were not
                    properly crystallised so much so that much time and effort were expanded by both
                    parties in advancing and/or defending their respective cases. In addition, for
                    the reasons explained above, it seems to me that even if I accept Hat’s
                    case on the issue of title (a finding which I do not and cannot make), Hat would
                    still not have succeeded against the Ngs for the alleged breach of their
                    contractual obligation to give good title.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     Given the special circumstances as described,
                    I propose to and do order a stay of the present action for the parties to sort
                    out the fundamental issues relating to title, such that the <em>Mocambique</em> principle is not offended and only the contractual
                    issues remain alive before this court. In this regard, the parties are to do the
                    needful without any unnecessary delay. Having heard the diametrically opposed
                    views held by the parties, they will probably need to obtain a conclusive ruling
                    from the Thai courts as to whether Hat had received good title to Villa 2
                    through the One-Step Process, be it (<em>inter alia</em>) a
                    consequence of the Ngs (or even Sarot) being able to give good title and/or of
                    Southern Land’s involvement during the registration process which was
                    after the 2008 Land Lease had been registered, giving Hat <em>de
                        facto</em> ownership of Villa 2. Once a ruling from the Thai courts is
                    obtained, this court will be placed in a position to determine the contractual
                    rights or obligations of each party (including the claim against Bolliger).
                    Meanwhile, the money which Hat has paid into court will remain
                there.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     There is, of course, a second and (in my view)
                    more straightforward alternative that the parties may wish to consider for
                    pragmatic reasons. Since Hat’s case is that Southern Land had title to
                    Villa 2, and that Southern Land ought to have transferred title to Villa 2 to
                    it, it seems to me that Hat is in the position to do exactly that. In fact,
                    Southern Land had throughout the dispute been co-operative, which is a stance
                    consistent with there being no adverse claim to Villa 2 by Southern Land.
                    Hat’s expert witnesses testified that this allegedly defective
                    registration (from Sarot) can be removed in one of two ways: either by applying
                    to the Director-General of the Phuket Land Office or by obtaining a court order.
                    They also testified that either Hat, the Ngs or even Southern Land could submit
                    an application to the Director-General, and that the process would take
                    approximately six months.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_110" id="Ftn_110_1"><sup>[note: 110]</sup></a></span> The Ngs, apart from asserting that
                    Pichitpon had never made such an application to the Director-General before, did
                    not meaningfully challenge this aspect of Hat’s witnesses’
                        evidence.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_111" id="Ftn_111_1"><sup>[note: 111]</sup></a></span> As such, either
                    the Ngs or Hat could cancel the title Hat obtained through the One-Step Process.
                    Hat and Southern Land by reason of the 2008 Land Lease could thereafter register
                    a sale and purchase of Villa 2 to confer title to Villa 2 in Hat’s name.
                    Indeed, this may be the more practicable solution to resolving the dispute
                    between the parties. To this end, it is hoped that the parties can take a
                    practical view towards resolving this case, as neither will gain from remaining
                    in this impasse caused by the application of the <em>Mocambique</em> principle. If there are any remaining issues which
                    may arise if this pragmatic suggestion is taken up, for example, as to who
                    should bear the cost of such cancellation, they can come back to court to
                    resolve such ancillary disputes (provided that it does not offend the <em>Mocambique</em> principle).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     In this judgment, the contractual issues
                    between the Ngs and Hat, including the claim against Bolliger, are reserved
                    pending the outcome of the stay order which takes effect from the date of this
                    judgment until further order.</p>
