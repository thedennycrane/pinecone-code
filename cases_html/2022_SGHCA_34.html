</div> and subsequently engaged GTMS, on the Singapore Institute of Architects, Articles and Conditions of Building Contract (Lump Sum Contract) (9th Ed, September 2010) (the “SIA Conditions”), to construct the three bungalows. The construction works and the parties’ relationship started off well, but unfortunately as the works progressed, things did not proceed smoothly and it rapidly descended into acrimonious disputes between Mr Ser, GTMS, and Mr Chan. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">3 </span>In <span class="font-italic">GTMS Construction Pte Ltd v Ser Kim Koi</span><span class="font-italic"> (Chan Sau Yan and Chan Sau Yan Associates, third parties) </span>[2015] 1 SLR 671, GTMS applied for summary judgment against Mr Ser on the basis of two Interim Payment Certificates 25 and 26 (“IC 25” and “IC 26” respectively) which were issued by Mr Chan. Mr Ser resisted the application arguing that IC 25 and IC 26 were tainted by fraud. GTMS prevailed before the High Court but on appeal (see <span class="font-italic">Ser Kim Koi v GTMS Construction Pte Ltd </span>[2016] 3 SLR 51 (the “CA Judgment”)), the Court of Appeal (the “CA”) set aside the summary judgment. The CA found that on the evidence presented before it, neither IC 25 nor IC 26 had temporary finality (CA Judgment at [70]–[92]) and Mr Chan had issued the Completion Certificate (“CC”), IC 25, and IC 26 improperly, without belief in their truth and/or recklessly, without caring whether they were true or false. The CA also held that the fraud exception in cl 31(13) of the SIA Conditions included recklessness in certification (CA Judgment at [38]–[40]). Further the CC, IC 25 and IC 26 were not properly issued under the SIA Conditions (CA Judgment at [98]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">4 </span>The dispute then went back before the High Court for trial (the “Suit”). GTMS claimed unpaid sums from Mr Ser arising from two interim payment claims (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, IC 25 and IC 26) and the final payment claim that were certified by Mr Chan. Mr Ser, in counterclaim, mounted a litany of allegations that GTMS and Mr Chan had entered into an unlawful means conspiracy against him by, among other things, improperly granting extensions of time, certifying as satisfactory deficient works that were not rectified, and certifying the Project as being complete when it was not safe for occupation. Mr Ser also alleged other contractual and tortious claims against GTMS and Mr Chan. In response, Mr Chan counterclaimed against Mr Ser for unpaid architect’s fees.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">5 </span>After a trial spanning close to 60 days, the High Court judge (the “Judge”), in a detailed judgment spanning some 419 pages, allowed GTMS’s and Mr Chan’s claims. However, he dismissed the bulk of Mr Ser’s claims. The Judge’s decision is reported in <span class="font-italic">GTMS Construction Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Ser Kim Koi (Chan Sau Yan (formerly trading as Chan Sau Yan Associates) and another, third parties)</span> [2021] SGHC 9 (the “Judgment”).

In our judgment, the Judge was correct to find that there was a delay in the completion of the works. However, with respect, we consider that he erred in his determination of the length<span class="font-italic"> </span>of the delay, the certification process that should have been carried out, and the determination of liquidated damages. Further, the Judge erred in finding that Mr Ser had no claim against GTMS<span class="font-italic"> </span>in liquidated damages for the delay, and the Judge erred in denying Mr Ser’s claim against Mr Chan. However, we affirm the Judge’s costs orders below.

Under the terms of the Contract, GTMS was to undertake the Works for a sum of $13.13m. In addition, Mr Ser engaged several consultants on the recommendation of Mr Chan, namely: (a) Chee Choon &amp; Associates (“CCA”), as the mechanical and engineering (“M&amp;E”) consultant; (b) Faithful+Gould Pte Ltd (“F+G”), as the quantity surveyor; (c) Web Structures Pte Ltd, as the civil and structural engineer (“Web”); and (d) Mr Leong Kien Keong, as the Resident Technical Officer (“RTO Leong”) (collectively, the “Consultants”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">11 </span>The original completion date for the Works was 21 February 2013.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">14 </span>Mr Ser’s claims were, in contrast, rather complicated. He alleged that GTMS and Mr Chan (and by extension, CSYA) were involved in an unlawful means conspiracy. On Mr Ser’s account of events, the alleged conspiracy against him was based on the following:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) EOT 2 and EOT 3 were improperly granted. The contractual completion date for the Works should have remained as 21 February 2013, instead of being extended to 17 April 2013. This was for a few reasons (Judgment at [17] and [20]):</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) There was no proper basis for the grant of EOT 2 as GTMS had failed to exercise due diligence, a precondition under cl 23(1) of the SIA Conditions. While Mr Chan took into account SPPG’s delay in electrical turn-on, he had failed to consider GTMS’s own delay in electrical installation works which had to be done before SPPG could connect the incoming power supply, which Mr Ser asserted had been delayed for more than four and a half months. </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) Likewise, there was no basis for the grant of EOT 3, as GTMS had failed to exercise due diligence. Prior to electrical turn-on, SPPG had to conduct testing and inspection on-site and the Project had failed the first round of testing and inspection (the “First Testing”) conducted on 14, 20 and 21 March 2013. This failure was due to construction-related issues caused by GTMS, which had to rectify such issues before the Project was able to pass the second round of testing and inspection (the “Second Testing”) conducted on 27 March, 2 and 8 April 2013. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b)  The CC was prematurely issued because the Works could not be deemed to be completed by 17 April 2013. The contractual prerequisites, contained in cl 24(4) of the SIA Conditions and Item 72 of the preliminaries of the bills of quantities (the “Preliminaries”), which had to be fulfilled prior to the grant of the CC, were not fulfilled (Judgment at [23]–[28]). In the same vein, the MC was prematurely issued because there were still outstanding defects in the Works by 7 July 2014, when the MC was issued (Judgment at [29]–[30]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Since the CC and MC were prematurely issued, it followed that IC 25, IC 26 and the FC were similarly prematurely issued (Judgment at [32]–[33]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Further, the liquidated damages and the costs of rectifying defective works should have been deducted from the sums certified under IC 25, IC 26 and the FC. In the same vein, the first moiety of retention money under IC 25 should not have been certified (Judgment at [34]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Mr Chan approved GTMS’s claims for Prime Cost Sum (“PC Sum”) items and Prime Cost Rate (“PC Rate”) items without basis. These claims needed to be supported with proper documentation, which GTMS failed to adduce (Judgment at [35]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">15 </span>The alleged facts which gave rise to this claim in unlawful means conspiracy also supported <span class="font-italic">alternative </span>and <span class="font-italic">independent </span>claims in contract and negligence, which were also pursued by Mr Ser against GTMS and Mr Chan. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">16 </span>Correspondingly, Mr Ser made the following counterclaims against GTMS:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) liquidated damages of $3,600 per calendar day from 22 February 2013 to 21 July 2014;

Broadly, the Judge granted GTMS’s claims against Mr Ser and dismissed the majority of Mr Ser’s counterclaims against both GTMS and Mr Chan. The Judge made the following findings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">19 </span>To begin with, both EOT 2 and EOT 3 were properly granted pursuant to cl 23 of the SIA Conditions, as SPPG, the entity responsible for the installation of electricity works, had delayed the power connection. This, in turn, caused a further delay in the testing and commissioning (“T&amp;C”) of the M&amp;E works. The delay on the part of SPPG amounted to a <span class="font-italic">force majeure </span>event, which justified the grant of EOT 2 and EOT 3, within the meaning of cl 23(1)(a) of the SIA Conditions (Judgment at [296(b)]–[296(c)]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">20 </span>However, notwithstanding the validly granted EOTs, the CC was nevertheless prematurely issued. This is because the Works could not have been deemed to be completed as of 17 April 2013. The earliest the Works could have been deemed to be completed was 28 May 2013. Among other things, the Judge found that:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Item 72 of the Preliminaries was validly incorporated into the Contract, and the CC thus could not be granted unless the three requirements in Item 72 were satisfied (Judgment at [306] and [317]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Item 72(a) of the Preliminaries, which required that the Works be ready for occupation and use in Mr Chan’s opinion, was satisfied on 28 May 2013, when the rectifications of the unequal steps and risers were completed. Even though the Project failed the Second TOP Inspection on 18 June 2013, this did not prevent Item 72(a) from being satisfied, since the Second TOP Inspection had failed due to reasons that were not within GTMS’s scope of work (Judgment at [334]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Item 72(b) of the Preliminaries, which required all services to undergo satisfactory T&amp;C, and for the testing documentation to be handed to Mr Ser, was satisfied by 17 April 2013. Even though the testing documents were <span class="font-italic">not </span>handed to Mr Ser by the required date, this constituted a <span class="font-italic">de minimis</span> breach (Judgment at [381]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Item 72(c) of the Preliminaries, which required all work done under the Contract, including rectifications, to be of acceptable standards, was also satisfied as of 28 May 2013. While there were some defects outstanding with the bungalows, these defects were not so serious as to prevent Item 72(c) from being satisfied (Judgment at [574]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">On the basis that the CC could have only been issued on 28 May 2013 at the earliest, the revised maintenance period of one year would end on 27 May 2014.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">21 </span>Therefore, while the contractual completion period was validly extended cumulatively by EOT 2 and EOT 3 to 17 April 2013, the CC could have only been issued on 28 May, over a month later. However, Mr Ser was not entitled to any liquidated damages from GTMS in respect of this delay. This was because Mr Chan, as Mr Ser’s agent, had instructed GTMS not to commence rectification of the steps and risers until after the First TOP Inspection (see [12] above). This constituted an act of prevention which rendered the liquidated damages clause inoperable as against GTMS (Judgment at [661]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">22 </span>Further, the payment certificates pursuant to which GTMS claimed against Mr Ser, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, IC 25, IC 26 and the FC (collectively, the “Payment Certificates”), were validly issued.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, there was no need, contrary to Mr Ser’s position, for GTMS to furnish proof that it <span class="font-italic">actually paid </span>the nominated subcontractors and suppliers before it could claim payment from Mr Ser. It sufficed for GTMS to substantiate its payment claims with invoices and quotations from the subcontractors and suppliers. Further, there was insufficient evidence to show that GTMS inflated its payment claims by concealing from Mr Ser discounts that it had received from the nominated subcontractors and suppliers (Judgment at [651]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Secondly, Mr Ser was wrong to insist that the payment claims be calculated by deducting certain sums that were handwritten by GTMS in its tender documents. Rather, the sums to be deducted were sums estimated by Mr Chan after discussion with the other consultants (Judgment at [636]–[643]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">23 </span>Therefore, in summary, GTMS’s claims under IC 25, IC 26 and FC were valid. Mr Ser’s assertion of a conspiracy against him was unfounded and entirely bereft of evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">24 </span>Accordingly, the Judge made the following orders:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Mr Ser was to pay GTMS $1,103,915.48 in total, representing the unpaid sums under a series of tax invoices following the completed construction of the Project (Judgment at [707]–[710]);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Mr Ser was to pay Mr Chan the sum of $60,990 plus interest of 3% above the prime rate from the amount due date, as part of the architect’s fee, with Mr Ser being entitled to set off the sum of $10,388.56 from this amount (Judgment at [711]–[717] and [749(d)]); and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Mr Ser’s counterclaims were dismissed, save for his claim for (i) rectifying the grouting in the swimming pools for $4,555.20, (ii) for the amount overpaid in respect of the missing trellis beam for $708.40 and (iii) for utility fees incurred in the Project up to 23 July 2014 (<span class="font-italic">ie, </span>the date when the Project was handed over) amounting to $27,916.82 (Judgment at [749(b)(xi)], [749(b)(xii)], and [749(b)(xix)]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Costs Judgment</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">25 </span>On 10 February 2021, the Judge delivered the Costs Judgment. In summary, the Judge made the following orders (see [1] and [36]–[37] of the Costs Judgment):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the judgment sum awarded to GTMS (<span class="font-italic">ie, </span>the sum of $1,103,915.48) was to include the default interest rate of 5.33% per <span class="font-italic">annum</span>;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Mr Ser was to pay GTMS costs on a standard basis from 13 January 2014 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the date the writ for the Suit was filed) up until 8 November 2018 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the date of the commencement of the trial) with costs payable on an indemnity basis thereafter, given his unreasonable conduct in bringing a speculative action clearly without any basis, and his reckless conduct in the course of proceedings; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Mr Ser was to pay Mr Chan and CSYA costs on a standard basis from 29 January 2014 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the date of the third party notice to join third parties to the Suit) up until 6 March 2017 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the deadline for Mr Ser to accept the open offer to settle), with costs payable on an indemnity basis thereafter, given that two letters containing offers to settle made by Mr Chan and CSYA were more favorable to Mr Ser than the outcome under the Judgment and it would have been eminently reasonable for him to accept such offers. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">26 </span>The Judge also found that it was inappropriate to order two sets of costs in respect of each of the third parties, <span class="font-italic">ie, </span>Mr Chan and CSYA, because there was, in reality, little distinction made between them during the proceedings. In addition, the circumstances did not warrant the grant of a Certificate of Three Counsel, as sought for by Mr Chan, because while the matter may have been of great personal and professional importance to Mr Chan, the Suit did not go beyond what would usually be the case for parties personally involved in litigation. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Arguments on appeal</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">27 </span>On appeal, Mr Ser does not seriously maintain that there was a conspiracy against him, and rightly so in our view. However, he maintains that the various claims in contract and negligence, which had constituted the alleged conspiracy (see [14] above), were wrongly rejected by the Judge. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">28 </span>In addition, Mr Ser argues that EOT 2 and EOT 3 were wrongly granted by Mr Chan as the preconditions in cl 23 of the SIA Conditions had not been duly satisfied. Further, the prerequisites in Item 72 of the Preliminaries (see [20] above) remain unsatisfied, with the effect that the CC (and all subsequent certificates predicated on the CC) could not have been issued even until today. There is thus a delay in the completion of the Works, which entitles Mr Ser to claim liquidated damages against GTMS and/or Mr Chan. Further, the certificates which GTMS rely on to claim against Mr Ser (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, IC 25, IC 26 and the FC) were not validly issued. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">29 </span>GTMS and Mr Chan, in response, argue that the Judge was entirely justified in making the findings that he did. To this extent, they reproduce broadly their submissions before the Judge below. In relation to Mr Chan, one particular thread in his arguments is that even if he did not exercise due competence in his capacity as an architect, Mr Ser could only, as a matter of law, mount a claim against GTMS and not him. As we shall go on to explain, we are unpersuaded by this argument. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issues on appeal</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">30 </span>The main issues to be determined in this appeal are hence:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Issue 1: Whether EOT 2 and EOT 3 were properly granted by Mr Chan to GTMS;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Issue 2: Whether the CC was properly granted by Mr Chan to GTMS; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Issue 3: Whether IC 25, IC 26 and FC were properly issued; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Issue 4: The remedies available as between Mr Ser and GTMS, as well as between Mr Ser and Mr Chan.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Whilst we shall consider each of these issues in turn, the parties have unfortunately raised a host of sub-issues, quite a few of which are without any merit.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  AC at para 79.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> There, the terms of a contract note in relation to a sale of steel contained the following clause: “[s]ubject to <span class="font-italic">force maj</span><span class="font-italic">eure </span>conditions that the government restricts the export of the material at the time of delivery” and the buyers relied on the note as evidence of a contract. McNair J rejected the buyers’ argument and held that the contract note and the buyers’ letter of acceptance did not purport to be an offer and acceptance constituting a written contract; the <span class="font-italic">force majeure </span>clause was so vague that it prevented the finding that any enforceable contract was made.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">51 </span>In our view, such a sweeping proposition as contended for by Mr Ser cannot be derived from <span class="font-italic">British Electrical</span>. That case is clearly distinguishable from the case before us. <span class="font-italic">British Electrical </span>was a case with a differently worded <span class="font-italic">force majeure</span> clause. The phrase used there was “<span class="font-italic">force majeure </span><span class="font-weight-bold">conditions</span>”<br/>[emphasis in bold added] and on the facts of that case, there were a variety of <span class="font-italic">force majeure</span> conditions in the trade but there was no evidence that any particular ones had been relied upon. The main issue in that case was the existence of a contract and McNair J took the view that irrespective of whether the word “conditions” was interpreted as stipulations or contingencies, the entire sentence was vague. He therefore held there was no consensus <span class="font-italic">ad idem </span>and there was hence no concluded contract between the parties. The more usual situations within which <span class="font-italic">force majeure </span>clauses arise are in the context of specific events that release the parties from their mutual obligations under a contract (see <span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract</span><span class="font-italic"> in Singapore </span>(Andrew Phang Boon Leong gen ed) (Academy Publishing, 2012) (“<span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at para 18.003). The present case falls within this category. In addition, this is quite a different kind of clause as it lies within a standard form contract where the <span class="font-italic">force majeure </span>provision is but one paragraph out of seventeen paragraphs in a subclause of clause 23 of the SIA Conditions governing extensions of time. Clause 23(1) and its seventeen paragraphs have to be construed in its context and within not only the SIA Conditions but also the contract between the parties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">52 </span>Mr Ser, through his counsel, does himself no favours when he raises submissions of this nature. The phrase “<span class="font-italic">force majeure</span>” is of some antiquity. In the English common law, one will find references to <span class="font-italic">force majeure</span> in the decided cases, from well over a hundred years ago, on, for example, charterparties, marine insurance and commodity contracts, where <span class="font-italic">force majeure </span>applies as a matter of contract made between the parties. These cases decide whether one party is excused from his contractual obligations because of an event of <span class="font-italic">force majeure</span> as used in that particular contract. It can range from Acts of God to <span class="font-italic">vis major</span> to dislocation of businesses owing to civil war, insurrection, statutory embargoes or other acts of man on a large scale. To pick but one example, in <span class="font-italic">Matsoukis v Priestman &amp; Co </span>[1915] 1 KB 681, it was interpreted to cover dislocation of business owing to a universal coal strike or accidents to machinery but not bad weather, football matches or a funeral. It all depends on how the provision is worded and deployed in the contract and taking into account, where apt or necessary, the relevant context.       </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">53 </span>More importantly, this kind of submission is also disingenuous because <span class="font-italic">force majeure</span> has been considered by the Singapore courts and several guiding principles may be extracted from these cases (see [73]–[77] below).

Fortunately, his counsel did not pursue this argument with too much vigour, and in our view, rightly so.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Hence, taken together, the combined effect of <span class="font-weight-bold">Clauses 23.(3) and 23.(4) </span>is to require the Architect to come to his decision on the period of extension of time to be awarded as soon as the delaying factor has ceased to operate, it is possible to decide the length of the period of extension, and the Contractor has furnished sufficient information. Once he has decided on this issue, the Architect will then issue a written notification of his decision to the Contractor unless there are good reasons why a notification cannot be made immediately following his decision (in which case the Architect has up till the issuance of the Final Certificate to notify the Contractor).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [T]he approach of <span class="font-weight-bold">Clause 23.(2)</span> … recognises the need for the Contractor to have an expeditious decision on whether an extension of time would be granted. As most if not all of the benefits of an expeditious decision on whether an extension of time would be granted would be lost if the Contractor is not also given an expeditious decision on the number of days of extension of time that would be granted, it does not seem logical to oblige the Architect to give a decision on the Contractor’s entitlement to an extension of time within one month but allow the Architect the luxury of months or even years to decide on the actual number of days of extension. The Contractor will need both sets of information in order to properly plan for his works. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Therefore, whilst <span class="font-weight-bold">Clause 23.(3) </span>does serve to protect the Architect should the circumstances are [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] such that he is unable to legitimately come to a decision on the duration of the extension of time until a significant time after the delay has occurred (up till the issuance of the Final Certificate), <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">it should not be read to give the Architect a license to delay a </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">decision (or its notification) if it is one which he could have made earlier.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The Architect therefore should decide on the extension of time within a reasonable time and unless there is a legitimate reason not to do so, this decision should also be notified to the Contractor once it has been made. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in bold in original; emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">61 </span>The current cl 23(3) of the SIA Conditions (see [32] above) provides that after any delaying factor has ceased to operate and it is possible to decide the length of the EOT, the architect “shall determine such period of extension”, but it goes on to provide that the architect shall <span class="font-italic">notify</span> the contractor of his decision in writing to extend time up to and including the issue of the Final Certificate. Three things are apparent from the words used in cl 23(3):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the architect is charged with determining the length of the EOT after any delaying factor has ceased to operate. That accords with common sense as the EOT must be evident in many cases once the delaying event has ceased to operate. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Secondly, it is noteworthy that cl 23(3) draws a distinction between an architect <span class="font-italic">determining</span> the EOT and <span class="font-italic">notifying</span> the contractor of the same. This is of some significance because many texts opine that giving an EOT, which determines the contractor’s liability for liquidated damages, is but one aspect, and it is <span class="font-italic">also</span> preferable to give the contractor a time towards which he can plan, re-allocate or throw in extra resources and implement measures to complete the works by the extended date. However, cl 23(3) does not (as one might expect it to) set a relatively short time limit within which the architect <span class="font-italic">has t</span><span class="font-italic">o notify </span>the contractor of his decision. It is obvious that flexibility has been given to the architect with regard to notifying the contractor of his decision. This also accords with common sense as a delaying factor may have ceased to operate, but there may be other “knock-on” effects to other works downstream, especially, but not only limited to, those lying on the critical path. Hence the architect is given flexibility, within a period up to the issue of the Final Certificate, to notify the contractor of the EOT.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Thirdly, it is clear that in allowing the architect a further period of time, after the delaying factor has ceased to operate, within which he has to notify the contractor of the EOT, there can be no stricture on the architect to make a final determination of the EOT the moment the delaying factor has come to an end under cl 23(3). He is entitled to come to a tentative view for the reasons set out above, hence the additional time granted to <span class="font-italic">notify</span> the contractor of the same. However, as noted at [60] above, the <span class="font-italic">Contract Administration Guide</span> does state that once the architect has decided on the extension of time, he “...will then issue a written notification of his decision…” to the contractor “…unless there are good reasons why a notification cannot be made immediately following his decision…”.   <span class="font-italic"> </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">62 </span>The original cl 23, as drafted by Mr Duncan Wallace QC, did not provide for such flexibility as to when the architect had to notify the contractor of the grant of an EOT. We can turn to Chow Kok Fong, <span class="font-italic">Law and Practice of Construction Contracts </span>vol 1 (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 5th Ed, 2018) (“<span class="font-italic">Law and Practice of Construction Contracts</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>vol 1”) at paras 21.287 and 21.288 to inform us of the history and changes made over various versions of cl 23(3):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The version of this sub-clause in the first edition of the SIA Contract was worded very differently. The original drafting took the view that a contractor should have a target date of completion to work towards. Hence, the granting of time extensions serves more than to determine the contractor’s liability for liquidated damages … Under the original version of the subclause, it would <span class="font-italic">not </span>be valid for a time extension to be certified retrospectively but this is mitigated by the provision that the architect is only required to certify the extension when the delaying factor has ceased to operate and when it is possible to determine the period by which time is to be extended. This particular point was also considered in <span class="font-italic">Tropicon Contractors Pte Ltd v Lojan Properties Pte Ltd </span>(1989). In a passage that was approved subsequently when the case went before the Court of Appeal, Thean J stated that the effect of clause 23(3) is that the architect is required to notify the contractor as to the extension of the contract completion date “as soon as any delaying factor has ceased to operate”.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The present version of clause 23(3) thus permits extension of time to be determined retrospectively although the period allowed for doing this is limited by the issue of the final certificate. <span class="font-italic">It will be appreciated that on this wording, the decision on time extension serves no purpose other than the calculation of the quantum of liquidated damages which may be recovered by the Employer</span>. Although the present version was no doubt introduced at the urging of architects it is respectfully suggested that this has the unfortunate result of shifting the focus of the extension of time provisions from one of compelling the pace of the work to make up for any lost time to that where the primary interest is the calculation of the quantum of liquidated damages. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">63 </span>Mr Ser’s assertion that the Judge erred in relying on the extract from <span class="font-italic">Contra</span><span class="font-italic">ct Administration Guide </span>is misplaced.

</div>
</div>
</div> However, this merely begs the question as to what the correct interpretation of cl 23(3) is and does not answer the question affirmatively. We agree with the Judge that cl 23(3) provides the latest date by which the architect must notify the contractor of its decision. Although cl 23(3) stipulates that the architect is to determine any period of EOT after the delaying factor has ceased to operate and it is possible to decide the length of the period of extension, we do not think this means that the architect can <span class="font-italic">only </span>decide the EOT <span class="font-italic">after </span>the delaying factor has ceased to operate and/or when it is possible to decide the length of the period of extension. Whilst Mr Ser is not wrong in saying that the cessation of the delaying event may allow the architect to determine the impact on completion with greater precision, it is reasonably conceivable that there are situations where it may be possible to determine the impact on completion even prior to the cessation of the delaying event. There is nothing in the words of cl 23(3) or elsewhere in the SIA Conditions that prohibits the grant of an EOT before the delaying factor has ceased to operate. This can happen where there is a delay in the arrival of some material or piece of equipment on site, but based on information received or by some other facts, which may include his experience, the architect is able to determine that the material or piece of equipment will arrive on site by a certain date. As noted above, the earlier an architect is able to determine the EOT application and issue the EOT certificate, the better. Consistent with this approach, cl 23(2) requires the architect, within one month from the receipt of a request from the contractor for an EOT, to inform the contractor whether or not he considers the event or instruction or direction <span class="font-italic">in principle</span> entitles the contractor to an EOT. This avoids a situation where the contractor has no assurance of a realistic completion date, which may in turn unnecessarily, and indeed deleteriously compromise the construction works. To hold otherwise may in fact cause architects to undesirably drag their feet. As Mr Chan points out, fairness requires the contract administrator to give a speedy decision on matters where timelines pose an issue (and indeed, liability) (see <span class="font-italic">Amec Civil Engineering Ltd v Secretary of State for Transport </span>[2005] 1 WLR 2339 at [49]).

Mr Chan was of the view that the delay event was SPPG’s delay in carrying out connection power works, and instead of delaying his decision on the EOT application till the issuance of the FC, Mr Chan processed the EOT application with input from CCA. There is evidence (from Mr Yong’s AEIC, which stated that SPPG commenced its works for the power connection for the Project on or around 23 February 2013 and completed its works on or around 7 March 2013, and from the Minutes of Site Meeting No. 44 on 4 March 2013, which stated that the power connection would be completed by “this coming Thursday”) that SPPG commenced its work after the 2013 Chinese New Year and completed it on or around 7 March 2013.

It expressly states that this is due to the late connection to the power grid, which in turn delayed the testing and commissioning of the M&amp;E Works.

There can be no doubt, on the contents of this letter and the following correspondence, as to what facts were being relied upon for the grant of EOTs.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) In subsequent substantiation, GTMS cited the requirement for an OG Box late in the day on 21 November 2012 and SPPG’s further delays in constructing the OG Box and making the cable connections from the power mains (see [41] above). It was certainly not lost on GTMS that it could apply for an EOT, and that could only have referred to cl 23(1) which has the words “Grounds” and “23. EXTENSION OF TIME” in bold print in the side note and heading of that clause. It is hard to believe an architect reading that letter and not being aware that the SIA Conditions contained a clause granting the power to an architect to extend time, particularly since EOTs and liquidated damages loom large in almost <span class="font-italic">any</span> building and construction contract. Mr Chan certainly must have known there was one because Mr Chan’s representative (Ms Wan) sent GTMS an email dated 28 January 2013 to GTMS in response to GTMS’s letter of 15 January 2013 asking GTMS to submit further substantiation. It cannot be a coincidence that cl 23(4)(a) gives the architect the express power to do so. We have set out the sequence of communication in [41]–[47] above, and note that these communications were headed, “REQUEST FOR EOT-FURTHER SUBSTANTIATION”.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) On 7 February 2013, as noted in [44] above, Mr Chan sent GTMS his detailed two-page letter dealing with his assessment of the application for EOT. That letter is headed: EXTENSION OF TIME APPLICATION”. In fact, Mr Chan expressly referred to cl 23 of the SIA Conditions in this letter.

It is noteworthy that cl 23(1) and the paragraphs within that subclause have changed very little from the first edition of the SIA Conditions. In our judgment, Mr Chan would not have to check and read cl 23(1) each time he issued and signed an EOT because he would know generally what kind of events would entitle a contractor to an EOT. Hence, for example, we do not think that Mr Chan would have to read cl 23(1) every time he was dealing with a delay caused by an architect’s instruction (“AI”) or the requirements of a government authority or statutory undertaker, in assessing the corresponding application for an EOT by a contractor, because Mr Chan would know generally that there was power to extend time for such events and, as we have referenced above, he specifically said as much on 5 June 2020 (see [67] above). It is also undisputed that Mr Chan himself did not work in isolation. For example, his representative, Mr Yong, testified that he (Mr Yong) was “familiar with the contract”,

It all depends on the facts of each case and the context. Indeed, such retrospectivity is not unknown to the law. For example, in the context of termination of an employment contract, it has been held that even if an employer summarily dismisses an employee pursuant to a contractual right without relying on any particular clause in the contract, the employer may nevertheless seek to rely on it later on based on newfound evidence (see <span class="font-italic">Phosagro Asia Pte Ltd v Piattchanine, Iouri</span> [2016] 5 SLR 1052 at [43]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Clause 23(1)(a) of the SIA Conditions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">72 </span>We now turn to consider whether SPPG’s delay constitutes a “<span class="font-italic">force majeure</span>” event within the meaning of cl 23(1)(a) of the SIA Conditions. The burden of proof falls on GTMS and Mr Chan to demonstrate that the facts bring the case within the clause and ought to be construed so as to include delays by SPPG (see <span class="font-italic">Tandrin Aviation Holdings Ltd v Aero Toy Store and another </span>[2010] EWHC 40 at [48]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-justify font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The meaning of “force majeure” in cl 23(1)(a) of the SIA Conditions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">73 </span>Having undertaken a review of several authorities, the Judge held that “a <span class="font-italic">force majeure </span>event generally refers to an event that impedes or obstructs the performance of the contract, which was out of the parties’ control and occurred without the default of either party” (Judgment at [197]).

The concept has also been described as “a reference to all circumstances independent of the will of man” and considered to be wider in meaning than the other frequently encountered phrase, “Act of God”. It has been ruled to include any “direct” legislative or administrative interference. The operation of the concept is framed by the context of the background and relationship of the parties to the contract. For this reason, it should be construed with reference to the words preceding and following the expression, with due regard being given to the nature and general terms of the contract: see <span class="font-italic">China </span><span class="font-italic">Resources (S) Pte Ltd v Magenta Resources (S) Pte Ltd </span>(1997). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">76 </span>In <span class="font-italic">Holcim (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Precise Development Pte Ltd </span>[2011] 2 SLR 106, cl 3 of the contract in question provided that the “Supplier shall be under no <span class="font-italic">obligation</span> to supply the concrete if the said supply has been disrupted by … any other factors arising through circumstances beyond the control of the Supplier”. The parties had entered into a contract for concrete to be supplied over a period of time. Supply was however made much more difficult when the Indonesian government announced it was imposing a ban on the export of sand. First, the CA held that the ban was a disruption within the meaning of cl 3 (at [50]–[64]). Secondly, in citing <span class="font-italic">Goldlion Properties Ltd v Regent National Enterprises Ltd</span> [2009] HKFCA 58 with approval, the CA rejected any free-standing principle that a contracting party could only rely on a <span class="font-italic">force majeure </span>clause if it had taken all reasonable steps to avoid the <span class="font-italic">force majeure </span>effects of the event in question, stating instead that “[w]hether the affected party must have taken all reasonable steps before he can rely on the <span class="font-italic">force majeure </span>clause depends, in the final analysis, on the precise language of the clause concerned” (at [66]). However, not <span class="font-italic">any event </span>that is beyond the parties’ control necessarily constitutes a <span class="font-italic">force majeure </span>event; hence it is well-established that a change in economic or market circumstances, affecting the profitability of a contract or the ease with which the parties’ obligations can be performed, is not regarded as being a <span class="font-italic">force majeure </span>event<span class="font-italic"> </span>(<span class="font-italic">The Concadoro </span>[1916] 2 AC 199<span class="font-italic">, </span><span class="font-italic">Brauer &amp; Co (Great Britain) Ltd v James Clark (Brush Materials) Ltd </span>[1952] 2 All ER 497)<span class="font-italic">.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">77 </span>In our view, the essence of a <span class="font-italic">force majeure </span>event is a radical event that prevents the performance of the relevant obligation (and not merely making it more onerous), and which is due to circumstances beyond the parties’ control: see for example, <span class="font-italic">Chitty on Contracts </span>vol 1 (Hugh Beale gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 33rd Ed, 2019) at para 15-164.

The use of the words “radical” and “external” by the CA suggests that the phrase “<span class="font-italic">force majeure</span>” would cover only those events or circumstances which were generally not, at the time the contract was entered into, contemplated or expected to or which might reasonably have been foreseen to occur during the performance of the contract (see [74] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">78 </span>We agree with Mr Ser’s submission that the text of the Contract, and in particular the SIA Conditions, ought to assume primary importance in the contextual approach to interpretation that the court applies.

</div> are of a very different nature; they cannot be said to be uncommon, their impact on the construction project is not so great as those in cll 23(1)(a) to (e) and many are even events and circumstances which one would expect to occur, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, not receiving instructions or drawings from the consultants on time, variations in the permanent and temporary works, AIs on P.C. or provisional sum items.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">81 </span>Clearly, many of the events and circumstances set out in cll 23(1)(b)–(e) could fall within the meaning of <span class="font-italic">force majeure </span>events and circumstances.

What cl 23(1)(a) covers will therefore be, as we have stated above in [77], radical external events and circumstances that prevent the performance of the relevant obligations and which are due to circumstances beyond the parties’ control – for example, the COVID-19 pandemic and the “lock down” that followed over much of 2020 and 2021, the shortage of labour and materials due to the COVID-19 pandemic lock-downs, the prohibition of travel between countries and the ensuing disruption of supplies and manufacture of goods and material. We note, for completeness, that cll 23(1)(l) and (m) specifically cover the shortage of labour and the shortage of goods or materials respectively resulting from domestic and foreign government actions.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether SPPG’s delay constitutes a “force majeure” event</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">82 </span>In the light of the above, we respectfully disagree with the Judge’s conclusion that SPPG’s requirement for an OG Box constituted a “<span class="font-italic">force majeure</span>” event within the meaning of cl 23(1)(a) of the SIA Conditions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">83 </span>First, SPPG’s requirement for an OG Box does not amount to such a <span class="font-italic">radical</span> or external event that is beyond the contemplation or control of the parties or something unforeseen to occur during the performance of the contract. It does not belong to the same category or types of events set out in cll 23(1)(a) to (e) of the SIA Conditions. It is common knowledge in the building and construction industry (indeed it is general knowledge) that the electrical supply for any dwelling comes off or is drawn from the electrical grid of Singapore, whether directly in landed property, or indirectly, through electrical transformers and/or switchgear, servicing condominiums or blocks of flats. A dwelling <span class="font-italic">must</span> therefore be connected to the electrical grid to enable it to draw its electricity. In that context, the connection to draw electricity from the grid <span class="font-italic">is an inevitability</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">84 </span>Besides being a physical impossibility, it is also common knowledge that a home owner cannot simply engage his own contractor and tap his electricity off the power grid. There are laws, regulations and rules governing how one can draw electricity from the electrical grid. How one draws electricity from the power grid is (as we set out below) within the sole purview and requirements of SPPG. In landed property, the anticipated electrical load or usage, the number of phases for electricity, the kind of distribution board boxes and the number and kinds of fuses and circuit breakers are also regulated by electrical codes and standards. Whilst in the past, houses or landed property were connected to the power grid from mains laid underneath or near the roads, it is not uncommon, for some time now, to use OG Boxes for housing estates with landed properties rather than allow connections directly to the mains underneath the roads for each and every house. This is readily seen in housing estates with landed property (especially those comprising semi-detached and detached houses) and Leedon Park is no exception. This would be all the more so in this case because three adjacent bungalows are being built on one plot of land. Tapping off the power mains at three different locations (especially if it lay underneath the road fronting the bungalows) for each bungalow would not make much sense when compared to making one tap off the mains to the OG Box and then for each bungalow to tap their electricity supply from the OG Box, which would be designed to have a few tap-off points. As stated above, SPPG would only use its own contractors to connect the cables from the mains to the OG Box and from the OG Box to the meter compartments of each bungalow. SPPG’s initial quotation to Mr Ser dated 22 November 2010 with regards to the electricity connection stipulated that Mr Ser had to provide a “150 mm dia[meter] UPVC cable entry pipe from intake point to undercross roadside drain along Leedon P[ar]k”, and the attached quotation for $17,869 was for service connection work to be carried out <span class="font-italic">by </span>SP PowerAssets Ltd<span class="font-italic"> </span>(“SP PowerAssets”).

</div> Mr Ser submits that this shows an intentional omission by the drafters who did not intend for matters like the SPPG delay to constitute a ground for EOTs (whether under <span class="font-italic">force majeure</span> or otherwise) and intended that the contractor bears that risk. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">86 </span>Mr Ser’s submissions on this point are without merit. First and foremost, whilst the phrase “<span class="font-italic">force majeure</span>”<span class="font-italic"> </span>in cl 23(1)(a) is not linked to an event like the requirement of an OG Box, there are two other paragraphs within cl 23(1), <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, cll 23(1)(f) and (o), under which such an event is covered for an EOT, as we will discuss later (see [92]–[104] below). Secondly, whether an event like the requirement of an OG Box by SPPG, is tagged onto the phrase “<span class="font-italic">force majeure</span>” or not depends on the wording of that particular clause and its contractual context. A comparison of these provisions from the three different standard form contracts will show that <span class="font-italic">force majeure </span>is one event which can give rise to an EOT, but so is compliance with the requirements of any law, regulation, by-law or public authority or public service company. Before we examine these provisions in the PSSCOC and FIDIC standard forms, we pause to note that the FIDIC Conditions (commonly referred to as the “Red Book”) was first in time, the SIA Conditions followed some 23 years later in 1980 and the first edition of the PSSCOC was published 15 years down the line in 1995.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  ABOA Vol 3 at Tab 29, clause 8.6 of FIDIC (2nd Edition 2017).</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> of the 2017 FIDIC Conditions of Contract (“FIDIC 2017”) as a clause dealing with EOT for delays caused by authorities. Clause 8.6 provides that if the contractor has diligently followed the procedures laid down by the relevant legally constituted public authorities or private utility entities in the “[c]ountry”, these authorities or entities delay or disrupt the contractor’s works and the delay or disruption was “[u]nforeseeable”, then this delay or disruption will be considered as a cause of delay under cl 8.5(b) giving an entitlement to an EOT. The 1999 FIDIC Conditions of Contract (“FIDIC 1999”) had the equivalent of cl 8.6 of FIDIC 2017 in cl 8.5 and of cl 8.5(b) in cl 8.4(b). FIDIC 1999 also contained cl 19 entitled “Force Majeure”, which defines <span class="font-italic">force majeure</span> as an exceptional event or circumstance which is beyond the parties’ control, which such party could not reasonably have provided against before entering into the contract, which having arisen, such party could not reasonably have avoided the outcome, and which is not substantially attributable to the other party. Clause 18 of FIDIC 2017 is almost identical to cl 19 of FIDIC 1999, except that it is now called “Exceptional Events”. Furthermore, both cl 18 (FIDIC 2017) and cl 19 (FIDIC 1999) go on to provide, in similar wording, for events included within the phrase “exceptional event” or “<span class="font-italic">force majeure</span>” respectively. This list of events bears great similarity to cll 23(1)(c), (d) and (e) of the SIA Conditions. Neither cl 18 of FIDIC 2017 nor cl 19 of FIDIC 1999 mentions acts of public authorities; both editions of FIDIC deal with this in separate sub-clauses.      </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">88 </span>Secondly, cl 14.2 of the PSSCOC 2020 is phrased in broadly similar terms to cl 23(1) of the SIA Conditions. Similar to cl 23(1)(a) of the SIA Conditions, cl 14.2(a) of the PSSCOC provides that the time for completion may be extended where such delay has been caused by “[a]n event which is beyond the Contractor’s reasonable control (a force majeure event)”. Clauses 14.2(b), (c), (f) and (q) of PSSCOC contain paragraphs similar in content to cll 23(1)(b), (c), (d), (e), (l) and (m) of the SIA Conditions. Importantly, cl 14.2(e) of the PSSCOC separately provides an entitlement to EOT which is caused by: “[c]ompliance with the requirements of any law, regulation, by-law or public authority or public service company as stipulated in Clause 7.1”, which in turn mandates that the Contractor “comply with and give notices required by any law, regulation, or by-law, or by any public authority or public service company, relating to the Works, or, in the case of a public authority or public service company, with whose systems the same are or will be connected”.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">89 </span>Contrary to Mr Ser’s submission, there are more similarities than differences between the standard form conditions of contract. They contain differing uses of the phrase <span class="font-italic">force majeure</span>, but they also list other events or causes entitling the contractor to an EOT which are fairly similar in content across the three forms. This only emphasises that in construction contract law the drafters have, through experience, set out the most likely causes for delays and made provision for it, not only as a matter of fairness but also as an allocation of risk and preservation of the right to impose liquidated damages.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">90 </span>Moreover, Mr Ser’s contention is erroneous from a more basic perspective. Whilst SPPG’s requirement for an OG Box is <span class="font-italic">not </span>a <span class="font-italic">force majeure</span> event, there are sixteen other paragraphs in cl 23(1) which cover a whole host of other events under which the project architect can grant an extension of time. The draftsman of the SIA Conditions, Duncan Wallace QC, was acutely aware that if any act of the employer or his consultants fell outside those paragraphs in cl 23(1) (or elsewhere in the SIA Conditions which mention the grant of an EOT), and that act prevented the contractor from completing his works on time, it would lead to, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, two very important consequences; first, the employer would lose the right to impose liquidated and ascertained damages and secondly, it would set the time for completion of the contract at large. This is due to the prevention principle as espoused in cases like <span class="font-italic">Roberts v The Bury Improvement Commissioners </span>(1870) LR 5 CP 310 which has been applied in Singapore, see <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Evergreat Construction Co Pte Ltd v Presscrete Engineering Pte Ltd </span>[2006] 1 SLR(R) 634. We return to this at [92] below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">91 </span>How <span class="font-italic">force majeure</span> came to play such a central role in the EOTs for the present case should be laid squarely on the shoulders of counsel. When applying for EOT 2 and EOT 3, GTMS did not cite the paragraph within cl 23(1) under which they were making their application. Similarly, Mr Chan, when granting EOT 2 and EOT 3, only cited the grant of EOTs under cl 23; he too did not cite the paragraph under which he was granting the EOTs. However, GTMS cited cll 23(1)(a) and (q) in its Consolidated Reply and Defence to Counterclaim.

The order does not necessarily (though it can) emanate from an AI. Clause 7(1) provides for the situation where the Government authority or statutory undertaker initiates the “order”. It then goes on to provide that the contractor shall, before making any variation to the Works as set out in the contract documents, give the architect a written notice specifying and giving the reasons for such a variation, and states that the architect <span class="font-italic">may</span> issue a direction or instruction with regard to that variation.

This therefore provides for the situation where the architect does not react to the notice – the contractor nonetheless <span class="font-italic">has to comply</span> with the order and may claim that this is a variation. If for any reason the architect refuses to act, the contractor is still contractually bound to comply with the “order” because failing to do so will prevent the project from being completed. That will not be to the benefit of anyone, least of all the owner. The contractor is then left to his remedies, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, arbitration as the last resort, if he is not paid for the cost of complying with the “order” or for not getting any EOT. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">95 </span>The same analysis applies to cl 23(1)(o).

This was a regulatory power previously exercised by the Public Utilities Board (“PUB”), a “statutory undertaker” in traditional and somewhat outmoded, though time-honoured, description. Although this is not a point taken by parties, it is important that this aspect is made clear as the term “statutory undertaker” in cl 7(1) needs to be given its updated context and meaning. This court can take judicial notice that the ownership of and use of electricity from the power grid of Singapore used to be under the purview of the PUB, which also dealt with piped gas and the harvesting, collection and control of water. The following is public knowledge made through public announcements by the PUB, Ministry of Trade and Industry (“MTI”) and other Government agencies:  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In 1995, the Government of Singapore decided to corporatise the electricity and piped gas functions of the PUB. This was a move towards privatisation which would be for the benefit of Singapore (Public Utilities Board, “PUB News Release, Public Utilities Board Annual Report 1995” (12 September 1996)). The Public Utilities Act 1995 (No. 26 of 1995) was passed on 7 July 1995 and took effect from 1 October 1995 (the “PU Act 1995”). The PU Act 1995 reconstituted the PUB as a statutory Board and provided for the transfer of the property, rights and liabilities in respect of its electricity, gas and related undertakings to successor companies.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The corporatisation of PUB’s electricity and gas departments was effected by s 61 of the PU Act 1995 whereby the PUB would transfer the necessary properties, rights and liabilities to Singapore Power Ltd. Thus, on 1 October 1995, Singapore Power Ltd, a holding company with five main subsidiary companies, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, PowerGen (Senoko) Ltd, PowerGen (Seraya) Ltd, PowerGrid Ltd, Power Supply Ltd and PowerGas Ltd took over the electricity and piped gas operations of the PUB. The PUB retained the water authority and took over its new role and regulator of the privatised electricity and piped gas industries in Singapore (ss 3 and 61 of the PU Act 1995; <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debate</span><span class="font-italic">s, Official Report </span>(7 July 1995) vol 64 at cols 1361–1366 (Yeo Cheow Tong, Minister for Trade and Industry)). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) On 11 March 2000, the MTI, through a Government Press Release, announced it would continue with its aim to divest the power generation companies by their transfer to Temasek Holdings Ltd (“Temasek”) and thereby separate the ownership of the retail business from the power grid. Whilst privatisation of the retail business would increase competition for the benefit of consumers and present them with a greater choice of service providers, the power grid, for obvious reasons, would remain a monopoly (Ministry of Trade and Industry, “Further Restructuring of the Electricity and Gas Industries” (11 March 2000) in <span class="font-italic">Singapore Government Press Release</span>).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) By virtue of the Public Utilities Act 2001 (which was passed on 16 March 2001), on 1 April 2001, the PUB Water Department was merged with the Sewerage and Drainage Departments under the Ministry of the Environment (now the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources), while PUB’s regulatory role in the electricity and gas industries was transferred to the new Energy Market Authority (the “EMA”) (see ss 3, 6 and 60 of the Public Utilities Act 2001 (No. 8 of 2001); <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debate</span><span class="font-italic">s, Official Report </span>(16 March 2001) vol 73 at cols 1317–1327 (Peter Chen, Acting Minister for Trade and Industry)). The EMA is a statutory board under the MTI and was established by the Energy Market Authority of Singapore Act 2001 (No. 9 of 2001).

Under para 4.2.6, the transmission licensee (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>SPPG) shall not connect any installation to the transmission system if the connection applicant fails to comply with the procedures and requirements for connection to and use of the transmission system set forth in the Transmission Code and the connection agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">98 </span>In this case, it was SPPG that required the OG Box in its 21 November 2012 Letter (using mandatory language “… it is necessary …”) as the means by which the three bungalows would draw electricity from the power grid. This, in our view, was an order of a “statutory undertaker” which operates the power grid and with whose “system” the bungalows would be connected – with or without an AI or an architect’s direction. We have already referred above as to how that 21 November 2012 Letter went first to Mr Ser, and then to CCA, and finally to CSYA and GTMS (see [38] above). Other than constructing the meter boxes and having the SPPG required items referenced above on hand, any work beyond the meter boxes to the electrical mains was not within GTMS’s scope of works. The work that ensued was that of the consultants on the siting of the OG Box. The rest was up to SPPG to make the connections. All this did not involve GTMS.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">99 </span>Therefore, EOT 2 and EOT 3 were, in principle, correctly granted by Mr Chan under “Clause 23”. The communications between SPPG, Mr Chan, GTMS and the other consultants made it plain, beyond doubt, what events and requirements were being relied upon for an EOT. We note that neither GTMS nor Mr Chan specifically mentioned which particular paragraph in cl 23(1) was being relied upon. Whilst that may be characterised as undesirable, sloppy or careless in some purist quarters, in our judgment, there was no doubt that the EOTs were being sought and granted on the ground of the OG Box requirement by SPPG and the consequent delays, which thereby caused a delay to the Works. We are therefore of the view that this did not mean there was no valid application for, nor an invalid grant of, EOTs under cl 23(1).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">100 </span>We observe here that Mr Chan had raised cl 23(1)(o) in the middle of the trial and cited it in his closing submissions (Judgment at [212]–[214]).

</div> The applicability of cl 23(1)(o) was therefore a live issue before the Judge and the parties made submissions thereon. However, because the parties had not pleaded cl 23(1)(o), the Judge saw no need for him to determine that point. We pause to note that we see little prejudice in considering these three paragraphs in this case because the facts upon which they rest are the same for all three paragraphs, and they all emanate from SPPG’s requirement for an OG Box. Importantly, none of these facts are disputed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">101 </span>The Judge nonetheless proceeded to deal with cl 23(1)(o) for completeness. The Judge opined, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, that there was no “variation” of GTMS’s contractual work within the meaning of cl 7(1) because the OG Box was to be constructed by SPPG, and there was no evidence of any AIs or verbal instructions for GTMS to carry out any variation works as a result of SPPG’s delays (Judgment at [213]). Two points arise from this which, with respect, need correction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">102 </span>First, just because the OG Box was to be constructed by SPPG does not mean that the OG Box requirement did not amount to a variation within cll 23(1)(f) or (o) and 7(1) of the SIA Conditions; these provisions and sub-paragraphs simply do not impose any such limitations. In our view, it is plain that the requirement for an OG Box fell within the meaning of a “variation” to the Works, even if SPPG was the one constructing it (see [103(b)(iii)] below). The direct connection from the power mains, across the drain, to the meter box of each bungalow was changed by SPPG’s requirement of an OG Box; the supply from the OG Box to each bungalow no longer crossed the drain but lay beneath the pavement fronting each bungalow.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">103 </span>Secondly, on the facts, there was no need for any AI or verbal instructions or directions from Mr Chan to GTMS because the requirement of an OG Box (and concurrence on the proposed location) came directly from SPPG in its 21 November 2012 Letter to Mr Ser. Subsequently, on 26 November 2012, CCA’s Linda Chua Hwee Hwee (“Ms Chua”) sent a copy of the 21 November 2012 Letter to GTMS <span class="font-italic">and</span> CSYA by email; that email appears in Ms Chua’s AEIC,

</div> We note the following:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Under cl 23(1)(f), a contractor is entitled to an EOT if it is delayed due to, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, “Architect’s instructions under Clauses …7.(1) (<span class="font-italic">or otherwise in accordance w</span><span class="font-italic">ith that clause</span>) …” [emphasis added]. An entitlement to an EOT under cl 23(1)(f) therefore was not based <span class="font-italic">only</span> on an AI; as referenced above, cl 7(1) requires, in mandatory terms, the contractor to comply with any “order” made by a statutory undertaker with whose systems the Works will be connected. Plainly, GTMS would be in no position to refuse to “comply” with SPPG’s requirement for an OG Box and in any case, GTMS would not have to carry out any additional works in relation to SPPG’s requirement.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Cl 7(1) requires the contractor who receives such an order to give the architect written notice of the same before embarking on any variation to comply with such an order. We note that in this case:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) There was no need for any such notice to be given by GTMS because, as noted above, the requirement for an OG Box was conveyed <span class="font-italic">by </span>CCA <span class="font-italic">to</span> GTMS, which would have been the first time GTMS knew of SPPG’s requirement, and CSYA was copied on that email. </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) Further, the evidence shows that it was the consultants who had to then proceed to deal with this new requirement by SPPG.

</div> GTMS was not involved in the follow-on steps necessitated by SPPG’s requirement. </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) We have also referenced above that cl 7(1) provides that works conforming to such an “order” shall be deemed to be a variation ordered by a written instruction of the architect (to the Works “designed, specified or chosen by or on behalf of the Architect or the Employer”) if no directions or instruction are received by the contractor within seven days of giving the written notice to the architect; this was a variation in that the design of the electrical supply to the bungalows had to be modified (with the construction of the OG Box), but one without direct construction cost consequences to GTMS because it fell under the works to be carried out by SPPG (and its contractors) and it would have to be paid for by Mr Ser. </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iv) However, because there were delays caused by SPPG, which impacted a critical path activity of testing and commissioning of the M&amp;E works, the architect was specifically empowered under cl 7(1), “if appropriate”, to grant an EOT to GTMS, which is also covered by cll 23(1)(f) and (o) (see [95] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">104 </span>In summary, we find that SPPG’s requirement for an OG Box in its 21 November 2012 Letter was an event falling under cl 7.

Mr Ser points to the Project’s Master Programme (the “MP”), under which GTMS was required to complete the construction of electrical meter compartments by or prior to 9 July 2012. However, the electrical meter compartment doors for Units 12 and 12B were only installed or on around 1 December 2012. Owing to this delay, the Contractor ought not to have been granted any additional time under EOT 2.

The first round of testing and inspection was conducted on 14, 20 and 21 March 2013 (the “First Testing and Inspection”) for Units 12B, 12 and 12A respectively. The Project failed the First Testing and Inspection. Mr Ser argues that the reasons for the failure were due to construction-related issues caused by GTMS. Consequently, GTMS had to rectify these construction-related issues before the Project passed the second round of testing and inspection conducted on 27 March, 2 April and 8 April 2013 (the “Second Testing and Inspection”). Accordingly, GTMS again failed to exercise due diligence and was not entitled to any EOT.

GTMS had constructed the electrical installation works fully in accordance with the M&amp;E construction drawings for the Project.

At the very latest, the electrical meter compartments were ready in or around early October 2012 and they were ready for survey by SPPG. Although the electrical meter compartment doors were only ready in November 2012 and installed on or around 1 December 2012 at the latest, there was simply no requirement that the doors be installed <span class="font-italic">before </span>SPPG would be willing to commence work. In addition, the presence or absence of the electrical meter compartment doors had no bearing on whether SPPG could carry out the installation works as the doors were not essential for the installation of a cabler to facilitate incoming power supply (Judgment at [220]–[228]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) While GTMS may have appeared to be behind the schedule for the installation of the electrical meter compartments <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis </span>the MP, as they were ready in or around early October 2012 when the MP provided for them to be ready by 9 July 2012, this could not <span class="font-italic">ipso facto </span>mean that GTMS was in delay as the MP incorporated a period of float to allow the Contractor to catch-up and meet the completion date of 21 February 2013. This in-built float was a period of time in which the execution of an activity which is not on a critical path may be prolonged without affecting subsequent activities or the completion time for the project as a whole. By choosing to remain silent at the relevant times and site meetings, Mr Ser clearly understood that the MP was not a rigid schedule of activities (Judgment at [229]–[231]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The timelines in the MP were not peremptory. GTMS had acted with due diligence because GTMS, Mr Chan and indeed CCA, remained confident that notwithstanding the installation of the electrical doors on 1 December 2012, the Project could be completed on schedule provided SPPG completed its cable-laying works and supplied the requisite electrical turn-on within four to six weeks. The delay in installation of the compartments and doors would not have caused delay in the completion of the Project but for SPPG’s OG Box requirement and the Contractor’s delay had no nexus to SPPG’s delay (Judgment at [232]–[236]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Upon knowledge of SPPG’s delay, GTMS also took reasonable mitigation efforts to reduce the delay (Judgment at [252]–[255]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Mr Chan had made a fair and rational assessment with regard to GTMS’s request for EOT 2. Mr Chan had sought and reviewed a critical path analysis of SPPG’s delay, sought the views of CCA and requested the relevant information from GTMS. This was even though it was not strictly necessary for Mr Chan to do so (Judgment at [259]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) GTMS had acted with due diligence in relation to EOT 3.

</div> As the Judge observed, and we agree, this must be viewed in light of the fact that the MP incorporated a float and the timelines were neither peremptory nor prescriptive. Mr Ser had no persuasive answer to this. We agree with Mr Chan that while the MP recorded GTMS’s plans to commence the SPPG power connection works on 9 July 2012, it was not strictly contractually obliged to do so and its failure cannot be conclusive of a lack of due diligence.

Likewise, the ongoing works at the turf outside the Project along the external boundary wall did not hinder SPPG’s works, neither did the M&amp;E works inside all three stories of the units that were still being carried out as at 2 February 2013. Mr Ser points to photos taken by RTO Leong that “showed that there were ongoing works at the turf outside all three units along the external boundary wall – obstructing SPPG’s cable laying works”.

</div> But this avoids Mr Foo and Mr Yong’s evidence regarding the excavation works, which the Judge accepted, that the excavation works were within the site and caused no hindrance to SPPG (Judgment at [245]–[247]). This is evidence that accords with the photographs of those works put before the Judge and we agree.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">111 </span>Mr Ser also argues that the Judge erred in finding that the electrical meter compartment doors were not required (Judgment at [226]), in having not considered the testimony of several witnesses.

</div> But the Judge’s finding is not plainly against the weight of the evidence. The Judge placed emphasis on the concession of Mr Ser’s own electrical expert witness, Mr Lee, that the electrical meter compartment doors were not essential for the installation of cables to facilitate incoming power supply and not only that, that they might get in the way of SPPG’s installation works (Judgment at [223]–[224]). RTO Leong’s evidence was to the same effect (Judgment at [225]). The Judge had considered and weighed the evidence before him, as he was entitled to do in coming to a conclusion. Further, it is telling, as the Judge observed, that SPPG’s letters dated 22 November 2010 and 25 August 2011 did not state that the electrical compartment doors had to be ready for the incoming power supply and only alluded to the electrical switchboard and cable entry pipes to be ready.

</div> On 18 June 2013, the bungalows failed the Second TOP Inspection. The TOP was finally issued by BCA on 16 September 2013, without a physical inspection but after a written submission by Mr Chan with accompanying marked up drawings and photographs of the remedial work. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">116 </span>The Judge found that the CC had been improperly and prematurely issued, as the Works could not have been deemed to be completed as of 17 April 2013. Instead, the Judge found that the Works could have been deemed completed at the earliest on 28 May 2013. Central to the Judge’s reasoning was his view that the CC could be issued <span class="font-italic">prior</span> to the issuance of the TOP, and could have easily been issued by the time of the Second TOP Inspection on 18 June 2013 as the one non-compliant concrete step at the turf could easily be rectified by topping up the soil at the bottom of the step. The Judge found that the soil around the last step had settled thereby causing the non-compliant riser. Consequently, Mr Ser could have moved into and assumed occupation of the three bungalows. He could have also utilised the premises as the defects would not have prevented him from doing so. A reasonable architect, in the Judge's view, would have determined that Item 72 of the Preliminaries would have been fulfilled on 28 May 2013, thereby permitting the issuance of the CC (Judgment at [574] and [575]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the Preliminaries were incorporated into the Contract</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">117 </span>On appeal, Mr Chan restates his objection that the Preliminaries, having not been incorporated into the Contract, neither binds Mr Ser nor GTMS, and thus cll 24(4) and 24(5) of the SIA Conditions are the <span class="font-italic">only</span> pre-requisites governing the issuance of the CC. Mr Chan says Mr Ser “consistently and purposefully ‘put [Volumes 1A, 1B and 2 of the formal contract documents] aside’ and refused to sign these, evincing an intention not to be bound by them”.

</div> Notwithstanding the CA’s analysis on Item 72 of the Preliminaries in the CA Judgment, Mr Chan contends that such deliberate withholding was not evidence before the court then. It is not disputed that Item 72 of the Preliminaries were contained in Volume 1B of the formal contract documents (Judgment at [306]). Volumes 1A, 1B and 2 of the formal contract documents were prepared by F+G and CCA (Judgment at [6]). It is undisputed that these formal contract documents were not signed by Mr Ser. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">118 </span>We hence begin with the anterior question of whether the Preliminaries were validly incorporated into the Contract.

This was the case, as the conduct of both Mr Ser and GTMS evinced such an agreement. While Mr Ser did testify that he had “just put the contract aside”, Mr Chan and GTMS continued to work on the Project (Judgment at [305]). The Judge found that having been reminded to sign the formal contract documents at site meetings, Mr Ser “must have known that [GTMS] and [Mr Chan] were operating on the basis that the formal contract documents applied” and his “inaction despite such knowledge evinced to [GTMS] his acquiescence to the formal contract documents being part of the Contract” (Judgment at [306]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">120 </span>We see no reason to disagree with the Judge’s finding.

</div> But it is not apparent how this assists his case at all. The evidence given there was in respect of Mr Ser’s refusal to sign a deed of novation forwarded to him on 20 December 2011. However, this deed of novation concerned the contractual transfer of all of Mr Chan’s rights, duties and obligations <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> Mr Ser arising from the MOA, to CSYA Pte Ltd, which had yet to be incorporated at the date of the MOA. Yet, Mr Ser’s refusal to sign this deed of novation, as was Mr Chan’s evidence, had nothing to do with the formal contractual documents prepared by F+G and CCA. Mr Chan’s submission completely ignores innumerable acts of the parties carried out over a considerable period of time, from the time of the LOA in May 2011 to the time the disputes arose towards the end of 2013, all of which point to the parties’ acceptance of a binding contract for the construction of the bungalows being in place. For example, Mr Chan and his team of consultants prepared the tender documents, there was a tender process and the contract was awarded to GTMS. There can no doubt that the tender documents set out the Contract Documents and Drawings. Mr Chan also signed and sent out the Letter of Award.

The crux of the issue is whether Mr Chan was entitled, as a matter of law, to issue the CC on 15 May 2013, certifying contract completion as of 17 April 2013, notwithstanding the Project failing the First TOP Inspection on 30 April 2013 (see [12] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">125 </span>The Judge did not overlook the primacy of the plain words of Item 72(a) of the Preliminaries. He observed, in respect of the failure of the First TOP Inspection, that “it does not matter whether or not the unequal steps and risers are ‘minor’ works by industry standard or that they could easily be rectified. The fact is that the Project could not have been ‘ready for occupation’ under Item 72(a) of the Preliminaries in the light of the safety issues presented by the unequal steps and risers.” Such minor works “would have posed a danger to the occupiers of the Project” (Judgment at [326]). Likewise, even though Mr Chan claimed that he had acted in good faith based on his experience, commercial understanding and practical reality, “none of these reasons can override the clear and express language of Item 72(a) of the Preliminaries” (Judgment at [327]). The Judge held that Mr Chan should not have issued the CC on 15 May 2013 certifying completion on 17 April 2013 (Judgment at [328]). We agree.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">126 </span>However, with respect, the Judge proceeded to sidestep this construction of Item 72(a) and opined that the Works could satisfy Item 72(a) of the Preliminaries even though the Project had not yet passed (and indeed failed) both the First TOP Inspection and the Second TOP Inspection, so long as the reasons for the failure of the inspections were <span class="font-italic">not due to construction-related issues that were within the </span><span class="font-italic">contractor’s scope of work</span> (Judgment at [324]). The relevant point of distinction, according to the Judge, was between construction-related issues and non-construction-related issues. The Judge found that the Project had failed the First TOP Inspection because of construction-related issues, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, due to the unequal steps and risers. As such, the CC could not have been issued before 30 April 2013 (Judgment at [328]). However, the Judge found that the Project had failed the Second TOP Inspection because of non-construction related issues. In particular, the Judge considered that the Second TOP Inspection failed, among other things, due to the last step at the landscape area of one of the bungalows being higher than permitted; this was not a construction-related error. Rather, this was due to the settlement of the landscaped soil, which was a natural phenomenon (Judgment at [334]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">127 </span>On that basis, Item 72(a) could have been completed <span class="font-italic">prior</span> to the Second TOP Inspection on 18 June 2013 (Judgment at [324]–[333]). And Item 72(a) of the Preliminaries would have been completed on 28 May 2013, when the rectifications of the unequal steps and risers were completed. Specifically, the rectification works started on 17 May 2013 and took 11 days to complete (Judgment at [334]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">128 </span>On appeal, Mr Ser argues that the Judge erred in concluding that Mr Chan was legally entitled to issue the CC notwithstanding the failure of the Second TOP Inspection. Mr Chan and GTMS are broadly aligned in their position. They say that Item 72(a) of the Preliminaries was satisfied and the CC was legitimately issued. Mr Chan maintains his position below that the “objective fact is that as at 17 April 2013, the Project could be physically occupied and used”.

Regulation 43(3) makes clear that a TOP may be granted where, among other things, every report or certificate by the appropriate qualified person has been submitted to the Commissioner of Building Control, and the certificate from the builder has been submitted to the commissioner within 7 days of the completion of the building works. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">130 </span>Although the CC and the TOP are very different in origin, nature, characteristics and requirements, and they serve different purposes, parties are nonetheless free to, and sometimes do, predicate the issue of a CC on the attainment of the TOP.

</div>
</div> The <span class="font-italic">statutory </span>issuance of a TOP is intended as a preliminary step towards the issuance of the Certificate of Statutory Completion (the “CSC”). Practically, and as its name suggests, this is an important step as it entitles a person to occupy the building during the pendency of the CSC (see s 12(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the BC Act). It is hence common industry practice for owners in strata developments, for example, to occupy their properties after the issuance of the TOP with the CSC only being issued at a later date. In contrast, the issuance of the CC may, according to the terms of the construction contract, be employed as a contractual mechanism to trigger other obligations. For example, in <span class="font-italic">Liang Huat Aluminium Industries Pte Ltd v Hi Tek Construction Pte Ltd</span> [2001] SGHC 334 (“<span class="font-italic">Hi Tek</span>”), the High Court observed that a completion certificate in a building contract is usually issued for various reasons, such as (a) to stop damages or liquidated damages for delay from running; or (b) to start the commencement of the maintenance period, or as it is sometimes called, the defects liability period (at [17]). In addition, the issuance of a completion certificate “does not mean that there can be no further claims or that no call should be made on an on-demand bond thereafter” (<span class="font-italic">Hi Tek </span>at [18]). This too, is the position articulated by GTMS, which states that a “Completion Certificate does not allow actual occupation and use of the Premises”.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">133 </span>GTMS contends that Item 72(a) of the Preliminaries is concerned with “practical completion” and that such practical completion was in fact achieved before the issuance of the TOP. Mr Thulasidas, counsel for GTMS, cites no authority for this proposition and construction of Item 72(a). We have little hesitation in rejecting this argument. Item 72(a) unambiguously states that the Works have to “… be ready for occupation and for use.” Mr Ser could not have entered into occupation and used the bungalows on 17 April 2013 because the TOP had not been issued and it is an offence under s 12 of the BC Act for anyone to occupy and use a building without a TOP. Mr Thulasidas erroneously attempts to use cl 24(4) to rewrite the clear words of Item 72(a). The learned author, Chow Kok Fong, (in <span class="font-italic">The Singapore SIA Form of Building Contract</span><span class="font-italic">: A Commentary on the 9th Edition of the Singapore Institute of Architects Standard Form of Building Contract</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2013) (“<span class="font-italic">Commentary on SIA Standard Form</span>”)) opines, at para 24.14, that the use of the word “appear” in the phraseology of cl 24(4), (“… when the Works appear to be complete and to comply with the Contract in all respects”), corresponds to “substantial completion” or “practical completion” as provided in other standard forms such as cl 2.27 of the 2016 JCT Design and Build form, (citing <span class="font-italic">Jarvis &amp; Sons v Westminster Corp</span> [1970] 1 WLR 637, 646). The learned author supports his construction by referring to cl 24(5) which allows the architect to certify completion even if there are minor works outstanding which can be completed following the removal of the contractor’s site organisation and all major plant and equipment and without unreasonable disturbance of the employer’s full enjoyment and occupation of the property as well as the completion of outstanding work or making good defects during the maintenance period under cl 27. Practical completion is a concept that is well-known to construction law, and its principles have recently been usefully summarised by Coulson LJ in the English Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Mears Ltd v Costplan Services (South East) Ltd and others </span>[2019] EWCA Civ 502. However, in this case, cl 24(4) of the SIA Conditions has to be read in conjunction with Item 72(a) of the Preliminaries. The issue really turns upon what Item 72(a) means. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">134 </span>Mr Chan also relies on a speech given by a Member of Parliament, Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report </span>(16 March 1993), vol 60 at cols 1298–1300 (Kenneth Chen Koon Lap)), to say that it has been “envision[ed] that the TOP and CC have 2 different scopes, but are related in that the CC <span class="font-italic">must </span>be issued before the TOP can be issued” [emphasis added]:

The CC requirements were not met as the Project premises had neither undergone TOP inspection nor obtained TOP as at the CC date and therefore would not have been fit for occupation under s 12 of the BC Act. However, the CA emphasised that its “findings at this enforcement stage … will necessarily be <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>and non-conclusive at the substantive and final determination of the disputes between the parties” (CA Judgment at [105]).

It is, therefore, apposite to see what this contract called for in relation to the Completion Certificate and its issuance. Clause 24(4) … provides that the Architect shall issue the Completion Certificate "when the Works appear to be complete and to comply with the Contract in all respects" whereupon the Contract "shall be deemed to be completed". More importantly, Item 72 of the preliminaries … sets out when works can be deemed completed in order for the Completion Certificate to be issued. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">44  The meaning of the phrase in Item 72 para (a), "All parts of the Works <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">are … ready </span>for <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">occupation and for use </span>…" [emphasis added in bold italics], is clear. It means, in no uncertain terms, <span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">that the employer can go into occupation of and use the premises</span>. It is difficult to understand how the Architect could have issued the Completion Certificate on 15 May 2013, certifying contract completion on 17 April 2013, when just two weeks prior to his issue of that Completion Certificate, the Buildings had <span class="font-italic">failed </span>the first TOP inspection on 30 April 2013.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">45  Mr Pillay rightly points out that anyone in the building and construction industry knows that entering into occupation of and using a building which has not obtained TOP or its certificate of statutory completion is an offence under s 12 of the [BCA] … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">136 </span>It is important to note that at trial, Mr Chan and Mr Yong both admitted that they had not read Item 72 in the Preliminaries when the CC was issued.

Instead, the Judge proposed a more “nuanced inquiry”, which involves, first, determining GTMS’s scope of works under the Contract, and second, to determine whether the reasons for failure of the TOP Inspections were due to construction-related issues within their scope of works; if the failure of the TOP was not due to construction-related issues, it would be justifiable for Mr Chan to issue the CC (Judgment at [322]–[324]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">138 </span>With respect, the CA was <span class="font-italic">not</span> laying down any general proposition in the CA Judgment; it was addressing the construction of the Contract before it. Further, with respect, we do not think that the terms of Item 72(a) leave any room for doubt as to what it means or for the adoption of a nuanced inquiry. It provides unambiguously that the Works must be ready “for occupation and for use”. This, in our view, means that the Works cannot be occupied and used as a dwelling <span class="font-italic">before</span> obtaining the TOP. Who caused, and is therefore liable for, the delay in obtaining the TOP is a separate question altogether. That is a question of liability as between GTMS and/or Mr Chan to Mr Ser (as Mr Ser did not contribute to the delay in obtaining the TOP). We therefore cannot agree with the Judge when he opined that if the delays in obtaining the TOP were due to non-construction factors and not within the scope of GTMS’s work, then they were beyond the control of GTMS; in those circumstances, GTMS would have completed its contractual responsibility and it would be justifiable for Mr Chan to issue the CC notwithstanding that the TOP had not been obtained (Judgment at [324]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">139 </span>We also cannot, with respect, agree with the Judge’s reliance on <span class="font-italic">Schindler’s Lifts (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Paya Ubi Industrial Park Pte Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> and Another</span> [2004] SGHC 34 (“<span class="font-italic">Schindler’s Lifts</span>”) (Judgment at [322]). As Mr Ser rightly points out, that case simply was not concerned with a dispute over the issuance of a CC before TOP. Nor did it involve any dispute over a term similar to Item 72(a) of the Preliminaries. Rather, the action was founded on a claim for retention moneys due for variations and outstanding works. There was simply no consideration there of whether such an action was proper. Hence, in so far as any reliance is placed on <span class="font-italic">Schindler’s Lifts </span>for the proposition that a CC may be issued <span class="font-italic">prior </span>to the obtaining of the TOP, it is misplaced as that case does not stand for such a principle. That case is clearly distinguishable on the facts. For completeness, Mr Chan’s reliance on <span class="font-italic">Schindler’s Lifts </span>to suggest that the issuance of a CC before the TOP is “not uncommon in industry practice” is likewise unfounded.

Instead, Mr Chan points out that Item 72(a) of the Preliminaries does not state that “occupation and use” refers strictly to legal occupation and use (<span class="font-italic">ie, </span>that of a TOP). There is no reference to TOP anywhere in Item 72(a) of the Preliminaries. This absence, Mr Chan says, must lead to the conclusion that Item 72(a) of the Preliminaries is not concerned with the TOP. Mr Chan says that a distinction ought to be drawn between physical and legal occupation; Item 72(a) of the Preliminaries is concerned only with physical occupation.

</div> In our view, that case is of no relevance to the issues in the present case. There, the plaintiffs sought damages for breach of the contract of sale and purchase of a property from the defendant. The defendant delayed in completing the property and a temporary occupation licence (the precursor to the TOP) was issued in November 1974. However, the plaintiffs refused to take possession until April 1975. Notice to complete was given in December 1975. The defendant admitted liability for damages up to the date of the temporary occupation licence but disputed that it ought to be liable up to the issue of the notice to complete. Choor Singh J dismissed the claim, holding that the plaintiffs did not suffer any financial loss from November 1974 to December 1975 and had no valid reason for not taking possession and occupying the property from November 1974 onwards. No such distinction of the sort suggested by Mr Chan was in fact drawn in that case. The High Court noted that during the issuance of the temporary occupation licence, the plaintiffs “could have been in occupation of the house” as they were “offered possession of the house …. with the necessary authority from the Building Control Division in the form of a [temporary occupation licence]” (<span class="font-italic">Phoenix Heights </span>at [7]).

On a true construction of Item 72(a), there can be no “physical” occupation or use of the bungalows as dwellings without the issue of the TOP; reference has already been made to s 12 of the BC Act (see [129(b)] above).

Unfortunately, because of the Judge’s approach in using a more nuanced inquiry to determine whether a CC can be issued before TOP, some of his analysis and findings of fact in relation to the various items causing the bungalows to fail the TOP Inspections and attribution of fault therefore are, with respect, not entirely clear nor, in some important instances, adequate to determine liability. This was also caused by counsels’ shortcomings at the trial in not drawing the Judge’s attention to how cl 24, and in particular cl 24(3), is meant to operate in such circumstances.

This should have been carried out not only for the First TOP Inspection but also the Second TOP Inspection right until TOP was obtained. This exercise should have included the period of delay for each of the reasons, to what extent they overlapped time-wise and whether one reason operated independently of the others or also had a cumulative delaying effect on the other reasons. With those findings, the law on concurrent delay can be applied; for example, what EOT GTMS should have received for the additional works, and further, the legal consequences of additional work at this stage of the Project had to be considered and applied to ascribe liability.

Mr Chan had provided for a glass barrier parapet one meter in height at the pavilion of Unit 12A, where there was a drop of 1.45 meters.

The Judge also referred to the building plans which stated the height of the glass parapet with the built-in bench at Unit 12A’s pavilion was 1000 mm from the “finished floor level”.

</div> The Judge held that since the BCA had approved the building plans, it should not have faulted this aspect of the design at the First TOP Inspection (Judgment at [333]). After the First TOP Inspection, Mr Chan proposed installing an invisible grille behind the built-in bench in an attempt to comply with the height requirement for the barrier (though at or sometime before the Second TOP Inspection, BCA did not approve the invisible grille and Mr Chan eventually asked GTMS to install glass barriers which met the 1-meter height requirement as measured from the seat of the built-in bench to the top of the barrier (Judgment at [333])). The Judge found that Mr Chan’s design of the barrier and the replacement invisible grille could not be said to be negligent, and GTMS’s construction of the original barrier, in accordance with the drawing, could not be described as a construction error. With respect, we cannot agree with the Judge on two points.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">151 </span>First, we have grave reservations on the Judge’s construction of cl H.3.2.1.

</div>
</div> is titled: “Safety from Falling” and cl H.1 states: “The objective of cl H.2.1 is to protect people from injury caused by falling.” That is the main objective of section H. Cl H.2.1 states that where there is a vertical drop of one meter or more, appropriate measures must be taken to prevent people from falling from a height. Clause H.3.1 states that cl H.2.1 is satisfied if a barrier is provided in accordance with cl H.3.2 to H.3.5. Those clauses mandate a barrier of one meter (cl H.3.2.1(a)), although there is one exception at H.3.2.1(b), <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, that the barrier can be 900 mm from the lower edge of windows, stairs, ramps, and galleries or balconies with fixed seating in areas such as theatres, cinemas and assembly halls. Whilst Note 1 to cl H.3.2.1 (which was relied on by the Judge) specifically provides that the height of the barrier is measured vertically from the finished floor level to the top of the barrier, Note 2 provides that the height of the barrier at the flight of stairs is measured vertically from the pitch line to the top of the barrier. This means the barrier is <span class="font-italic">not </span>measured from the tread of the top step nor the tread of the bottom step of that staircase but along the pitch line between the two. In our view, cl H.3.2.1(b) and Note 2 clearly indicates that where it is not appropriate, the measurement for the height of the barrier is not taken from the finished floor level. We do not think, with respect, that the Judge was right to conclude that there was a genuine difference of opinion. In our view, the BCA officer inspecting the bungalows was correct in his interpretation that the height of the barrier should be one meter above the top of the seat of the built-in concrete bench. That accords with the aim of section H, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, to protect persons from injury by falling from heights and an appropriate measure would be a barrier of one meter in height measuring from the bench. Otherwise, for anyone standing on that bench, the effective barrier to prevent that person from falling over would only be 0.55 meters and to exacerbate the case, the drop at that point would have been some 2 meters (1.45 meters plus the 0.55 meters). That cannot, on any view from the point of safety, be correct. Mr Chan admitted under cross-examination that if somebody was standing on the bench, there was a risk that this person may fall from the pavilion.

The BC Act provides, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, for a scheme where the responsibility for accuracy, design, compliance and adequacy of engineering or architectural matters fall squarely upon the shoulders of the architects, engineers and accredited checkers (“AC”) or specialist ACs: see s 5 BC Act. These professionals are charged with the responsibility to ensure that the building works comply with the regulatory requirements: see s 9. The BC Act also mandates that every developer of building works must employ the requisite professionals: see s 8. Section 5(5) clearly provides that the Commissioner of Building Control may, on the basis of the required certificates signed by these professionals, approve the submitted plans without checking the designs and calculations of any building works; notwithstanding s 5(5), the Commissioner is entitled, under s 5(6), at his sole discretion to carry out random checks on the detailed structural plans, design calculations or geotechnical aspects of any building works before granting the approval. For completeness, there are also provisions against liability of its officers, see ss 32(1) and 32(3). Insofar as the Judge had held at [333] that BCA “should not have faulted [the relevant] aspect of the design at TOP Inspection 1”, this does not represent the law. Holding otherwise would mean that if BCA wrongly or mistakenly approved the requisite submission of drawings, designs, calculations and responses to queries from the BCA, they cannot be corrected subsequently when discovered or that the design responsibilities and obligations of the professionals involved had shifted to BCA’s doorstep. In our judgment, the fact that the designs were approved by BCA does not remove the responsibility of a qualified person to ensure that the buildings works are designed in accordance with the provisions of the BC Act (see s 9(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) of the BC Act, read with the definition of a “qualified person” under s 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)).

Unfortunately, this too was rejected by the BCA, and eventually a taller glass barrier was installed.

For the reasons we have set out above, we find that Mr Chan caused, and is therefore responsible for, the delay in the issuance of the TOP occasioned by the non-compliance of the barrier at the built-in concrete bench at the pavilion of Unit 12A (the Parapet Walls at the Pavilion issue). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">RC Roof issue</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">157 </span>In relation to the RC Roof issue, the Judge found that the concrete steps on the roofs of all three bungalows were not part of the contract drawings and had only been added subsequently through AI No. 15, dated 14 August 2012 (Judgment at [330]).

The Judge found that Mr Chan had considered the steps at the roofs fell within “certain exceptions” (without specifying which exception(s) in the Judgment at [330]), but the BCA officer at the Second TOP Inspection took a different view.

The Note to cll E.3.4.1to E.3.4.4 states that the requirements in cll E.3.4.1 to E.3.4.3 do <span class="font-italic">not</span> apply to (a) plant and equipment rooms, (b) the production area of an industrial building, (c) attic rooms in residential buildings and (d) houses built by the owners for their own use. We do not think (a) is applicable in the present case as the flat concrete roofs are not the equivalent of or akin to plant and equipment rooms, where there are space constraints, (and similarly as with attic rooms, in para (c), in residential buildings). Paragraph (d) is also not applicable, in the light of Mr Ser’s stand at trial that these bungalows were built for investment purposes and renting out and not for his own use.

</div> Therefore, the requirements in cll E.3.4.1 to E.3.4.4 do appear to us to apply to the Project, as does the requirement in cl E.3.4.4 for the risers and treads within each flight of stairs to be of uniform height and size (albeit with a tolerance of +/- 5 mm in any flight of stairs). This was certainly the view of the BCA Inspectors. It appears to us that there was probably an omission by Mr Chan to issue a proper drawing with instructions for the construction of these steps. First, if the faint markings are what they appear to be and are to be interpreted as showing two steps at the relevant parts of the roofs of each bungalow (and leaving aside the unreadable words that may or may not relate to those steps), then GTMS cannot be faulted for constructing two steps at each location. Secondly, if they are not, then it can hardly be good or responsible architectural practice to omit to do so, leaving a contractor to his own devices for the construction of these steps. In Mr Chan’s submissions below,

</div> his justification that this was not a defect because GTMS had constructed the steps as the result of a late request by Mr Ser and Mr Chan had inspected and supervised the same in line with Mr Ser’s request, rings hollow. Although these steps were on the RC concrete roofs, compliance with at least the maximum riser height and tread width (none of which could have been an issue here as there were no site constraints) would obviously have been required for the safety of workers carrying out maintenance or other work on those roofs, particularly given the possibility of such workers also carrying equipment. Nonetheless, bearing in mind Mr Dennis Tan’s evidence, the AI No. 15’s drawings possibly not showing the steps to be constructed, the absence of any cross-examination on the points noted above, the absence of a finding by the Judge on these facts, and the absence of any other findings and any proper focus on this issue by the parties in their submissions, we do not think there is sufficient basis for us to intervene in this finding of fact below that this was neither a construction error by GTMS or a design error by Mr Chan. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">Landscape Step issue</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">159 </span>As for the height of the riser at the last step of the landscape area of Unit 12A exceeding the limit, the Judge found that it was not a construction error nor a design error because the cause was the settlement of the soil next to the last step, causing an increase in the riser.

</div> If Mr Chan or his teams had done so, they would have noticed the settlement of the soil next to the last step at the landscape area in Unit 12A and should have realised there were possible issues with the steps at the roofs because no drawings or details had been issued by CSYA and the steps had risers beyond 175 mm. If so, Mr Chan or Mr Yong should have asked GTMS to top up the soil before the inspection. It bears noting that at the First TOP Inspection, when all the steps were under scrutiny by the BCA, they found nothing amiss with this last step at the landscape area. Mr Chan should also have contacted BCA regarding the steps at the roof and could probably have done something about confirming if those steps fell within the exceptions.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">Our findings</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">162 </span>At this juncture, we make the following findings and rule as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The Contract Completion Date was correctly and validly applied for and extended to 17 April 2013 by EOT 2 and EOT 3.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) As of 18 April 2013, the works were in delay and there being no other matters entitling GTMS to any further EOT pending, Mr Chan should have issued a Delay Certificate under cl 24(1) of the SIA Conditions. Liquidated damages would then have started to run from 18 April 2013. Mr Ser would have had the option to deduct these accrued liquidated damages from any sums payable to GTMS (see cl 24(2) of the SIA Conditions).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Under the terms and conditions of this Contract, including Item 72(a), the CC could not be issued before the TOP was issued; on this basis, the earliest point in time when the CC could have been issued was 16 September 2013, when the TOP was obtained. As the Judge has not made any alternative findings of fact as to when the CC should have been issued after TOP was obtained and the parties have not made proper submissions thereon, we find that the CC should have been issued on 16 September 2013 and, save for considering the relative causes for the delay, liquidated damages could <span class="font-italic">theoretically</span> have run from 18 April 2013 to 16 September 2013.  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The bungalows failed the First TOP Inspection. Five reasons were given by BCA therefor and from the evidence below we find and hold as follows:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) <span class="font-underline">Steps and Risers issue</span>: There were construction errors in relation to the risers found on all the internal staircases, landscape areas and swimming pools, responsibility and liability for which rests on GTMS. GTMS does not dispute this. The Judge found that this was the <span class="font-italic">main</span> reason for the failure of the First TOP Inspection (Judgment at [325]). With respect, we disagree. The Judge expressly acknowledged, and discussed to varying degrees, some of the other reasons for the bungalows failing the First TOP Inspection. These other errors, which we list below, would have caused a delay to the Project achieving TOP, but there were no proper or adequate findings as to responsibility therefor, the causative potency or degree to which it was a cause of delay, the time required to rectify each of these other defects or non-compliances, the different reasons for the same, their concurrency or otherwise and how they would have impacted, both singly, in combination and cumulatively, the time taken to remedy and ready the Project for the Second TOP Inspection. This is an unsatisfactory state of affairs. </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) The Judge has made one other finding of fact, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, GTMS completed rectification of all the non-compliant steps and risers within 28 days of the First TOP Inspection, <span class="font-italic">ie,</span> by 28 May 2013. There was evidence to support such a finding and we cannot say that the Judge’s finding is against the weight of the evidence. However, that does not resolve the issues surrounding the failure to obtain TOP and therefore the delay in the issuance of the CC. Without the Judge’s reasons for his conclusion and in light of the other reasons for the failure of the First TOP Inspection, which include Mr Chan’s own admitted design errors and omissions, there should have been an analysis and findings for these other reasons, which we discuss below, within the relevant time periods:</div><div class="Judg-4 mb-3 text-justify">(A) first, the 28 days for GTMS to rectify the construction errors (1 May 2013 to 28 May 2013), and </div><div class="Judg-4 mb-3 text-justify">(B) secondly, the remaining 21 days, unaccounted for in terms of remedying other non-compliances, (29 May 2013 to 18 June 2013) to the Second TOP Inspection.</div><div class="Judg-4 mb-3 text-justify">With respect, the Judge’s finding that GTMS’s construction errors were the <span class="font-italic">main</span> reason for the bungalows failing the First TOP Inspection is a finding against the weight of evidence and cannot stand.   </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) <span class="font-underline">Parapet Walls at Roof issue</span>: GTMS were also responsible, and therefore liable, for construction errors in building parapets that did not reach up to the required height of one meter. There is no finding of fact as to the extent of this defect, the amount of time required to rectify the same and by what date it was rectified, nor was there any finding as to the causative potency and the degree to which this contributed to any of the overall delays in completion. This should have been, but was unfortunately not, done. In the absence of any submissions with sufficient detail on this point, we are constrained against making any specific findings in this regard on appeal, save to say that from the photographs and drawings submitted by Mr Chan to the BCA in his letter dated 6 September 2013,

In our view, for the reasons set out above, Mr Chan was wrong in measuring the height of the barrier from the floor level and not the top of the built-in concrete bench. As referenced above, there is evidence that Mr Chan attempted to initially resolve this by asking GTMS to install an invisible grille behind the bench. We have no evidence as to how GTMS was told to do this. We have referred to Ms Wan’s email of 15 May 2013 with a table of the non-compliant items from the First TOP Inspection. In that email, in referring to this issue, Ms Wan has stated: “To add invisible grille at No. 12A pavilion”. It appears work started on this defect fairly soon after the First TOP Inspection. From the photographs in the evidence relating to this invisible grille it was not simply adding cables; there were vertical as well as horizontal cables for the first 900 mm and then only vertical cables for the next 900 mm.

</div> As noted above, this also involved a QP’s submission with cl H.3.5, N.3.2 and N.3.3 (see [153(c)] above) for a glass barrier of more than 2.4 meters. Regretfully, there were again no relevant findings of fact necessary to assess relative delays as between GTMS and Mr Chan. Potentially, this was an operative cause for the delay in obtaining the TOP from or very soon after 30 April 2013 up to perhaps 30 August 2013 (when the compliant glass barrier was installed) or even close to 16 September 2013 (when TOP was obtained), given that the BCA had to ask Mr Chan about the QP’s confirmation of compliance with cl H.3.5, N.3.2 and N.3.3 for a glass barrier of over 2.4 meters. This similarly raises the issues relating to and operation of cl 24(3) as noted in [162(d)(v)] above. There must have been verbal instructions or directions or a request from Mr Chan, well before AI No. 34, (which was dated 26 August 2013), to GTMS to carry out the various remedial works to the Parapet Walls at the Pavilion in Unit 12A. We note AI No. 34 was included in the Final Accounts as was an evaluation by F+G for payment for the “[a]dditional glass railing with aluminium capping at no. 12A-pavilion”.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Two reasons were given by the BCA for the bungalows failing the Second TOP Inspection on 18 June 2013:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) <span class="font-underline">RC Roof issue</span>: All the steps at the RC flat roofs of all bungalows failed to comply with cll E.3.4.1, E.3.4.2 and E.3.4.4. These were not construction defects and GTMS was therefore not liable. The facts surrounding the issue of these steps have been set out above at [158]. There are no findings in relation to which exception the Judge was relying upon (although, as noted above, an inference <span class="font-italic">might</span> be drawn from Mr Chan’s submissions), how or when these steps were rectified, how much they contributed to the overall delay and similar issues as raised above. We are therefore constrained by these limitations from intervening in or departing from the findings of the Judge.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) <span class="font-underline">Landscape Step issue</span>: The last step at the landscape area of Unit 12A had a riser that was non-compliant with cl 3.4.4. The Judge held that this was a natural phenomenon, and no one was responsible for this (Judgment at [331]). We take a different view. First, Mr Chan should have carried out his own inspection, as he was advised to by the BCA to do, prior to the Second TOP Inspection, but he failed to do so. If he had done so, he would have noted the soil settlement and ordered that the soil be topped up <span class="font-italic">before </span>the Second TOP Inspection. As referenced above, when all the steps (in relation to tread and risers) were under scrutiny during the First TOP Inspection, this step was not found to be a non-compliant item. It is therefore reasonable to infer that this settlement occurred subsequent to the First TOP Inspection. This was not a serious non-compliant item and it could certainly be rectified easily. Furthermore, it was something that fell within the Defects Liability Period (“DLP”). Evidence was given by Mr Yong in his AEIC that this was rectified by GTMS in the space of one day, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, by 19 June 2013.

</div> We know by the time Mr Chan wrote to the BCA on 6 September 2013 this item had been rectified. Secondly, this settlement, occurring within the soil and turfing of the external works, is usually due to insufficient compaction of the soil or due to improper soil drainage. It is not something “natural”, as occurring in undisturbed soil as such, but occurring in part of GTMS’s landscaping external works. However, this is a very minor issue, especially given the other delay events, and perhaps was considered not worthwhile to explore.

</div> Hence, GTMS was in delay from 18 April 2013, as all these works and steps had to be carried out and completed before the application for the First TOP Inspection. As we have stated above (see [162(b)]), Mr Chan ought to have issued a Delay Certificate under cl 24(1) on or fairly soon after 18 April 2013 as there was no legitimate reason in this case to take a longer time to make a decision thereon. Even though cl 24(1) entitles an architect the latitude up to the issue of the Final Certificate to issue a Delay Certificate, there was no legitimate reason to delay the issue of a Delay Certificate in this case as the circumstances requiring its issue were clear, without complexity or ambiguity on the facts. Whether and/or when liquidated damages start to run is a matter that has grave consequences for both contractor and employer; it therefore behoves the architect to act promptly and with clarity when he carries out his certification function under cl 24(1), so the parties know where they stand. There may well be cases where there is complexity or ambiguity on the facts surrounding the decision whether to issue a Delay Certificate or not, hence the latitude granted in cl 24(1), but this is certainly not such a case. In the absence of any finding of delays caused by Mr Chan during that period, GTMS is liable for the delay up to the First TOP Inspection.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">165 </span>The causes for the bungalows failing the First TOP Inspection have been examined above. The Judge’s finding is that GTMS completed its rectification of the tread and risers for all staircases by 28 May 2013. We have found that the rectification of the other causes for the TOP Inspection failure attributed to GTMS could have been done in that same period up to 28 May 2013. If GTMS was not liable for any delays after 28 May 2013, then Mr Chan ought to have issued a Termination of Delay Certificate under cl 24(3)(a) which provides:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">24(3)(a)</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If while the Contractor is continuing work subsequent to the issue of a Delay Certificate, the Architect gives instructions or matters occur which would entitle the Contractor to an extension of time under Clauses 23(1)(f), … 23(1)(o) … and if such matters would have entitled the Contractor to an extension of time regardless of the Contractor’s own delay and were not caused by any breach of contract by the Contractor, the Architect shall as soon as possible grant to the Contractor the appropriate further extension of time in a certificate known as a “Termination of Delay Certificate.”  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">166 </span>Clause 24(3) specifically deals with delay events, which would usually entitle the contractor to an EOT under cl 23, when the contractor is already in delay, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, still carrying out the construction works after the contract completion or extended contract completion date, and a Delay Certificate has already been issued under cl 24(1). Hence if additional works are required under an AI or other verbal order or request by the architect, during the delay period, the architect is empowered to issue a Termination of Delay Certificate under cl 24(3)(a) of the SIA Conditions, in respect of those additional works. This makes clear that liquidated damages that have accrued up to the issue of the Termination of Delay Certificate remain intact, but do not continue to run after the Termination of Delay Certificate is issued; however if upon completion of the additional works, the contractor is still in delay, then a Further Delay Certificate can be issued, in which case the imposition of liquidated damages resumes from that date. This delineates the boundary between the earlier delay and further delay caused by new delay events or acts of prevention (see <span class="font-italic">Commentary on SIA Standard Form</span> at paras 24.11 to 24.13). Cl 24(3) serves a very important function of preserving the right of the Employer to liquidated damages that have already accrued when additional works during the period of delay are necessary and allows for a resumption of liquidated damages if the contractor still remains in delay after the additional works are completed. It should be noted that cl 24(3), (unlike earlier editions of the SIA Conditions of Contract), does not apply to the events set out in cll 23(1) (a)–(e), (l), (m) and (q).   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">167 </span>There were thus two significant events which, with respect, counsel and therefore the Judge, missed or failed to deal with:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, as mentioned above, one of the effective causes for the failure to obtain TOP on 30 April 2013, was the design error or omission by Mr Chan to provide for a railing at the swimming pool of Unit 12B where there was a drop of more than 1 meter.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) GTMS <span class="font-italic">must</span> have been “instructed” by an AI or verbally requested or otherwise asked to install the missing railing because this was rectified by the Second TOP Inspection. As this was an omission in the Drawings, one would have expected an AI or some request to GTMS with a drawing for GTMS to fabricate and then install the railing on site. This additional work meant and entailed an EOT and cost consequences. As mentioned above, there is a document, “AI No. 39” (see [162(d)(v)] from CSYA to GTMS to “add galvanised steel railing with paint finish at no.12B-swimming pool” with a reference to an attached drawing. However, as noted above, this is dated 23 September 2013, which is after TOP was obtained, and there is no corresponding evaluation by F+G, (unlike AI No. 34) in the Final Accounts although it appears in Valuation No. 27 (Final)

</div> under the “PARTICULARS OF VARIATION WORKS”, Item No. 19. Be that as it may, since this omission must have been rectified by the Second TOP Inspection on 18 June 2013, it would also have an important effect on the concurrent delay and liquidated damages being accumulated against GTMS. We deal with this in greater detail below. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Secondly, the inadequate height of the barrier at the built-in concrete bench at the Unit 12A pavilion would also have required additional works, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, the installation first of an invisible grille and later its dismantling and erection of a taller glass barrier, which would, in turn, have entailed submission of QP calculations and endorsement for strength and stability compliance. This would have held up the issue of the TOP and therefore the CC. The scant documentary evidence on the steps taken by Mr Chan and their corresponding dates have been set out at [162(d)(vi)] above. There is an “AI No. 34”, which is dated 26 August 2013,

We note there is a signed copy appearing in the Final Accounts together with an evaluation by F+G. Again, there are no findings in relation to these events upon which we can assess a potential EOT that should have been issued, which would have, in turn, triggered a Termination of Delay Certificate as Mr Chan was solely responsible for this omission. This additional work would have entailed time and costs consequences. It would similarly affect the liquidated damages ticking away as against GTMS with a far longer effective causative effect compared to the missing railing at Unit 12B.      </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Both these events would have potentially attracted the operation of cl 24(3) and stopped the accumulation of liquidated damages against GTMS.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">168 </span>To complete the factual framework, as noted above, the failure of the Second TOP Inspection was also not due to any construction works for which GTMS were responsible. Rectification of the concrete steps at the roofs of the bungalows would similarly have involved additional works ordered by Mr Chan but there are no findings of fact thereto as well as the soil settlement next to the Landscape Step. Mr Chan incorrectly submitted below that neither GTMS nor CSYA was responsible as they had no control over the settlement of the soil.

</div> These facts raise the issue of concurrent delays when the architect issues instructions or requires additional works, during a period of the Contractor’s delay. We note that this issue was not raised in the pleadings and there was only a very brief mention in parties’ submissions to the Judge on the law in relation to concurrent delays and the respective liabilities therefor. GTMS admitted in its closing submissions that there were construction errors which caused the failure of the First TOP Inspection, but said that the Second TOP Inspection would have passed if not for “non-construction errors” for which GTMS was not responsible; in particular, GTMS submitted that the overriding issue that caused the delay was the Parapet Walls at the Pavilion issue (or glass barrier, as referred to in the evidence below), at the pavilion in Unit 12A.

For present purposes, the general principle as stated in <span class="font-italic">Keating</span> at para 8-026 will suffice: “It is now generally accepted that under the Standard Form of Building Contracts and similar contracts a contractor is entitled to an extension of time where delay is caused by matters falling within the [EOT] clause notwithstanding the matter relied upon by the contractor is not the dominant cause of delay, provided only that it has at least equal “causative potency” with all other matters causing delay.” Put in another way, if during a period of culpable delay by the contractor, a variation is given, then the contractor is entitled to an extension of time for the period of delay caused by the variation even if it is concurrent with a period of culpable delay by the contractor, see <span class="font-italic">Henry Boot Construction (UK) Ltd v Malmaison</span> <span class="font-italic">Hotel (Manchester) Ltd </span>[1999] 70 Con LR 32 at [13]; <span class="font-italic">Royal Brompton</span><span class="font-italic"> Hospital National Health Trust v Hammond (No. 6)</span>, 18 December 2000,<span class="font-italic"> </span>2000 WL 1841725; <span class="font-italic">Walter Lil</span><span class="font-italic">ly &amp; Co Ltd v Giles Patrick Cyril Mackay and another </span>[2012] EWHC 1773 (TCC), [2012] BLR 503, per Akenhead J at [370].<span class="font-italic"> </span>The extension to the contractor would only be for the ‘net’ delay caused by the variation which would not include the ‘gross’ period up to the variation, see <span class="font-italic">Balfour Beatty</span><span class="font-italic"> Building Ltd v Chestermount Properties Ltd </span>[1993] 32 Con LR 139 at 158–164.

These points were not covered in the pleadings or in the evidence and were, as mentioned above, referred to in the submissions in a less than cursory fashion upon which a trial judge cannot be expected to make the necessary findings and rulings. If this had been done, and in the circumstances of this case, we need only set out two of the following possible outcomes that would have altered, fairly substantially, the parties’ positions on delay in completion of the Works, liability therefor and liquidated damages or general damages:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) A Termination of Delay Certificate should have been issued as a result of the additional works to rectify the Landscape Railings issue and this would have affected the liquidated damages that would have been running against GTMS as of 18 April 2013; we can conclude that this item was in all probability rectified by 31 May 2013 (when Mr Chan applied for the Second TOP Inspection) and certainly by the time the Second TOP Inspection took place on 18 June 2013.  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The Parapet Walls at the Pavilion issue would also have been the basis for the issue of a Termination of Delay Certificate and depending on the date when GTMS were told to remove the installed barrier and replace it with first, the invisible grille and its subsequent removal and replacement with a higher glass barrier and the QP submission therefor; the rectification of this error would, in all probability, have covered most, if not all, of the delay period after the bungalows failed the First TOP Inspection to the grant of the TOP.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">174 </span>In the circumstances, despite the foregoing analysis of how this dispute should have been resolved, we are constrained by the way the parties ran their respective cases below, and as a result thereof, to accept the Judge’s limited findings of fact. As found by the Judge, GTMS completed remedying their construction errors by 28 May 2013 (Judgment at [334]) and therefore liquidated damages against GTMS would run from 18 April 2013 to 28 May 2013. We find that on the facts, the responsibility, and therefore the liability, for the delays after 28 May 2013 in obtaining the TOP were attributable to Mr Chan’s errors and omissions. As for the Landscape Step issue and RC Roof issue, Mr Yong’s unchallenged evidence was that the former was completed in one day, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, by 19 June 2013, and according to the unchallenged evidence of Mr Dennis Tan, the latter was completed in two days, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, by 20 June 2013. We accept their evidence on these facts. These relatively minor non-compliant items cannot explain nor be the cause of TOP only being obtained on 16 September 2013. On the facts, the cause of delay after 28 May 2013 was attributable to the Parapet Walls at the Pavilion issue. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">175 </span>We therefore find and hold as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Mr Chan should have issued a Delay Certificate on or as reasonably soon after 18 April 2013 as GTMS was in delay as of that date and liquidated damages ran from that date. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Mr Chan was negligent in issuing IC 25 and/or IC 26 without affording Mr Ser the opportunity to decide if he would deduct the accrued liquidated damages from these payments due to GTMS.  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) We cannot fully agree with the Judge that the construction errors of GTMS were the dominant and effective cause of the bungalows failing the First TOP Inspection. However, as set out above, we are constrained to accept that GTMS continued to be in delay and liquidated damages would have continued to run.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) As of 28 May 2013, when GTMS completed rectifying their construction errors, GTMS could no longer be considered to be in delay, but the CC could not have been issued since TOP had not been obtained in accordance with the terms of the Contract. In these circumstances, especially since GTMS had been asked by Mr Chan to install the steel railings and the invisible grille as a result of his omission and errors in design, Mr Chan should have issued a Termination of Delay Certificate under cl 24(3)(a) of the SIA Conditions on or as soon as possible after 29 May 2013. Under cl 24(3)(b), liquidated damages should then have stopped running against GTMS. All operative delays after 28 May 2013 were not caused by GTMS but by Mr Chan. Liquidated damages against GTMS would therefore run from 18 April 2013 to 28 May 2013; this would amount to $147,600 (41 days x $3,600). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) The reasons for issuing the Termination of Delay Certificate under cl 24(3) should continue to hold good through to the date TOP was obtained, whereupon Mr Chan should have issued the CC. The DLP would then have started to run, and all else being satisfactorily complied with, DLP would have ended on 15 September 2014 with the issue of the Maintenance Certificate.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">176 </span>We deal with Mr Chan’s liability to Mr Ser below. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Item 72(b)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">177 </span>The requirements of Item 72 of the Preliminaries are conjunctive. Having found that Item 72(a) of the Preliminaries was not duly satisfied, it is strictly speaking, unnecessary for us to go further as the CC would have been improperly and prematurely issued. However, in deference to the parties having spent considerable time and resources on the remaining provisions of Item 72, as well as the care with which the Judge made his detailed findings and rulings thereon, we shall proceed to consider Item 72(b) of the Preliminaries briefly. Item 72(b) states that the CC shall not be issued until “[a]ll services are tested, commissioned and operating satisfactorily as specified in the Contract … including handing over all test certificates, operating instructions and warranties”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">178 </span>The Judge was satisfied that Item 72(b) of the Preliminaries had been duly fulfilled by 17 April 2013, for the following reasons:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) <span class="font-weight-bold">Testing and commissioning (“T&amp;C”) for gas services</span>: The Judge found that Mr Ser was estopped from insisting that the T&amp;C for gas services be completed before the CC could be issued. This was because Mr Ser had himself agreed that the T&amp;C for the gas services shall be conducted only <span class="font-italic">after </span>the TOP was issued. In addition, the T&amp;C for the gas was done by the gas supplier, GTMS and some subcontractors prior to, at the time of, and after gas turn-on (Judgment at [338]–[343]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) <span class="font-weight-bold">T&amp;C for electrical services: </span>There was no dispute that T&amp;C for electrical services were done <span class="font-italic">prior to </span>electrical turn-on. As to T&amp;C <span class="font-italic">after </span>turn-on, while there was no formal documentation, the Judge accepted the evidence of Mr Chan’s staff and CCA, who testified that the necessary T&amp;C had been duly carried out. While GTMS’s director had testified that no T&amp;C after turn-on was carried out, the Judge did not prefer his evidence, since the director would not have been directly managing the Works at the material time (Judgment at [346]–[351]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) <span class="font-weight-bold">T&amp;C for air conditioning and mechanical ventilation (“ACMV”) works: </span>The Judge was satisfied that the T&amp;C for ACMV works was done around 1 and 2 April 2013, prior to the electrical turn-on, as well as from 10 to 12 April 2013, after the electrical turn-on. The Judge accepted the testimony of a staff worker of CCA, as the M&amp;E consultant, that she had personally conducted the testing so that the Certificate of Supervision could be released for the TOP application. Further, GTMS and its subcontractor also signed off on the ACMV works for the bungalows at the latest by 12 April 2013. Additionally, there was a further round of T&amp;C for the air-conditioning equipment on 8 July 2013, which was an <span class="font-italic">additional </span>T&amp;C requested by Mr Ser (Judgment at [352]–[357]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) <span class="font-weight-bold">Handover of documents</span>: Mr Ser complained that while Item 72(b) of the Preliminaries required GTMS to hand over all testing documentation, no such documents were ever furnished. The Judge found that this handover requirement was <span class="font-italic">de minimis</span>, in that non-compliance would not prevent Mr Chan from validly issuing the CC (Judgment at [366]–[382]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">179 </span>In sum, the Judge found that the T&amp;C had been duly carried out for all relevant services with the exception of the gas services by 17 April 2013, <span class="font-italic">ie, </span>at the end of the contractual completion date following the grant of EOT 3 from a practical perspective, the handover of the documents could be done on another day. Therefore, Item 72(b) was satisfied by 17 April 2013. For the reasons that follow, we do not consider that there is sufficient basis to disturb the Judge’s findings on Item 72(b) in relation to Mr Ser’s complaints thereon, save that we do not, with respect, agree with the Judge’s <span class="font-italic">de minimis</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>approach to the requirement to hand over all test certificates, operating instructions and warranties in Item 72(b). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-justify font-italic"><span class="font-italic">T&amp;C for gas services</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">180 </span>It is undisputed that as at 17 April 2013, the T&amp;C for the gas services was not completed (Judgment at [338]). The Judge however, accepted Mr Chan’s argument that Mr Ser was estopped from strict reliance on Item 72(b) of the Preliminaries because first, it was represented to all parties that for safety reasons, the T&amp;C for gas services would be done <span class="font-italic">after</span> the Works were completed and second, all the parties consented to this arrangement. He found that Mr Ser’s M&amp;E Consultant, CCA, had conveyed this concern to the relevant parties involved, such as Mr Ser himself as well as his assistants, Mr Wilson Cheung and Mr Chow Kum Wai. There was no objection to this representation, which was relied on by Mr Chan and GTMS (Judgment at [338]–[343]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">181 </span>On appeal, Mr Ser claims that the Judge erred in his finding because he did not agree to the T&amp;C for gas services “being done after completion” but “merely agreed to postpone the <span class="font-italic font-underline">gas service connection (i.e</span><span class="font-italic font-underline">. gas turn-on)</span> until after TOP” [emphasis in original]. Put differently, he says he did not agree that GTMS need not conduct T&amp;C for gas services at all, nor agree that this could be done after the issuance of the CC.

</div> Their case, and the Judge’s finding, is simply that there was a representation that was relied on by the Contractor, that the T&amp;C for the gas services be done <span class="font-italic">after </span>the TOP. Mr Ser had agreed to this and is thus estopped from insisting on Item 72(b) of the Preliminaries as a bar to completion. Yet, Mr Ser fails to address what was crucially recorded in the minutes of Site Meeting No 41 on 21 January 2013 at Item 7.4, which was circulated to all parties present at the meeting by the Architect on 30 January 2013:

No such objections were raised at the following Site Meeting No 42. It follows, in our view, that in the light of the agreement to delay the gas turn-on until after the TOP, Mr Ser had waived the requirement that the gas turn-on had to occur before the CC could be issued and agreed to the T&amp;C of the gas services being conducted after TOP as well. The evidence, viewed in its totality, shows that when the CC was issued (albeit prematurely), neither Mr Ser nor his assistants raised any objections to the issuance of the CC notwithstanding that the T&amp;C for gas services were yet completed. This clearly supports the Judge’s finding on estoppel. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">183 </span>But that is not the end of Mr Ser’s argument.

</div> However, this elides the fact that Mr Ser’s presence was not contractually mandated. The Judge considered the evidence and made a finding that the certificates, together with Ms Chua’s and Mr Chew Beng Wah’s testimonies, were sufficient to find that the T&amp;C for gas services were adequately carried out. In addition, as GTMS points out, Mr Ser’s allegations in his Appellant’s Case that there are two different versions of the Certificate of Final Pressure Test in evidence (one version dated 18 July 2013 and the other version undated), and that both Mr Ser and CCA did not sign the Certificate of Final Pressure Test, are entirely belated; these were not pursued at trial and not put to CCA’s representative, Ms Chua.

The Judge preferred the evidence of Mr Yong and Ms Chua over that of Mr Dennis Tan, as they were more closely involved in the construction of the Project (Judgment at [351]).

</div> In support of this argument, Mr Ser relies on an email dated 30 September 2013 sent to him by Mr Dennis Tan. This is with respect, unsustainable. Mr Dennis Tan’s email does not say that GTMS was of the view that T&amp;C was beyond the scope of their works, but merely that for “[e]lectrical power tripping: the issue of overloading the MCB due to the 150 Amps cap is not under our jurisdiction or responsibility”.

</div> GTMS submits that the issue of overloading was a design issue, and that, against CCA’s advice that “150 Amps cap” might be too low for the Project, Mr Ser had nonetheless insisted on settling for this electricity load. As such, GTMS could not be faulted for Mr Ser’s choice of a low electrical supply load when it had constructed the electrical works based on Mr Ser’s design.

</div> This is mischievous as it suggests that the T&amp;C was done only on this date. Mr Ser omits to point out that this T&amp;C of the air-conditioning equipment referred to in the schedule of minor works attached to the CC was an <span class="font-italic">additional </span>T&amp;C carried out at Mr Ser’s own request, as he wanted the ACMV works to be tested on both sunny and rainy days. This was the unchallenged evidence of Ms Chua, Mr Yong and Mr Chan’s representative, Ms Wan (Judgment at [354]–[357]). In essence, this additional T&amp;C pertained to ascertaining whether CCA’s <span class="font-italic">design </span>for the ACMV works was performing according to purpose, rather than whether they were in accordance with CCA’s design (Judgment at [357]).

</div> It was undisputed between the parties that the operating instructions and warranties were only handed over to Mr Ser on or about 22 June 2014, though Mr Ser submitted below that the test certificates had not been handed over to him even up till today; however, the Judge found that “…the Documents were in fact ready earlier than 22 June 2014 as [GTMS] and [Mr Chan] wanted to hand over the Project to [Mr Ser] soon after the TOP was obtained, specifically, on or around 25 September 2013, but [Mr Ser] refused to take over the Project” (Judgment at [366]). On appeal before us, Mr Ser does not dispute that the operating instructions and warranties were handed over to him on 22 June 2014, but maintains that the test certificates (with the exception of ACMV) have not been given to him at all.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">196 </span>The Judge accepted Mr Chan’s argument that a “practical approach” was warranted, such that the handing over of these Documents was a <span class="font-italic">de minimis </span>issue that had no impact on the practicality of completion and the preparation of the Documents could be done during the maintenance period instead (Judgment at [367]). The Judge undertook an analysis of Item 72(b) of the Preliminaries, alongside cl 31(13) of the SIA Conditions, and in applying a contextual approach to interpretation, considered the critical issue of Item 72(b) of the Preliminaries to be whether the T&amp;C requirement had been fulfilled. In his view, the handover requirement was a <span class="font-italic">subset </span>of the T&amp;C requirement, and thus subsidiary to the primary focus of Item 72(b), which is the T&amp;C requirement. This interpretation of <span class="font-italic">de minimis,</span> he concluded, would accord with commercial common sense and be consistent with the business purpose of the clause and the Contract as a whole (Judgment at [369]–[380]). As such, Item 72(b) of the Preliminaries would be fulfilled as long as the services are “tested, commissioned, and operating to the [Architect’s] satisfaction as specified in the Contract and subcontracts” (Judgment at [381]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">197 </span>Whilst we can agree with the Judge that the main and important requirement of Item 72(b) is that all services are tested, commissioned and operating satisfactorily, with respect, we do not think there is any room to imply a <span class="font-italic">de minimis</span> approach to Item 72(b). On a true construction, Item 72(b) has also to be complied with before the CC can be issued. Consequently, Item 72(b) requires the handing over of all test certificates (unless waived or modified by agreement of the parties), operating instructions and warranties before the issue of the CC. However, we think the Judge was correct in his view that these “Documents” (Judgement at [366] and referenced at [195] above) were in fact ready earlier than 22 June 2014 but Mr Ser refused to take over the Project soon after TOP. If Mr Ser refused to take over the Project, including the Documents, then he is in no position to contend that this requirement of Item 72(b) was not complied with. The Judge noted that GTMS and CSYA wanted to hand over the Project to Mr Ser soon after the TOP was obtained, specifically, on or around 25 September 2013, but Mr Ser refused to take over the Project (Judgment at [366]). The Judge referred to Mr Dennis Tan’s evidence under cross-examination, where, in gist, Mr Dennis Tan testified that the Documents were ready to be handed over to Mr Ser around 25 September 2013, but “the owner [Mr Ser] refused to accept it because he has not accept taking over the property”.

</div> In our view, the evidence shows that GTMS and CSYA did attempt to handover the Documents to Mr Ser around 18 September 2013, but he had refused to accept them. Mr Ser has also not addressed the Judge’s finding that he had refused to accept the handover of the Documents in his Appellant’s Case. Mr Ser therefore has no basis to submit there was a non-compliance with Item 72(b) on this score. The Judge has found that this was fulfilled, and we agree with that conclusion.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Item 72(c)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">198 </span>Item 72(c) of the Preliminaries requires that the CC be issued only when the works under the Contract, including any rectifications, were done “to the completion and standards acceptable to [Mr Chan]”. If in Mr Chan’s honest professional opinion, the rectification was effected and completed to a standard satisfactory to him, that would be the end of the matter. Item 72(c) would have been fulfilled. If Mr Ser disagreed, he was entitled to take GTMS to arbitration and he was at liberty to sue Mr Chan if he thought otherwise. Whether Mr Ser would succeed would depend on the facts. The Judge was correct to say that Item 72(c) would be satisfied when in Mr Chan’s honest professional opinion, there was “practical completion”, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, when there remained only <span class="font-italic">minor</span> defects with the bungalows (Judgment at [384]–[386]). Mr Ser thus must also show that the defects were <span class="font-italic">substantial</span> and/or that Mr Chan did not or could not have held the honest opinion and/or was negligent in certifying that the works and any required rectification thereto was completed to his satisfaction, in order to succeed in his claim that Item 72(c) was not satisfied. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">199 </span>In this regard, the Judge accepted that there were some defects with the bungalows, but found that they did not affect the date on which the Works could be deemed as completed for the purposes of the CC (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 28 May 2013). On appeal, Mr Ser insists on his laundry list of complaints in relations to the Works. In brief, our position is that his complaints regarding the defects in the bungalows are without merit, <span class="font-italic">save for</span> that relating to the intumescent paint. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">200 </span>Moreover, given our earlier finding that the CC could have only been issued at the earliest on <span class="font-italic">16 September 2013, when </span><span class="font-italic">the TOP was issued</span>, we are of the view that Item 72(c) only needed to have been satisfied by <span class="font-italic">16 September 2013</span>. This is a pertinent point because, as we shall see below, some of the requirements under Item 72(c) could not be said to have been satisfied by 28 May 2013 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the date found by the Judge).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Preliminary observation on the burden of proof</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">201 </span>We make a preliminary observation on the burden of proof. Mr Ser is the one who alleges that there are <span class="font-italic">substantial </span>defects with the Project which remain unrectified. The burden of proof thus falls on him to prove that first, there were defects which were substantial and secondly, that these defects remain unrectified. As will be evident from our analysis below, this burden would prove fatal to many of Mr Ser’s claims of defective works, since many of these claims are supported solely by assertions on his part, or on the part of his expert, Mr Chin. The Judge considered the evidence before him and observed Mr Chin, and other witnesses, under cross-examination. He found Mr Chin to be partial and lacking in the requisite expertise (Judgment at [130]). We see no reason to disagree with that finding.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Loamy soil</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">202 </span>Pursuant to Architect’s Instruction No. 26 (“AI 26”) dated 4 January 2013, GTMS had to supply and backfill the project with loamy soil.

</div> They contend that the backfill was an approved soil mixture (“ASM”) containing loamy soil and was of a better quality than loamy soil. GTMS and Mr Chan contend that NParks requires any external roadside planting to be backfilled with an ASM containing loamy soil, compost and washed sand in the ratio of 3:2:1 respectively. Since the backfill used for the roadside planting was acceptable to NParks, it must also have meant that the backfill for Units No. 12, No. 12A and No. 12B must have been that same ASM containing loamy soil. GTMS and Mr Chan retained an expert, Mr Leong Lian Chuan (“Mr Leong”), who, based on photographs provided to him by GTMS, opined that the soil used was loamy soil as it matched the ratio of clay, sand and silt contained in loamy soil. There were also laboratory reports from the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority of Singapore (“AVA”) that the soil used was an ASM which contained loamy soil (Judgment at [565]). Mr Leong, however, conceded that the photographs he viewed did not provide conclusive evidence that the backfill was loamy soil. He also agreed with Mr Ser’s counsel that the photographs were consistent with Mr Tay’s evidence that loamy soil was merely applied to the Project by way of “top-dressing” rather than backfilled (Judgment at [566]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">205 </span>The foregoing shows that the evidence led below was based on visual or inadequate investigation, making the respective “conclusions” of the experts on what kind of soil was used for backfill unreliable. In addition, the parties were often making submissions at cross-purposes. Different terms, like “top soil”, “normal top soil”, “ASM with loamy soil”, and “loamy soil” were tossed about without any precision as to what they mean. Proper details, accurate description of soil types and, as here, relative proportions are necessary when discussing the soil types that have been specified and supplied. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">206 </span>To return to our analysis, Mr Ser also contends that the bungalows were not backfilled with ASM but with something called “normal top soil” as evidenced by an email dated 28 April 2014 from the nominated subcontractor for the landscape works, Creideas Design Pte Ltd.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">207 </span>An examination of Creideas Design Pte Ltd’s email of 28 April 2014 will illustrate our point at [205] above.

</div> Mr Ser then submitted that GTMS and CYSA should be jointly and severally liable for a total of $153,700 for the cost of stripping and reapplying intumescent paint with a two-hour fire rating. This was quantified by Mr Ser’s expert, Mr See Choo Lip, at $90,556 for the steel staircase and $63,144 for the remaining steelworks at the Project.

</div> We agree with Mr Singh. We think that the doctrine of <span class="font-italic">estoppel by representation </span>precludes Mr Ser from claiming against GTMS. Mr Ser must be taken to have represented to GTMS that Mr Chan, as the architect appointed under the Project, is his agent and authorised representative who therefore has the ability to vary the Contract (and this is expressly provided for under the SIA Conditions). GTMS has detrimentally relied on this representation by following Mr Chan’s directions. We are further satisfied that this position better accords with the realities of the construction industry, see <span class="font-italic">Hudson’s</span> at para 2-086. As we pointed out during the oral hearing, it would be an “impossible situation”

</div> if contractors are liable even though they were just following the architect’s instructions in good faith.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">223 </span>It follows that only Mr Chan would be liable for the lowering of the fire rating of the intumescent paint to a one-hour rating without obtaining Mr Ser’s consent to do so. We should note that whether GTMS was paid on the basis of a two-hour or one-hour rated intumescent paint does not appear to have surfaced below or before us. This follows from the fact that the Contract entered into between Mr Ser and GTMS stipulated a two-hour rated intumescent paint, that was priced accordingly by GTMS and accepted by Mr Ser; he was therefore contractually entitled to receive paint of that stipulated rating. Mr Chan could not unilaterally change that specification without getting Mr Ser’s authorisation. This is a well-known principle in construction law and set out in the standard texts. First, in <span class="font-italic">Hudson’s</span> at para 2-086 under the heading “Waiver of Contractual Requirements” it is stated: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… But it cannot be too strongly emphasised that construction professionals (unless, as is less and less frequently the case at the present day, there is a contractual provision giving their opinion, decision or certificate finality [which is not applicable here]) will have no authority whatever to waive strict compliance with the contract or to bind the Employer.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Secondly, in <span class="font-italic">Keating</span>, it is stated at para 14-021:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The architect has no implied authority to vary the works or to order extras, or to order as extras works impliedly included in the work for which the contract sum is payable. … An architect cannot, without the employer’s knowledge or consent, bind the employer by a promise that a condition of the contract will be waived or vary the terms of the contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">224 </span>This requirement of strict compliance and not to make any material alteration, including additions or omissions from the approved design, is also reflected in cl 1.1(3) of the MOA:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The Architect shall not make any material alteration to, addition to or omission from the approved design without the consent of the Client, except in cases in which they are necessary to comply with statutory requirements and/or for constructional reasons. In which case, the Architect shall subsequently notify the Client promptly and the additional cost incurred shall be paid by the Client.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Subject therefore to any contractual provisions to the contrary (and there are none here), that principle holds good; that principle includes waiving or lowering contract specifications, (save for compliance with the law or regulations). But assuming the employer is prepared to accept a diminution in value (which is not Mr Ser’s position), the very least that one would expect is for the cost difference to be passed on to the employer. Failing to obtain Mr Ser’s consent to this change results in a claim by Mr Ser against Mr Chan and that claim would lie both in contract as well as tort. We note that in his Appellant’s Case,

This appears to exclude the $90,556 that Mr Ser claimed below in respect of the cost of reapplying the intumescent paint at the steel staircases for the Project (see [221(f)] above). However, we note that in his Appellant’s Case at [147], Mr Ser has claimed the sum of $90,556 for reapplying intumescent paint to the staircases under a separate heading, “Steps and risers of the staircases”.

</div> In this regard, the Judge found that the only applicable provision was cl 7.1 of the drawing, which simply requires compliance with the statutory requirements. The statutory requirements, as reflected in the SCDF Fire Code 2013, requires only “exposed faces” to be coated. The Judge accepted GTMS’s explanation that the top of the beams was covered by the timber decking and thus not “exposed”. The Judge further relied on the registered inspector’s certification, in March 2013, that the paintwork on the trellis beams satisfied the relevant statutory requirements (Judgment at [548]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">227 </span>With respect, we disagree with the Judge. Intumescent paint is a special paint which is applied to steel components, like steel beams, to protect them from high heat; when the heat exceeds a specified temperature, the paint will intumesce or expand to form a carbon layer which thermally insulates the steel or other material upon which it is painted for a specified period of time. It also slows down the spread of the fire. Much was made of the fact that Table 3.3A of the SCDF Fire Code 2013 only required “exposed faces” of the structural beam to be coated. The requirement that “exposed” faces must be coated cannot be given an unduly literal interpretation bearing in mind the purpose of using this kind of special fire protection or fire retardant paint. First, it is clear that the steel beams support a wooden trellis above a service yard and not, for example, a wooden deck. Therefore, the upper surfaces of the steel beams certainly had partially “exposed” surfaces. From the photographs submitted at trial,

There is no need for scientific literature to support the fact that wood catches fire more easily than brick, mortar and steel. Wood has been used as fuel to sustain a flame for various purposes from time immemorial. It is therefore fallacious to conclude that since one side of the beam is covered, or partly covered, with wood, (whether it is a trellis or wooden deck or floor), that means there is no need to coat it with the specified intumescent paint. If beams of this nature are used in this context, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, as supports for a trellis above, and are required to be coated with intumescent paint, it does mean that <span class="font-italic">all four sides</span> of the beams are to be painted. As to the Judge’s reliance on the certification by the registered inspector, the short answer is that such certification is not binding on this court, <span class="font-italic">a fortiori</span> if there is an error or omission on the part of the registered inspector; his certification may certainly be departed from when he has made an error or there are compelling reasons to do so. Furthermore, there is no contractual obligation to apply the coating to the satisfaction of the registered inspector.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">228 </span>We therefore find that all four sides of the trellis beams had to be coated with intumescent paint. This entitles Mr Ser to damages. As referenced above, in this appeal, Mr Ser claims the sum of $63,144 for the cost of applying intumescent paint of a two-hour rating on all the trellis beams. This is based on the evidence of Mr Ser’s witness, quantity surveyor Mr See Choo Lip. Mr Singh confirmed at the hearing before us that this sum concerns the costs of using paint of two-hour fire-proof rating on all four sides.

</div> Mr Ser has not stated whether this sum encompasses both the difference in the cost of the correct intumescent paint and the application of the intumescent paint on all four sides of the trellis beams, which will include dismantling of the wooden trellis, applying the two-hour intumescent paint and then re-assembling the wooden trellis. The former is an item of damage which Mr Chan should bear but the latter should be borne by GTMS as it pertains to their negligent workmanship in failing to paint the fourth side of the steel beams on which the wooden trellis rested. It cannot be laid at Mr Chan’s doorstep as neither Mr Chan nor his subordinates authorised the painting on only three surfaces of the steel beams. However, there are no findings of fact, no submissions or any evidence to make a proper apportionment. This failure is another instance of inadequate assistance from counsel and their experts to the Judge below. Given the nature of intumescent paint with a two-hour rating, it cannot be equated to ordinary plaster or wood paint, and it may be more expensive by an appreciable margin. Further, the dismantling and re-assembly cost will also vary depending on whether scaffolding or scissor lifts are required. It would not be just or fair to put the whole cost on Mr Chan as GTMS were responsible for not coating all the surfaces. We therefore have to do the best we can in this sad state of affairs. We accordingly apportion the sum of $63,144 as follows. Mr Chan is liable to Mr Ser for $42,096 (together with interest thereon from the date of the writ), being two thirds of this claim and GTMS is liable to Mr Ser for $21,048 (together with interest thereon from the date of the writ), being one third of this claim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">230 </span>Item 72(c) is in the nature of a “sweep-up” clause. It requires all works included in the Contract to be performed, including such rectification as may be required to bring the work to completion and standards acceptable to the Architect. Given the circumstances in which the two-hour fire rating was changed unilaterally by Mr Chan to a one-hour fire rating, which complied with the statutory fire protection requirements in force and the registered fire inspector passed the bungalows on 20 March 2013 (Judgment at [546]),

</div> This criticism is in our view unfounded. First, he argues that he only chose an “example” of what he wanted, and did not view every single marble slab to be used. He appears to be saying that he must have chosen each and every single marble slab before he can be bound to his choice. This is not a realistic position. Secondly, Mr Ser says that he is only a layman, and cannot be expected to identify the flaws in the marble slabs he has selected – and GTMS’s expert also gave evidence to this effect.

At that meeting, he was briefed about, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, “tonality, stain, grain and veins, which was often only appreciated by marble connoisseurs” (Judgment at [429]).

Thirdly, Mr Ser asserts that there is no proof that the Volakas marble supplied was that which he selected. He misapprehends the burden of proof.

Also, in relation to this point about acceptance, the Judge found, and Mr Ser does not contest, that the marble was installed in January 2013 and he only complained about the marble in October 2013. Mr Ser had nine months to study the marble, and yet chose to say nothing (Judgment at [431]).

On appeal, Mr Ser says that he cannot be faulted for agreeing to forego the dry lay. During the oral hearing before us, Mr Singh insists that it was GTMS and Mr Chan that “discouraged”

While GTMS did tell Mr Ser that there were space constraints at the site, the dry lay could have been done <span class="font-italic">at the warehouse of the marble supplier</span>. Further, and more fundamentally, GTMS and Mr Chan, as the Judge found, <span class="font-italic">explained to Mr Ser the pros and cons </span>of forgoing the dry lay, and it was an “informed” choice on Mr Ser’s part to agree with the recommendations given to him.

</div> We do not think that this evidence supports Mr Ser’s contention that the installation works were defective. The “existing imperfections” with the Volakas marble more likely than not referred to the natural features typical of Grade C marble which Mr Ser personally selected, and not to any defective works. In the same vein, the need for “site repair” likely arose from the natural features typical of the Grade C marble and not from any defects with the installation. In any event, Mr Singh also conceded in the oral hearing before us that GTMS’s expert was not cross-examined on the quality of the installation works.

In the same vein, the Architect’s Direction No 1, which pertained to Mr Chan’s concern that there was no proper protection of the installed works, was deemed satisfactory after Mr Chan accepted GTMS’s “explanation that protective measures were only necessary on-site when the finishing works were complete” (Judgment at [417], [432]–[435]). Mr Ser himself accepts that the Architect’s Direction No 1 was eventually complied with.

</div> We find this contention misguided. Mr Ser appears to be saying that he must have personally seen and chosen each and every piece of ironwood in order to be bound. Again, this is unrealistic and cannot be sustained. Insofar as Mr Ser is alleging that the Contractor did not get the ironwood similar to the samples which he had selected, Mr Ser has produced no evidence to substantiate that claim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">260 </span>Secondly, Mr Ser complains about the excessive splitting of the ironwood.

</div> We agree with Mr Ser. The Judge was satisfied that the splitting occurred naturally because the outdoor decks were left unmaintained between April 2013 and November 2014, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 19 months (Judgment at [440]). However, the bungalows were only handed over to Mr Ser in July 2014. Therefore, GTMS bore the responsibility of maintaining the ironwood decking up to July 2014. Assuming the Contractor did maintain the ironwood properly, it follows that the ironwood split within four months. That is in our view not satisfactory for ironwood meant for <span class="font-italic">outdoor </span>timber decking.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">261 </span>GTMS is thus in our view responsible for the splitting of the ironwood. However, this is not sufficient for Mr Ser. The Judge found that in any event, GTMS had carried out rectification works on the outdoor timber decking in January and April 2014, which Mr Chan was satisfied with (Judgment at [442]). Mr Ser disagrees because the 2014 BAPL Report still shows many outstanding defects with the timber decking.

He was not entitled to do so, as a matter of fact and law, prior to the issuance of the TOP, because of the strictures set out in Item 72 of the Preliminaries. With respect, the Judge erred in finding that the Works could be deemed to have been completed (and the CC thus validly issued) as of 28 May 2013.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">273 </span>We begin with the delays, which is the more contentious area. Liquidated damages are a <span class="font-italic">contractually provided </span>remedy, the grant of which must therefore comply with the provisions of the Contract. Clause 24(2) of the SIA Conditions requires a Delay Certificate to have been issued before there is a right to liquidated damages and the concomitant right to start deducting liquidated damages from any sums due to the contractor under the contract. Since Mr Chan did not issue any Delay Certificate, Mr Ser was not able to start deducting liquidated damages from any monies that fell due to GTMS under the Contract. However, the parties have now submitted all their disputes to the court for final resolution and at this stage, Mr Ser is not entirely without recourse, as we will explain later (see [316] below). Litigation can sometimes give rise to strange bedfellows. As we shall see, both Mr Ser and Mr Chan submit that this court can and should reopen or review Mr Chan’s failure to issue the Delay Certificate under the SIA Conditions, in particular, cl 37.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">274 </span>Turning to the deductions for the defective works, we have earlier found that the intumescent paint applied on the trellis beam did not meet contractual specifications in two aspects, namely, that (a) the paint should have had a two-hour fire-proof rating and not one-hour rating, and (b) all four sides of the trellis beams should have been painted instead of just three. However, we have found that the issue of the fire-proof rating (a) is something for which <span class="font-italic">Mr Chan alone</span> should bear liability, since he (<span class="font-italic">via</span> his representative) was the one who authorised GTMS to change the paint to one with a one-hour fire-proof rating without obtaining Mr Ser’s consent. This was a change in the specified fire-proof rating without authorisation from the owner (see [224] above). We have also found that GTMS is only liable for the omission to paint the additional side of the trellis beams, for which a deduction in favour of Mr Ser should be made (see [228] above).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The two moieties of retention money</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">275 </span>Mr Ser submits that Mr Chan should not have certified the release of the two moieties of retention money under IC 25 and under FC.

</div> However, that rests upon his own view as to when completion took place. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">276 </span>Under cl 31(9) of the SIA Conditions, the first moiety of the retention monies is to be certified due and released to the contractor upon the issue of the CC. Cl 31(9) empowers the architect to retain a reasonable sum to cover the cost of any minor outstanding works as described under cl 24(5). As referenced above, Mr Chan issued the CC erroneously, on 15 May 2013 and backdated the date of Completion to 17 April 2013. Mr Chan only certified the first moiety due under IC 25, dated 3 September 2013. We have found that<span class="font-italic"> </span>the earliest date on which the CC could have been issued is 16 September 2013 (see [270] above). Technically, based on our finding in relation to the CC, the first moiety of retention money should not have been released until or shortly after 16 September 2013. However, Mr Ser has not proved or shown what loss or damage he has suffered as a result of certification of its release of the first moiety some 13 days prematurely. In so saying, we have not forgotten Mr Ser’s position that the Project was not completed until at least July 2014 when he took possession and that there were many defects and errors still extant as of that date – this is a contention which, as mentioned above, we do not accept. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">277 </span>Since practical completion should have been certified only on 16 September 2013, it follows that the maintenance period would only have commenced on 16 September 2013 under cl 26(2)(b) and ended on 15 September 2014, provided the conditions in cl 27(5) have been complied with. Putting to one side all the disputes over the defects in the Works, the MC thus could have been issued only from 16 September 2014 onwards. The second moiety could only have been released from 16 September 2014. The FC was issued only on 22 June 2015 and in the absence of evidence that the FC was issued too early, Mr Ser cannot have any valid complaint over the certification of the release of the second moiety under the FC. The Judge has dismissed all of Mr Ser’s allegations in relation to the alleged defective Works and, with one exception in relation to the intumescent paint, we have dismissed Mr Ser’s appeals on these alleged defective Works.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">278 </span>We accordingly dismiss Mr Ser’s appeal in relation to the wrongful certification and release of the moieties of the retention sums.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Proof of payment </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">279 </span>Mr Ser’s appeal on this score relates to the work and payments of the nominated subcontractors (“NSCs”) and nominated suppliers (“NSs”) under cl 28.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">280 </span>The bottom line of this issue is Mr Ser’s submission that Mr Chan could not have certified the sums claimed by GTMS under IC 25 and IC 26 if GTMS did not adduce any proof that it had <span class="font-italic">actually paid</span> the NSCs and NSs.

Under cl 31(11)(a), the sub-clause for “Final Account Documents”, a similar phrase is used: “… including <span class="font-italic">documents relating to the accounts</span> of the Designated or Nominated Sub-contractors or Suppliers …” [emphasis added]. The phrases “[the NSC or NS’s] accounts showing the sub-contract value of the work carried out by them” and “documents relating to the accounts of the [NSCs or NSs]” does not necessarily mean the actual sums paid to them. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">283 </span>For historical context, we can do no better than turn to the <span class="font-italic">C</span><span class="font-italic">ommentary on SIA Standard Form</span>, where the learned author, Chow Kok Fong, states at para 28.26:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Clause 28(5) re-states the approach commonly adopted by quantity surveyors in dealing with valuation and payments to [NSCs and NSs].

</div> This cannot be correct. In our view, all that is necessary is for the quantity surveyors to ascertain what the subcontract sum or value was and that the NSCs or NSs have provided the requisite services and goods, which would be evidenced through the invoices which GTMS did in fact submit. That would be evidence of the amount expended or to be expended for that piece of work or supply of work, material or goods. It should be noted that quantity surveyors are the experts dealing with the prices and values of such items as are found in BQs, including the PC Items or Sums or Provisional or Contingency Sums on a daily basis. They are current with the range of prices in the various cost items.

The project quantity surveyors, F+G, were Mr Chan’s consultants. Mr Ng Pak Khuen, who was formerly employed by F+G and was the quantity surveyor dealing with the Project, gave evidence under subpoena.

With respect, we disagree. Clause 28(5) of the SIA Conditions refers merely to the “accounts”. Clause 31(11)(a) merely requires that the “accounts” be substantiated with “supporting documents”. Nothing can be read from the text of these clauses which requires GTMS to first pay the NSCs and NSs before it can be reimbursed. Mr Singh’s reliance on the phrase “the actual amount expended” by the main contractor to the NSC or NS does not stand on firm ground as it can also refer to the subcontract sum which, as referenced above, is consistent with Mr Chow Kok Fong’s view. It is noteworthy that Mr Chow is a quantity surveyor by training and profession and has been intimately involved with the construction industry; he has lived with these various standard forms like the previous standard form contracts used by the Singapore statutory boards or semi-government bodies (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, the PUB form, the JTC form of standard contract), those issued by the bodies like the RIBA, JCT, FIDIC and ICE, their various editions and amendments, as well as witnessed the birth of the SIA and PSSCOC forms.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">289 </span>The above suffices to dispose of Mr Ser’s argument that GTMS needed to prove the sums it paid the NSCs and NSs first before it can make payment claims.

By certifying the payment claims, Mr Chan (with the assistance of the quantity surveyor) has confirmed that the sums claimed were legitimate. Therefore, if Mr Ser is saying that there were irregularities, the onus lies on <span class="font-italic">him </span>to prove such irregularities. We also note that Mr Ser’s allegation cannot apply to a number of NSC or NS items of work as the necessary AI would, for example, direct GTMS to accept a named entity, like LuxLight Pte Ltd, as NS for the supply and delivery of light fittings and accessories at a stated price, $194,800.59, together with a quotation. If for any reason GTMS was able to obtain a discount from LuxLight Pte Ltd for that supply subcontract, for reasons unrelated to Mr Ser or because of past dealings where LuxLight was indebted to GTMS, that has nothing to do with Mr Ser or is GTMS’s good fortune and they do not have to account for that further discount to Mr Ser.

But that was not the only meaning for the word “discount”; as explained by the quantity surveyor, it could have referred simply to a <span class="font-italic">refund</span>, where the Contractor <span class="font-italic">returns unused items or faulty items</span> (Judgment at [649]). We do not think Mr Ser has proved that the reference to “discount” in the credit notes <span class="font-italic">necessarily </span>means that he was overcharged. For example, in his Appellant’s Case, Mr Ser referred to a credit note issued by Oriental Stone LLP on 24 September 2012, reflecting a “Discount” of $2,257.14 (10% of Invoice No. 121150 dated 9 September 2012).

What Mr Ser has done is to confuse a PC Rate item for supply with a PC Sum item. As explained by the Judge, a “PC Sum” item refers to items in the Project that are based on a lump sum, for example, built-in wardrobes and cabinets (Judgment at [610(a)]. As noted in <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s</span><span class="font-italic"> Laws of Singapore </span>vol 2 (LexisNexis, 2009)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at para 30.261, a PC Sum “stipulates a unit rate for the supply of that item and the contractor’s price for that item (that is, covering labour and supply) is taken to have been tendered on the basis of this rate”. However, PC Rate items constitute those that are calculated in the Project based on a rate of measurement, for example, per square metre for marble and tiles (Judgment at [610(b)]; see also <span class="font-italic">Poh Lian Development Pte Ltd v Hok Mee Property Pte Ltd and Others </span>[2009] SGHC 153 at [18]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Summary</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">301 </span>In summary, the Payment Certificates were validly issued and, with the exception of the intumescent paint on the steel beams (see [228] above), the judgment entered in respect of the Payment Certificates at $1,103,915.48 stands (Judgment at [749(a)]).

Mr Ser’s claim in respect of two thirds of this sum, $42,096 (together with interest thereon from the date of the writ), lies against Mr Chan for the unauthorised change in the specifications of the intumescent paint and one third of this sum, $21,048 (together with interest thereon from the date of the writ), from GTMS for failing to paint all four sides of the steel beams.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 4: The remedies available as between Mr Ser and GTMS, as well as between Mr Ser and Mr Chan</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">As between Mr Ser and GTMS</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">303 </span>We now turn to the issue of Mr Ser’s claim for liquidated damages against GTMS, following from our discussion at [175(d)] above.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Liquidated damages</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">304 </span>We have found that the CC could only have been issued, at the earliest, on 16 September 2013 when TOP was attained.

</div> We agree. It is trite law that a claim, or a defence, which is unpleaded cannot be relied upon: <span class="font-italic">V Nithia </span>at [38]. We note for completeness that there is a narrow exception where the court may permit an unpleaded point to be raised if no injustice or irreparable prejudice (that cannot be compensated by costs) will be occasioned to the other party, if the evidence given at trial can, where appropriate, overcome defects in the pleadings provided that the other party is not taken by surprise or irreparably prejudiced, or where it would be clearly unjust for the court not to do so (<span class="font-italic">V Nithia </span>at [40]; <span class="font-italic">OMG Holdings Pte Ltd v Pos Ad Sdn Bhd </span>[2012] 4 SLR 231 at [18]). The rationale of disallowing a claim, or a defence, that is not pleaded, is to prevent injustice from being occasioned to the party who did not have a chance to respond to the unpleaded claim or defence (see <span class="font-italic">Ma Hongjin v SCP Holdings Pte Ltd </span>[2021] 1 SLR 304 at [34]–[35]). In the context of this case, the operation of the prevention principle is very fact sensitive. With respect, we are therefore of the view that the Judge erred in relying on Mr Chan’s instructions in relation to the steps and risers as that would be prejudicial to Mr Ser since GTMS never pleaded this as an act of a prevention in its Defence to Counterclaim. We note that GTMS did plead an act of prevention but <span class="font-italic">only</span> with respect to the construction of the pavilion. Therefore, the obvious inference is that there was no other act of prevention being relied upon. More significantly, GTMS did not argue that Mr Chan’s instructions in relation to the steps and risers was an act of prevention <span class="font-italic">even </span><span class="font-italic">in its written submissions before the Judge</span>.

</div> Their interests are aligned because if Mr Ser is unable to claim liquidated damages against GTMS due to a lack of a Delay Certificate, Mr Ser would look to Mr Chan for the loss due to the latter’s supposed default or negligence in not issuing the same. If the lack of a Delay Certificate is not an impediment to the recovery of liquidated damages, then Mr Ser can recover those damages from GTMS. Mr Singh was also happy to argue that this court can reopen Mr Chan’s refusal to issue a Delay Certificate, since Mr Ser will then be able, potentially, to claim against both GTMS and Mr Chan, as opposed to against Mr Chan alone.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">314 </span>Mr Thio SC’s and Mr Singh’s positions are premised on the arbitration clause, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, cll 37(3) and 37(4) of the SIA Conditions, the material parts of which read as follows:

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">316 </span>In our judgment, the court or an arbitrator is empowered under the SIA Conditions and this Contract to come to a view and rule or find that a Delay Certificate <span class="font-italic">ought </span><span class="font-italic">to or should</span> have been issued as of a particular date when an architect fails to do so. The court or an arbitrator can therefore proceed to award or find that liquidated damages are payable, based on that notional Delay Certificate which ought to or should have been issued. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">317 </span>We start with the contractual provisions. The scheme that underpins almost all standard form construction contracts in Singapore is that whilst the construction contract is ongoing, the architect (or his equivalent) is empowered to make various decisions which are aimed to keep the construction processes on track to completion. Thus, just to mention a few examples, the architect may issue variations (both additions and omission) to the works, and the architect (and his team of consultants, including the quantity surveyors) may certify interim payments to the contractor, clarify any issues in relation to the construction, certify extensions of time and certificates in relation to the usual, if applicable, stages of completion and rectification works. Over the years, various mechanisms have been incorporated to deal more effectively with interim disputes, like the adjudication process under the Building And Construction Industry Security of Payment Act 2004 (2020 Rev Ed) (“SOPA”) for interim payments, or dispute adjudication boards under contract forms like FIDIC, which give temporary finality. Temporary finality is also usually given to interim payment and other certificates issued by the architect, (see for example, cll 31(13) and 37(3)(h) in this case). However, <span class="font-italic">all </span>these interim disputes, decisions and rulings thereon, are only clothed with <span class="font-italic">temporary</span> finality. That temporary finality <span class="font-italic">ends</span> when they, and any other disputed issues in relation to the contract, are brought before an arbitrator or the courts for a <span class="font-italic">final resolution</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>if the parties are unable to settle their differences. It is invariably the case that the parties may raise any issues they have at this final stage of resolution and any certificates, rulings or decisions by the architect (save for some limited exceptions) can then be “opened up”, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, meaning reviewed, re-examined, tested and re-evaluated, before the arbitrator or the courts for final resolution (<span class="font-italic">Chin Ivan v H P Construction &amp; Engineering Pte Ltd </span>[2015] 3 SLR 124 at [33]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">318 </span>The SIA Conditions also follow this scheme. The arbitration clause, cl 37 is extremely widely worded and detailed. The parties have the right, under cl 37(1)(a) to submit: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Any dispute</span> between the Employer and the Contractor as to any matter <span class="font-italic">arising under or out of or in connection with</span> this Contract or <span class="font-italic">under or out of or in connection with the carrying out of the Works</span> and whether in contract or tort, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">or as to any</span> direction or instruction or <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">certificate</span> of the Architect or as to the contents of or granting <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">or refusal of or reasons for any such</span> direction, instruction or <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">certificate</span> <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">shall be referred to the arbitration and final decision</span> of … [an arbitrator].  </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in italics and bold italics added]      </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Clause 37(2) gives the arbitrator in an appropriate case express powers to rectify the Contract. As cited above (see [314]), cl 37(3) provides that the arbitrator <span class="font-italic">shall not</span>, in making his final award, “<span class="font-italic">be bound by</span> <span class="font-italic">any certificate, </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">refusal of certificate</span><span class="font-italic">, ruling or decision of the Architect</span> under any terms of the Contract, but may disregard the same <span class="font-italic">and substitute his own decision</span> on the basis of the evidence before and facts found by him …” The same principle is set out in cl 31(13), which is the clause dealing with payment to the contractor and interim certificates:   </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">No certificate of the Architect under this Contract shall be final and binding in any dispute between the Employer and the Contractor, whether before an arbitrator or in the Courts … [the clause goes on to provide for temporary finality of interim payment certificates, enforceable by summary judgment but subject to the fraud or improper pressure or interference by any party] … until final judgment or award, as the case may be … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">319 </span>On a plain reading of these provisions, it is clear that the arbitrator or the court is conferred the widest powers to finally decide all issues in dispute between the parties. These provisions make clear that the arbitrator is not bound by any certificate, refusal of certificate, ruling or decision of the Architect and may substitute his own decision therefor. It is true that cl 37 excludes some issues from review or revision by the arbitrator, none of which are relevant to the facts of this case (for example, the inability of an arbitrator to review or revise an EOT given by the architect if the contractor has failed to comply with the condition precedent of giving due notice of a delaying event under cl 23(2) – although whether the contractor <span class="font-italic">has</span> complied with the condition precedent or not <span class="font-italic">is</span> an issue which the arbitrator can decide – or the inability to award claims for dayworks unless the contractor has complied with the condition precedent set out in cl 12(4)(e)). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">320 </span>An argument can be raised on the word “refusal” under cll 37(1)(a) and 37(3) to issue a certificate. The word “refuse” or “refusal” connotes, as a precursor, a request to do or grant something or some obligation to do something. Hence the ordinary meaning of “refuse” or “refusal” is to decline to do so in such circumstances. Mr Chan cannot really be said to have refused to issue a Delay Certificate because Mr Chan took the mistaken view that the works were complete as of 17 April 2013 and that GTMS was entitled to EOTs up to that date. The issue of a Delay Certificate therefore never arose in his mind. Mr Thio SC submits that the word “refusal” in cll 37(1)(a) and 37(3) must include the lesser situation where there was a failure, for whatever reason, to issue a Delay Certificate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">321 </span>As mentioned above, Mr Thio SC also relied on cl 37(3)(h), which provides for the temporary finality effect of certificates; cl 37(3)(h) also provides (see [314] above) that in cases where <span class="font-italic">no ruling or decision</span> has been made <span class="font-italic">or certificate given</span> (or refused) by the architect, the aggrieved party can  apply to an arbitrator to deal with the matter whether in interlocutory proceedings or by way of an Interim Award or in any other way <span class="font-italic">before</span> final award or judgment. Whilst cl 37(3)(h) contains the phrase “no ruling or decision … or certificate given …” it also contains the phrase “or refused”, which detracts somewhat from Mr Thio SC’s submission that “refusal” must include failure to make a decision. Nonetheless, we are of the view that on a true construction, cl 37(3)(h) does support Mr Thio SC’s submission. If a party who is aggrieved by the architect’s failure to rule or decide on an issue or not to issue a certificate, which is of importance to that party, and that party is specifically allowed to proceed to arbitration to deal with the matter in interlocutory proceedings and/or to ask for an Interim Award or in any other way <span class="font-italic">before</span> a final award or judgment, then it must follow that the aggrieved party can also wait to put that in issue when the arbitration is commenced at the end of the project to finally resolve all disputes between the parties. This also accords with the practice of completing the project before starting an arbitration, as is provided for in some construction contracts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">322 </span>As a matter of construction of the SIA Conditions and this Contract therefore, and in particular cl 37, an arbitrator (or the court) at the stage of final resolution of all the disputes between the parties, is entitled to take the view and decide, after considering the evidence and hearing the parties, that a Delay Certificate should have been issued as of a particular date and that will form the basis, together with a finding as to when completion took place, upon which an arbitrator (or the court) is entitled to make an award for liquidated damages accordingly. Clause 24(2) does not contradict this construction because cl 24(2) deals with a different stage of the construction contract where without a Delay Certificate, the employer has <span class="font-italic">no right</span> and is <span class="font-italic">not entitled</span> <span class="font-italic">to start</span> deducting liquidated damages from payments due to the contractor. However, cl 24(2) does not mean that the employer cannot seek relief from an arbitrator or court on the basis that a Delay Certificate should have been issued.

It is settled law that the courts <span class="font-italic">can set aside</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>a<span class="font-italic"> </span>Delay Certificate wrongfully issued by an architect, see <span class="font-italic">Tropicon </span>at [25] (where a Delay Certificate was issued some two and a half years after the Date of Completion) and <span class="font-italic">Lian Soon Construction Pte Ltd v Guan Qian Realty Pte Ltd </span>[1999] 3 SLR(R) 518 at [37] (where the Delay Certificate was issued one year and ten months after completion and the architect’s conduct was also taken into consideration). It must follow, and it is clear, that if an architect took a mistaken view on the date upon which he issued a Delay Certificate, that Delay Certificate could, under cl 37, be corrected or revised by the arbitrator who could substitute his own decision upon receiving the evidence and hearing the parties (see <span class="font-italic">Samsung Corp v Chinese Chamber Realty Pte Ltd and others </span>[2004] 1 SLR(R) 382 at [21], citing <span class="font-italic">Aoki Corp v Lippoland (Singapore) Pte Ltd </span>[1995] 1 SLR(R) 314 at [32]–[33]; see also <span class="font-italic">Liew Ter Kwang v Hurry General Contractor Pte Ltd </span>[2004] 3 SLR(R) 59 at [20]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">324 </span>Having construed the relevant SIA Conditions, we think there is no such gap in the drafting and we hold that where an architect has failed to issue a Delay Certificate when he ought or should have done so, an arbitrator or the court seised with the power to resolve disputes between the parties, can rule or decide that a Delay Certificate should have been issued on a particular date thereby giving rise to liquidated damages and issue an award or entry of a judgment therefor. To hold otherwise would mean that an architect can render a liquidated damages clause inoperable and of no effect simply by his failure to issue a Delay Certificate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">325 </span>We therefore turn to specialist texts to ascertain if there are any compelling countervailing views or considerations for or against such a construction. In <span class="font-italic">Commentary on </span><span class="font-italic">SIA Standard Form</span> at para 37.23, the learned author states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">However, in the situation where the Architect has not issued a certificate, ruling or decision on any matter which, under the terms of the Contract, is required to be dealt with by an Architect’s certificate, Clause 37(3)(h) provides that the arbitrator may, on the Contractor’s application, deal with this by way of interlocutory proceedings or an interim award. For example, the Contractor may raise before an arbitrator a complaint that the Architect should have issued a completion certificate pursuant to Clause 24(4) or ought to have granted an extension of time in respect of a particular delay event.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">We agree, and in so saying, it is clear that cl 37(3)(h) is equally applicable to an employer in proceedings which are not interlocutory; the learned author was just giving an example and cl 37(3)(h) does not limit the remedies available to the contractor.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">326 </span>There are also statements from other specialist texts to the effect that the presence of an arbitration clause (in our case, cl 37(3) of the SIA Conditions), which provides for a review of the architect’s decision, implies that the arbitrator himself can supply the certificate. I. N. Duncan Wallace, <span class="font-italic">Construction Contracts: Principles and Policies in Tort and Contract </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 1986) sets out a historical perspective on the “open up, review and revise” wording introduced into arbitration clauses within building and construction contracts at para 17-11 where he recounts that “the principal early method of avoiding finality was to introduce an arbitration clause into the contract.” At para 17-12, the learned author notes that short form arbitration clauses were met with the many references to the opinion or judgment of the architect in the contract in an effort to argue that the arbitrator was bound by such decisions. Although these failed in two cases mentioned below (see [327] below), the learned author stated:   </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… It was anticipation of this, it may be surmised, which at the end of the nineteenth century produced the “open up review and revise” wording in the RIBA standard form arbitration clause, which was also adopted in the civil engineering standard forms, and has remained in both cases identical to the present day. … That wording, which it is desirable to set out in full, confers power on the arbitrator “<span class="font-italic">to </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">open up, review and revise</span><span class="font-italic"> any certificate, opinion, decision, requisition or notice</span>, save in regard to the matter expressly excepted, and <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">to determine all matters</span><span class="font-italic"> in dispute … in the same manner </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">as if no such certificate, opinion, decision, requisition or notice had been given</span>.”</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in italics and bold italics added]  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">327 </span>As pithily stated in <span class="font-italic">Hudson</span> (at paras 4-022 and 4-029), “the existence of an arbitration clause will normally mean that the absence of a certificate can be remedied”.

However, we depart from the decision for the following reasons: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Judge Westbrook SC’s decision was premised on his concern that the court is being asked, essentially, to exercise the architect’s power, which appears incongruous with the fact that the power of certification is something which is contractually conferred onto the architect alone. However, this concern is directly addressed by the plain text of cl 37(3) of the SIA Conditions, which expressly provides that the arbitrator is empowered to “<span class="font-italic">substitute his own decision</span> on the basis of the evidence before and facts found by him and in accordance with the true meaning and the terms of the Contract” [emphasis added].</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Judge Westbrook SC further pointed out that it was odd for the employer to sue the contractor for something that the architect, <span class="font-italic">as the employer’s agent</span>, failed to do. With respect, this overlooks the architect’s dual role and function in a construction contract like the SIA Conditions. As mentioned above, in addition to acting as the employer’s agent under cl 1.1(2), cl 1.1(10)(a) provides that the architect <span class="font-italic">also acts</span> as a certifier and is duty bound to the employer and the contractor to do so fairly and impartially; further the MOA expressly provides that the employer shall not interfere in the architect’s certification duties. When acting as the certifier, the architect is <span class="font-italic">not </span>acting as agent of the employer. Whilst the architect may be liable to the employer for any breaches of his contractual or tortious duties owed to the employer, this does not change the fact that if the contractor is in delay, the architect should, acting as a certifier under the contract, issue a Delay Certificate, thereby triggering the right of the employer to liquidated damages.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The arbitration clause that Judge Westbrook SC construed is set out in his judgment at [137] and although it may not be the clause in its entirety, we set out the same as it appears in the judgment for completeness:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(1) Provided always that <span class="font-italic">in case </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">any dispute or difference shall arise</span> between the Employer or the architect on his behalf and the main contractor … <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">as to any matter or thing of whatsoever nature arising thereunder or in connection therewith (including</span> <span class="font-italic">any matter or thing left by this Contract to the discretion of the architect </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">or the withholding by the architect of any certificate to which the main contractor may claim to be entitled</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>…) then such dispute or difference shall be and is hereby referred to the arbitration and final decision of a person to be agreed between the parties …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) Subject to the provisions of cls.2(2) and 30(7) of these Conditions, the Arbitrator shall, without prejudice to the generality of his powers, <span class="font-italic">have power to … ascertain and award any sum which ought to have been the subject of or included in any certificate and </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">to open up, review and revise any certificate, opinion, decision, requirement or notice</span><span class="font-italic"> and to determine all matters in dispute which shall be submitted to him </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">in the </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">same manner as if no such certificate, opinion, decision requirement or notice had been given</span><span class="font-weight-bold">.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in italics and bold italics added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">330 </span>Whilst we agree that any construction dispute has to be decided on the terms and conditions of the relevant contract (and we have not had the benefit of seeing the full contract provisions in <span class="font-italic">W Hing</span>), we pause nonetheless to point out the similarity of the arbitration clause as it is reported in <span class="font-italic">W H</span><span class="font-italic">ing </span>with cl 37(3). As a matter of general principle, we cannot, with respect, agree with the reasons set out in <span class="font-italic">W Hing </span>in relation to the personal function of certification bestowed on an architect and from which he cannot be displaced. Where a construction contract has a general scheme of temporary finality of decisions or rulings of an architect subject to a final resolution of all matters before an arbitrator (or the court), and if the architect fails to issue a certificate or make a ruling when he ought to have done so under the contract, an arbitrator or the court seised with that issue must be able to remedy that omission. This is clear from the provisions as set out at [329(c)]: “…or the withholding by the architect of any certificate to which the main contractor may claim to be entitled …”. That being said, although we have noted at [329(b)] above that an architect who fails to issue a Delay Certificate may be liable to the owner for any breaches of his contractual or tortious duties owned to the owner, it is not always satisfactory to say that an owner may claim against an architect for his failure to issue a Delay Certificate. First, the level of damages may be beyond the ability of the architect to pay or above the limit of the architect’s professional indemnity insurance. Secondly, this would be an onerous burden on architects if the employer has no recourse to the contractor who should be primarily responsible for delay.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">331 </span>We add that since the arbitrator or court may find a contractor liable for delay notwithstanding the absence of a Delay Certificate, it may also decide when the delay ends in the absence of a Termination of Delay Certificate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">332 </span>In summary, we are of the view that cll 37(3) and 37(4) of the SIA Conditions, read together, empowers the court to disregard the absence of a Delay Certificate. The arbitrator or court, as the final arbiter of all the disputes between the parties in this case, is entitled to find and hold that Mr Chan should or ought to have issued the Delay Certificate under cl 24(2) certifying that the Works ought to have been completed by 17 April 2013. Liquidated damages therefore started running from 18 April 2013. Mr Chan should then have issued the Termination of Delay Certificate on 28 May 2013 and the CC on 16 September 2013 when the bungalows obtained the TOP. It follows that GTMS is liable to pay Mr Ser liquidated damages from 18 April 2013 to 28 May 2013 and this amounts to $147,600 (41 days x $3,600) together with interest thereon from the date of the writ. Mr Ser is therefore entitled, as against GTMS, to deduct the sum of $147,600 (together with interest thereon from the date of the writ) from the $1,103,915.48 due under the Payment Certificates.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">333 </span>Aside from the contractual provisions, we do not think it is incongruous for an arbitrator or court to be empowered to act in the circumstances mentioned. If it can vary an architect’s decision on the period of delay even though that is in the province of an architect to decide, there is no reason why it cannot act when no Delay Certificate or Termination of Delay Certificate is issued. The idea must be to allow the arbitrator or court to review an architect’s decision, unless there is good reason otherwise.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">As between Mr Ser and Mr Chan</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Liability for negligence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">334 </span>There is no dispute that Mr Chan, as the project architect under this Contract, owed Mr Ser contractual obligations under the MOA and a duty of care in tort in the performance of his functions and contractual duties. Mr Chan, as a practising architect, in common with all professionals, will (unless exceptionally, it is provided to the contrary in his contract of engagement), be under an implied duty to carry out his services and functions with the skill and care reasonably to be expected of competent members of the profession they belong to. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">335 </span>There can be little doubt that one of the core standards of care and skill of an architect is that he should know the salient and more important provisions of the contract he is supervising and administering and carrying out certification functions. There may well be complex or unexpected questions of law or law applied to facts of a construction contract which an architect cannot be faulted for not appreciating. It is one thing to fail to appreciate that there is a complex latent legal issue within some provisions; it is quite another not to even know what is in the contract. An architect is expected to know the terms and conditions on which the contract is entered into, the specifications in the contract, the drawings (including any notes thereon and those drawings issued by allied professionals in connection with the building project) and the bills of quantities. These provisions involve the very core of the architect’s expected competencies and form an integral part of his special knowledge and skill that he professes to possess as an architect. In particular, (since Mr Chan attempted, albeit rather tentatively, to suggest that that he expected F+G, advise him on the “legal” aspects of the relevant contract provisions to enable him to carry out his administrative and certifying duties), the architect should be familiar, within the bounds of reasonableness in relation to specialist areas, with the matters stated above. Architects should disabuse themselves of the notion that it is the duty of allied professionals to carry out any of the architect’s duties under a construction contract like the SIA Conditions. For example, it cannot be an answer for an architect not to know the contents of the specifications because it was put together by the quantity surveyor. Again, the quantity surveyor may well be there to carry out an evaluation of a contractor’s submission for interim payment and arrive at a valuation of a payment due to the contractor but it is incumbent on the architect to exercise his own judgment, after due checking of the quantity surveyor’s evaluation and calling for substantiation if the architect has any doubts on any items before issuing the interim certificate of payment. If there are any areas of doubt and they involve other allied professional disciplines, for example in specialised areas like structural or geotechnical engineering, it is incumbent on the architect to proactively raise this with those allied professionals. If it were otherwise, we cannot see how the architect will be able to competently carry out his duties, including the important function of certification, under the SIA Conditions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">336 </span>On appeal, Mr Ser’s focus is on:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Mr Chan’s premature grant of the CC with effect from 17 April 2013;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) wrongful grants of EOT 2 and EOT 3;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) premature issue of the MC;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) wrongful certification in IC 25, IC 26, the FC and wrongful release of retention monies; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Mr Chan’s supervision of GTMS.

</div> Mr Chan can have no excuse for not having read the Contract. His professional behaviour in doing so was reckless and if Mr Chan issued certificates, like the CC, without having read the contract, then he was clearly certifying matters under the SIA Conditions recklessly, without caring whether it was true or false. We find that Mr Chan was grossly negligent in failing to read the Contract he was administering, and under which he had certification functions. Mr Chan was grossly negligent in not being aware of the existence of an important provision like Item 72 in carrying out his supervision and certification duties. As we shall examine and conclude below, Mr Chan was grossly negligent in carrying out his certification duties, not only in relation to the issue of the CC, but to subsequent events for which he can have no excuse as they involved the standard conditions of the SIA Conditions; Mr Chan should have been familiar with these provisions, as they were in a standard form contract drafted in 1979 under the auspices of his own professional body, the SIA. His concession of not being aware of Item 72 until this suit was brought is fatal to any defence that he honestly and in good faith believed that there was no delay. There was absolutely no basis for such a view. We note Mr Chan admitted under cross-examination that he had not done his job as an architect “[i]n this aspect” by “not reading prelim 72”.

There was no question that the non-compliant items of the constructed bungalows, involving very basic safety issues, <span class="font-italic">had</span> to be rectified before the bungalows could be said to be completed and handed over to Mr Ser. It is of significance that in Mr Chan’s own application to the BCA for the TOP Inspection on 23 April 2013, one of the boxes he had to tick off contained the reminder: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">NO OCCUPATION OF BUILDING  </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The building must not be occupied before a TOP/CSC has been issued as provided for under Section 12(1) of the Act.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">There could have been no basis whatsoever to issue the CC under cl 24(4) in the circumstances of this case as the Works were clearly not compliant with the Contract in all respects, as they were not compliant with the Building Control provisions and regulations in relation to safety. Clause 2.1 of the MOA covers the five stages of the “Basic Services” provided by the architect to the client; cl 2.(5)(a), which deals with the “Final Completion” stage of the contract construction, provides:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Doing such work as may be required on behalf of the Client and instructing the building contractor <span class="font-italic">to carry out such work as may be required to comply with all requirements of the relevant authorities</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">There is no dispute that Mr Chan was aware that the steps and risers needed rectification on 17 April 2013.

We agree with the Judge below that Mr Chan was wrong to do so.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">343 </span>Since there were no outstanding applications by GTMS for further Extensions of Time beyond 17 April 2013, once that date had passed, Mr Chan should have issued or considered issuing a Delay Certificate certifying that GTMS was in delay as of 18 April 2013. But Mr Chan failed to do so. This was not a case where Mr Chan had a reason to delay issuing the Delay Certificate. Mr Chan states in his AEIC that GTMS was not in delay and he did not see any reason to certify liquidated damages.

</div> We find it inexplicable that Mr Chan, knowing of all the issues in the tread and risers in all the staircases, would think that the BCA inspectors would overlook this basic safety issue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">344 </span>Following the First TOP Inspection, Mr Chan failed to properly assess the reasons for the failure and to fairly attribute the reasons for the failure to the relevant parties, including himself, and to assess the relative time taken for rectification of each item. We are drawn to the ineluctable conclusion that he did so as a matter of self-preservation. We find that his issuing of the AI No. 34 and AI No. 39 with the dates 26 August 2013 and 23 September 2013 respectively, is completely inconsistent with the facts, (see <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, Ms Wan’s email of 15 May 2013 at [148] and also [346] below). Mr Chan <span class="font-italic">must have known</span> the insertion of those dates, representing dates when the AIs were issued, were false and misleading as the request or instructions to GTMS in respect of these two items were given much earlier. This is clearly reflected in Ms Wan’s 15 May 2013 email after the First TOP Inspection where, in addition to writing what rectification was going to be done, she clearly stated: “We are still waiting for GTMS to submit rectification works schedules for the re-inspection.”,

</div>
</div> <span class="font-italic">ie </span>since this email was sent on 15 May 2013, which is before the dates of 26 August 2013 and 23 September 2013, CSYA must have asked GTMS to rectify these items <span class="font-italic">before </span>the dates of 26 August 2013 and 23 September 2013. We have examined at length (from [146]–[176] above), the reasons for the bungalows’ failing the First TOP Inspection and the parties responsible therefor. That assessment was clearly required of Mr Chan under the SIA Conditions; it should have been, but was not, done. That assessment would have triggered the issue of various certificates under the SIA Conditions. We find it hard to believe that Mr Chan was unaware of cl 24 and was unaware that he bore the responsibility for the delays caused by his errors and omissions. There were clearly serious basic contractual principles, rights and obligations that were completely ignored by Mr Chan in his duties of supervision and certification following upon that First TOP Inspection. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">345 </span>It bears repeating that GTMS was responsible for three out of the five non-compliant items (the Steps and Risers, the Parapet Walls at the Roof and the Gap issues). As explained above, we have accepted the Judge’s finding that these non-compliant items would have been rectified by 28 May 2013. On the other hand, Mr Chan was responsible, due to his negligence and design errors for the two important safety lapses: first, the absence of a railing at the landscaped area to prevent persons from falling over a drop of 1 meter or more (the Landscape Railings issue, see [148(b)] above), and secondly the Parapet Walls at the Pavilion issue (see [148(c)(ii)] above). It is not in dispute that <span class="font-italic">both</span> these lapses <span class="font-italic">had</span> to be rectified and were rectified by GTMS in accordance with Mr Chan’s instructions or requests; GTMS did not rectify these items on their own volition. However, unfortunately, because of the way the parties ran their respective cases, there are no specific findings by the Judge as to how Mr Chan asked or told GTMS to rectify these two items.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">346 </span>In Ms Wan’s email of 15 May 2013 (see [148] above), Ms Wan euphemistically states that GTMS “was asked to add steel railings” to remedy the Landscape Railings omission. In our view, on balance, and unless GTMS agreed to do this gratis and without any EOT, they were entitled to an EOT pursuant to an AI that should have been issued. As referenced above, such an AI, AI No. 39, was issued, but it was dated 23 September 2013, seven days <span class="font-italic">after</span> TOP was attained. We also know that this was rectified by the Second TOP Inspection. This request to carry out additional work during a period of delay was exactly the kind of situation catered for under cl 24(3) to ensure an act of prevention did not occur and invalidate the right to impose liquidated damages. The time taken for Mr Chan to issue a drawing, for GTMS to fabricate and then install the railing had to be set against the overall delay by GTMS that was continuing to run as of 30 April 2013 to 28 May 2013. In such a situation, as mentioned above, Mr Chan should have issued a Termination of Delay Certificate to GTMS from the date that Mr Chan “asked” GTMS to remedy his own error and/or omission to provide for this railing. LD would then have stopped accruing against GTMS.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">347 </span>As for the Parapet Walls at the Pavilion issue, there was again no specific findings on an equivalent analysis as set out in the foregoing paragraph. What evidence there is indicates that Mr Chan asked GTMS, first to install invisible grilles in an effort to comply with the BCA’s directions. This is evidenced in Ms Wan’s email of 15 May 2013 (see [148] above), where it is noted that GTMS were asked by CSYA to add an invisible grille at the Unit 12A pavilion at the area above the built-in concrete bench. There is no finding on, for example, the date when that request was made, in what form it was made or when the invisible grille was installed (see also [162(d)(vi)] above). This initial remedial action was rejected by the BCA on 19 July 2013. It appears that Mr Chan asked or instructed GTMS to measure and install a taller glass barrier on 1 August 2013. AI No. 34 was issued on 26 August 2013 and the taller glass barrier was installed on 30 August 2013. BCA approval therefor was given on 6 September 2013, after which Mr Chan wrote in for another TOP Inspection. Given this state of affairs, we are in no position to make findings on the relevant dates so as to conclude exactly <span class="font-italic">when</span> a Termination of Delay Certificate should have been issued for this item (though, as we have previously stated at [173(b)] above, we are of the view that the Parapet Walls at the Pavilion issue would have been the basis for the issue of a Termination of Delay Certificate) and whether any Further Delay Certificate should have been issued. However it is clear that Mr Chan “ordered” additional works by the installation of the invisible grille, then had GTMS dismantle and remove the same and thereafter issued an AI to install a taller glass barrier first within the period of GTMS’s delay from 18 April to 28 May 2013, and then beyond that period from 29 May 2013 to at least 30 August 2013.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">348 </span>We have our grave doubts whether these clear omissions by Mr Chan to properly assess the position under the SIA Conditions <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> Mr Ser and GTMS were mere carelessness. If Mr Chan had acted as he should have, in fulfilment of his certification duties, it may well be that GTMS would not have been liable for much liquidated damages given that Mr Chan’s errors and omissions in design overlapped with GTMS’s delays and properly issued AIs would have reduced the liquidated damages payable by GTMS and by the same token exposed Mr Chan to an action in negligence by Mr Ser. Mr Chan’s most egregious failure was his turning a blind eye to the causes of delay that were attributable to his own negligent design or omissions which caused the bungalows to fail the TOP Inspections and the reasons therefor and his failure to do his duty under the SIA Conditions as well as his obligations owed to Mr Ser in contract and in tort. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">349 </span>The position we therefore reach is that based on the facts as found by the Judge, Mr Chan should have:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) issued a Delay Certificate, certifying GTMS was in delay as of 18 April 2013;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) issued a Termination of Delay Certificate on 28 May 2013 as GTMS had completed rectification of defects caused by them;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the CC ought to have been issued on or with effect from 16 September 2013, the date when TOP was obtained. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) We have found and held above that the non-provision of test certificates, the operating manuals and the warranties did not prevent the fulfilment of Item 72(b) of the Preliminaries. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) We are also satisfied that Mr Ser’s refusal to take over the bungalows until 21 July 2014 was, as found by the Judge, unreasonable and could not be justified. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) We find that on the evidence Mr Ser could have taken over the bungalows on or shortly after 16 September 2013 – under cross-examination, he accepted that TOP was obtained on 16 September 2013 (though he insisted that the issues arising from the First TOP Inspection had not been rectified by then, contrary to his earlier position in the summary judgment application).

But, like the Judge below, we are constrained by how the parties chose to plead and run their cases below and before us. Consequently, there is no evidence, let alone exploration of relevant evidence upon which we can say when the Termination of Delay Certificate should have been issued any more than we can find when and how Mr Chan requested GTMS to carry out the rectification works to remedy Mr Chan’s own errors and omissions in his design. However, what we can say, with confidence, is that the purported issuing of AI No. 34 and AI No. 39 by Mr Chan was at best negligent and at worst dishonest. It appears to us that on the whole, Mr Chan was attempting to shield himself from the consequences of his own errors and omission and was done in clear and flagrant breach of his duties and certifying functions under the Contract.     </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">351 </span>We now turn to Mr Ser’s claim against Mr Chan.

However, the Judge only awarded Mr Ser nominal damages. The Judge rejected Mr Ser’s argument that Mr Chan’s negligent certification of contract completion prevented Mr Ser from claiming liquidated damages. The Judge reasoned that the liquidated damages clause was part of the Contract between <span class="font-italic">Mr Ser, as owner of the Project,</span><span class="font-italic"> and GTMS, as contractor for the Project</span>. To that extent, any claim in liquidated damages can only be pursued against GTMS, and not Mr Chan himself (Judgment at [697]). With respect, we do not wholly agree with the learned Judge’s analysis and conclusions on this. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">353 </span>If GTMS failed to complete the Works by the extended Completion Date, due to reasons attributable to GTMS, then it must follow that they are in delay. But for the failure of Mr Chan to issue the Delay Certificate, liquidated damages would have started to accrue and Mr Ser would have been entitled to deduct those liquidated damages from any monies due to GTMS under the Contract. For the reasons set out above, we have awarded Mr Ser liquidated damages against GTMS from 18 April 2013 to 28 May 2013. IC 25 was issued on 3 September 2013 for some $390,000 and Mr Ser could have deducted the liquidated damages of $147,600 therefrom. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">354 </span>Apart from the pleadings, the real question on this issue is whether Mr Ser has suffered any loss as a result of this omission by Mr Chan to issue a Delay Certificate. Although a claim for liquidated damages is separate in nature and quite different from a claim against an architect for breach of contract or tort for not issuing a Delay Certificate, a claim against a contractor for liquidated damages (when properly certified) and a claim for damages against the architect for breach of contract and duty in not issuing a Delay Certificate can intersect when, for example, the employer cannot recover those liquidated damages from the contractor because of the contractor’s intervening insolvency. In such an event, the employer’s loss and damage will (subject to the facts of each case) include the liquidated damages he could not deduct from the interim or final payments, which is now beyond his reach due to the contractor’s subsequent insolvency. As matters stand before us, there is a sum owing to GTMS by Mr Ser under IC 25, IC 26 and the FC (subject to a deduction in respect of the rectification of applying the two-hour rated intumescent paint on all sides of the steel beams), and the liquidated damages as ascertained by this court can be set off against that sum. No loss has as yet arisen unlike the aforesaid hypothetical situation posed. Further, we note that this sum has not been paid by Mr Ser because there was a consent order for a stay of execution pending appeal.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">355 </span>We agree with the Judge that a liquidated damages claim against GTMS is based on the contract between GTMS and Mr Ser (Judgment at [697]). It is a contractually agreed pre-estimate of the loss Mr Ser would suffer for each day of delay caused by GTMS. Mr Ser cannot, without more, transplant that agreed pre-estimate of the loss from his contract with GTMS to his contract with Mr Chan. There is no liquidated damages clause in the MOA or provision agreeing to that agreed pre-estimate of loss per day of delay as between Mr Chan and Mr Ser.

</div>
</div>
</div> This argument must fail for two reasons. First (save for an exception like the hypothetical given in [354] of intervening insolvency of a contractor), there is no true joint and several liability for this sum because the basis of assessment and recovery of this sum rests on very different legal principles. In the case of GTMS, it is founded on a specific contractual liquidated damages clause and in the case of Mr Chan, it is founded on a breach of a different contract and/or tort where damages are not derived from a calculation based on a pre-agreed estimate of the loss but on principles upon which damages for a breach of contract and/or damages n tort are assessed. Damages for any delay caused by Mr Chan, unlike damages for any delay caused by GTMS, simply cannot be assessed on the basis of the liquidated damages clause that is in the Contract (between GTMS and Mr Ser), as the MOA (between CSYA and Mr Ser) is a different kind of contract and importantly, without any liquidated damages clause. Secondly, there can be no true joint and several liability where the injury caused is divisible, <span class="font-italic">ie </span>it is possible to attribute different parts of the injury to different causes. Three possible permutations for liability will illustrate this. (a) For the reasons set out above, GTMS is responsible for delays from 18 April 2013 (the date when the Delay Certificate ought to have been issued) to 30 April 2013 (the date of the First TOP Inspection); for this period Mr Chan is not liable. (b) For the period from 30 April 2013 to 28 May 2013 (when GTMS completed its rectification works), depending on findings that might have been made, both GTMS and Mr Chan may be liable as GTMS was responsible for defective construction work which had to be rectified and Mr Chan was responsible for the Landscape Railings Issue and the Parapet Walls at the Pavilion Issue as Mr Chan asked for rectification work to be put in hand for his errors and omissions. On that basis, this would be a case of concurrent delays. GTMS will be relieved of liability for liquidated damages as it was entitled to an EOT for these additional works during a period of concurrent delay and Mr Chan should have issued a Termination of Delay Certificate from the time he asked GTMS to carry out rectification works in relation to his, <span class="font-italic">ie </span>Mr Chan’s, errors and omissions. (c) On the facts as found in this case, after 28 May 2013, all delays up to 16 September 2013 (TOP) would be the liability of Mr Chan. In the above permutations, GTMS is responsible for (a) and Mr Chan is responsible for (b) and (c). It therefore could not be said that GTMS and Mr Chan have caused the same and indivisible damage to Mr Ser (<span class="font-italic">Crest Capital Asia Pte Ltd and others v OUE Lippo Healthcare Ltd (formerly known as International Healthway Corp Ltd) and another and other appeals </span>[2021] 1 SLR 1337 at [178]–[183]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">356 </span>Nonetheless, in his claim for professional negligence against Mr Chan, Mr Ser is entitled to claim, and prove, any loss and damage he sustained as a result of Mr Chan’s breach of contract and breach of duty. As for the tortious requirement of suffering damage, there can be no doubt that Mr Ser has suffered damage as a result of Mr Ser’s negligence. Mr Ser has spent a large sum of money constructing three good class bungalows, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, a relatively small number of top category bungalows, found only within prestigious areas designated by the Urban Renewal Authority and which must have special characteristics, including a minimum land area of 1,400 square meters or 15,070 square feet. Mr Ser was entitled to have them completed within a certain time period under the SIA Conditions. As referenced above, there were delays in obtaining TOP and Mr Chan was responsible for that part of the delay. It did not matter whether Mr Ser intended to use the bungalows for himself or his family or otherwise or to rent them out. He must have suffered some loss and/or damage as a result of these delays. The problem for Mr Ser is how he pleaded his claims for damages against Mr Chan.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">357 </span>Mr Ser has claimed, but has not given any evidence of, loss or damage as a result of the premature issue of the MC, the premature release of the moieties of retention monies nor of the incorrect certification of the maintenance or defects liability period. This has not been addressed on appeal. We have partially touched upon those issues above but as Mr Ser has not been able to prove any loss or damage arising from these matters, we need make no awards on these claims. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">358 </span>It is convenient at this juncture to deal with Mr Singh’s statement before us that Mr Ser has not dropped his claim for loss and damage due to his inability to rent out any of the bungalows.

</div>
</div> There was no re-examination or retraction of this withdrawal then. During the course of the third tranche of the trial, after Mr Ser had been extensively cross-examined in the earlier tranche, Mr Ser attempted to amend his Further and Better Particulars to re-introduce his claim for loss of rental revenue. This was roundly, and we might add rightly, rejected by the Judge: see Judgment at [729]–[748]. In our judgment, Mr Ser cannot resurrect this claim before us.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">359 </span>As noted above, Mr Ser has not pleaded any other alternative general or special damages suffered as a result of Mr Chan’s breaches of contract and grossly negligent acts. This trial was not bifurcated. The Judge was therefore correct in awarding Mr Ser nominal damages of $1,000. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">Costs of the summary judgment proceeding</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">360 </span>For completeness, Mr Ser also claims against Mr Chan out-of-pocket expenses for the summary judgment application, appeals and related interlocutory proceedings (see [3] above), quantified at some $649,082.63 (Judgment at [718]). This sum was the balance he had allegedly incurred after recovering costs from GTMS. Mr Ser’s argument appears to be that but for Mr Chan’s negligent certification, Mr Ser would not have had to defend himself against GTMS’s claims in the summary judgment proceedings.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">361 </span>We find this argument without merit. First, we agree with the Judge that having failed to plead this claim for costs of the summary judgment proceedings, no recovery can be allowed for Mr Ser (Judgment at [719]). Mr Ser claims that there is no prejudice to Mr Chan because Mr Chan had the opportunity to address this claim. We think it does not lie in Mr Ser’s mouth to now say that there is no prejudice, considering that the claim for costs of the summary judgment proceedings was not added to his consolidated Defence and Counterclaim, even after <span class="font-italic">three </span>rounds of amendments. Secondly, the summary judgment application concerned IC 25, IC 26 and FC. However, we have found the sums certified under these Payment Certificates to be largely correct (see [301] above). The only certificate tainted with negligence is the CC. Thirdly, we have concerns with <span class="font-italic">remoteness </span>– it is not readily apparent to us that the claim for costs of the summary judgment proceedings would be costs within the reasonable contemplation of either Mr Ser or Mr Chan, either as a matter of tort (see <span class="font-italic">Overseas Tankship (UK) Ltd v Morts Dock &amp; Engineering Co Ltd (The Wagon Mound)</span> [1961] AC 388) or contract (see <span class="font-italic">Hadley v Baxendale </span>(1854) 156 ER 145).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">362 </span>For completeness, Mr Chan argues that the claim for costs should not be allowed because the CA had had an opportunity to consider the costs of the summary judgment proceedings, and chose not to order costs against him.

The Judge placed significance on three factors (Costs Judgment at [16]–[19]): (a) Mr Ser indulged in speculative claims and allegations that were completely without basis; (b) the claims made by Mr Ser were highly unreasonable and exaggerated; and (c) in the course of the trial, Mr Ser raised new evidence and new allegations that had not been set out in his pleadings or in his AEICs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">365 </span>On the first factor, Mr Ser argues that his allegations of fraud and bribery which the Judge criticised were responses to questions asked of him by Mr Chan’s counsel.

It is <span class="font-underline">GTMS/</span><span class="font-underline">CSY</span> [the latter being Mr Chan’s firm] who changed their case at trial. Mr Dennis Tan [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, GTMS’s director] originally asserted that only the gas pipe sleeve was damaged – <span class="font-underline">not the gas pipe</span>. GTMS further claimed in their pleadings not to know of any requirement to replace the gas pipe. CSY aligned himself with GTMS in his pleadings. It was only after Mr Tan admitted on 14 November 2018 that the photographs he had earlier sent CCA were not photographs of the punctured pipe and therefore did not prove rectification, that he asserted that he had nevertheless complied with <span class="font-weight-bold">ED 1 </span><span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-weight-bold">, the engineer’s directions requiring the gas pipe </span><span class="font-weight-bold">to be rectified]</span> and that there was no basis to SKK’s concerns of a leak. SKK had been prepared to proceed with his claim on the basis that GTMS failed to produce satisfactory evidence to prove rectification, but Tan J seemed dissatisfied that there was no objective evidence as to whether or not the pipe was repaired. Hence, SKK decided to break the ground and expose the pipes to settle the issue once and for all. This is why SKK applied to introduce the video evidence ‘late’, after trial had commenced. This new evidence proved conclusively that GTMS did not replace the pipe sleeve as they claimed. It also disproved their earlier claim that the gas pipe itself was intact. It was only after this video was produced that GTMS and CSYA [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Firm]<span class="font-italic"> </span>finally admitted on 28 and 29 November 2018 respectively that the gas pipe was punctured and the evidence which Tan J relied on at [the Judgment at] [407] emerged in the course of trial on 29 November 2018.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in bold]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">370 </span>Mr Ser’s position appears to be as follows.

Therefore, as there was no evidence of problems with the <span class="font-italic">gas pipe itself</span>, Mr Ser found it necessary to get evidence pertaining to the <span class="font-italic">gas pipe</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>by himself.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">371 </span>We consider Mr Ser to have mischaracterised GTMS’s position. Mr Ser assumes that by asserting that ED 1 was complied with, GTMS must be taken to have impliedly accepted that there were defects with the <span class="font-italic">gas pipe</span> itself. This is wrong. GTMS’s director had explained in cross-examination that ED 1 was satisfied <span class="font-italic">not because there were defects with the gas pipe which were rectified</span>; rather, <span class="font-italic">there were no faults with the gas pipe to begin with, but only the gas pipe sleeve, and therefore ED 1 was erroneously issued</span>.

</div> Again, Mr Ser cannot seek to foist the blame for his actions onto the opposing parties (see [365] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">374 </span>In sum, the reasons offered by Mr Ser to resist the order for costs on an indemnity basis are unconvincing.

This letter offered that the Suit be settled on the basis that parties shall bear their own costs of the Suit, and Mr Chan shall pay Mr Ser’s out-of-pocket expenses for the summary judgment proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The second was a Calderbank letter dated 5 July 2019, which provided that Mr Chan shall pay Mr Ser up to $100,000, and the parties were to bear their own costs for the Suit and HC/S 875/2015 (which was a related suit eventually consolidated with the Suit). Further, should Mr Chan accept this offer after 19 July 2019, Mr Ser was to bear Mr Chan’s costs in relation to the Suit and HC/S 875/2015 on a standard basis up till 19 July 2019, and on an indemnity basis from 20 July 2019 up till the date of acceptance of the offer.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">376 </span>The Judge reasoned that while both offers to settle were not made in accordance with O 22A of the Rules of Court (2014 Rev Ed) (“Rules of Court”) since they were not made in accordance with Form 33 of Appendix A to the Rules of Court (Costs Judgment at [21]), and thus did not fall under the statutory regime of offers to settle, they nevertheless should be taken into account by the court in awarding costs. The Judge also found that both offers to settle were more favourable to Mr Ser than what he eventually received. On that basis, the Judge ordered Mr Ser to pay Mr Chan costs on a standard basis from 29 January 2014 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the date of the third-party notice to join Mr Chan and CSYA to the Suit) up until 6 March 2017 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the deadline for Mr Ser to accept the open offer to settle), with costs payable on an indemnity basis thereafter (Costs Judgment at [24]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">377 </span>We agree with the Judge that Mr Chan’s offers to settle, while not compliant with O 22A of the Rules of Court, may nevertheless be considered in ordering costs. The Judge’s costs order proceeded on the premise that the two offers are more favourable to Mr Ser than what he ultimately received. This conclusion has not been altered by this appeal. The Judge’s orders in relation to costs at [376] above stand.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">378 </span>Our conclusions and findings, and the reasons therefor, are set out above; in gist, they may be summarised as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) On Issue 1, both EOT 2 and EOT 3 were correctly granted, such that the extended completion date is 17 April 2013 (see [114] above).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) On Issue 2, Mr Chan had prematurely and wrongly issued the CC on 15 May 2013, when Item 72(a) of the Preliminaries was not satisfied. It is therefore set aside and of no effect. In the absence of any other evidence and taking the earliest possible date, we hold that the CC should have been issued was on 16 September 2013, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> the date that the TOP was obtained (see [270] above).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) On Issue 3, the Payment Certificates were validly issued and the judgment entered in respect of the Payment Certificates at $1,103,915.48 stands (see [301] above), save that:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) Mr Ser is entitled, as against GTMS, to deduct $147,600 together with interest thereon from the date of the writ in respect of liquidated damages computed at $3,600 per day from 18 April 2013 to 28 May 2013 (a period of 41 days) from the $1,103,915.48 due under the Payment Certificates (see [332] above).</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) Mr Ser is entitled to deduct the sum of $21,048 together with interest thereon from the date of the writ as against GTMS, in respect of its failure to paint all four sides of the steel beams supporting the trellis (see [229] above). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) On Issue 4:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) <span class="font-weight-bold">Remedies between Mr Ser and GTMS: </span>There being no outstanding applications for EOT and no other reasons not to do so, Mr Chan should have issued a Delay Certificate under cl 24(1) of the SIA Conditions. Liquidated damages against GTMS therefore commenced running from 18 April 2013 until 28 May 2013, when GTMS completed its rectification of non-compliant items of work after the First TOP Inspection, whereupon Mr Chan ought to and should have issued a Termination of Delay Certificate under cl 24(3)(a) as all further delays thereafter were not due to or caused by GTMS (see [332] above).</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) <span class="font-weight-bold">Remedies between Mr Ser and Mr Chan:</span></div><div class="Judg-4 mb-3 text-justify">(A) Mr Ser’s appeals in respect of the wrongful grants of EOT 2 and EOT 3 (see [337] above), the issuance of the Payment Certificates (see [338] above), and the Judge’s exoneration of Mr Chan’s supervision of GTMS (see [339] above) are dismissed, save for the issue of the intumescent paint, in respect of which we hold that Mr Chan is liable to Mr Ser for $42,096, together with interest thereon from the date of the writ (see [229], [302] above).</div><div class="Judg-4 mb-3 text-justify">(B) Mr Chan should have issued a Delay Certificate pursuant to cl 24(1), as of 18 April 2013 to certify GTMS was in delay as of 18 April 2013, and issued a Termination of Delay Certificate pursuant to cl 24(3)(a) on 28 May 2013 as GTMS had completed its rectification of defects caused by GTMS (see [349] above). The delay in obtaining the TOP from 29 May 2013 to 16 September 2013 was due to errors and omissions in design committed by Mr Chan (see [174] above).</div><div class="Judg-4 mb-3 text-justify">(C) However, Mr Ser has not shown that he suffered any other loss as a result of Mr Chan’s omission to issue a Delay Certificate. As matters stand, there is a sum owing to GTMS by Mr Ser under the Payment Certificates (subject to a deduction in respect of the intumescent paint issue as held above at [378(c)(i)] and [378(c)(ii)]), which was subject to a stay of execution by consent of the parties pending this appeal, against which these liquidated damages can be set-off. Mr Ser’s claim to an equivalent sum in liquidated damages from Mr Chan is misconceived and dismissed and as Mr Ser has not pleaded any other alternative loss or damage as a result of Mr Chan’s failures to issue a Delay Certificate under cl 24(1) and a Termination of Delay Certificate, the Judge was correct to award Mr Ser nominal damages of $1,000 as against Mr Chan (see [359] above). This award below stands and Mr Ser’s appeal against the same is dismissed.</div><div class="Judg-4 mb-3 text-justify">(D) No awards are made on Mr Ser’s claims in professional negligence against Mr Chan for loss or damage as a result of the premature issue of the MC, the premature release of the moieties of retention monies nor of the incorrect certification of the maintenance or defects liability period (see [355] above).</div><div class="Judg-4 mb-3 text-justify">(E) Mr Ser’s claim against Mr Chan for the out-of-pocket expenses for the summary judgment proceedings fails (see [361] above). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) On costs:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) The costs order imposed by the Judge <span class="font-italic">viz</span> Mr Ser and GTMS stands.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) The costs order imposed by the Judge <span class="font-italic">viz</span> Mr Ser and Mr Chan stands. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">379 </span>For the reasons above, we allow CA 20 in part and dismiss CA 36.

Mr Chan practised under a sole proprietorship, Chan Sau Yan Associates (“CSYA”). In October 2011, Mr Chan incorporated CSYA Pte Ltd and thereafter carried out his practice thereunder.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">2 Mr Ser engaged Mr Chan as his architect under a memorandum of agreement dated 16 June 2009 and subsequently engaged GTMS, on the SIA Conditions, to construct the three bungalows (the “Works”).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">3 The original completion date for the Works was 21 February 2013. Over the course of the Works, GTMS made three requests for extensions of time (“EOT”). The relevant extensions were the second and third EOTs (“EOT 2” and “EOT 3”, respectively). GTMS requested EOT 2 on 20 December 2012 due to, among other things, a delay by SPPG in connecting the main incoming power supply and SPPG’s late notice of the requirement to install an OG Box. Mr Chan granted EOT 2 on 7 February 2013 for a period of 40 days from 21 February 2013 to 2 April 2013. GTMS subsequently requested EOT 3 on 1 April 2013 to complete the testing and commissioning for M&amp;E works and the installation of light fittings for the Project. Mr Chan granted EOT 3 on 10 April 2013 for a period of 15 days, extending the previous completion date further from 2 April 2013 to 17 April 2013.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">4 On 30 April 2013, the Building and Construction Authority (“BCA”) inspected the Project for the issuance of Temporary Occupation Permit (“TOP”) (the “First TOP Inspection”). The Project failed the First TOP Inspection. On 15 May 2013, Mr Chan issued the Completion Certificate (the “CC”) certifying completion of the Project as of 17 April 2013, with a Schedule listing outstanding minor works. A second TOP inspection for the Project (the “Second TOP Inspection”) was conducted on 18 June 2013. The Project failed the Second TOP Inspection. On 16 September 2013, the Project obtained TOP. The Certificate of Statutory Completion was issued on 12 May 2014. On 7 July 2014, Mr Chan issued the Maintenance Certificate (the “MC”). The Project was handed over to Mr Ser on 21 and 23 July 2014. On 22 June 2015, Mr Chan issued the Final Certificate (“FC”) for some $450,000, and the second moiety of retention money was released under the FC. It should be noted that over the course of the Works, Mr Chan issued a total of 26 interim payment certificates. Mr Ser made payment for the first 24 interim payments, but not for Interim Payment Certificates 25 and 26 (“IC 25” and “IC 26” respectively).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">5 GTMS applied for summary judgment against Mr Ser on the basis of IC 25 and IC 26. While GTMS prevailed before the High Court, on appeal, the Court of Appeal (the “CA”) set aside the summary judgment. The CA found that neither IC 25 nor IC 26 had temporary finality, and Mr Chan had issued the CC, IC 25 and IC 26 improperly, without belief in their truth and/or recklessly, without caring whether they were true or false. Further, the CA found that the CC, IC 25 and IC 26 were not properly issued under the SIA Conditions.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">6 The dispute then went back before the High Court for trial (the “Suit”). GTMS claimed unpaid sums from Mr Ser arising from IC 25 and IC 26 and the final payment claim certified by Mr Chan. Mr Ser, in counterclaim, alleged that GTMS and Mr Chan had entered into an unlawful means conspiracy against him. Mr Chan counterclaimed against Mr Ser for unpaid architect’s fees. The High Court judge (the “Judge”) allowed GTMS’s and Mr Chan’s claims, but dismissed the bulk of Mr Ser’s claims. Thereafter, the Judge issued a supplemental judgment on costs in which he ordered, among other things, for Mr Ser to pay part of the costs of the action to GTMS and Mr Chan on an indemnity basis. Mr Ser appealed against the Judge’s decision to dismiss the bulk of his claims as well as the Judge’s decision on costs.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The court’s decision</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issue 1: Whether EOT 2 and EOT 3 were properly granted by Mr Chan to GTMS</span><div class="font-weight-bold font-italic"><br/></div></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">7 EOT 2 and EOT 3 were validly granted by Mr Chan to GTMS pursuant to cll 23(1)(f) and/or (o) of the SIA Conditions: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">114]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">8 The court did not agree with the Judge’s conclusion that SPPG’s requirement for an OG Box constituted a “<span class="font-italic">force majeure</span>” event within the meaning of cl 23(1)(a) of the SIA Conditions. SPPG’s requirement for an OG Box did not amount to such a radical or external event that was beyond the contemplation or control of the parties or something unforeseen to occur during the performance of the contract: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[82]</span> to <span class="font-weight-bold">[83]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">9 However, SPPG’s requirement for an OG Box fell within a “statutory obligation” covered by cl 7 and cll 23(1)(f) and/or (o) of the SIA Conditions. SPPG was the “statutory undertaker” (by devolution) which had the power to oversee and operate the power grid in Singapore and to impose conditions or its requirements on the supply of electricity: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">92]</span>,<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold">[94] </span>to<span class="font-weight-bold"> [95], </span><span class="font-weight-bold">[97]</span>.  </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">10 The requirement for an OG Box fell within the meaning of a “variation” to the Works, even if SPPG was the one constructing it. On the facts, there was no need for any architect’s instruction (“AI”) or verbal instructions or directions from Mr Chan to GTMS; the requirement for an OG Box was conveyed by SPPG to Mr Ser, who conveyed the same to his mechanical and engineering consultant (“CCA”). CCA then forwarded SPPG’s requirement for an OG Box to GTMS and CSYA: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[102]</span> to <span class="font-weight-bold">[103]</span>.  </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">11 The other requirements for an EOT under cl 23(1) of the SIA Conditions for an EOT were fulfilled. SPPG’s requirement for an OG Box did in fact cause a delay in connecting the power mains to the bungalows which in turn delayed the testing and commissioning of the mechanical and electrical Work and light fittings. Further, GTMS had acted with due diligence and had taken all reasonable steps to avoid or reduce the delay in completion. Although the Master Programme recorded GTMS’ plans to commence the SPPG power connection works on 9 July 2012, GTMS was not strictly contractually obliged to do so and its failure could not be conclusive of a lack of due diligence. The OG Box requirement was beyond the control of the parties and had occurred without the parties’ fault: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[105]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[109]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[113]</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issue 2: Whether the CC was properly granted by Mr Chan to GTMS</span><div class="font-weight-bold font-italic"><br/></div></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">12 Mr Chan had improperly (and prematurely) issued the CC on 15 May 2013, certifying completion as of 17 April 2013.

The parties’ conduct from the time of contracting in May 2011 to the time the disputes arose towards the end of 2013 all pointed to the parties’ acceptance of a binding contract: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[119] </span>to <span class="font-weight-bold">[120]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[122]</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Item 72(a)</span><div class="font-italic"><br/></div></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">14 Item 72(a) of the Preliminaries stated that the CC shall not be issued until “[a]ll parts of the Works are in the Architect’s opinion ready for occupation and for use”. In the court’s view, Item 72(a) meant that the Works could not be occupied and used as a dwelling before obtaining the TOP. Therefore, Mr Chan was not entitled to issue the CC on 15 May 2013 certifying contract completion as of 17 April 2013 before the grant of TOP. The court proceeded on the basis that the CC ought to have been issued on 16 September 2013, that being the earliest date when it could have been issued: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[124]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[138]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[143]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">15 Because of the delay in obtaining TOP and the consequent delay that would have on the issue of the CC, it was necessary to examine, for the purposes of liability, who was responsible for the delays. Unfortunately, some of the Judge’s analysis and findings of fact in relation to the various items causing the bungalows to fail the TOP Inspections and attributions of fault therefor were, with respect, not entirely clear nor, in some important instances, adequate to determine liability. The facts before the court raised the issue of concurrent delays when the architect issued instructions or required additional works during a period of delay caused by the contractor. However, this issue was not raised in the pleadings and was only very briefly mentioned in parties’ submissions to the Judge. The parties should have pleaded and made submissions on, among other things, whether a Delay Certificate under cl 24(1) of the SIA Conditions should have been issued certifying delays in completion of the works as from 18 April 2013, the reasons for the failure of the First and Second TOP Inspection, and the effect, if any, of the above mentioned certificates on the liquidated damages accumulating against GTMS: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">144]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[162]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[170]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[172].</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">16 Despite the foregoing analysis of how the dispute should have been resolved, the court was constrained by the way the parties ran their respective cases below, and as a result thereof, to accept the Judge’s limited findings of fact. As found by the Judge, GTMS completed remedying their construction errors by 28 May 2013 and therefore liquidated damages against GTMS would run from 18 April 2013 to 28 May 2013. The court found that on the facts, the liability for the delays after 28 May 2013 in obtaining the TOP were attributable to Mr Chan’s errors and omissions. Mr Chan should have issued a Delay Certificate on or as reasonably soon after 18 April 2013 as GTMS was in delay as of that date and liquidated damages ran from that date. Next, Mr Chan should have issued a Termination of Delay Certificate under cl 24(3)(a) of the SIA Conditions on or as soon as possible after 29 May 2013 such that, under cl 24(3)(b), liquidated damages should then have stopped running against GTMS. Liquidated damages against GTMS would therefore run from 18 April 2013 to 28 May 2013; this would amount to $147,600: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[174]</span> to <span class="font-weight-bold">[175]</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Item 72(b)</span><div class="font-italic"><br/></div></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">17 Item 72(b) of the Preliminaries stated that the CC shall not be issued until “[a]ll services are tested, commissioned and operating satisfactorily as specified in the Contract … including handing over all test certificates, operating instructions and warranties”. The Judge was of the view that Item 72(b) was satisfied by 17 April 2013 and the court did not consider that there was sufficient basis to disturb the Judge’s findings on Item 72(b): at <span class="font-weight-bold">[177]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[179]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[182]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">184]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[187]</span> to <span class="font-weight-bold">[18</span><span class="font-weight-bold">8]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[193]</span> to <span class="font-weight-bold">[194]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">18 However, the court did not agree with the Judge’s <span class="font-italic">de minimis </span>approach to the requirement to hand over all test certificates, operating instructions and warranties in Item 72(b). On a true construction, Item 72(b) required the handing over of all test certificates (unless waived or modified by agreement of the parties), operating instructions and warranties before the issue of the CC. However, the court agreed with the Judge that these documents were in fact ready earlier than 22 June 2014 (the date they were handed over), but Mr Ser refused to take over the Project soon after TOP. Thus, Mr Ser was in no position to contend that this requirement was not complied with: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[197]</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Item 72(c)</span><div class="font-italic"><br/></div></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">19 Item 72(c) of the Preliminaries required that the CC be issued only when the works under the Contract, including any rectifications, were done “to the completion and standards acceptable to [Mr Chan]”. In this regard, the Judge accepted that there were some defects with the bungalows, but found that they did not affect the date on which the Works could be deemed as completed for the purposes of the CC. The court found that Mr Ser’s complaints regarding the defects in the bungalows were without merit, save for that relating to the intumescent paint. Moreover, given the court’s earlier finding that the CC could have only been issued at the earliest on 16 September 2013, when the TOP was issued, the court was of the view that Item 72(c) only needed to have been satisfied by 16 September 2013: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[198]</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>to <span class="font-weight-bold">[20</span><span class="font-weight-bold">0]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">20 The court did not find any merit in Mr Ser’s complaints relating to the soil used for the backfill, the risers of the steps, the sliding glass doors, the Volakas marble flooring, the ironwood timber decking and the punctured gas pipe: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[203]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[212]</span> to <span class="font-weight-bold">[213]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[232]</span> to <span class="font-weight-bold">[23</span><span class="font-weight-bold">6]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[240]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[243] </span>to <span class="font-weight-bold">[244]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[248]</span> to <span class="font-weight-bold">[249]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[252]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[254]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[259] </span>to <span class="font-weight-bold">[260]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[266]</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">[268]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">21 However, in respect of the intumescent paint, the court agreed with Mr Ser’s complaints that the paint was only fire-proof for one, instead of two, hours, and secondly, that it was painted on only three, as opposed to all four sides of the trellis beams. In respect of the first complaint, the contract required the paint to have a fire-proof rating of two hours, and it was CSYA who had told GTMS that the application of paint with a one-hour fire-rating was acceptable. However, the doctrine of estoppel by representation precluded Mr Ser from claiming against GTMS. As such, only Mr Chan would be liable for the lowering of the fire rating of the intumescent paint to a one-hour rating without obtaining Mr Ser’s consent to do so. As for the second complaint, all four sides of the trellis beams had to be coated with intumescent paint and this issue entitled Mr Ser to damages. Although Mr Ser claimed the sum of $63,144, there was no breakdown as to whether this sum included the cost of dismantling the wooden trellis, applying the two-hour rated intumescent paint and then re-assembling the wooden trellis. In the circumstances, the court apportioned the sum of $63,144 as follows: Mr Chan was liable to Mr Ser for $42,096 (together with interest thereon from the date of the writ), being two thirds of this claim, and GTMS was liable to Mr Ser for $21,048 (together with interest thereon from the date of the writ), being one third of this claim. Lastly, although the court agreed with Mr Ser’s complaints about the intumescent paint, this was not an item that held up completion and achieving of the TOP since the registered fire inspector had passed the same, and it was therefore not a non-compliance with Item 72(c): at <span class="font-weight-bold">[215]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[218]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[221(</span><span class="font-weight-bold">h)]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[222]</span> to <span class="font-weight-bold">[223]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[228]</span> to <span class="font-weight-bold">[230]</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issue 3: Whether IC 25, IC 26 and FC were properly issued</span><div class="font-weight-bold font-italic"><br/></div></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">22 IC 25, IC 26 and FC (the “Payment Certificates”) were validly issued and, with the exception of the intumescent paint on the steel beams, the judgment entered in respect of the Payment Certificates at $1,103,915.48 was to stand: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[274]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">301]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">23 The court did not accept Mr Ser’s argument that Mr Chan should not have certified the release of the two moieties of retention money under IC 25 and under FC. In respect of the first moiety due under IC 25, the release of which was certified by Mr Chan on 3 September 2013, the court noted that the earliest date on which the CC could have been issued was 16 September 2013, and technically the first moiety should not have been released until or shortly after 16 September 2013. However, Mr Ser had not proved what loss or damage he had suffered as a result of certificate of its release of the first moiety some 13 days prematurely. In respect of the second moiety, the court noted that since practical completion should have been certified only on 16 September 2013, the maintenance period would only have ended on 15 September 2014. Thus, the MC could have been issued only from 16 September 2014 onwards, and the second moiety could only have been released from 16 September 2014. The FC was issued only on 22 June 2015, and in the absence of evidence that the FC was issued too early, Mr Ser could not have any valid complaint over the certification of the release of the second moiety under the FC: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[275]</span> to <span class="font-weight-bold">[277]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">24 Mr Ser next complained that Mr Chan could not have certified the sums claimed by GTMS under IC 25 and IC 26 if GTMS did not adduce any proof that it had actually paid the nominated subcontractors (“NSCs”) and nominated suppliers (“NSs”). However, the reality of the construction industry was that quantity surveyors did not require contractors to first pay the subcontractors and suppliers before they could be reimbursed. In fact, it was usually the opposite, since a contractor often procured goods and services on credit and it paid its subcontractors and suppliers only upon receiving money from the owner. Nor could the SIA Conditions be interpreted to require GTMS to adduce such proof: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[280]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[287]</span> to <span class="font-weight-bold">[288]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">25 Mr Ser alleged that GTMS was overcharging him for the work done by NSCs and NSs. He relied on credit notes issued by various NSs and NSCs to GTMS, which made references to “discounts”. The court rejected Mr Ser’s argument as Mr Ser had only picked upon a few documents to support the allegation, which was insufficient to discharge Mr Ser’s burden of proof – the reference to “discount” in the credit notes did not necessarily mean Mr Ser had been overcharged. More importantly, the quantity surveyor would have picked up on any of such discounts. Finally, it was always open to Mr Ser to call these NSCs and NSs to the stand for evidence, as they were nominated by Mr Ser, albeit through Mr Chan, and his failure to do so would mean that he had failed to discharge his burden of proof: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[290]</span> to <span class="font-weight-bold">[293]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">26 Lastly, Mr Ser challenged the Judge’s interpretation of cl 28(5) of the SIA Conditions (which dealt with the quantification of the amount that GTMS could claim from Mr Ser in relation to PC Rate items, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, items where the quantities, at the point of contracting, could not be precisely determined). The Judge’s interpretation of the methodology in cl 28(5) was that, from the contract sum, the “relevant sum” of the PC Rate item would be deducted and the value of the actual work done would be added. The value of the actual work done was not disputed, and was calculated by multiplying the area in the contractual drawings with the actual unit rate of the PC Rate items. Mr Ser, however, argued that the “relevant sum” to be deducted referred to the “tender breakdown prices”, which were the budgeted sums handwritten by GTMS in the Preliminaries section of the Schedule of Prices in the tender documents for the Project. The court rejected Mr Ser’s argument. First, this point was not pleaded. Secondly, Mr Ser’s interpretation of what constituted the “relevant sum” was unreasonable as this submission converted what was a PC rate in the Bill of Quantities into a lumpsum where the rate became irrelevant. Mr Ser had confused a PC Rate item for supply with a PC Sum item: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[295]</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> to [296]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[299]</span> to <span class="font-weight-bold">[300]</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issue 4: The remedies available as between Mr Ser and GTMS, as well as between Mr Ser and Mr Chan</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">As between Mr Ser and GTMS</span><div class="font-italic"><br/></div></div><div class="txt-body text-left">27 Mr Ser was entitled, as against GTMS, to deduct the sum of $147,600 (together with interest thereon from the date of the writ) from the $1,103,915.48 due under the Payment Certificates: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">332]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body text-left">28 The court did not agree with the Judge that the liquidated damages clause was inoperable because the prevention principle applied. The prevention principle had not been pleaded by GTMS: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[305]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[307]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body text-left">29 Although the architect had not issued a Delay Certificate, liquidated damages could still be imposed on GTMS under the SIA Conditions. Clauses 37(3) and 37(4) of the SIA Conditions empowered the court to disregard the absence of a Delay Certificate. The court, as the final arbiter of all the disputes between the parties in this case, was entitled to find and hold that Mr Chan should or ought to have issued the Delay Certificate under cl 24(2) certifying that the Works ought to have been completed by 17 April 2013. Further, since the arbitrator or court could find a contractor liable for delay notwithstanding the absence of a Delay Certificate, it could also decide when the delay ended in the absence of a Termination of Delay Certificate. Liquidated damages therefore started running from 18 April 2013. Mr Chan should then have issued the Termination of Delay Certificate on 28 May 2013 and the CC on 16 September 2013 when the bungalows obtained the TOP. It followed that GTMS was liable to pay Mr Ser liquidated damages from 18 April 2013 to 28 May 2013, which amounted to $147,600 together with interest thereon from the date of the writ: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[308]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[324]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[329(b)]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[33</span><span class="font-weight-bold">0] </span>to <span class="font-weight-bold">[332]</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">As between Mr Ser and Mr Chan</span><div class="font-italic"><br/></div></div><div class="txt-body text-left">30 An architect who failed to issue a Delay Certificate may be liable to the owner for any breaches of his contractual or tortious duties owed to the owner: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[329</span><span class="font-weight-bold">(b)]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[330]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body text-left">31 Mr Ser’s appeal against Mr Chan’s allegedly wrongful grants of EOT 2 and EOT 3 were dismissed. As for the Payment Certificates, Mr Ser’s appeal was dismissed save for the issue of the intumescent paint and the issue of liquidated damages. Similarly, Mr Ser’s appeal against the Judge’s exoneration of Mr Chan’s supervision was without basis and was dismissed: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[337] </span>to <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">339]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body text-left">32 Mr Chan was wrong to have issued the CC on 15 May 2013 when it had failed the First TOP Inspection on 30 April 2013. Following the First TOP Inspection, Mr Chan had failed to properly assess the reasons for the failure and to fairly attribute the reasons for the failure to the relevant parties, including himself, and to assess the relative time taken for the rectification of each item. The court was drawn to the ineluctable conclusion that he did so as a matter of self-preservation. It appeared to the court that on the whole, Mr Chan was attempting to shield himself from the consequences of his own errors and omissions and this was done in clear and flagrant breach of his duties and certifying functions under the Contract: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">341] </span>to <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">342]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[344]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[348]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[350]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body text-left">33 However, Mr Ser’s claim against Mr Chan for the liquidated damages that Mr Ser had failed to recover from GTMS pursuant to cl 24(2) of the SIA Conditions was dismissed. A claim for liquidated damages was separate in nature and quite different from a claim against an architect for breach of contract or tort for not issuing a Delay Certificate. However, a claim against a contractor for liquidated damages (when properly certified) and a claim for damages against the architect for breach of contract and duty in not issuing a Delay Certificate could intersect when, for example, the employer could not recover those liquidated damages from the contractor because of the contractor’s intervening insolvency. In such an event, the employer’s loss and damage would, subject to the facts of each case, include the liquidated damages he could not deduct from the interim or final payments, which was now beyond his reach due to the contractor’s subsequent insolvency. In this case, there was a sum owing to GTMS by Mr Ser under the Payment Certificates and the liquidated damages as ascertained by this court could be set off against that Sum. No loss had as yet arisen. This sum had not yet been paid by Mr Ser because there was a consent order for a stay of execution pending appeal. Further, a liquidated damages claim against GTMS was based on the contract between GTMS and Mr Ser. Mr Ser could not, without more, transplant that agreed pre-estimate of the loss from his contract with GTMS to his contract with Mr Chan: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[351]</span><span class="font-weight-bold">, [354]</span> to <span class="font-weight-bold">[355]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body text-left">34 Nonetheless, in his claim for professional negligence against Mr Chan, Mr Ser was entitled to claim and prove any loss and damage he sustained as a result of Mr Chan’s breach of contract and breach of duty. However, since Mr Ser had not been able to prove any loss or damage arising from the premature issue of the MC, the premature release of the moieties of retention monies or the incorrect certification of the maintenance or DLP, the court made no awards on those claims. Mr Ser also could not raise his claim for loss of rental revenue again, after having withdrawn it under cross-examination. Mr Ser had not pleaded any other alternative general or special damages suffered as a result of Mr Chan’s breaches of contract and grossly negligent acts. The Judge was therefore correct in awarding Mr Ser nominal damages of $1,000: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[35</span><span class="font-weight-bold">6]</span> to <span class="font-weight-bold">[359]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body text-left">35 Mr Ser’s claim against Mr Chan for out-of-pocket expenses for the summary judgment application, appeals and related interlocutory proceedings, quantified at some $649,082.63, was rejected. First, Mr Ser had failed to plead this claim. Secondly, the summary judgment application concerned IC 25, IC 26 and FC; however, the court had found the sums certified under these Payment Certificates to be largely correct. The only certificate tainted with negligence was the CC. Thirdly, it was not readily apparent that the claim for costs of the summary judgment proceedings would be costs within the reasonable contemplation of either Mr Ser or Mr Chan, either as a matter of tort or contract: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[360] </span>to <span class="font-weight-bold">[361]</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Costs</span><div class="font-weight-bold font-italic"><br/></div></div><div class="txt-body text-left">36 The court upheld the Judge’s costs orders as between Mr Ser and GTMS and as between Mr Ser and Mr Chan: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[374]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[377]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body text-left">37 The Judge ordered Mr Ser to pay costs to GTMS on a standard basis from the date the writ was filed up until the date of the commencement of the trial on 8 November 2018, with costs payable on an indemnity basis thereafter. The Judge placed significance on the fact that Mr Ser had indulged in speculative claims and allegations, that Mr Ser’s claims were highly unreasonable and exaggerated, and that in the course of the trial, Mr Ser raised new evidence and new allegations that had not been set out in his pleadings or in his AEICs. The court found Mr Ser’s reasons to resist the order for costs on an indemnity basis unconvincing: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[364]</span> to <span class="font-weight-bold">[365]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[367]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[371]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[373]</span> to <span class="font-weight-bold">[374]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body text-left">38 The Judge found that Mr Chan sent Mr Ser two letters containing offers to settle. The Judge ordered Mr Ser to pay Mr Chan costs on a standard basis from 29 January 2014 (the date of the third-party notice to join Mr Chan and CSYA to the Suit) up until 6 March 2017 (the deadline for Mr Ser to accept the open offer to settle), with costs payable on an indemnity basis thereafter. The court agreed with the Judge that Mr Chan’s offers to settle, while not compliant with O 22A of the Rules of Court (2014 Rev Ed), could nevertheless be considered in ordering costs. The Judge’s costs order proceeded on the premise that the two offers were more favourable to Mr Ser than what he ultimately received.
