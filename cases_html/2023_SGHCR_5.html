This is an expression of procedural justice because consequential amendments may be necessitated to address amendments that may often raise a new question and/or issue that has to be determined by the court. What is the position, however, when the proposed amendment to a party’s pleading is not in fact a consequential amendment? And further, does the fact that the proposed amendment seeks to resile from an admission made in that very pleading provide a basis for striking out the impugned amendment? That was the crux of the legal issues in this matter. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 By the present application, the plaintiff sought to strike out a sentence (the “Impugned Sentence”) in the first defendant’s Defence (Amendment No 2) dated 20 February 2023 (“DA 2”) filed in HC/S 703/2020 (the “Suit”). The Impugned Sentence was inserted, under the auspices of a consequential amendment, following the filing of the plaintiff’s Statement of Claim (Amendment No 3) dated 6 February 2023 (“SOCA 3”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 Having considered the parties’ submissions, I allowed the plaintiff’s application with brief oral remarks. In my view, the first defendant’s amendment was not a consequential amendment and impermissibly sought to re-open an issue that had previously been admitted to.

They are equal shareholders and directors in the third defendant company, Avtiar Holdings Pte Ltd. They are also directors in the second defendant, Avitar Enterprises Pte Ltd. The second defendant is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the third defendant and is engaged in, among other things, the business of trading electronic products and mobile phones.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Suit </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 In the Suit, the plaintiff brings several claims against the defendants, but it would suffice for present purposes to focus on just one aspect. A key plank of the plaintiff’s case hinges on a purported understanding (the “Understanding”) reached between himself and the first defendant in or around 2005, regarding the use of the second defendant as an investment vehicle. The Understanding is defined in paragraph 8 of the plaintiff’s Statement of Claim dated 3 August 2020 (“SOC”) as follows:

</div> Disputes subsequently arose between the parties and the plaintiff claims that there was a breakdown of trust and confidence between him and the first defendant. The result, the plaintiff says, is that he has been subjected to oppressive conduct within the meaning of s 216 of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (the “Act”). He therefore seeks, among other things, for the first defendant to render a complete account of all investments and profits that he has made or alternatively for damages to be assessed arising from the breach. The plaintiff also seeks an order that the second and third defendants be wound up pursuant to s 216(2) of the Act, upon payment of the sums found to be due and owing to the second defendant and himself. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 The second and third defendants are notional defendants to the Suit, joined solely for the purpose of ensuring that they are bound by any findings and/or orders.

I shall elaborate on the significance of these events in my analysis below. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 On 3 August 2020, the plaintiff commenced the Suit against the defendants and filed his SOC. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 On 6 September 2020, the first defendant filed his Defence. Paragraph 10 of the Defence expressly denied paragraph 8 of the SOC (see [5] above). Therein, the first defendant denied that there was the mutual Understanding to use the second defendant’s funds “to invest in stock and/or real estate” on behalf of the second defendant. Moreover, the first defendant denied any duty to account to the plaintiff or to the second defendant.

These documents were sought on the basis that they were relevant and necessary to show the existence of the Understanding, which the first defendant had denied in unequivocal terms in his Defence (see [10] above) and to demonstrate a breach of the Understanding.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 On 15 July 2021, by the parties’ mutual consent, the plaintiff filed his SOCA 2.

This is the Impugned Sentence. The application was made pursuant to O 18 rr 19(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and 19(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the revoked Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (the “Rules”) and/or the inherent jurisdiction of the court. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The applicable legal principles</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 The legal principles governing striking out and amendment of pleadings are well-established.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 The power to strike out ought only to be invoked in a plain and obvious case (<span class="font-italic">Gabriel Peter Partners (suing as a firm) v Wee Chong Jin and others </span>[1997] 3 SLR(R) 649 (“<span class="font-italic">Gabriel Peter</span>”) at [18]). The specific grounds under O 18 rr 19(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and 19(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the Rules are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The ground under O 18 r 19(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Rules refers to cases that are obviously frivolous or vexatious or obviously unsustainable. As summarised in <span class="font-italic">Chee </span><span class="font-italic">Siok Chin and other v Minister for Home Affairs and another </span>[2006] 1 SLR(R) 582 (“<span class="font-italic">Chee </span><span class="font-italic">Siok Chin</span>”), proceedings are “frivolous when they are deemed to waste the court’s time and are determined to be incapable of legally sustainable and reasoned argument” while proceedings are “vexatious when they are shown to be without foundation and/or where they cannot possibly succeed and/or where an action is brought only for annoyance or to gain some fanciful advantage” (at [33]). In considering this ground, the court may have regard to the history of the matter and relevant correspondence exchanged between the parties, in addition to the pleadings (<span class="font-italic">Active Timber Agencies Pte Ltd v Allen &amp; Gledhill </span>[1995] 3 SLR(R) 334 at [21]–[22]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The ground under O 18 r 19(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) refers to instances where the court’s machinery is used improperly or not <span class="font-italic">bona fides </span>(<span class="font-italic">Gabriel Peter </span>at [22]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">There is a significant degree of overlap between these two grounds, which largely mirror and share a consistent juridical basis with the court’s residual and inherent jurisdiction, as contained within O 92 r 4 of the Rules (<span class="font-italic">Chee </span><span class="font-italic">Siok Chin </span>at [29] and [35]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 As for amendment of pleadings, under O 20 r 5(1) of the Rules, the court has a broad discretion to allow such amendment at any stage of proceedings on such terms as may be just. This discretion is, however, not unfettered, and must be exercised judicially. The court must be satisfied, first, that the amendment will enable the real questions and/or issues in controversy between the parties to be determined, and second, that procedural fairness to the opposing party be maintained (<span class="font-italic">Sheagar</span><span class="font-italic"> s/o T M Veloo v Belfield International (Hong Kong) Ltd</span> [2014] 3 SLR 524 at [116] and [117]). The court is to have regard to the “justice of the case” and in doing so, ought to bear in mind two key factors, namely, whether any prejudice would be caused to the other party which cannot be compensated for in costs and whether the applicant is effectively asking for a second bite at the cherry (<span class="font-italic">Review Publishing Co Ltd and another v Lee Hsien Loong and another appeal</span> [2010] 1 SLR 52 at [113]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 What then of an amendment that seeks specifically to retract an admission? The general rule is that an admission, made inadvertently and in a case of a <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>mistake, may be withdrawn, and the pleading amended accordingly (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure 2020</span> vol 1 (Cavinder Bull gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2021)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at paras 18/13/2 and 20/8/20, citing the English Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Hollis v Burton </span>[1892] 3 Ch 226 at 236 (“<span class="font-italic">Hollis</span>”)). This coheres with both precedent, as well as principle. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 In <span class="font-italic">Hollis</span>, the beneficiary<span class="font-italic"> </span>under a settlement sued the defendant solicitor, to recover a sum of trust money alleged to have been received by the firm and not duly invested. The defendant had in his defence and in his answer to interrogatories, admitted that his partner had paid the money into the bank account of the firm but without his knowledge. The defendant then sought to retract this admission, on the basis that it had been made by mistake, and adduced evidence that showed that the moneys had not been paid into the bank account of the firm. The court allowed the defendant to withdraw his admission and to amend his defence on the condition that the defendant pay into court a sum representing the quantum of the plaintiff’s claim, given that on the materials, there remained a strong case for contending that the firm had received the moneys. The principle that may be surmised from <span class="font-italic">Hollis </span>is that a party is generally entitled to correct a <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>error in his pleading, especially where an incorrect admission of fact is made by mistake. That being said, evidence ordinarily has to be adduced to demonstrate that there was in fact such a mistake. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 A more recent illustration of this principle may be found in the Supreme Court of New South Wales case of <span class="font-italic">Bank of Western Australia Ltd v Coppola </span>[2011] NSWSC 1326 (“<span class="font-italic">Coppola</span>”). In <span class="font-italic">Coppola</span>, the defendant had filed a notice admitting that he had signed a document but claimed that he was misled as to its nature and effect. The court refused the defendant’s application to amend his defence and to withdraw his previous admission in the notice as well as in other proceedings, even though there had been no evidence put forward by the plaintiff of having changed its position and it was undisputed that the solicitors’ admissions were made without instructions. Walmsley AJ summarised the relevant legal principles in determining whether a party may withdraw its admissions (<span class="font-italic">Coppola </span>at [22]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">There must be proper grounds for the exercise of the discretion. The circumstances in which an admission was made must be examined.

It has also been said that where leave to withdraw an admission is sought, a court will require an explanation for the making of the admission. The explanation must be a sensible one, based on evidence of a solid and substantial character</span>: <span class="font-italic">Langdale v Danby</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[1982] 3 All ER 129; <span class="font-italic">Hollis v Burton</span>[1892] 3 Ch 226 and <span class="font-italic">Crumper</span><span class="font-italic"> v Pothecary</span>[1941] 2 KB 58 at 70; <span class="font-italic">Celestino v Celestino</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[1990] FCA 299 at [12]; <span class="font-italic">Jeans v Commonwealth Bank of Australia Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[2003] FCAFC 309; (2003) 204 ALR 327 at [17]-[19].

The pleadings<span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> are the principal method of defining the issues to enable the court more easily to get to the truth. Thus, in principle, an </span>erroneous admission should be able to be withdrawn unless other factors outweigh. The principal factor that might outweigh is that there is such great prejudice to the other party, because of the way in which that party has prepared his or her case on the basis of the admission, that the leave should not be given.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[4] What I have just said is a gross over simplification and the cases show there has to be a distinction between an admission deliberately<span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> made, an admission which is key to the way in which the parties have prepared their case, and more peripheral facts. There must be some evidence as to how the admission</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> was made and there must be some material to show that it was erroneous.” </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">[emphasis added in bold]</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 I note that <span class="font-italic">Coppola </span>was decided in the context of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules (Reg No 418 of 2005) (NSW), of which Rule 17.3(3) permits an admitting party to withdraw an admission with the leave of court. I nevertheless consider that the case provides useful guidance in determining when a court should exercise its discretion to permit an amendment that seeks to resile from an admission. In short, it is incumbent on the party seeking to withdraw an admission to provide a logical explanation, supported by substantial evidence, to demonstrate that the admission made was erroneous. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 This is eminently sensible as a matter of principle. The key purpose of pleadings is to set the parameters of the issues that lie for the court’s determination. Admissions fortify this delineation and narrow the issues in dispute because an admission deprives a party from challenging the admitted fact at trial (<span class="font-italic">Borneo Housing Mortgage Finance </span><span class="font-italic">Bhd v Personal Representatives of the Estate of Lee Lun Wah Maureen &amp; Anor </span>[1994] 1 MLJ 209). This goes towards the preservation of judicial resources as no further evidence has to be adduced in reference to those facts that have been admitted (<span class="font-italic">Pioneer Plastic Containers Ltd v Commissioner of Customs and Excise </span>[1967] Ch 597). It follows that when an attempt is made to resile from an admission, thereby re-opening an issue that was once no longer in dispute, the burden necessarily lies on the admitting party to provide cogent reasons as to why he or she ought to be permitted to do so it, so as to no longer be bound by the admission. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Bearing these principles in mind, I turn to the parties’ arguments. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The parties’ arguments</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 The plaintiff contends that the Impugned Sentence is a non-consequential amendment.

Let me explain.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The amendments in DA 2 were made in response to the plaintiff’s filing of his SOCA 3 on 6 February 2023 (see [21] above). The key amendment made by the plaintiff in his SOCA 3 was the inclusion of an additional overseas property at paragraph 13(j), namely, one “BD Blvd Point 39-3901” located in Dubai.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> No amendments were made to paragraphs 8, 9 or 10 of the plaintiff’s SOCA 2 and the definition of the “Understanding” remained the same. Hence, the Impugned Sentence (see [22] above), which expressly concerns the averments made in paragraphs 8 and 10 of the SOCA 2, simply cannot be said to have been a consequential amendment. Moreover, it is equally clear that the Impugned Sentence makes no reference to paragraph 13 of SOCA 2 at all. It is therefore entirely misconceived for the first defendant to suggest that because an amendment was made to paragraph 13 of SOCA 2, it was therefore necessary for him to clarify in his pleadings his position on the Understanding as defined in paragraph 8 of the SOCA 2.

</div> Indeed, what puts paid to this argument is the fact that the first defendant also included a new line in paragraph 13 of his DA 2 stating that “at no point in time did parties agree to the inclusion of the item at paragraph 13(j) and this did not form part of the [Settlement Agreement]”.

Indeed, that the existence of the Understanding was no longer an issue in dispute was the very impetus for the plaintiff to withdraw his request in the Discovery Application for documents relating to the local properties listed in paragraph 9 of his SOC. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Next, I also accepted the plaintiff’s submission that the first defendant had admitted that the Understanding applies to the local properties as set out in paragraph 10 of the SOC. In this respect, paragraph 11 of the first defendant’s DA 1 is crucial: it expressly provides that “[p]aragraph 8 of the SOC is admitted to the extent that there was an understanding between the parties but limited to the Transactions listed our [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] in the Schedule of the [Settlement Agreement]” (see [19] above). Save for a typographical edit, this remained unchanged in the first defendant’s DA 2. As the first defendant himself acknowledged, the list of local properties contained in paragraph 10 of the SOC were the subject of transactions listed in the Schedule of the Settlement Agreement.

</div> This must mean that the first defendant had admitted to the Understanding insofar as it pertained to the local properties listed in the Schedule of the Settlement Agreement, which are reproduced in paragraph 10 of the SOC. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 As against this, the first defendant argued that in relation to paragraphs 10 and 13 of the SOC, it was made clear in his DA 1 that he only accepted that there was an obligation for him to account for the properties listed in the Schedule to the Settlement Agreement.

</div>
</div> Before me, counsel for the first defendant elaborated on this argument, contending that there was a distinction between the “Understanding” (in upper case) as defined in paragraph 8 of the SOC and the “understanding” (in lower case) as stated in paragraph 11 of DA 2 (see [19] above). In other words, in paragraph 11 of his DA 2, the “understanding” referred to was a limited obligation to account as compared to the “Understanding” as defined in paragraph 8 of the SOC. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 With respect, I was not persuaded by this argument for three reasons: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the alleged distinction is simply not borne out by the express language of paragraph 11 of DA 2, which refers not only to “an understanding between the parties” but also to paragraph 8 of the SOC. In my view, this is plain as a pikestaff: the “understanding” must necessarily refer to the Understanding as defined in paragraph 8 of the SOC. I agree with the plaintiff’s submission that this is the only intelligible interpretation of paragraph 11 of DA 2.

</div>
</div> Not once was this supposed semantical distinction ever communicated to either the plaintiff or the court, until the present application was filed. This suggested that this explanation was a bare assertion and a mere afterthought. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, the first defendant’s proffered interpretation of the word “understanding” in paragraph 11 of DA 2 as being a more limited duty to account disregards the fact that the very pith and marrow of the “Understanding”, as defined in paragraph 8 of the SOC, implicates a duty for the plaintiff and the first defendant to account to one another in respect of the second defendant’s funds. In the circumstances, I was unable to see how this allegedly narrower duty to account is somehow different from the Understanding at all.  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, and consistent with my finding that the alleged distinction was an afterthought, the clarification provided by counsel for the first defendant was not clearly fleshed out in the first defendant’s affidavit in reply filed on 23 March 2023. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Finally, the first defendant contended that parties have a different understanding of the effect of the Settlement Agreement and that this issue should be left for trial. Whether, as a consequence of the Settlement Agreement, the first defendant had indeed admitted to the Understanding as applying to the local properties as set out in paragraph 10 of the SOC, should not be determined in this application. In support of this, the first defendant referred to a statement made by counsel for the plaintiff at the hearing of SUM 3250, which was the plaintiff’s application to amend his Reply (see [20] above):

</div> </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">PC: … Parties have differing understanding of the Settlement Agreement and what it relates to. Our proposed amendments are not immaterial or useless, they go towards the issued to be tried between parties. The Plaintiff’s position is that Clause 9 of the Settlement Agreement does not preclude the Plaintiff from continuing its claims, including the s. 216 claim. 1DC has different understanding of Clause 9. Issue for trial judge to determine. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 This was a captious objection, which I rejected. Viewing the statement in its context, it was clear that the dispute related to the interpretation of Clause 9 of the Settlement Agreement and in particular, whether this precluded the plaintiff from pursuing its claims under s 216 of the Act (see [6] above). This had no nexus to the admission with respect to the Understanding, and specifically, whether the Understanding applies to the overseas properties listed in paragraph 10 of the SOC. In any event, my finding that the first defendant had made such admissions was not contingent on any disputed interpretation of the Settlement Agreement: it was not in dispute that the properties set out in the Schedule of the Settlement Agreement mirror the overseas properties listed in paragraph 10 of the SOC. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Therefore, I agreed with the plaintiff that the existence of the Understanding and the fact that the Understanding applies to the local properties as set out in paragraph 10 of the SOC was no longer a live issue in the Suit. Allowing the Impugned Sentence to stand would in effect allow this issue to be re-opened and re-litigated, which would not preserve judicial resources given the admissions made by the first defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Further, I found that these admissions were neither the result of inadvertence nor mistake. This was not suggested by the first defendant to be the case. In my view, the admissions made by the first defendant were clear, considered and concerted. Unlike <span class="font-italic">Hollis, </span>the first defendant provided no cogent explanation as to why he should be allowed to resile from the admissions previously made, that have been repeated before the court at hearings, in its correspondence with the plaintiff, as well as in its own set of pleadings. The burden being on the first defendant, his proffered explanation for including the Impugned Sentence in his DA 2 was not sensible and simply did not hold water. The Impugned Sentence therefore constituted an impermissible attempt to resile from these admissions and was therefore liable to be struck out. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 For completeness, I emphasise that the only practical effect of the striking out is that the first defendant is precluded from challenging at trial the existence of the Understanding as well as the fact that the Understanding applies to the list of local properties as listed in paragraph 10 of the SOC. Doubtless, whether the Understanding was in fact breached due to the first defendant’s purported failure to account is ultimately an issue that will be ventilated and determined at trial, with the full benefit of cross-examination. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 For the reasons above, I allowed the plaintiff’s application to strike out the Impugned Sentence and ordered that the first defendant re-file and serve his DA 2 with the Impugned Sentence expunged. I also granted the plaintiff liberty to file its amended Reply within 14 days of the first defendant re-filing and serving his DA 2. Lastly, I ordered the first defendant to pay to the plaintiff costs of and incidental to the application fixed at $5,500, inclusive of disbursements. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 It only leaves me to express my gratitude to counsel for their assistance to the court. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Wong Hee Jinn  <br/>Assistant Registrar</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Chacko Samuel and Anne-Marie John (Legis Point LLC) for the plaintiff;<br/>Nur Halimatul Syafheqah binte Rosman (Gabriel Law Corporation) for the defendants. </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
