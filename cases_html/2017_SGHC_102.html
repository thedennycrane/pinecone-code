Of especial significance was the obligation for each applicant to submit two chips for evaluation. The specific operating system that was to be masked onto the chips was not prescribed, save that it must be an “open operating system”, though this term was initially undefined. This led to questions from a consortium participating in the Tender, and the MHA subsequently clarified that an open operating system was one that could be put into the two types of chips specified.

</div> The evidence as to what chips and operating system were tested by the MHA at Sandipala’s factory was decidedly murky. Whilst it is clear that the NXP P3 chip and operating system were tested and evaluated by the MHA, it is entirely unclear whether the ST23YR12 chip was ever tested and evaluated. The simple reason is that the ST23YR12 chip encoded with RUA or RUB operating system was not ready in time for the POC test.

It appears that the personalisation machines used for the POC test were from Muehlbauer.

</div> In any case, there is no doubt that Sandipala could use NXP chips if it wanted to in order to fulfil its obligations. The decision to move away from NXP chips was Sandipala’s alone. There is no evidence at all to support Mr Tannos’ claim that PNRI had instructed Sandipala to use ST chips. As members of the same consortium, it is not obvious why the two lead members should choose to use different chips with different operating systems for the same Indonesian Government project: a project which involved the E-KTP Cards which had to be compatible with the E-KTP system established for Indonesia as a whole.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">30 </span>Between August and November 2011, Sandipala received or obtained quotations from a number of other entities for the supply of chips that could be used in producing E-KTP Cards.

</div> On 20 September 2011, Mr Cousin sent Mr Tannos another quotation from ST-AP for the supply of ST23YR12 chips encoded with RUB operating system which had been developed by PT Softorb (“Softorb”). This offer was not accepted by Mr Tannos apparently because the letter of credit payment terms was too onerous for Sandipala.

</div> It bears repeating that the ST23YR12 chip with the RUB operating system produced by Softorb did not arrive in time for the POC test held by MHA. Nevertheless, the ST23YR12 chip alongside the NXP P3 chip was approved by MHA in the tender award. The evidence that Sandipala was unable to provide a letter of credit for the full purchase price is confined to a bare assertion from Mr Tannos. After reviewing the evidence, I do not accept that any problems in securing a letter of credit was the reason why Mr Tannos did not want to proceed with an order for ST23YR12 chips encoded with RUB. The decision not to proceed with this order is very surprising given that this was the very type of chip approved by MHA. There is no doubt that if that chip arrived in time for the POC test conducted by MHA on 20 May 2011, it would have been encoded with the RUB system.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">33 </span>Whilst Mr Tannos was having discussions with ST-AP in early September 2011, it is evident that he was also engaged in talks with a German company, Oberthur. What this means is that Oberthur would source for suitable chips (for example from ST-AP) and develop a suitable operating system for the chip. The circumstances in which Mr Tannos started talks with Oberthur is uncertain. What is clear is that these discussions occurred shortly after Sandipala started discussions with ST-AP and Ubivelox and culminated in an order on 19 September 2011 for 30m modules using “ST 23 Series – NXP P3/P5 Series”. This purchase order was made expressly subject to testing and approval by the authorities. According to Mr Tannos, these chips were produced and delivered to Sandipala in Jakarta, but were not tested and approved. The chips were rejected by Sandipala.

There is no evidence to support Sandipala’s assertion that Softorb was the subcontractor of Quadra or the PNRI Consortium or that ST-AP had recommended to Softorb the chip hardware and/or software that could be used in the tender evaluation. In contrast, the evidence placed before the court is consistent with ST-AP/Mr Cousin’s case that Softorb was acting as an independent software developer which intended to make a pitch to various consortiums for the use of its software with ST-AP’s ST23YR12 chips in the tender evaluation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">72 </span>First, the evidence shows that ST-AP/Mr Cousin had no hand in determining the suitable software to be encoded on the chips. In January 2011, Softorb placed an order for 100,000 ST23YR12 modules that were to be encoded with an operating system that would be submitted to ST-AP. The said operating system (referenced “RUA”) was subsequently submitted to ST-AP sometime in February 2011. Upon discovering that the RUA operating system did not work, Softorb replaced it with another operating system (referenced “RUB”) in May 2011. These dealings show that it was in fact Softorb which had developed its own software that was to be encoded on the chips that Softorb purchased from ST-AP. This is inconsistent with Sandipala’s claim that ST-AP had determined the <span class="font-italic">suitable operating system</span> to be encoded on the chips for use in the tender evaluation. Further, as pointed out by ST-AP and Mr Cousin, it is illogical that ST-AP, a chip hardware manufacturer, would make software recommendations to Softorb which was itself a software developer.

It appears that these documents originated from Softorb, not ST-AP; they were attached to an email that was sent from Softorb to Mr Cousin on 7 April 2011. Although the documents bear Mr Cousin’s signature, I accept his explanation that Softorb had requested him to sign on them so that Softorb could submit them to the consortiums it was working with. I also accept Mr Cousin’s explanation that he had signed the documents without knowing which consortium they would be provided to. In particular, I find his explanations to be consistent with the fact that there is no evidence to support the allegation that Softorb had been acting on behalf of Quadra or the PNRI Consortium at the material time. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">74 </span>Further, I find the date on which the Datasheet and the Addendum were sent to ST-AP to be rather significant. In Mr Tannos’ affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”), he deposed that the details of the PNRI Consortium’s tender proposal had mostly been decided on by the time Sandipala joined the PNRI Consortium on or around 28 February 2011 and therefore, Sandipala did not have a say in any decision-making aspects of the bidding, tender process or the technical specifications or requirements of the E-KTP Cards.

If those chips had been tested, it would be extremely surprising that the Indonesian Government would have awarded the Tender to the PNRI Consortium. Therefore, I find that it is highly unlikely that the chips that were encoded with the RUA operating system were tested as part of the tender evaluation.

Sandipala had identified the Tender Evaluation Chips by reference to what it said had been tested at its factory in May 2011.

First, I am unable to accept Mr Tannos’ claim that the Ubivelox Quotation had been sent to him before the meeting on 4 August 2011. The brevity of Mr Kim’s email attaching the Ubivelox Quotation suggests that some discussion had taken place prior to that email and therefore is more consistent with Mr Kim’s evidence that he had sent the Ubivelox Quotation after the meeting on 4 August 2011. Significantly, Mr Tannos accepted under cross-examination that there was a discussion during the 4 August 2011 meeting about a quotation being sent after the meeting.

I find it quite unlikely that Mr Kim would have prepared a quotation for these items if Mr Tannos had not demonstrated any interest in such items. Further, the fact that the Ubivelox Quotation included items such as the KMS and the SAM is also telling. These components were required for the purpose of modifying the system so that the Datacard machines could personalise ST chips. Their inclusion in the Ubivelox Quotation is consistent with Mr Kim’s evidence that he had explained these components to Mr Tannos and had informed Mr Tannos that the use of new software would require redevelopment as well as modification work.

I note in particular that the document attached to Mr Wong’s email dated 15 September 2011 had also included a reference to a KMS that would be provided by Oberthur.

While Mr Tannos characterised his discussions with Oberthur, Hongda and Ubivelox as “unsolicited”, feigned disinterest in their proposals and even denied that his first meeting with Mr Winata took place at his initiative despite evidence to the contrary, I am unable to accept his characterisation of the relevant events. Instead, I find that he had been actively sourcing for alternative chips and/or software for use in the E-KTP Project.   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether Mr Tannos had embarked on steps to modify the existing card system</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">112 </span>I am also satisfied on the evidence that Mr Tannos had embarked on plans to modify the existing card system.

I am unable to agree with Sandipala in this regard. The evidence shows that Ms Lim had personally dealt with Mr Tannos and would have the requisite knowledge to give evidence about the Draft Proposals.

Ms Lim has consistently maintained that the Draft Proposals were prepared pursuant to Mr Tannos’ intention to modify the Datacard machines to ensure compatibility with Oxel’s chips.

</div> While there may have been discussions (between representatives of Datacard, Oxel and ST-AP) that Sandipala was not part of, this is consistent with the evidence of Mr Vanhoucke, Mr Cousin and Mr Winata that ST-AP and Oxel were roped in to assist with the technical aspects of the proposed modifications. As for the reference to “Danatel” in the earlier draft proposal that was never circulated to Sandipala, Ms Lim has testified that the reference to “Danatel” was a mistake and that although she was not the author of that draft proposal, she had personal knowledge of the mistake because it had been brought up during a meeting which she attended.

</div> In this regard, there is an exchange of emails on 6 July 2011 which showed that Sandipala was working with Quadra in relation to its dealings with Datacard. The emails also showed that Sandipala was also assisted by one Mr Indra, a technical expert from Len Industri. The overall picture is also very much consistent with Mr Winata’s evidence that Mr Prawira, together with a technical team from Quadra, had met Oxel’s technical consultants and had, during those meetings, asked questions about Oxel’s chips and the PAC operating system that was encoded on Oxel’s chips.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">134 </span>Given my view that Mr Tannos was not completely clueless about smartcard systems and that he had access to technical expertise in the form of Sandipala’s technical staff and the other members of the PNRI Consortium who were in charge of the technical aspects of the Tender, the fact that he went ahead with the purchase of chips from Oxel gels with the suggestion that he had known what he was purchasing under the Agreement. Indeed, the financial commitment of Mr Tannos and Sandipala to the E-KTP project was very substantial. As a seasoned businessman, he would be well aware of the importance of knowing what he was committing to. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether Sandipala’s reaction in 2012 was consistent with one who had been defrauded</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">135 </span> Sandipala’s case was that it realised all of Oxel’s chips could not be personalised in January 2012. Mr Tannos also claimed that in mid-January 2012, he met with Husni Fahmi (“Mr Fahmi”) from the MHA, who told him that his preliminary assessment was that the issues with Oxel’s chips arose because the chip operating system was different from that of the Tender Evaluation Chips. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">136 </span>In my view, Sandipala’s reaction after their alleged discovery that Oxel’s chips could not work is incongruent with its case that it had been defrauded. There is no indication that Mr Tannos or Ms Tannos were surprised or outraged after they allegedly found out that Oxel’s chips could not be used in January 2012. They did not at any time say that they had been supplied the wrong chips despite having ample opportunities to do so. It is not disputed that there were on-going communications between Sandipala, Oxel and ST-AP during the first quarter of 2012. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">137 </span>Most tellingly, there was no mention of the Tender Evaluation Chips in their communications with Oxel or ST-AP. On 10 January 2012, Ms Tannos, on behalf of Sandipala, sent a letter to Oxel stating <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">We would like to advise that Adminduk has now decided that Sandipala’s portion for blank cards and perso is reduced to 60 million cards for the year 2012 target. We attach a copy of their letter for your perusal. We are naturally challenging this. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">As also recognized, we had produced ID cards (E-KTP) using these chips and these cards cannot be personalized at our Patra Jasa personalization centre yet. This is because the current system is not compatible to your chips operating system. Adminduk also has to approve the new system that can personalize the ST Micro chips with your operating system software. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">We have decided to temporarily reduce our order of 100 million STM chips … to the first 10 million chips that is due to arrive within the first quarter of 2012. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I hope you understand the difficult situation we are facing. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Thank you for your understanding. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">138 </span>There is no suggestion in this letter that Sandipala had been duped into buying chips that could not work or that there was any wrongdoing on the part of Oxel, ST-AP or Mr Cousin. More importantly, Sandipala did not reject Oxel’s chips. Instead, Sandipala appeared to be seeking an indulgence from Oxel by asking to reduce Sandipala’s order temporarily. The tone of the letter is consistent with the defendants’ case that Mr Tannos had known at all material times that Oxel’s chips would not work with the existing card system. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">139 </span>On 13 January 2012, Mr Cousin met with Ms Tannos and Mr Jerry Chum (“Mr Chum”) of Sandipala in Jakarta. The conversation was recorded by Mr Cousin. The focus of their discussion was on Sandipala’s dealings with Oberthur and neither Ms Tannos nor Mr Chum suggested any wrongdoing on the part of Mr Cousin or Oxel.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">140 </span>On 22 January 2012, Mr Cousin and Mr Tannos met in Jakarta. Their conversation was again recorded by Mr Cousin. There is no dispute that they were jointly exploring ways to change the system to accommodate the PAC operating system that was encoded on Oxel’s chips. In this regard, I agree with ST-AP and Mr Cousin that if Mr Tannos had realized by this point that he had been cheated into buying chips that could not work or possibly could not work, it is indeed surprising that he would sit down and hear ideas from Mr Cousin on how Sandipala should move forward.

</div> I note also that Mr Tannos had told Mr Cousin at various points in the conversation that they were in the “same team”. Again, this is an odd reaction for someone who claims that he has been defrauded to the tune of US$60m. Apart from this observation, there are a number of aspects of this conversation that are worth noting. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The issue of the Tender Evaluation Chips was not reflected in the transcript of the conversation despite Mr Tannos’ insistence that he did raise it during the meeting. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Early on in the conversation, Mr Cousin is recorded to have said “Yes.

As may be readily observed, the relationship between Mr Tannos and Mr Cousin remained cordial and they were still jointly working towards the common aim of changing the E-KTP infrastructure. The only logical explanation for this is that Sandipala had contracted to purchase Oxel’s chips despite being aware that they would not work unless changes were made to the E-KTP infrastructure. In my view, Sandipala’s case that it has been defrauded simply does not hold up in the face of the evidence that has been adduced. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">143 </span>I will also briefly address Sandipala’s contention that the efforts of ST-AP and Oxel to render assistance (after the alleged discovery that Oxel’s chips could not work) supported its case that it had been defrauded. According to Sandipala, if Mr Tannos had requested for chips with an unapproved operating system, Mr Cousin and Oxel should have told him that he was not entitled to complain and seek assistance from ST-AP or Oxel. However, “not only did Mr Cousin and Oxel not blame Mr Tannos, the former attempted to address the problems by meeting with Mr Tannos and feigned ignorance that there was no reason for the government to reject the chips”.

</div> Bearing in mind the sequence of events and the evidence as set out above, I do not think it is fair or reasonable to conclude that ST-AP’s and Oxel’s efforts to render assistance to Sandipala indicates a “guilty conscience” on their part. They were more likely to have stemmed from a genuine attempt to assist Sandipala out of goodwill. Further, I note that much of the discussions between the parties stemmed from Sandipala’s attempts to renegotiate the bargain it had entered into with Oxel.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">144 </span>Oxel submits that Sandipala wanted chips with a different operating system for reasons of its own, in the hope that it could change and thereby control the E-KTP system.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">145 </span>It is true that Oxel stood to gain from a modification of the E-KTP infrastructure to suit its chips. However, the same could be said for Sandipala. The evidence shows that PNRI and Sandipala, though they were fellow consortium members, were in competition with each other. It bears recalling that a large chunk of Sandipala’s work allocation had been redistributed to PNRI on 19 December 2011 (see [40] above). The nature of the relationship between Sandipala and PNRI is also evident from the transcript of the discussion that took place between Mr Cousin and Mr Tannos in April 2012 which suggests that Mr Tannos had intended to complete the modifications to the E-KTP infrastructure and to produce as many blank E-KTP Cards as possible with the aim of outperforming PNRI.

He had approached ST-AP on his own accord, not on PNRI’s instructions. He also shopped for chips with different operating systems, and the evidence of one such other operating system provider, Mr Kim, showed that Mr Tannos was aware that the systems he was shopping for would not work with the pre-existing systems. After entering the Agreement with Oxel, Mr Tannos had also taken concrete steps towards securing system changes in the E-KTP Project. Further, while I accept that Mr Tannos may not have been an expert in the field, I am satisfied that he knew enough to appreciate that the chips that Sandipala had contracted to purchase under the Agreement would not work unless certain changes were made to the E-KTP infrastructure. I am also satisfied that he had access to technical expertise. Finally, I find Sandipala’s reaction in 2012 to be patently inconsistent with the reaction of one who has just discovered that he has been defrauded.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">147 </span> In short, Mr Tannos knew what he wanted to purchase and Oxel had, in turn, supplied what Mr Tannos requested for.

I have found earlier that ST-AP did not supply any chips for the PNRI Consortium’s use in May 2011 (when the testing took place in Sandipala’s factory); the chips that were ordered by Softorb (ST23YR12 with RUB) were only in fact delivered in September 2011.

For instance, where the contract stipulates a monthly tenancy, the court would not imply a term that it was a tenancy for life. In the present case, in the face of an express term that Oxel would supply 100m chips described as “ST-Micro ST23YR12AW0NPACA” (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, ST23YR12 chips that were encoded with PAC operating system), it would not be appropriate to imply a term that the Agreement was for the supply of chips with a completely different operating system (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the RUB operating system) and I decline to do so. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">169 </span>Whilst there is some evidence that the MHA had approved the ST23YR12 chip (together with the NXP P3 chip) it will be recalled there was no indication at all of the operating system that was to be encoded on the ST23YR12 chip.

In this regard, Sandipala relies on s 14(3) of the Sale of Goods Act (Cap 393, 1999 Rev Ed) (“the SOGA”) which states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3) Where the seller sells goods in the course of a business and the buyer, expressly or by implication, makes known — </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) to the seller; or </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">any particular purpose for which the goods are being bought, there is an implied condition that the goods supplied under the contract are reasonably fit for that purpose, whether or not that is a purpose for which such goods are commonly supplied, except where the circumstances show that the buyer does not rely, or that it is unreasonable for him to rely, on the skill or judgment of the seller. … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">171 </span>On the facts, I am of the view that as part of its broader plan to obtain greater control over the technical aspects of the E-KTP Project, Sandipala had entered into the Agreement with the specific intention of procuring chips that had an alternative operating system. This was the particular purpose that was made known to Oxel which eventually supplied goods that would have been fit for this purpose. As such, I cannot see how Oxel could be said to have breached any obligation to supply goods that are reasonably fit for the purpose that was made known to it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">172 </span>Further and in any event, I find that it would have been unreasonable for Sandipala to have relied on the skill or judgment of Oxel. As pointed out earlier, it is not disputed that Oxel was not involved in the tender process; it came into the picture only after the Tender had been awarded to the PNRI Consortium. It is not surprising that Oxel had limited knowledge of the tender requirements. Mr Tannos has sought to suggest otherwise by claiming that Mr Winata had been provided with a thumbdrive containing copies of the PNRI Consortium’s tender submission documents by one Mr Sudihardjo.

</div> It will also be recalled that there was no copy of these documents before the Court, given Sandipala’s own position that Sandipala itself did not have a copy (above at [13]). Given the paucity of evidence, I am unable to conclude that Oxel knew the type of hardware and software that Sandipala required for the E-KTP Project. Sandipala, in contrast, would have been in a far better position to ascertain for itself the type of hardware and software that was required to fulfil its card production obligations. In the circumstances, it would not have been reasonable for Sandipala to have relied on the skill or judgment of Oxel in procuring chips for the production of E-KTP Cards.      </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The implied term that Oxel would provide samples before mass producing the chips</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">Term implied by custom</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">173 </span>   Sandipala claims that there is a term implied by custom that Oxel would provide samples before mass producing the chips. Its case is that it is the usual and customary practice for manufacturers and/or distributors of electronic chips which are specifically made for a particular purpose (as opposed to “off the shelf”) to produce a batch of sample electronic chips and deliver these sample electronic chips to the customer for functional testing in order to ensure that the electronic chips met the customer’s requirements and purpose before they are put into mass production.

</div> Oxel’s expert, Mr Lam, also testified that there are many different practices in the smart card industry relating to the provision of samples and it is up to the parties involved in each transaction to decide how they want to structure the terms of that particular transaction. Indeed, there is evidence that when an IT solution provider wishes to place a bulk order with ST, for a particular chip that is to be encoded with an operating system the solution provider is developing, the agreement will often include specific provisions on the provision of samples to be provided for testing, evaluation and approval by the solutions provider before bulk production. That said, even in these circumstances, there is nothing to prevent the solutions provider from entering into the contract on the basis that he will take the risk of the software failure. Take, for example, the order placed by Softorb with ST-AP for the ST chip encoded with RUA and summarised above at [72]–[73] and [77]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">176 </span>I note in this regard that Sandipala had indeed asked for samples to be provided and tested in respect of the order it had placed with Oberthur (see [101(c)] above). This does not, however, mean that there is an implied term <span class="font-italic">by custom</span> that such samples would be provided. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">Term implied in fact</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">177 </span>Sandipala also claims that there is a term implied in fact that Oxel would provide samples before mass producing the chips. Sandipala submits that applying the officious bystander test and business efficacy test, there must be an implied term that Oxel delivers a batch of sample electronic chips to Sandipala for functional testing before mass producing the chips as this would accord with the presumed intention of the parties. To that end, Sandipala asserts that the provision of samples is necessary for business efficacy for these reasons:

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) For security related applications and at a nation-wide scale, sample cards testing are mandatory and very common to ensure that there are no security loopholes in the entire process and to ensure that there are no counterfeit or duplicated cards in the market;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The supplier would not want to risk supplying a large quantity of goods that do not work. It is in the commercial interest of a supplier/distributor to ensure that its product has been qualified, tested, and proven to be compatible with its intended purpose;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) It is important to get an official sign-off from the end-user or governmental agencies so as to ensure the testing result meets their needs and objectives. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">178 </span>Sandipala’s submissions on this point are factually and legally unsustainable. First, the business efficacy test does not ask whether the terms in the contract would be accorded greater commercial sense if the term is implied; instead, it asks whether the contract would lack commercial or practical coherence without the term that is sought to be implied: <span class="font-italic">ACTAtek, Inc and another v Tembusu Growth Fund Ltd</span> [2016] 5 SLR 335 (“<span class="font-italic">Tembusu</span>”) at [91]–[93]. As stated by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Tembusu</span> at [94], there will often be room to think one can improve a contract with the benefit of hindsight, but that is emphatically not the test for implication. Here, there is nothing on the facts to suggest that the Agreement would lack commercial or practical coherence without the provision of samples prior to mass production. Oxel promised to deliver ST23YR12 chips encoded with PAC operating system according to a stipulated timeline in exchange for Sandipala’s payment according to the agreed terms. This bargain could be performed regardless of whether samples were provided before the commencement of mass production.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">179 </span>Secondly, the implication of a term that Oxel was obliged to supply samples for testing prior to mass production is inconsistent with the context in which the Agreement was concluded. This transaction should be distinguished from dealings such as the one between Softorb and ST-AP in which Softorb was in the process of developing its own operating system and required chips for testing. In the present circumstances, Sandipala ordered a specific set of chips that were to be encoded with specific software that Oxel had licensing rights to, with the knowledge that they would not work unless changes were made to the E-KTP infrastructure.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">180 </span>For completeness, I note that Sandipala has suggested in its closing submissions that there was an express term of the Agreement that Oxel would provide samples before mass producing the chips.

</div> This submission is a non-starter since this alleged express term was not pleaded. Even if it had been pleaded, I would venture to observe that there is no merit in the allegation of an express term in this regard. To support the existence of an express term, Sandipala points to the request for samples that was made by Ms Tannos on 11 November 2011 and Mr Zhang’s response that “the samples are being taken care now and our rep in Indonesia will contact you”.

I will first deal with the alleged duty to exercise reasonable care and skill when proposing to Sandipala chips for producing E-KTP Cards. The fundamental thread that underlies Sandipala’s claims in these proceedings is the claim that it wanted to purchase chips that were similar to the Tender Evaluation Chips (which it now claims are the 100,000 chips that were encoded with the RUB operating system and supplied by ST-AP to Softorb in September 2011). If Sandipala had known what chips it required from the outset, it would be unnecessary for ST-AP or Oxel to propose chips for use in the E-KTP Project, let alone exercise reasonable care and skill in doing so. Indeed, it bears repeating that ST23YR12 chips encoded with the RUB operating system were first offered to Mr Tannos but rejected by him on account of payment terms.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">185 </span>I turn to the alleged duty of care for ST-AP or Oxel to alert Sandipala to the fact that the chips that were to be supplied by ST-AP through Oxel could not or could possibly not be used to produce E-KTP Cards. I have found earlier that Sandipala was at all material times aware that Oxel’s chips would not work unless changes to the E-KTP infrastructure were made and approved by the MHA. Sandipala and Mr Tannos have no basis to claim that it should have been alerted to what it must have known from the outset. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">186 </span>Finally, I am of the view that there is no legal basis for imposing a duty on ST-AP to assist Sandipala to render Oxel’s chips usable for producing E-KTP Cards. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">187 </span>I accept ST-AP’s submission that it is not correct, as a matter of law, to frame a duty of care in tort as a specific positive obligation. In <span class="font-italic">Go Dante Yap v Bank Austria Creditanstalt AG</span> [2011] 4 SLR 559, the appellant businessman opened two accounts with the respondent bank and suffered significant losses on certain investments. The appellant sued the respondent in contract and tort, and argued, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, that the respondent had tortious and contractual duties to advise him on his investments. The Court of Appeal held it was incorrect for the appellant to frame a duty of care as a specific positive obligation without reference to any contractual duty and reasoned as follows (at [19]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…A duty of care in the tort of negligence, however, is in general imposed by law upon the tortfeasor, and as a result it is necessarily a broad duty to take such care as is reasonable in the circumstances. Hence, it is not, strictly speaking, correct to speak of a “tortious duty to advise” without more and, in particular, without reference to any related contractual obligation (see by analogy the House of Lords decision of <span class="font-italic">A C Billings &amp; Sons Ltd v Riden</span> [1958] AC 240 at 264 (<span class="font-italic">per</span> Lord Somervell of Harrow)). If there could be a “tortious duty to advise”, there would be no logical limit to how far a duty of care in the tort of negligence could be subdivided: the courts would be flooded with claims of specific “tortious duties” to answer telephone calls, respond to e-mails, read the newspapers or the like (see for instance the House of Lords decision of <span class="font-italic">Qualcast (Wolverhampton) Ltd v Haynes</span> [1959] AC 743). Of course, it could well be a breach of a tortious duty of care (if one was owed) for someone not to give advice in certain circumstances, but that is not the same as saying that there was a tortious duty to give advice. As the author of T Weir, <span class="font-italic">A Casebook on Tort </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 10th Ed, 2004) put it (at p 129), “[m]atters of detail are best treated as part of the question of breach, not as raising sub-duties with a specific content” (see also J Murphy, <span class="font-italic">Street on Torts</span> (Oxford University Press, 12th Ed, 2007) at pp 114−115). To frame a duty of care in the tort of negligence as narrowly as a specific contractual obligation (as in the case of a “tortious duty to advise”) would render the question of breach nugatory, for the tortfeasor would then be under a duty to do precisely that which he has been accused of not doing (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, give advice), and there would be no room for the court to inquire whether it was in fact <span class="font-italic">reasonable</span> for him not to have done it – an indispensable element of the tort of negligence – with the result that, to quote a learned commentator (see D Howarth, “Many Duties of Care – Or A Duty of Care? Notes from the Underground” (2006) 26 OJLS 449 at p 466), “[t]he concept of fault would disappear” (see too, by the same author, “Negligence after <span class="font-italic">Murphy</span>: Time to Re-Think” [1991] CLJ 58 at p 72). Consequently, “[t]here is no reason why the law of tort should impose duties which are identical to the obligations negotiated by the parties” (see <span class="font-italic">Robinson v Jones</span> at [79] (<span class="font-italic">per</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>Jackson LJ)), in so far as the content of those contractual obligations is of a <span class="font-italic">different scope</span> from a tortious duty of care.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">188 </span>In the present case, while there was some suggestion by Mr Choong, Sandipala’s expert witness, that technical assistance must come from ST-AP, the ultimate supplier of the chips,

</div> it is unclear what purpose this suggestion was intended to serve. To the extent that this suggests an attempt to imply a term based on custom or usage, such an attempt must fail since Sandipala has not pleaded that ST-AP was under a specific contractual duty to render assistance and therefore had to take reasonable care in so doing. As for Oxel, Sandipala has not pleaded that the Agreement contained an express or implied term for Oxel to assist Sandipala in making the chips usable for the E-KTP Project. In the circumstances, its pleaded case that ST-AP or Oxel owed it a tortious duty of care to render assistance is incorrect as a matter of law and it is not entitled to any relief in this regard.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">189 </span>Before leaving this issue, I note in passing that Sandipala had dropped its negligence claim against Oxel completely in its Opening Statement which stated that its claim against Oxel is for damages arising out of (a) Oxel’s breach of the Agreement; (b) fraudulent or negligent misrepresentation; (c) conspiracy by unlawful means to injure Sandipala; and (d) alternatively, that there was a unilateral mistake in the formation of the Agreement.

Further, the allegation that the defendants intended to offload on Sandipala chips that were meant for a wholly separate project finds no support in the evidence.

In this regard, I accept Oxel’s point that none of Sandipala’s witnesses have given evidence that the said delivery order was indeed received with the first shipment. In any case, the delivery order on its own would not suffice to establish on a balance of probabilities that the first three shipments contained 18kb chips, especially since the Chilitag documents clearly point to a different conclusion. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">194 </span>Second, Sandipala claimed that the absence of an end-user statement for Oxel’s chips meant that the chips had not been exported from Singapore and gave rise to suspicions that they were imported into Indonesia for another purpose and use by another party.

</div> Sandipala suggests that it is a legal requirement for Oxel to ask Sandipala to endorse an end-user statement for the export of chips from Singapore. However, I note that the shipping documents that have been disclosed by Oxel show that the chips in the present case originated from Taiwan and were transported to Singapore before being shipped to Sandipala in Jakarta.

</div> This submission falls away in the light of my earlier finding that Sandipala was aware (and therefore could not have been labouring under a mistake of fact) that Oxel’s chips would not work unless changes to the E-KTP infrastructure were approved by the MHA but had nonetheless set out to purchase these chips, confident that the MHA would approve the relevant modifications to the E-KTP infrastructure. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Oxel’s counterclaims against Sandipala</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">196 </span>Oxel claims against Sandipala for failing to accept the shipments of chips and pay for them in accordance with the Agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">197 </span>A total of 19,426,284 chips were produced for Sandipala.

The reason why Sandipala had only made a down payment for the first 10m chips is simple — the purchase order stated:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Payment Terms:</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">20% Down Payment based on committed quantity <span class="font-italic">at the beginning of each quarter</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">80% Remaining upon arrival based on quantity</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">According to these payment terms, the down payment for the first 10m chips was due in the fourth quarter of 2011 since it was due to be delivered between “Q 4 2011 – Q1 2012”. The down payments for the remaining batches of chips would be payable at the beginning of subsequent quarters. Nothing on the face of the quotation or the purchase order suggests that the order for the remaining 90m chips would only be confirmed upon Sandipala’s payment of the subsequent tranches of down payments. In this regard, I accept Oxel’s submission that the payment structure had nothing to do with whether the order had been confirmed and I accept the evidence of Oxel’s witnesses that the reason for this payment structure was that Sandipala had limited working capital at the time and Oxel agreed to allow down payments to be made in tranches.

In that letter, Sandipala asked for a temporary reduction of “<span class="font-italic">our order of 100 million STM chips</span> … to the first 10 million chips that is due to arrive within the first quarter of 2012” [emphasis added]. If the order was indeed for a confirmed quantity of only 10m chips, Sandipala would have been entitled to cancel the unconfirmed order of 90m chips and it would not have sought a <span class="font-italic">temporary reduction</span> of the quantity of chips ordered. I find that the claim that Sandipala had placed a firm order for only the first 10m chips was an afterthought. It only surfaced in a letter sent on 19 January 2012 from Sandiapala to Oxel

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> It is well-established that the tort of conspiracy is constituted by the following elements set out in <span class="font-italic">Nagase Singapore Pte Ltd v Ching Kai Huat and others</span> [2008] 1 SLR(R) 80 (“<span class="font-italic">Nagase</span>”) at [23]:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a)  a combination of two or more persons and an agreement between and amongst them to do certain acts;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) if the conspiracy involves lawful acts, then the predominant purpose of the conspirators must be to cause damage or injury to the plaintiff but if the conspiracy involves unlawful means, then such predominant intention is not required;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the acts must actually be performed in furtherance of the agreement; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) damage must be suffered by the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">212 </span>It is also settled law that a company could be regarded as co-conspirator with its directors. In <span class="font-italic">Nagase</span>, Judith Prakash J (as she then was), held that there could be a conspiracy between a company and its controlling director to damage a third party by unlawful means notwithstanding that the director might have been the moving spirit of the company<span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [22]). <span class="font-italic">Nagase</span> was followed in <span class="font-italic">Lim Leong Huat v Chip Hup Hup Kee Construction Pte Ltd </span>[2009] 2 SLR(R) 318 in which Andrew Ang J added his observations on this point of law. Ang J drew a distinction between the situation where the company is a victim of the alleged conspiracy and the situation where it is not and has in fact benefited from the conspiracy. His observations in this regard (at [23] and [24]) are apposite:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">23 … where the company is a <span class="font-italic">victim</span> of an alleged conspiracy of its directors and sues its directors for breach of duties, the company does not become a co-conspirator with its directors just because its directors are the conspirators: see also <span class="font-italic">Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 19th Ed, 2006) … at para 25–119. The rationale underlying such an interpretation is that it prevents the company’s errant directors from otherwise escaping liability by contending that, as co-conspirator, the plaintiff tortfeasor company cannot sue the errant tortfeasor directors for damages resulting from the directors’ conspiracy.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">24     However, the position is different where the company and its directors are in an established arrangement which benefits the company, to the detriment of third parties. In this case, the company is no longer a victim of an alleged conspiracy of its directors. Instead, the third party is the victim of the alleged conspiracy between the company and its directors. Taking a leaf from the reasoning of McCarthy J in [<span class="font-italic">Sydney Taylor v Philip Smyth </span>[1991] 1 IR 142]), I can see no reason why the assets of a limited company and/or that of its errant director, even where such a director is the controlling mind of the company, should not be liable to answer for conspiracy where either or both of their assets have been augmented as a result of the action alleged to constitute the conspiracy.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">213 </span>In view of the above, I consider it a settled principle of law that a company (such as Sandipala) can be liable as a co-conspirator along with its controlling directors and this is even more so in a case such as the present where the alleged conspiracy (if established) would have benefited Sandipala to the detriment of Oxel. Since this point has not been taken up by Sandipala, I say no more on it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">214 </span>In the present case, Oxel must show that there was an agreement between the defendants (by counterclaim) to pursue a particular course of conduct and that concerted action was taken pursuant to that agreement. The agreement need not be express: it can be tacit and inferred from the parties’ overt acts and the surrounding circumstances: <span class="font-italic">EFT Holdings, Inc and another v Marinteknik Shipbuilders (S) Pte Ltd and another </span>[2014] 1 SLR 860<span class="font-italic"> </span>(“<span class="font-italic">EFT Holdings</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [113]. Since Oxel’s claim is for a conspiracy by unlawful means, it follows from the above (see [210]) that a predominant intention to cause damage or injury is not required. Instead, the requisite mental element is that the injury to the claimant must have been intended as a means to an end or an end in itself (see <span class="font-italic">EFT Holdings </span>at [101]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">215 </span>On the facts of the present case, I am satisfied that an inference can be drawn that Sandipala, Mr Tannos and Ms Tannos had an agreement to extricate Sandipala from its contractual obligations and had taken concerted action towards that end. I am, however, not satisfied that Mrs Rawung had participated in that conspiracy.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Acts in furtherance of the alleged conspiracy</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">216 </span>I accept Oxel’s submission that there was indeed a paper trail that appeared to have been created so as to found a claim against Oxel. Shortly after Sandipala had its request for a temporary reduction of its order of 100m chips rejected, Sandipala (through a letter signed by Ms Tannos) tried a different tack and stated that there was only a firm order for 10m chips and that the order for the remaining 90m chips would only be confirmed upon further down payments.

</div> I do not think that Ms Tannos held a genuine belief in her claim that Sandipala’s order was only confirmed to the extent of 10m chips. Her claim is obviously contrary to her previous letter on 10 January 2012 in which there was an implicit recognition that Sandipala had ordered 100m chips and was requesting for a temporary reduction of its order.

During that meeting, Mr Tannos asked whether Sandipala could make payment for 40m chips in 2012 and for the remaining 40m chips in 2013,

</div> These attempts were clearly intended to convey a different impression of what had been agreed and to suggest that it was Oxel’s (instead of Sandipala’s) responsibility to ensure that its chips would work with the E-KTP infrastructure.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">222 </span>The next plank of Oxel’s case is that there was a conspiracy to bring a false, trumped up claim to apply pressure on Oxel. This aspect of Oxel’s case is also accepted. Initially, Sandipala pleaded that it had lost profits of US$11.8m from the reduction in its work allocation on 19 December 2011 and that this reduction was the result of Oxel’s breaches of the Agreement. However, it later transpired that the first delivery of Oxel’s chips only took place on 22 December 2011 and thus there could not have been a causal link between the alleged discovery that Oxel’s chips could not work and the reduction in Sandipala’s work allocation.

</div> As has been established above, Sandipala had ordered a specific kind of chips and had been delivered those chips and there is therefore no basis for Mr Tannos’ suggestion that the chips delivered were not the kind he ordered. Further, while Mr Tannos initially denied that he had supplied information to the Tempo, he admitted in the end that he had “met Tempo reporter for a short period of time. It can be considered chatting, it can be considered interview, but for short period of time”.

In the present case, the Agreement was evidenced by Sandipala’s purchase order and Oxel’s quotation. Under Sandipala’s purchase order, the chips were sold by Oxel on an “<span class="font-italic">ex-works</span>” basis.

</div> Oxel’s quotation is also endorsed “EXW Singapore” under the heading “Shipment Terms”. Whilst the latter endorsement was not raised in cross examination, I am satisfied that it can only mean “<span class="font-italic">e</span><span class="font-italic">x-works</span> Singapore.” This makes sense since Oxel is a Singapore company and is also based in Singapore (see also Andrea Lista, <span class="font-italic">International Commercial Sales: The</span><span class="font-italic"> Sale of Goods on Shipment Terms</span> (Routledge, 2017) at p 8 where a sale on “EXW” terms is treated in the same way as a sale on “ex-works” terms).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">239 </span>Sale of goods on an “<span class="font-italic">ex</span><span class="font-italic">-works</span>” basis essentially means that the seller’s obligation is only to make the goods available at the <span class="font-italic">seller’s</span> premises. A sale of goods “<span class="font-italic">ex</span><span class="font-italic">-works</span>” can hardly be considered an export sale at all since it is the buyer’s duty to take delivery at the works in question: see John Adams and Hector MacQueen, <span class="font-italic">Atiyah’s Sale of Goods</span> (Pearson, 12th Ed, 2012)  (“<span class="font-italic">Atiyah</span>”) at p 408; see also <span class="font-italic">Benjamin </span>at para 21-003. It follows that seller is not responsible under the “<span class="font-italic">ex-works</span>” contract to make arrangements to send the goods to the buyer. The buyer is to arrange for the pickup from the supplier’s designated site and is also responsible for clearing customs and completion of export documentation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">240 </span>The situation in the present case is “unusual” in that according to Oxel, Sandipala requested Oxel to assist in making the arrangements to ship or transport the chips to Sandipala in Jakarta, even though the contract was on “<span class="font-italic">ex-works</span>” terms. This was apparently because Sandipala did not have contacts with freight forwarders in Singapore. It was for this reason that Oxel “obliged” and arranged for the chips to be delivered to Sandipala in Jakarta.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">241 </span>Oxel cited the English case <span class="font-italic">Sabaf SpA v MFI Furniture Centres Ltd </span>[2003] RPC 14 (“<span class="font-italic">Sabaf</span>”) on the effect of a sales contract entered into on “<span class="font-italic">ex-work</span><span class="font-italic">s</span>” terms. In that case, an issue arose as to whether the defendant seller was liable for patent infringement on the basis that it had imported the goods into the United Kingdom. The goods in question were made in Italy and sold on “<span class="font-italic">ex-</span><span class="font-italic">works</span>” terms to the English buyer. The English Court of Appeal held at [61] that title and risk in the goods passed as soon as the goods left the factory gate. Even though the defendant had made the relevant contract of carriage, it did so without having an ultimate interest in the goods. If property and risk had passed to the buyer before or at the beginning of the carriage, the contract of carriage is made on behalf of the buyer even if it is the seller who agrees that he will make the contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">242 </span>In the present case, I accept that the contract was entered into on an “<span class="font-italic">ex</span><span class="font-italic">-works</span>” basis and that it was Sandipala who requested Oxel to assist in arranging carriage to Jakarta for Sandipala. On this basis, based on <span class="font-italic">Sab</span><span class="font-italic">af</span>, I am satisfied that property passed to Sandipala when each shipment of chips left Oxel’s premises into the hands of the carrier or forwarder.

By the middle or late January 2012, Sandipala was changing its position from a request for a temporary halt or reduction of production to a bold assertion that Sandipala had only bound itself to purchase 10m chips. Thereafter, Oxel made several unsuccessful attempts to deliver chips in February, March and April 2012. On 27 February 2012, Oxel by letter demanded payment of the arrears due.

</div> Although there was a meeting in April 2012 between Mr Winata, Mr Tannos, Ms Tannos and Mr Cousin, the relationship between Oxel and Sandipala was already at a low ebb.

Oxel relies on s 49(2) of the SOGA which provides that a seller can maintain an action for the price where under the contract of sale, the price is payable on a day certain irrespective of delivery and the buyer wrongfully neglects or refuses to make payment, even though the property in the goods has not yet passed and the goods have not yet been appropriated to the contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">248 </span>The first question is whether the down payments provided for are to be treated as deposits or part payments of price. If they amount to deposits, tricky questions may follow as to whether the deposit is a forfeitable deposit. <span class="font-italic">Benjamin</span> at para 15-134 and <span class="font-italic">Atiyah </span>at p 553 state that that payments by way of earnest (as a forfeitable deposit) are not recoverable by the party in breach.

The purchaser paid 100,000<span class="font-italic">l </span>but thereafter, in breach of the contract, neither completed the payment of the purchase price nor took delivery of any rifles and ammunition. The vendors elected to treat the contract as at an end. It was held that the advance payment was not in the nature of deposit or earnest, but was a part-payment of the price, and that the purchaser was accordingly entitled to recover the sum subject to the defendants’ claim to damages for the purchaser’s breach of contract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">250 </span>The law on deposits, part-payments and the rights of the parties was not however dealt with in any detail by the parties in the submissions.

These include in particular whether the decision is best confined to a pure contract of sale of goods as opposed to a contract to manufacture and sell goods (contract for goods and services).The position in <span class="font-italic">Hyundai </span>was more complicated partly because the law lords adopted different approaches. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">253 </span>Beatson’s position is that the question of recoverability of a down payment is essentially a matter of construction (see also Donald Harris, David Campbell &amp; Roger Halson, <span class="font-italic">Remedies in Contract &amp; Tort</span> (Cambridge University Press, 2nd Ed, 2002) at p  150 that the rights should depend on the construction of the clause requiring advance payment: was the right to retain the payment intended to be conditional upon performance by the payee of his obligations or was it intended to be a security for performance of the payer’s obligations?) This is an approach which has found favour in recent English cases such as <span class="font-italic">Cadogan Petroleum Holdings Ltd v Global Process Systems LLC </span>[2013] EWHC 214 (Comm) (“<span class="font-italic">Cadogan</span>”) and<span class="font-italic"> Griffon Shipping LLC v Firodi Shipping Ltd </span>[2013] EWHC 593 (Comm) (“<span class="font-italic">Griffon</span>”).  For example, in <span class="font-italic">Griffon </span>at [16], the court held that in any case where the question is whether a payment which accrued due before termination remains payable after termination it will be necessary to construe the contract with a view to determining whether the obligation to pay accrued due unconditionally or conditionally. This will depend upon the nature of the contract and the purpose of the part-payment. For example, where the contract is a simple contract of sale the part-payment may be regarded as accruing due conditionally upon the contract of sale being performed. But an express term which provides that the part-payment remains payable will be given effect, as in <span class="font-italic">Cadogan</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">254 </span>In Singapore, the most recent Court of Appeal decision on this area is <span class="font-italic">Lee Chee Wei v Tan Hor Peow Victor and others and another appeal </span>[2007] 3 SLR(R) 537 (“<span class="font-italic">Lee Chee Wei</span>”). The law was stated at [84]–[85] as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">84  The invariable judicial approach to forfeitable deposits at common law is that the deposit will be forfeited to the payee upon the discharge of the contract on the default of the payer, irrespective of whether it would have been deemed part-payment had the contract been completed. The payer cannot insist on abandoning the contract and yet expect to recover the deposit as this would enable him to take advantage of his own wrong (<span class="font-italic">Howe v Smith</span> (1884) 27 Ch D 89 at 98). An advance payment, on the other hand, does not fall within the category of forfeitable deposits and is neither designed nor intended to secure performance (<span class="font-italic">Lim Lay Bee v Allgreen Properties Ltd</span> [1998] 3 SLR(R) 1028 (“<span class="font-italic">Lim Lay Bee</span>”)). This is underscored by the premise that the vendor is already amply protected by the recovery of damages he has sustained (<span class="font-italic">Dies v British and International Mining and Finance Corporation Limited</span> [1939] 1 KB 724). </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">85  Whether the sum of $750,000 is recoverable by the party in default if the contract is discharged by reason of his breach therefore depends upon the construction of the contract. The object that the parties had in mind must be ascertained (<span class="font-italic">Mayson v Clouet</span> [1924] AC 980). In the absence of any specific provision, recoverability of the $750,000 hinges on the nature of the payment (ie, whether payment is construed as a deposit entitling forfeiture upon default, or as an advance payment, which is returnable) as evinced by the intention of the parties expressed in the Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">255 </span>I should make clear that in coming to my decision, I make no comment on how Singapore law as set out in <span class="font-italic">Lee Chee Wei</span> should develop. This must await an appropriate case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">256 </span>In the present case, the contract was for a total committed quantity of 100m chips at a total price of US$60m.  The chips were to be delivered in stated quantities (of 10m, 30m, 30m, 30m) over four quarters (see [35(b)] above). Within any given quarter, it is evident that the specified quantity would be delivered over several lots or instalments. The payment terms provided for a 20% down payment based on the quantity specified for the quarter to be paid at the <span class="font-italic">beginning</span> of the quarter. The balance of 80% (for each quarter) was to be paid upon the quantity on delivery of the chips. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">257 </span>Even though detailed submissions were not made by the parties on the distinction between deposit and down payment, I am satisfied that the result will be the same whichever approach is taken. On the <span class="font-italic">Dies </span>approach, I am of the view that the down payments are clearly meant as advance payment of price, not deposits, and thus are mostly not claimable by Oxel. Even if the more recent English cases were followed, the question is whether the down payment was conditional upon the contract of sale being performed. This is a question of construction. In my view, the down payment was conditional upon the contract of sale being performed because there is no suggestion by Oxel that the down payment was a deposit, and such language does not appear on the face of the contract. Instead, the contract between Oxel and Sandipala is a simple contract of sale akin to <span class="font-italic">Dies</span>. The contract of sale for <span class="font-italic">most</span> of the Q1 2012 chips and all of the Q2 and Q3 2012 chips was not performed, and thus these down payments cannot be claimed by Oxel. Either way, it should be remembered that Oxel is not left hanging dry: its remedy is in damages, which it also pleaded for as an alternative head of claim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">258 </span>In the preceding paragraph, I have alluded to the fact that a small portion of the down payments remain claimable. I shall explain further here. It will be recalled that I have found that property in 12,331,778 chips (see [200] above) have passed from Oxel to Sandipala. In other words, in relation to these chips, the contract has been performed on Oxel’s part. Oxel is therefore entitled to the down payment for them. In this regard, Sandipala has made a down payment for Q4 2011 (see [35(c)] above), but this covered only the 10m chips delivered in that quarter (see [35(b)(i)] above). Oxel is still entitled to claim the down payment for the 2,331,778 chips (being 12,331,778 chips for which property has passed, less 10m chips for which down payment has been made). Accordingly, I allow the claim for down payments to the following extent: 2,331,778 chips x US$0.60 x 20% = US$279,813.36.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">259 </span>Leaving aside the price of the 11,263,289 chips which Oxel is entitled to, Oxel is also entitled to damages for the breach. This essentially comprises the claims for storage and freight, the consequential losses in respect of payments made to Danatel and Logii as well as for Oxel’s loss of profits on the remaining chips under the 100m order. I will examine each in turn. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Loss of profits and payments made to suppliers</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">Payments made to suppliers</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">260 </span>It will be recalled that Oxel had to place orders with Danatel and Logii in order to fulfil its contract with Sandipala. I reject Sandipala’s contention that Oxel is double claiming on their losses in respect of loss of profits and the payments Oxel has made to its suppliers, as will be evident from [273]–[276] below. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">261 </span>Oxel claims (a) sums that it has paid to its suppliers; and (b) loss of profits that it would otherwise have earned. These are two separate losses altogether. It will be useful to briefly illustrate this point by reference to <span class="font-italic">Todd</span><span class="font-italic"> Trading Pte Ltd v Aglow Far East Trading Pte Ltd</span> [1997] 1 SLR(R) 494 (“<span class="font-italic">Todd Trading</span>”), a case which Oxel has brought to my attention.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">262 </span> In <span class="font-italic">Todd Trading</span>, the defendant promised to buy a consignment of Vietnamese rice from the plaintiff. Subsequently, the defendant informed the plaintiff that the transaction was cancelled. The plaintiff had to cancel the contract with its supplier and paid compensation to its supplier. The court allowed the plaintiff’s claim for (a) its loss of profits it would have made if the defendant had not defaulted (<span class="font-italic">Todd Trading </span>at [47]); and (b) the compensation that it had paid to its supplier (<span class="font-italic">Todd Trading </span>at [53]). The latter head of damages was allowed on the basis that it was foreseeable by or within the contemplation of the defendant that if it defaulted, the plaintiff would have to pay compensation to their supplier (<span class="font-italic">Todd Trading </span>at [52]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">263 </span>In the present case, Sandipala knew that Oxel did not manufacture the chips that it had contracted to supply under the Agreement. In fact, it claims to have been told that Oxel was a distributor of ST-AP’s chips. Thus, it would be within Sandipala’s contemplation that Oxel would be liable to its own suppliers in relation to the chips that it had promised to supply to Sandipala. I am thus satisfied that Oxel is entitled to its claim for losses that it had incurred in meeting the payment obligations it owed to its suppliers.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">264 </span>In order to meet its obligations under the Agreement, Oxel entered into two contracts with its suppliers, Danatel and Logii. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">265 </span>Although (as Sandipala pointed out) Oxel’s contract with Danatel was entered into about five days before Oxel entered into the Agreement with Sandipala, it was clear from the evidence that Oxel’s contract with Danatel was entered into for the purposes of the Agreement (see [37] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">266 </span>The Danatel contract with Oxel was for 100m ST23YR12 chips encoded with the PAC operating system.

</div> It appears that this figure is based on 0.2 cents profit per chip (US$200,000 for 100m chips), given thatthe price charged by Oxel for the 100m chips to Sandipala was US$60m and the cost of acquisition of the chips from Danatel and Logii was US$59.8m.

Two points are significant. First, this allegation is a non-starter since it has not been pleaded. Secondly, whether Mr Winata and his family were the ultimate controllers/owners of Oxel, Danatel, Logii and Wahyu is a complete red herring. The question before the court is whether Oxel, as a company, has suffered any losses flowing from Sandipala’s breach of the Agreement; the court is therefore not concerned about whether Mr Winata or his family has sustained any overall losses from the same.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Storage costs</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">281 </span>The 7,094,506 chips that Oxel received from its suppliers between April and July 2012 are presently stored in a warehouse in Singapore.
