First, where only lawful pressure was used, it would be a “very rare case” for duress to be found simply because illegitimate economic duress generally requires proof of illegitimate pressure as opposed to mere commercial pressure (<span class="font-italic">E C Investment</span> at [47] and [51]). Second, lawful commercial pressure should not be mistaken for unlawful duress because the aim of the courts is to distinguish between agreements that are the result of mere commercial pressure and those entered into because of unfair exploitation (<span class="font-italic">E C Investment</span> at [52]). Third, in order to identify such unfair exploitation, the court can refer to the following factors (see <span class="font-italic">E C Investment</span> at [44], citing the Privy Council’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Pao</span><span class="font-italic"> On v Lau Yiu Long</span> [1980] AC 614 at 635–636):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Whether the party alleged to be coerced did or did not protest.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Whether, at the time that he was allegedly coerced, he had an alternative course open to him such as an adequate legal remedy.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Whether he was independently advised.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Whether after entering the contract he took steps to avoid it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 That said, I also accepted the Defendants’ submissions that illegitimate economic duress can be found even if the victim remains silent. When the victim has no other practical choice open to him but to submit to the pressure, then illegitimate pressure can be found even if the victim does not complain (see <span class="font-italic">Universe </span><span class="font-italic">Tankships Inc of Monrovia v International Transport Workers Federation and others</span> [1983] 1 AC 366

I shall now deal with each in turn.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The sums in the Settlement Agreement were not extravagant or unconscionable</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 The Defendants submitted that the total sums in the Settlement Agreement were extravagant or unconscionable because in a short span of three years they had ballooned from $3.3m to $4.75m. I did not accept these submissions. Although it is true that the absolute sums had increased, this must be seen in the context of three other facts:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the sums increased because the Defendants had failed to pay up on any of the loan agreements entered into between the Transaction Agreement and the Settlement Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, it was the Defendants who suggested and agreed to the principal sums of the various restructured loan agreements and the Settlement Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, the sum claimed in this case was only $3.25m, which is less than the original loan sum of $3.3m.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 The first pertinent point to note is that the Defendants had not paid the principal sums of any of the original and restructured loan agreements. The purpose of the various restructured loan agreements was so that the Plaintiff would gain from the interest and additional repayments, while the Defendants would have more time for the repayment of the loans. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 The second pertinent point is that the precise sum that would be payable under each of the restructured loan agreements was computed and proposed by the Defendants, and not by the Plaintiff. For instance, Yap mentioned in his affidavit that from the principal sum of $3.3m in the Transaction Agreement, he computed that Chua would be able to grow this sum to $4.4m. As a result, $4.4m became the principal sum in the First Supplemental Agreement.

Having recognised this, the Defendants were later able to negotiate these sums down to $6m (in the Second Supplemental Agreement (September)) and $4.75m (in the Settlement Agreement). Indeed, it was the Defendants themselves who calculated these sums and came up with these figures. This was not disputed. It therefore follows that the Defendants now cannot challenge the sum of $4.75m as extravagant or unconscionable given that it is a <span class="font-italic">discount</span> from the sum of $7.2m, which the Defendants themselves calculated was the rightful sum due to Chua and the Plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The third pertinent point is that the sum claimed by the Plaintiff is only $3.25m from the first failed payment under the Settlement Agreement. As the AR rightly noted, this sum was even <span class="font-italic">less</span> than the original loan sum of $3.3m under the Transaction Agreement. The Defendants did not challenge this sum for being unconscionable and even admitted that they owed the Plaintiff $3.3m. Essentially, at these proceedings, the Plaintiff’s claim was for $3.25m, which was less than the principal sum of $3.3m. It is irrelevant for this court to speculate whether the Plaintiff would commence court proceedings for the balance of $1.5m in the future as this matter was not before the court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Hence, even at the stage of a summary judgment application, where the Defendants needed only to show that there was a triable issue, I found that there was no triable issue that the sums were extravagant or unconscionable. I would reiterate that it was the Defendants who computed and had come up with the respective sums in the various restructured loan agreements. Given these undisputed facts, it would be extremely difficult for the Defendants to show that there was illegitimate economic duress in this case since the acts that they relied on were lawful means exerted by the Plaintiff to seek legal recourse for the return of her loan. Having set out this background, I shall now examine the facts in this case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Chua did not apply any illegitimate pressure on the Defendants in entering the Settlement Agreement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The Defendants submitted that Chua applied illegitimate pressure on them by (a) threatening to take legal action in situations where he knew that they could not afford the spectre of such legal action, and (b) demanding his money back in situations where he knew that they were financially strapped. The Defendants submitted that this constituted illegitimate economic duress that vitiated the Settlement Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Before addressing the Defendants’ submissions, I shall deal first with a preliminary point raised by the Plaintiff, namely, that the court should not take into account events that happened in the lead-up to the other restructured loan agreements in deciding whether there was illegitimate economic duress for the Settlement Agreement (see [15] above). I agreed with the Plaintiff to the extent that the ultimate inquiry was whether there was duress in entering the Settlement Agreement and not the other restructured loan agreements. However, the circumstances in which the other restructured loan agreements had been entered into could be relevant in assessing the context in which the Settlement Agreement was entered into.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 But even looking at the circumstances in totality, I did not agree with the Defendants that there was evidence of illegitimate pressure to form a triable issue. To begin with, I did not think that the Plaintiff or Chua had exerted any illegitimate pressure on the Defendants although Chua might have been anxious to get the money back. It is understandable that Chua was concerned since the Defendants had not paid any sum over the last three years although the parties had entered into various restructured loan agreements culminating in the Settlement Agreement. To the contrary, the evidence suggests that the Defendants were the ones that boldly asserted their wishes in the dealings between the parties.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Transaction Agreement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 The Transaction Agreement appeared to have come about as Chua seemed interested in the Defendants’ business. At the very least, Chua had envisioned that the Defendants’ company would attempt an IPO in the near future.

The parties took several rounds of negotiations to eventually arrive at the Transaction Agreement dated 25 February 2014, by which the loan sum of $3.3m, with interest of 15% per annum, could be repaid by $2.5m in convertible shares and the remaining $800,000 exchanged into existing shares.

</div> At that time, Chua began to exert financial pressure on the Defendants especially when he knew that the Defendants’ business had too many financial commitments. Therefore, the Defendants had no choice but to appeal to Chua to work out an alternative arrangement in the First Supplemental Agreement dated 26 June 2015, where the Defendants proposed that the loan sum be increased from $3.3m to $4.4m.

</div> This argument is entirely mistaken. That email, which was sent in May 2015, spoke of the $4.4m that was rightly due under the First Supplemental Agreement by 31 December 2015. It was not about the Transaction Agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Instead, as I have earlier noted, it appeared that the Defendants volunteered the sum of $4.4m to be what Chua should have gotten from his investment at the time the First Supplemental Agreement was entered into (see [23] above).

Subsequently, the borrower faced difficulty in the payment of this loan. Thus the Taiwanese lender chased Chua, the guarantor, for the payment of the loan and Chua in turn looked towards the Defendants for the repayment of the various restructured loan agreements.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Restated Loan Agreement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The Defendants attempted to weave a similar story when it came to the Restated Loan Agreement.

</div> Like the earlier loan agreements, far from the Defendants being forced to enter into the Restated Loan Agreement, this agreement was an olive branch extended to them by Chua. The Defendants themselves negotiated the interest rate upwards to make up for the shares that they could not pledge. Having negotiated the terms, the Defendants could not now complain about them.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Second Supplemental Agreement (March)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The Restated Loan Agreement was later restructured into the Second Supplemental Agreement (March) when the Defendants again failed to pay. It should be noted that the Plaintiff did not sign the Second Supplemental Agreement (March). The Defendants also attempted to characterise this Second Supplemental Agreement (March) as containing “onerous and oppressive terms” that Chua imposed by the spectre of legal action hanging over the Defendants. This alleged threat was made by Chua in an email dated 22 February 2016 in which he proposed an extension until 15 March 2016 with $2m to be paid in the first tranche and the remainder by April 2016, with all interest continuing at 7.5% per month and a further additional default interest of 3% on outstanding amounts after 30 April 2016.

The parties’ correspondence instead showed that the Defendants had, once again, been unable to pay up on the sum in the Restated Loan Agreement by end February 2016 and again began to negotiate with Chua for an extended loan period. The following correspondence bears this out:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) On 26 January 2016, Chua sent an email to Yap and Ng inquiring about the repayment as there was “radio silence” since the last promise of repayment by the Defendants. One day later, Ng replied to say that the Defendants were “working on a full payment with the funds coming in anytime now to mid Feb” and that the “interest shall follow and prorate till the full amount is cleared”.

Instead, Chua helped to intercede to extend the loan repayment period for the Defendants’ benefit and even paid the relevant legal fees. It was <span class="font-italic">Ng</span> who had suggested that the payment could be due by mid-March 2016. Finally, far from being intimidated by the potential lawsuit, Ng had fired back that the Defendants were also familiar with senior legal counsel, having engaged their services for lawsuits in the past. This was not the behaviour of a party who was being pressured into entering yet another loan agreement. The evidence suggests that the Defendants stood firm in their inability to pay and Chua was the one left scrambling to help both the Defendants and the Taiwanese lender.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Second Supplemental Agreement (September)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Under the Second Supplemental Agreement (March), the Defendants had to pay the first tranche of $2m by 15 March 2016 and the remaining amounts by 30 April 2016. The Defendants again did not make any such payment. They claimed that they had tried to do so but were reeling from the pressure that Chua had put on them, although they alleged that they eventually managed to pay $500,000 by August 2016. Despite this, Chua continued to exert intense pressure on them, which culminated in the even more onerous terms of the Second Supplemental Agreement (September) which the Defendants had no choice but to sign.

Ng said that the Defendants could only pay $880,000 by 15 March and the balance of $1.12m by the end of March, but at the same time tried to extract a promise from Chua that there would be no demand letter, otherwise the $880,000 would not be paid:

Instead they apologised and asked for extensions of time from Chua and the Taiwanese lender, blaming their misfortunes on third parties. Whenever the payment on the loan agreements became imminent, the Defendants would drag out the payment and urged Chua and the Taiwanese lender not to take legal action. They would entice Chua with favourable restructured loan agreements so as to prolong the repayment period. The negotiations for repayment could drag on for months on end by the Defendants but would only result into another restructured loan agreement and not any repayment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 I therefore did not accept the Defendants’ submissions that they were coerced into entering the Second Supplemental Agreement (September).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Settlement Agreement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 I turn finally to the Settlement Agreement itself. Although, as I have mentioned above, the crux of the issue before me was whether the Settlement Agreement (and not all the other loan agreements) was entered into by illegitimate economic duress (see [29] above), I have chosen to set out the parties’ dealings in the lead-up to the Settlement Agreement for several reasons. First, to show that Chua did not exert illegitimate economic pressure on the Defendants in the events that led to the Settlement Agreement. This makes it even more unlikely that there could be a build-up of illegitimate pressure that culminated in the Defendants having no practical choice but to enter into the Settlement Agreement (see [19] above). Second, to show that Chua was not the aggressor. Third, the Defendants’ pattern of behaviour revealed that they had repeatedly taken advantage of Chua’s goodwill in order to delay the repayment of the loan. These findings are significant when assessing whether Chua had exerted illegitimate economic duress and/or illegitimate pressure in the signing of the Settlement Agreement with the Defendants. I shall now focus on the Settlement Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The Defendants’ position was that the Settlement Agreement was a culmination of a series of loan agreements, in which the Plaintiff had, through Chua, “imposed unconscionable terms including, extortionate interest rates and amounts with continuing threats of legal action, which [Chua] knew would totally destroy [Yap]”.

</div> Specifically, the Settlement Agreement required the Defendants to pay a ballooned sum of $4.75m (an increase from the original loan sum of $3.3m), and the Settlement Agreement itself was extracted from the Defendants by illegitimate pressure exerted on account of their vulnerable financial position.

</div> I find this to be true. The communications exhibited by the Defendants relating to the Settlement Agreement only contained emails between the parties’ solicitors and Yap. Chua was not involved. Therefore, this makes it even more unlikely that there was illegitimate economic duress at this stage, since both parties were dealing at arms’ length with the benefit of legal advice (see [18(c)] above). Chua had also stopped communicating directly with the Defendants. Thus the Defendants needed to show that Chua had exerted such illegitimate pressure <span class="font-italic">through his lawyers</span>, which was an extremely high bar.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 No such evidence was shown.

</div> Whether this letter is genuine is of no relevance here because even if it had been sent and received, it was sent on 2 August 2017 which is after the writ of summons was filed. It has no relevance to whether the Settlement Agreement was entered into by illegitimate economic duress.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Instead, the contrary was shown by a series of messages exhibited by Chua. In an exchange on 20 June 2017, ten days before the first tranche of $3.25m was due under the Settlement Agreement, Yap seemed to have apologised for the Defendants’ inability to make payment yet again. And in another message sent on 19 July 2017, after the $3.25m was due but had not been paid, Yap acknowledged the need to make payments in order for any further extensions to even be considered.

</div> While I note that these messages were also after the Settlement Agreement had been entered into, they are significant in that the Defendants’ attitude was not that they had been forced into the Settlement Agreement by illegitimate pressure amounting to illegitimate economic duress, but that they were apologetic for their failure to meet the obligations that they had agreed upon. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Accordingly, I found that there was insufficient evidence to raise even a triable issue of illegitimate economic duress or any other triable issues.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Finally, I shall address a case that the Plaintiff cited, <span class="font-italic">Real Estate Consortium </span><span class="font-italic">Pte Ltd v East Coast Properties Pte Ltd</span> <span class="font-italic">and </span><span class="font-italic">another </span>[2011] 2 SLR 758 (“<span class="font-italic">Real Estate Consortium</span>”).

</div>
</div> This case is highly relevant as the factual matrix is very similar to the present case. The dispute in <span class="font-italic">Real Estate Consortium</span> arose from a convertible bond agreement entered into by the plaintiff and the two defendants. The defendants were unable to repay the principal amount and the parties entered into negotiations. After the negotiations the parties entered into a settlement agreement. The defendants delivered four post-dated cheques for the amounts owed pursuant to a payment schedule in the settlement agreement, but the defendants defaulted on three of those cheques. At the trial, the defendants argued that they entered into the settlement agreement under illegitimate economic duress as they were concerned with the threat of legal proceedings allegedly made by the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Andrew Ang J found that there was not an iota of evidence of illegitimate economic duress for the following reasons (<span class="font-italic">Real Estate Consortium</span> at [44]–[50]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) <span class="font-italic">Prima facie</span> the threat of legal action to enforce one’s legal rights is not a wrongful threat.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The defendants were the ones who initiated the offer to settle and until the commencement of the action, the defendants had never disputed the plaintiff’s rights under the settlement agreement. Indeed, the defendants’ actions were inconsistent with a plea of illegitimate economic duress; instead of protesting that the settlement agreement was made under duress, the defendants actually requested an extension of time to make the repayments.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The defendants had the benefit of independent legal advice throughout the process of negotiating the terms of the settlement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 All these features can be found in the present case. Furthermore, there was not an iota of evidence of illegitimate economic duress here. The plea of illegitimate economic duress in the present case is even weaker than <span class="font-italic">Real Estate Consortium</span>, because the Defendants did not protest in the negotiations of the Settlement Agreement and the various restructured loan agreements over the long period of three years. Similarly, I found that the Defendants had not satisfied the court that there was a triable issue of illegitimate economic duress or any triable issue. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 In summary, I dismissed the appeal against the AR’s decision and rejected the Defendants’ plea that there was a triable issue of illegitimate economic duress for the following reasons:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The sums in the Settlement Agreement were not extravagant or unconscionable as the Defendants were the ones who had calculated and volunteered these sums. The sum of $3.25m that the Plaintiff claimed was also lower than the original loan sum of $3.3m, and this figure was not contested by the Defendants.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Chua did not exert illegitimate pressure amounting to illegitimate economic duress in the process of negotiating the loan agreements and the Settlement Agreement. If anything, it was the Defendants who used the spectre of non-payment to extract promises of non-litigation from Chua and the Taiwanese lender.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The Defendants had the benefit of independent legal advice. Further, at the point of negotiating the Settlement Agreement, Chua had stopped communicating with the Defendants directly and had done so only through his lawyers. This made it even more unlikely that the Defendants were under illegitimate economic duress.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 In my view, this appeal is completely unmeritorious. It is a further attempt by the Defendants to delay repayment of the loan to the Plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 I ordered fixed costs at $10,000 to the Plaintiff (inclusive of disbursements) for RA 301. As for Summons No 4882 of 2017, which is a summons for a stay of execution of the AR’s order, it was no longer necessary considering the orders that I have made in RA 301. I made no costs order for this summons.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Tan Siong Thye<br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Reshma Nair and Benjamin Niroshan Bala (TSMP Law Corporation) for the plaintiff;<br/>Liew Teck Huat and Anand George (Niru &amp; Co LLC) for the defendants.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
