Despite the advantage of anonymity they can provide, the risks in such nominee arrangements are quite clear and the trust reposed in the nominee can often be easily exploited in a variety of ways, especially for wrongful financial gain.

She later claimed that the account had been “hacked” and that all the moneys were lost.  As a result, the plaintiff only discovered the details of the Unauthorised Transfers out of the second defendant’s DBS Bank account in May 2019, after the relevant documents were provided by DBS Bank Ltd to the plaintiff pursuant to the latter’s pre-action disclosure application in HC/OS 1564/2018.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The trial and closing submissions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The trial of this matter was heard remotely over the online platform “Zoom” from 17 to 26 November 2020.  This was because the plaintiff, his two factual witnesses (Mr Jackson and Ms Flynn) and the first defendant were all based overseas, and would have found difficulty travelling to Singapore because of the Covid-19 restrictions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 At the end of the trial, I gave directions for the parties to file and exchange their written closing submissions and reply submissions.  Just two days before the closing submissions were due, the defendants’ solicitors and counsel, Mr Keith Hsu and Mr Edison Tam from Emerald Law, applied to discharge themselves.  An Assistant Registrar made an order granting that application on the next day.  The plaintiff duly filed his closing submissions on time, but the defendants did not.  When contacted by the Registry, the first defendant then replied by email to state that she did not “wish to hold up the courts any further and so will not file the written submissions”.  As such, I was left unassisted by the defendants in terms of submissions on the issues that I had to decide in this matter.       </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The issues</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 From my review of the parties’ cases, the central issues that I have to decide in order to resolve the dispute between the parties are as follows.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Had the first defendant agreed to act as the nominee of the plaintiff in relation to the setting up of the second defendant?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) If so, had the first defendant breached her obligations by causing the Unauthorised Transfers and Continuous Unauthorised Transfers to be transferred out of the DBS Bank account of the second defendant and refusing to relinquish control of the second defendant to the plaintiff?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Does the doctrine of illegality bar the plaintiff’s claims against the defendants?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 There are also other issues which arise from the alternative claims made by the plaintiff, namely whether the first defendant has been unjustly enriched and whether the defendants are liable for unlawful means conspiracy.  I will proceed to determine those issues only if it becomes necessary to do so.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The applicable law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 The plaintiff pleaded that the first defendant acted as agent and trustee of the plaintiff and that she breached both her contractual and fiduciary duties as nominee.  It is trite that an agency refers to a relationship, often undergirded by a contractual agreement, where one party is able to act for<span class="font-italic"> </span>another party: see <span class="font-italic">Tonny Permana v One Tree Capital Management Pte Ltd and another</span> [2021] SGHC 37 (“<span class="font-italic">Tonny Permana</span>”) at [91], citing Tan Cheng Han SC, <span class="font-italic">The Law of Agency </span>(Academy Publishing, 2nd Ed, 2017) (“<span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Han</span>”) at para 01.008.  The issue of whether an agency relationship exists is a matter to be determined <span class="font-italic">objectively</span> as a matter of law from what the parties said and did.  Thus, the parties will be deemed to have consented to such a relationship even if they were ignorant of or did not intend the consequences of their action: <span class="font-italic">Ding Auto Pte Ltd v Yip Kin Lung and others</span> [2019] SGHC 243<span class="font-italic"> </span>(“<span class="font-italic">Ding Auto</span>”) at [131], citing <span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Han</span> at para 01.011.  Whilst a defining characteristic of agency is the control exerted by the principal over the scope of the agent’s authority, an agency relationship can arise even if the agreement between the parties gives full discretion to the agent in the exercise of the agent’s authority: <span class="font-italic">Ding Auto</span> at [132], citing <span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Han </span>at para 01.020.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 As a result of being able to act for the principal, and thereby affect the principal’s position and interests, the law imposes various duties on agents for the protection of the principal, such as fiduciary duties, duties of skill and care, and any contractual duties stipulated in the agreement between the agent and principal.  Each unique agency relationship will be accompanied by distinct sets of rights and obligations.  For instance, while the relationship of agent and principal is one of the established categories of fiduciary relationships, not every agent will owe fiduciary duties, and the presumption that a fiduciary relationship exists in an agency relationship can be rebutted by the particular facts of the case: <span class="font-italic">Susilawati v American Express Bank Ltd</span> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 737 (“<span class="font-italic">Susilawati</span>”) at [40].  The three common features of a fiduciary relationship are that (<span class="font-italic">Susilawati</span> at [41]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the fiduciary has scope for the exercise of some discretion or power;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the fiduciary can unilaterally exercise that power or discretion so as to affect the beneficiary’s legal or practical interests; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the beneficiary is peculiarly vulnerable to or at the mercy of the fiduciary holding the discretion or power.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Therefore, the “critical feature” of a fiduciary relationship is that (<span class="font-italic">Susilawati</span> at [41], quoting Mason J in <span class="font-italic">Hospital Products Ltd v United States Surgical Corporation</span> (1984) 156 CLR 41 at 96-97):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the fiduciary undertakes or agrees to act for or on behalf of or in the interests of another person in the exercise of a power or discretion which will affect the interests of that other person in a legal or practical sense. The relationship between the parties is therefore one which gives the fiduciary a special opportunity to exercise the power or discretion to the detriment of that other person who is accordingly vulnerable to abuse by the fiduciary of his position. [emphasis in original omitted]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Therefore, in general, the more extensive<span class="font-italic"> </span>the agency relationship, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the greater an agent’s authority or ability to affect the principal’s interests, the more onerous the duties imposed upon the agent will be: <span class="font-italic">Tonny Permana</span> at [94].  Where an agent is able to unilaterally and significantly affect his principal’s position or interests and has been conferred such powers in trust and confidence, extensive fiduciary duties may arise.  On the other hand, where the agent has limited authority and discretion, the agent will owe few, if any, fiduciary duties: <span class="font-italic">Tonny Permana</span> at [99].  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 An agent may have “actual authority”, either express or implied, or “apparent authority” (also known as “ostensible authority”) to bind his principal.  The plaintiff has relied on actual authority in this case (see [27] above).  Express actual authority flows from the parties’ explicit agreement on what the agent is authorised to do on behalf of the principal.  The scope of an agent’s implied authority depends on the circumstances of each case, including the parties’ words and conduct towards each other.  Where authority is implied, it is usually because it is “necessary to enable the agent to effectively perform the task for which the agent had been appointed”: <span class="font-italic">Lew, Solomon v Kaikhushru Shiavax Nargolwala and others and another appeal </span>[2021] SGCA(I) 1 at [47], affirming <span class="font-italic">Alphire Group Pte Ltd v Law Chau Loon and another matter</span> [2020] SGCA 50 at [7] and <span class="font-italic">Singapore Salvage Engineers Pte Ltd v North Sea Drilling Singapore Pte Ltd</span> [2016] SGHC 5 at [14].  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 With these applicable legal principles outlined, I now turn to examine (a) whether an agency agreement existed between the plaintiff and the first defendant because the first defendant agreed, whether explicitly or impliedly, to be a nominee for the plaintiff; and, if so, (b) whether the first defendant breached any of her duties as agent (contractual or fiduciary) owed to the plaintiff by making the Unauthorised Transfers and the Continuous Unauthorised Transfers.  The determination of the second question necessarily involves an examination of what the first defendant, as agent for the plaintiff, was authorised – expressly or impliedly – to do on behalf of the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Did the first defendant agree to be a nominee for the plaintiff?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 The plaintiff pleaded and attested that the terms of the plaintiff’s engagement of the first defendant were set out in WhatsApp messages exchanged between Mr Jackson, on behalf of the plaintiff, and the first defendant from 7 June 2018 to 16 July 2018 (the “Agency Agreement”), and included but were not limited to the following.

</div>  In my judgment, this was an untenable position to take.  It is quite clear from the WhatsApp messages that the first defendant knew and agreed to be a nominee for one of Mr Jackson’s “clients”.  Critically, she did not ask whom the client was, nor did she appear to care.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 I was not able to accept the first defendant’s objections about the authenticity of the signed Mandatory Declaration or the email exchanges with Mr Jackson about this document.  The plaintiff has produced a copy of the signed Mandatory Declaration.  There has been a reasonable explanation by the plaintiff and Mr Jackson as to why the original signed version could not be produced.  From a visual comparison of the signature on the copy of the Mandatory Declaration adduced in evidence with the first defendant’s signature in her affidavit of evidence-in-chief, it would appear that the first defendant’s signature closely resembles the signature that is on the signed Mandatory Declaration.  In such circumstances, I find that the evidential burden had shifted to the defendants to adduce evidence to show that the signature in the disputed document is a forgery.  Indeed, this is also consistent with <span class="font-italic">Alwie Handoyo v Tjong Very Sumito and another and another appeal </span>[2013] 4 SLR 308 at [157], where the Court of Appeal held that the burden of proof is on the party alleging forgery to prove the forgery.  This could have been done, for instance, with expert handwriting evidence.  For reasons best known to the defendants, this was not done.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 In fact, despite such a serious allegation that there has been forgery of her signature, I find it puzzling that the first defendant did not make a police report in Singapore.  When asked by the plaintiff’s counsel why she did not do so, I find that the first defendant could not come up with any credible explanation – the only excuse she could muster was that she “spen[t] all [her] money and [her] efforts to clear [her] name”.

</div>  This is not only a convenient excuse but also, more importantly, illogical and incredible, since filing a police report would not incur much, if any, extra cost for the first defendant.  As such, I was not inclined to believe her allegation that her signature had been forged on the Mandatory Declaration.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Significantly, the defendants’ treatment of the email evidence is more damaging to their case.  The plaintiff gave discovery of the email exchanges of 29 August 2018 between the first defendant and Mr Jackson.  The native copies of the emails have been with Mr Jackson all this while.  However, the defendants did not even bother to inspect the native copies of the emails.  Neither did they call any forensic expert to prove their rather serious allegations that the emails were doctored.  That being the case, it is quite clear to me that the defendants have utterly failed to prove that the first defendant did <span class="font-italic">not</span> sign the Mandatory Declaration and email a scanned copy of the document over to Mr Jackson, as the emails show quite starkly.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The terms of the Mandatory Declaration spell out the first defendant’s acknowledgment that she is a nominee in respect of her shareholding in the second defendant.

In exchange, 20% of the sales revenue of the second defendant would remain in the second defendant and be shared equally between herself and Mr Jackson.  The first defendant was purportedly unaware of the substantial banking transactions that had taken place in the DBS Bank account of the second defendant in October 2018 because these were all effected by Mr Jackson or Ms Flynn.  Amongst other things, Dr Meier demanded, on behalf of the first defendant, proof of the identity of the “ultimate beneficial owner” and also for her “part of the margin of the transactions”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 In my view, the email of 14 November 2018 from Dr Meier contained clear admissions on the part of the first defendant that she was merely a nominee in respect of her shareholding and directorship in the second defendant.  When cross-examined on this email, the first defendant made what can only be described as an outrageous attempt to explain away its contents.  She claimed that it was not Dr Meier who wrote and sent the email in question.  Instead, she had asked someone to impersonate Dr Meier and to compose and send the email.  When pressed, she could not even name the person she had purportedly asked to impersonate Dr Meier.  She claimed that she did not even know the imposter’s last name.  She claimed that she did not give the imposter instructions about what exactly to state in the email.  She tried to disassociate herself from the email’s contents by claiming that it was all thought up by the imposter, and that she did not even read a draft of the email before he sent it out.

</div>  This is clear evidence that the first defendant had instructed Dr Meier around this period of time to represent her in dealing with the demand made by the plaintiff and Mr Jackson.  That the transfer of funds to Dr Meier was on 12 November 2018, and the dates of Dr Meier’s abovementioned emails to the plaintiff were on 9 and 14 November 2018, is too much of a coincidence.  I thus reject the first defendant’s claims regarding Dr Meier.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The alleged online outsourcing agreement with Mr Jackson</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 A significant part of the first defendant’s case was that Mr Jackson had agreed to set up an online business for her, and this was done using, amongst other companies, EPS Hong Kong and the second defendant.  Hence, the first defendant claimed that the second defendant (and EPS Hong Kong) belonged entirely to her.  In return, the first defendant and Mr Jackson would allegedly share in the profits generated by the online business.

As already mentioned, the first defendant’s communications with Mr Jackson were mostly in the form of WhatsApp messages and emails.  But there is nothing in those written communications that even hinted at the existence of such an agreement between Mr Jackson and the first defendant that he would set up these companies for her benefit.  In fact, quite the contrary, as I have already found, the written communications are entirely consistent with Mr Jackson’s evidence that the first defendant was acting as a nominee for one of his clients.  Further, despite the first defendant’s claims that she was actively running an online business involving the sale of health and beauty products, she was not able to show <span class="font-italic">any</span> documents at all to substantiate her claims.  In fact, she could not even name any of her suppliers or service providers that she used, let alone produce any documents from any of these entities.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Not only that, the first defendant’s evidence as to the terms of the alleged agreement with Mr Jackson fluctuated over time.  Dr Meier’s email of 14 November 2018, which I have already referred to above, stated that 20% of the sales generated by the second defendant’s business would be shared equally with Mr Jackson.  In her email of 5 April 2019 sent to the plaintiff’s solicitors in response to their letter before action, the first defendant claimed that Mr Jackson and her had agreed that she would get “10% of GROSS revenues from the online business”.

</div>  I reject this explanation as being all too convenient.  Further, that might explain the figure of 10% but it did not explain why there was a reference to gross revenues instead of profits.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Critically, and worst of all, the first defendant’s allegation that she had an agreement with Mr Jackson for him to set up an online business with her was not even put to Mr Jackson when he was cross-examined, even though this is an important part of the first defendant’s case.  As such, it ought to have been put to Mr Jackson for him to be given the opportunity to respond.  It is trite that the rule in <span class="font-italic">Browne v Dunn</span> (1893) 6 R 67 requires parties to put to a witness important points of contention about the witness or the evidence given by the witness in order to give the witness a fair opportunity to meet that contention.  Failure to do this may preclude the party concerned from making that submission: <span class="font-italic">Michael Vaz Lorrain v Singapore Rifle Association</span> [2021] 1 SLR 513 at [26], citing <span class="font-italic">Sudha Natrajan v The Bank of East Asia Ltd </span>[2017] 1 SLR 141 at [48]; see also <span class="font-italic">Britestone Pte Ltd v Smith &amp; Associates Far East, Ltd</span> [2007] 4 SLR(R) 855 at [17].  Consequently, I find that it is not open to the defendants to claim that the first defendant had an agreement with Mr Jackson for him to set up an online business with her.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 In summary, for all the above reasons, I find the evidence of the first defendant to be highly unsatisfactory.  On the other hand, the plaintiff’s case is corroborated by the WhatsApp exchanges, emails and other communications that emanated from the first defendant or her lawyers.  As such, I am left to conclude that the plaintiff has established his case that the first defendant was a nominee in relation to her position as a shareholder and director of the second defendant.  This means that, pursuant to the Agency Agreement between the plaintiff (through Mr Jackson) and the first defendant, the first defendant acted as agent for the plaintiff on the terms outlined at [44] above.  I now turn to the question of the specific duties owed by the first defendant to the plaintiff pursuant to the Agency Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Duties owed by the first defendant as agent of the plaintiff</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The plaintiff pleaded that the first defendant owed contractual and fiduciary duties to the plaintiff.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Notwithstanding that the first defendant would be a nominee director and the sole shareholder of the second defendant, the first defendant held the shares of the second defendant on trust for the plaintiff.  At all material times, the plaintiff was and is the beneficial owner of the shares of the second defendant.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The first defendant was to take instructions from the plaintiff or his agent on matters relating to the second defendant and its DBS Bank account.  Therefore, whilst the first defendant had exclusive access to the second defendant’s DBS Bank account, the first defendant was only to use the DBS Bank account on express instructions from the plaintiff, and to transfer such funds to the plaintiff or third parties upon its instructions.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The plaintiff would provide outgoing remittance instructions to the first defendant.  The first defendant would remit outgoing remittance(s) upon the plaintiff’s express instructions. The first defendant would notify the plaintiff or his agent of any incoming fund remittance as and when received.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Upon the plaintiff’s request, the first defendant was to render a true and complete account of all funds deposited in the second defendant’s DBS Bank account, including by providing to the plaintiff true and accurate statements of outstanding balances in the DBS Bank account as well as the DBS Bank account’s transaction history.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) The first defendant owed a duty to act <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> in the interest of the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) The first defendant owed a duty to act for the proper purposes of the plaintiff in relation to its affairs and/or the affairs of the second defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 I find the plaintiff’s foregoing list to be a bit unclear.  First, while the foregoing points were framed as “duties” owed by the first defendant to the plaintiff pursuant to the Agency Agreement, it is evident that not all of them are “duties” <span class="font-italic">per se</span>.  For instance, the proposition in [70(a)] above that the first defendant held the shares of the second defendant on trust for the plaintiff is <span class="font-italic">not</span> a “duty”.  Instead, it concerns the state of the beneficial <span class="font-italic">ownership</span> of the shares of the second defendant, and the relationship between the first defendant (as trustee) and the plaintiff (as beneficiary).  If this relationship exists, then the question arises as to <span class="font-italic">what duties</span> the first defendant, as trustee, owes to the plaintiff, as beneficiary.  Similarly, the propositions at [70(b)] and [70(c)] are also not duties.  Rather, they pertain to the <span class="font-italic">scope</span> of the first defendant’s authority to act for the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Second, while the plaintiff’s pleading gives the impression that these “duties” are <span class="font-italic">contractual</span> duties arising from the Agency Agreement, it is apparent that the duties listed at [70(e)] and [70(f)] above are actually <span class="font-italic">fiduciary</span> duties: see <span class="font-italic">Ho Yew Kong v Sakae Holdings Ltd and other appeals and other matters </span>[2018] 2 SLR 333 (“<span class="font-italic">Ho Yew Kong</span>”) at [134]–[135]; and <span class="font-italic">Ho Kang Peng v Scintronix Corp Ltd (formerly known as TTL Holdings Ltd)</span> [2014] 3 SLR 329 at [40].  The core character of a fiduciary duty is that it is imposed to exact loyalty from the agent: see <span class="font-italic">Ho Yew Kong</span> at [135].  On the other hand, as aforementioned, the plaintiff omitted to specify the particular fiduciary duties owed by the first defendant to the plaintiff; the plaintiff only pleaded broadly that, “alternatively, the [first defendant] owed fiduciary duties as an agent and trustee to the [p]laintiff in relation to the shares of [the second defendant] held by the [first defendant] on trust for the [p]laintiff”.

</div>
</div>  This is apt to confuse.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Third, the duty to account listed at [70(d)] above is not, strictly speaking, a “duty”.  Rather, the taking of an account is merely the first step of a <span class="font-italic">process</span> that enables the beneficiary to identify and quantify any deficit in the trust fund and seek the appropriate remedy by which it may be made good: see <span class="font-italic">UVH and another v UVJ and others</span> [2020] 3 SLR 1329 at [22], citing <span class="font-italic">Libertarian Investments Ltd v Thomas Alexej Hall</span> [2013] HKCFA 93 (“<span class="font-italic">Libertarian </span><span class="font-italic">Investments</span>”) at [167]–[168] (per Lord Millett NPJ).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Nevertheless, the plaintiff did at a minimum plead that:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the first defendant held the second defendant’s shares on trust for the plaintiff; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the scope of the first defendant’s authority to act on behalf of the plaintiff in relation to the second defendant is limited only to what the plaintiff expressly authorises the first defendant to do; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the first defendant owed fiduciary duties to act <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>in the interest of the plaintiff and to act for proper purposes.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 The purpose of pleadings is to ensure that each party is aware of the case against it, and that the key consideration in this context is the need to prevent surprises arising at the trial: see <span class="font-italic">Tuitiongenius Pte Ltd v Toh Yew Keat and </span><span class="font-italic">another</span> [2021] 1 SLR 231 at [65].  While the plaintiff’s pleadings were not drafted with precision, it is clear that the defendants were not at all taken by surprise by the plaintiff’s claims at [74] above because these were pleaded, attested, and run at trial.  The next question is whether these claims are made out on the evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 I find that these three propositions at [74] above flow from the terms of the Agency Agreement, as outlined at [44] above.  It also bears clarifying that, in my view, the first defendant’s fiduciary duties to act <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>in the interest of the plaintiff and to act for proper purposes arise not only from the first defendant’s position as trustee of the second defendant’s shares <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis </span>the plaintiff (per [74(a)] above) but also from the Agency Agreement.  I note that it is the plaintiff’s case that the first defendant was not given any discretion to affect the plaintiff’s position, but instead had to act according to the strict instructions of the plaintiff.  Applying the considerations at [39] to [41] here, this means that the first defendant had not been conferred broad powers and discretion in trust and confidence.  Thus, I accept that the first defendant does not owe the plaintiff “extensive” fiduciary duties.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 However, this does not mean that the first defendant owes the plaintiff <span class="font-italic">no </span>fiduciary duties at all; even if granted limited discretion, an agent can owe a “few” fiduciary duties (see [41] above).  In this case, the first defendant had <span class="font-italic">exclusive</span> access to the second defendant’s bank account.  The first defendant was also travelling to a foreign country to act for the plaintiff as nominee director and shareholder of the second defendant.  Critically, the first defendant was entrusted with funds in her position as agent.  In these circumstances, the relationship between the plaintiff and the first defendant is therefore one which gives the first defendant a special opportunity to act to the detriment of the plaintiff, who is accordingly vulnerable to abuse by the first defendant’s position as the plaintiff’s agent.  This is squarely within the consideration listed at [39(c)] and [40], and, for this reason, I find that, as the plaintiff’s agent, the first defendant owes, minimally, the fiduciary duties to act <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>in the plaintiff’s interest and to act for proper purposes.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 I also note, for completeness, that I do not find that the first defendant was a trustee of the second defendant’s funds in the DBS Bank account.  This will be explained further at [112] below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 It is undisputed that the plaintiff did not authorise the first defendant to effect the Unauthorised Transfers from the second defendant’s bank account.  Therefore, the Unauthorised Transfers would be a breach of the Agency Agreement (per [74(b)] above) and also the first defendant’s fiduciary duty to act <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>in the interest of the plaintiff and to act for proper purposes of the plaintiff’s (per [74(c)] above), <span class="font-italic">if </span>the Unauthorised Transfers were indeed effected by the first defendant.  This leads me to the next question.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Did the first defendant effect the transfer of funds from the second defendant’s bank account?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 The next issue that I have to decide is whether the first defendant was the person who effected the transfer of the funds from the second defendant’s DBS Bank account in the period from October 2018 to April 2019.  If so, the first defendant would be liable to the plaintiff for breach of her obligations as a nominee, since it is undisputed that she did not act on any instructions of the plaintiff or his agents in effecting such transfers. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 There can be no dispute between the parties as to the precise inflows and outflows of moneys to and from the second defendant’s DBS Bank account.  This is because a full set of the bank statements and documents showing the bank transfers have been obtained by the plaintiff from DBS Bank through the process of pre-action discovery.  As these documents show, from 9 to 15 October 2018, there were four transfers of moneys to the DBS Bank account – <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, the Funds – totalling the amount of approximately US$1,028,455 (see [20] above).

She said that she caused moneys to be transferred to EPS Hong Kong’s Standard Chartered Bank account in Hong Kong because she knew that she needed to build up a legal fund to defend the case that would be brought by the plaintiff against her.  She claimed that she already knew then that she was being “set up” by the plaintiff and Mr Jackson.

By that, she explained that she had transferred out from the bank account the moneys that had been returned, as I have recounted above.

This is because, when banking transactions are effected online, apart from requiring the customer to key in the necessary login information on the DBS Bank online banking platform, the bank would also send a one-time password (“OTP”) to the mobile phone number that is registered with the bank.  This OTP must then be entered into the online banking platform in order for the banking transaction to be effected.  Also, once the banking transaction is effected, an SMS notification of that transaction will be sent to the mobile phone number registered with the bank.

There were at least two occasions when Ms Flynn had to urgently contact the first defendant over the group chat to ask for the OTP so that Ms Flynn could effect a transaction online for the DBS Bank account.  If there was an “SMS forwarder” application being used, there would have been no need for Ms Flynn to seek the first defendant’s assistance to effect transactions on the account.

Through the “EPS” WhatsApp group chat, the first defendant was informed of these funds being credited to the account.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 On 18 October 2018, Ms Flynn was instructed by the plaintiff to make a payment of €198,000 from the second defendant’s account to Digimark Inc, a Canadian-registered company that had provided online advertising services for Eat Pray Shop.  Ms Flynn then contacted the first defendant and told her of the intended payment, because she needed her assistance by providing the OTP that she received from the bank.  The first defendant sent a WhatsApp message to Ms Flynn with the OTP that the bank had sent her.  She later also sent a message to the “EPS” WhatsApp group chat that she had received an SMS text from the bank to notify her that the payment to Digimark Inc had been effected.

</div>  In short, she had been locked out of online access to the second defendant’s bank account.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 From the evidence that emerged at the trial, it is now clear what had transpired.  The first defendant gave evidence that, on or prior to 20 October 2018, she had requested DBS Bank for new login details to access online banking.  In fact, since the login details arrived by a letter dated 20 October 2018, the first defendant’s request must have been made prior to that date.  This request caused the bank to automatically invalidate the confidential PIN that had been set up by Ms Flynn and to reset it with a new confidential PIN.

One is that the first defendant had told a blatant untruth in both her affidavit of evidence-in-chief and an affidavit sworn by her on 2 December 2019 for an interlocutory application for summary judgment.  In both affidavits, the first defendant had unequivocally stated: “I did not request a new Organisation ID, User ID and/or PIN prior to 20 October 2018”.

</div>  The other possibility is that the first defendant is, for reasons only known to herself, lying now in her oral evidence.  I find the former to be more likely to be the case.  Either way, it is quite clear to me that the first defendant has no qualms about lying on oath.  She is a witness with little to no credibility at all.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 According to the first defendant’s claim at the trial, the new confidential PIN requested by the first defendant was sent to the registered address of the second defendant.  Under cross-examination, the first defendant further admitted that, once the new confidential PIN was received at the registered office of the second defendant on 24 October 2018, it would have been sent to her by In.Corp, which was providing company secretarial services for the second defendant.  She further conceded that, once she was in possession of the new confidential PIN, she would be able to log in and access the online banking platform.

This is because of the indisputable fact that she had the new login details to carry out online banking on the second defendant’s bank account and, more significantly, the fact that her mobile phone number was registered with DBS Bank.  She was the one who was able to receive the OTPs sent by the bank that would have been required for the transactions to be effected online.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 It follows from my findings above that the transfers of funds out of the second defendant’s bank account that took place from 25 October to 1 November 2018 must have been effected by the first defendant.  I do not accept her evidence that the account had been “hacked” as she claimed.  If it were true that the first defendant discovered sometime on or around 31 October 2018 that the account had been “hacked”, one would expect that the first defendant’s natural reaction would have been to lodge a police report or, at least, to raise an alarm to the bank, who would then have frozen the account, so that the funds in the bank account would not be siphoned off.  Yet, nothing of this sort was done, as there is no evidence at all before me that the first defendant had lodged a police report or complained to DBS Bank that there had been any unauthorised access or “hacking” of the second defendant’s bank account.

</div>  I find this to be an incredible explanation.  If this were true, it is unbelievable that the first defendant would then leave the matter hanging and not pursue some recourse to reclaim the dissipated moneys, or inform Mr Jackson and/or Ms Flynn immediately and ask for their instructions, or, at the very least, update DBS Bank about what the police in Vienna told her so that she can be advised on the next steps, since it is <span class="font-italic">the first defendant’s case</span> that it was <span class="font-italic">DBS Bank</span> who advised her to call the police.  In any event, there is not a shred of evidence to show that the first defendant ever communicated to DBS Bank that the bank account had been “hacked” and that the second defendant’s moneys had been “stolen”.  The critical point here is that the first defendant’s evidence that the account had been “hacked” is highly improbable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 In any event, I reject the first defendant’s evidence that she discovered the transfers out of the second defendant’s bank account only on 1 or 2 November 2018.

She was reluctant to assist them in obtaining information from the bank as to the alleged “hacking” and where the funds had been transferred to.  She started making accusations against Mr Jackson and Ms Flynn that they had involved her in criminal activities.  She was often unresponsive to their texts and emails.  She refused to execute the necessary documents for the transfer of ownership and control of the second defendant to the plaintiff.

</div>
</div>  It is obvious that all this was done with the devious intent of delaying the discovery of her dishonest actions and impeding the recovery of the funds.            </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 In my judgment, given my assessment of the totality of the evidence before me, I find that the first defendant had acted to deliberately prevent Ms Flynn and Mr Jackson from having online access to the second defendant’s DBS Bank account, so that she could then effect the transfers out of the account.  To put things bluntly, she had schemed to get her hands on the funds in the second defendant’s account and she succeeded in doing so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 Therefore, I find that the Unauthorised Transfers and the Continuous Unauthorised Transfers were effected by the first defendant out of the second defendant’s DBS bank account, and that this was done without any actual authority – whether express or implied – conferred by the plaintiff.  Consequently, the first defendant breached her duty under the Agency Agreement.  I also find that, by effecting the Unauthorised Transfers and the Continuous Unauthorised Transfers to dissipate the funds from the second defendant’s DBS bank account to unauthorised recipients (controlled by the first defendant, no less), the first defendant had clearly breached her fiduciary duties to act <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>in the plaintiff’s best interests and to act for proper purposes.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 For completeness, I note that, while the plaintiff pleaded that the first defendant acted as a trustee (of the second defendant’s shares and the second defendant’s funds), the plaintiff did not plead that the first defendant committed a breach of trust in relation to the second defendant’s funds (see [27] above).  This is correct because the first defendant is not, strictly speaking, a trustee of the funds in the second defendant’s DBS bank account.  This is because the first defendant is only the nominee director and shareholder of the second defendant for the plaintiff.  Consequently, title to the second defendant’s assets is not vested in the first defendant <span class="font-italic">herself</span>, but rather is vested in the second defendant: see <span class="font-italic">Sim Poh Ping v Winsta Holding Pte Ltd and another and other appeals</span> [2020] 1 SLR 1199 (“<span class="font-italic">Sim Poh Ping</span>”) at [109].  Therefore, the first defendant did not commit any breaches of trust by misapplying those funds.  Instead, she committed custodial breaches of fiduciary duty.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 Before I turn to the question of the appropriate relief below, I shall first consider the question of illegality raised by the first defendant.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Is the plaintiff’s claim barred by illegality or considerations of public policy?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 Given my findings above, the first defendant is <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> liable to the plaintiff for breach of her obligations as a nominee by (a) making unauthorised withdrawals from the second defendant’s DBS Bank account, and (b) refusing to relinquish control of the second defendant to the plaintiff.  She has no claim to ownership of the second defendant or its funds.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 In the defence, the defendants plead that the plaintiff’s claim should not be allowed as a matter of public policy.  It goes on to aver that the second defendant did not carry out any <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> business; that the plaintiff, Mr Jackson and Ms Flynn were engaged in money laundering; and hence that they were involved in illegal acts.  It was also averred that the first defendant was unaware of this illegality because she had been misled by Mr Jackson into thinking that the second defendant was set up for a legitimate online business.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 The defendants’ submissions on this issue engages the doctrine of illegality.  The principles on the doctrine of illegality have been clarified and summarised by the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Ochroid Trading Ltd and another v Chua Siok Lui (trading as VIE Import &amp; Export) and another</span> [2018] 1 SLR 363 (“<span class="font-italic">Ochroid Trading</span>”).  The Court of Appeal set out a two-stage framework to determine if an agreement may be unenforceable due to illegality (<span class="font-italic">Ochroid Trading</span> at [64] and [65]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 At the first stage, the court ascertains whether the contract (and not the conduct) is prohibited either pursuant to a statute (“statutory illegality”) or an established head of common law public policy (“common law illegality”) (<span class="font-italic">Ochroid Trading</span> at [22] and [64]).  If the contract is so prohibited by statute, then there can be no recovery whatsoever pursuant to the illegal contract, as the contract is void and unenforceable.  This is not relevant in this case, as the defendants are not alleging that the Agency Agreement <span class="font-italic">itself</span> is illegal and prohibited by statute.  Rather, the defendants’ argument is that the Agency Agreement is <span class="font-italic">tainted</span> by illegality as it seeks to commit a crime, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, money laundering. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 Therefore, the relevant issue at hand is not statutory illegality but common law illegality.  If the contract falls foul of established heads of common law public policy, then that would also render the contract unenforceable on the basis that it is contrary to public policy.  Examples of the contracts rendered unenforceable under established heads of common law public policy include contracts prejudicial to the administration of justice (such as contracts to stifle a prosecution) and contracts to commit a crime, tort or fraud (<span class="font-italic">Ochroid Trading </span>at [29]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 Where the contract is not unlawful <span class="font-italic">per se</span> but is tainted by illegality in that it nevertheless involves the commission of a legal wrong in their formation, purpose or manner of performance, the enforcement of such a contract is subject to the limiting principle of proportionality (<span class="font-italic">Ochroid Trading </span>at [39] and [64]).  This means that the court has to consider if it would be a proportionate response to the illegality to refuse to enforce the contract.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 If the contract is prohibited, the court then moves on to the second stage of the inquiry to ascertain whether, notwithstanding the fact that there can be no recovery pursuant to the (illegal) contract, there might, nevertheless, be restitutionary recovery of the benefits conferred thereunder (as opposed to recovery of full contractual damages) (<span class="font-italic">Ochroid Trading </span>at [42] and [65]).  As for such other independent causes of action (such as unjust enrichment, tort and trusts), the guiding principle is stultification<span class="font-italic">.</span>  To stultify is to “make nonsense of”.  Thus, the independent cause of action will be precluded where allowing it will undermine the fundamental policy that rendered the underlying contract void and unenforceable in the first place (<span class="font-italic">Ochroid Trading </span>at [145] and [168]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 As already mentioned, statutory illegality is irrelevant here.  The potentially applicable head of common law public policy raised by the defendants is the category of contracts stated at [119] above – contracts entered into with the object of committing an illegal act: see <span class="font-italic">Ting Siew May v Boon Lay Choo and another</span> [2014] 3 SLR 609 (“<span class="font-italic">Ting Siew May</span>”) at [42]–[43].  The application of this principle depends upon “<span class="font-italic">proof of the intent</span>, at the time the contract was made, to break the law” [emphasis in original omitted; emphasis added in italics].  If the intent is mutual, the contract is not enforceable at all.  If the intent is unilateral, the contract is unenforceable at the suit of the party who is proved to have it: <span class="font-italic">Ting Siew May</span> at [43], citing <span class="font-italic">St John Shipping Corp v Joseph Rank Ltd</span> [1957] 1 QB 267 at 283.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 Needless to say, it is <span class="font-italic">the defendants</span> who shoulder the burden of proving their allegations of illegality: specifically, that the plaintiff (if not both parties) harboured the intent to enter into the Agency Agreement to commit money laundering.

</div>  This follows from ss 103 and 105 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed), as it is the defendants who are seeking to persuade this Court that the Agency Agreement was entered into with the object of committing money laundering, which are acts prohibited by statute in Singapore (see, for instance, ss 46–47 of the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (Cap 65A, 2000 Rev Ed)).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 Bearing this in mind, I was surprised that, at trial, counsel for the defendants did not even put their case of illegality to the plaintiff, Mr Jackson or Ms Flynn, save to broadly suggest to the plaintiff that the source of the funds in the second defendant’s bank account was “potentially illicit”,

</div>  In fact, all of the plaintiff’s and his witnesses’ evidence as to how the Eat Pray Shop business operated, how the business was marketed, how the sales took place, who were the customers, and how the sales revenue was processed and then paid to the second defendant, were substantially unrebutted at trial.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 It will also be recalled that it was the first defendant’s evidence that she was operating the online business set up by Mr Jackson <span class="font-italic">for her</span>, and hence she was entitled to the moneys in the second defendant’s bank account (see [65] above).  The glaring inconsistency between the first defendant’s evidence and the pleaded case of illegality, which involved showing that the second defendant had no legitimate business, was irreconcilable.  In this regard, it bears emphasising that, while a party in civil proceedings in Singapore has a common law right to plead and advance factually inconsistent claims, the inconsistency “cannot – particularly in relation to the facts pleaded – offend common sense”: <span class="font-italic">Ng Chee Weng v Lim Jit Ming Bryan and another</span> [2012] 1 SLR 457 (“<span class="font-italic">Ng Chee Weng</span>”) at [31]–[37].  For instance, while alternative claims of fraud and negligence are acceptable, it would be impermissible for a party to plead that the party has actual knowledge of two opposite alternative facts: see <span class="font-italic">Ng Chee Weng</span> at [36]–[38].  Essentially, therefore, alternative factual claims are permissible if one claim is the <span class="font-italic">subset</span> of the other alternative claim.  On the other hand, alternative claims are impermissible if they are logical <span class="font-italic">opposites</span>.  This is the case for the first defendant’s claims that (a) the agreement was that the second defendant was a legitimate online business was set up <span class="font-italic">for her </span>and that (b) the business of the second defendant was set up for <span class="font-italic">the plaintiff’s</span> <span class="font-italic">illegal acts</span>.  Indeed, at one point of her oral evidence, the first defendant even unequivocally stated that the second defendant was “[her] business” and “has nothing to do with [the] plaintiff”.

The defendants also chose not to file any submissions after trial, which certainly did not assist me in showing how the defence of illegality or public policy has been made out on the evidence.

</div>  In other words, counsel appeared to be suggesting that the payments received by the second defendant into its bank account were not actually from MeikoPay or its agents, but from elsewhere.          </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 However, as I pointed out to counsel, the defendants had not challenged the authenticity of several MeikoPay statements issued to the second defendant that had been discovered by the plaintiff in his list of documents dated 29 October 2019.  There was no inspection of these documents.  It was only on 16 November 2020, the day before the commencement of the trial, that the defendants issued a notice of non-admission of the MeikoPay statements.

This suggests that the default position under the Rules of Court is that provided for in r 4(1), namely, that a party is deemed to admit the authenticity of a document contained in his opponent’s lists. That being the case, a party is generally deemed to admit authenticity unless he can bring himself within O 27 r 4(2) by showing that he had actually issued a notice of non-admission<span class="font-italic"> within the requisite window of time</span>. … [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 Thus, the defendants are deemed to admit to the authenticity of the MeikoPay documents that are now being objected to since (a) the defendants did not deny the authenticity of these documents in their pleadings and (b) the defendants did not issue a notice of non-admission within the requisite 14 days.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 When I queried the defendants’ counsel as to how he planned to overcome the fact that, by operation of the ROC, the defendants had already lost their right to challenge the authenticity of the MeikoPay statements through their failure to file notices of non-admission within the time permitted by the ROC, he replied to say that the plaintiff would suffer no prejudice.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 I am unable to agree.  No reasonable explanation has been provided by the defendants as to why this notice of non-admission was filed so late.  Critically, the first defendant did not even deny the authenticity of the relevant MeikoPay documents in her AEIC.  In these circumstances, it is certainly far too late to raise objections of authenticity on the eve of the trial for documents discovered more than a year ago.  If such late objections are allowed, parties might have to scramble to search for an appropriate witness to prove the authenticity of documents even as the trial is progressing.  This might lead to trial dates being vacated, or trials being part-heard because a witness that is needed to prove the authenticity of a documents is not available at short notice.  In this case, the plaintiff would suffer prejudice because he would then have to locate and persuade someone from Shenzhen Hongzhanzheng Trading Co Ltd to agree to give evidence as to the provenance of the MeikoPay documents before he would be able to close his case, and all this while the trial is already ongoing.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 In any event, I find that the suggestions by the defendants that MeikoPay was not really used, and that the MeikoPay documents were of doubtful authenticity, are without basis.  Mr Jackson gave evidence that he received documents directly from MeikoPay.

</div>  Mr Bello was not cross-examined on his expert report.  Neither was there any contradictory expert evidence adduced by the defendants.  Furthermore, it was never put to Mr Jackson and Ms Flynn during their cross-examination that these messages were fabricated or had been doctored with.  When she took the stand, the first defendant also did not deny that these messages were sent by her during her cross-examination.  As such, I accept that the plaintiff has proven that the MeikoPay documents, including the MeikoPay agreement, are authentic.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 In sum, the defendants have failed to show that Eat Pray Shop is not a <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> business, that there was criminal activity or money laundering involved, or that the payments received by the second defendant originated from dubious sources.  I also find that the defendants have failed to show that the plaintiff intended to enter into the Agency Agreement to commit money laundering or any illegal act for that matter.  As such, I find that the defendants have not established their case that the plaintiff’s claims should be barred by public policy because of illegality.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Remedies              </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 Given my findings that the first defendant, by her actions, was clearly in breach of the agreement that she would act as a nominee in relation to her position as a shareholder and director of the second defendant, and that she had also thereby breached her fiduciary duties, there is no need for me to deal with the alternative claims in conspiracy and unjust enrichment.  These other claims do not add anything in terms of the remedies to which the first plaintiff is entitled.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 I now turn to the appropriate remedies in this case.  It is trite that double recovery is impermissible, so the plaintiff cannot be compensated twice for the same loss stemming from the breaches of the Agency Agreement and fiduciary duties: see <span class="font-italic">Tonny Permana </span>at [117].  The plaintiff seeks the following remedies:

[emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) and damages to be assessed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 I have already found that the true beneficial owner of the shares of the second defendant is the plaintiff.  Therefore, I grant a declaration that all the shares in the second defendant are held on trust by the first defendant for the plaintiff.  Consequent to this, I order the first defendant to, within 14 days hereof, transfer all the shares in the second defendant to the plaintiff.  The defendants are also to return all bank tokens, cheques, financial statements, email accounts and all other documents which belong to the second defendant to the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 For the breach of the Agency Agreement, the plaintiff is entitled to damages, and it is trite that this would generally be on an expectation measure: see <span class="font-italic">Turf Club Auto Emporium Pte Ltd and others v Yeo Boong Hua and others and another appeal</span> [2018] 2 SLR 655 at [125].  On the other hand, the appropriate remedy for a breach of fiduciary duty depends on the specific circumstances of the breach.  Breaches of fiduciary duties can be divided into custodial and non-custodial breaches.  A non-custodial breach does not involve the stewardship of assets already entrusted to the fiduciary, while a custodial breach results in the misapplication of the principal’s funds: <span class="font-italic">Sim Poh Ping </span>at [104]–[106].  The usual remedy for a breach of a non-custodial fiduciary duty would be the compensatory monetary award of equitable compensation.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 As for a custodial breach, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Sim Poh Ping </span>(at [108]–[109]) observed that there is “good reason for the remedial principles targeting the misapplication of funds to apply to a custodial breach” [emphasis in original omitted], as the wrong is done to the principal’s funds placed under the fiduciary’s custody.  The remedy for a custodial breach is substitutive in that it seeks to restore the trust fund or the fund of the principal either <span class="font-italic">in specie</span> or by a monetary sum in lieu.  For a custodial breach, there should be a causal link between the breach and the subject matter of the breach that is sought to be restored.  However, the role which causation plays in the situation of a custodial breach is a limited one, meaning that the court will not go further to determine whether the loss would still have occurred in the absence of the trustee’s or custodial fiduciary’s breach of duty.  On the other hand, equitable compensation and surcharging are reparative in nature, and thus seek to “repair” the loss that has been caused to the principal or the trust fund.  In particular, the term “equitable compensation” should be used only by reference to the reparative remedy sought for non-custodial breaches of fiduciary duty, and not for the remedy sought for a custodial breaches or for a breach of the management stewardship duty of a trustee: <span class="font-italic">Sim Poh Ping</span> at [114]–[115] and [124]–[126].  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 It is evident from the reliefs sought by the plaintiff that he has claimed remedies that flow from the breach of fiduciary duty.  As already mentioned, the remedy of damages that flow from the contractual breach of the Agency Agreement is allowed, but double recovery will not be permitted.  I shall turn my attention now to the former.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 It is clear that the present case involves a custodial breach of fiduciary duty.  There is a clear causal link between the breach and the quantum of the Unauthorised Transfers and Continuous Unauthorised Transfers.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 However, it is very unclear what <span class="font-italic">exactly</span> was the total quantum of money that was misapplied by the first defendant.  The plaintiff’s pleadings and closing submissions are very loosely drafted on this issue.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The quantum of the Funds, which were deposited into the second defendant’s DBS bank account from 9 October 2018 to 15 October 2018, is <span class="font-underline">US$1,028,455.00</span>.  This was stated in the plaintiff’s statement of claim (amendment no. 2) at paragraphs 15 and 16, closing submissions at paragraph 186, and a letter to court at paragraph 3(a) dated 4 May 2021 (“the 4 May letter”).  The 4 May letter to court was in response to this Court’s questions for clarification.  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The quantum of Unauthorised Transfers from 25 October 2018 to 12 November 2018 is <span class="font-underline">US$1,070,950.02</span>.  This was clearly stated in Annex A of the plaintiff’s closing submissions and at paragraph 3(b) of the 4 May letter. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) However, the plaintiff has, at numerous points of his statement of claim and closing submissions, <span class="font-italic">equated </span>the Unauthorised Transfers with the sum of US$1,028,455.00.  </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) At paragraph 186 of the plaintiff’s closing submissions, the plaintiff confusingly equated the sum of US$1,028,455.00 and the Funds with “the Unauthorised Transfers and/or Continuous Unauthorised Transfers”:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">186. Further and/or alternatively, the Plaintiff seeks an order that the 1st Defendant does account on a wilful default basis of <span class="font-italic">the Unauthorised Transfers and/or Continuous Unauthorised Transfers amounting to the Funds i.e. USD $1,028,455.00</span>. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) At paragraph 198(5) of the plaintiff’s closing submissions, the plaintiff even more explicitly asked for a return of the Unauthorised Transfers and/or Continuous Unauthorised Transfers “amounting to USD $1,028,455.00”, even though neither the Unauthorised Transfers nor the Continuous Unauthorised Transfers tally with the sum of US$1,028,455.00 (the Unauthorised Transfers are US$1,070,950.02; the <span class="font-italic">Net</span> Unauthorised Transfers, after deduction of the various corresponding returns during the same period, are US$572,617.65; the Continuous Unauthorised Transfers are US$877,135.16; and the Net Continuous Unauthorised Transfers are US$442,068.88, which means that the total sum misappropriated from the second defendant’s DBS bank account would be US$1,014,686.53 (US$572,617.65 plus US$442,068.88)).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">198. The Plaintiff therefore claims: … (5) An order that the 1st Defendant returns <span class="font-italic">the Unauthorised Transfers and/or Continuous Unauthorised Transfers amounting to USD $1,028,455.00</span>. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) Similarly, at paragraph 198(6) of the plaintiff’s closing submissions, the plaintiff asked for an account of the Funds, Unauthorised Transfers and/or Continuous Unauthorised Transfers “amounting to USD $1,028,455.00”,</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">198. The Plaintiff therefore claims: … (6) An order that the 1st Defendant does account on a wilful default basis of <span class="font-italic">the Funds, Unauthorised Transfers and/or Continuous Unauthorised Transfers amounting to USD $1,028,455.00</span>, and any and all profits, benefits, gains and/or assets arising from, relating to and/or in connection with the Funds and/or the Unauthorised Transfers and/or the Continuous Unauthorised Transfers (the “Assets”), and an order that all such Assets be paid over and/or delivered up upon such account to the Plaintiff. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iv) At page 14, point (5), of the plaintiff’s statement of claim (amendment no. 2), the plaintiff sought an order that the first defendant “account on a wilful default basis of the Unauthorised Transfers and <span class="font-italic">return to the Plaintiff for the Funds, Unauthorised Transfers and/or Continuous Unauthorised Transfers amounting to USD $1,028,455.00</span>” (emphasis added; see [136(e)] above).  This is, again, confusing.  On one hand, the use of the conjunctive word “and” suggests that the <span class="font-italic">total</span> quantum of the Funds, Unauthorised Transfers and Continuous Unauthorised Transfers is US$1,028,455.00.  This is inaccurate.  The use of the conjunctive word “or” is equally unhelpful, because that suggests that the Unauthorised Transfers and/or the Continuous Unauthorised Transfers amount to US$1,028,455.00 (which is also not accurate).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 Therefore, it is quite unclear what exactly is the total sum that was misapplied and misappropriated by the first defendant from the second defendant’s DBS account.  If only US$1,028,455.00 was deposited into the account, then I agree that it seems, logically, that only that amount could have been misapplied and misappropriated by the first defendant.  It is perhaps for this reason that the plaintiff is only claiming for a return of <span class="font-underline">US$1,028,455.00</span>.  <span class="font-italic">However</span>, as already highlighted, the Unauthorised Transfers amount to <span class="font-underline">US$1,070,950.02</span>; the Net Unauthorised Transfers amount to <span class="font-underline">US$</span><span class="font-underline">572,617.65</span>; the Continuous Unauthorised Transfers are <span class="font-underline">US$877,135.16</span>, and the Net Continuous Unauthorised Transfers are <span class="font-underline">US$442,068.88</span>.  If so, it would seem that the total sum misappropriated from the second defendant’s DBS bank account should be about <span class="font-underline">US$</span><span class="font-underline">1,014,686.53</span> (US$572,617.65 plus US$442,068.88).  Indeed, there appears to be €9,545.15 (about US$10,851.45) and £122.73 (about US$156.62), which amount to a total amount of about US$11,008.07, left in the second defendant’s DBS account.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 Nevertheless, it is clear that <span class="font-italic">at least</span> US$1,028,455.00<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>has been misapplied and misappropriated from the second defendant’s DBS bank account, since the total sum of the Unauthorised Transfers and the Continuous Unauthorised Transfers amount to more than the sum of the Funds, and the second defendant’s DBS bank account has been almost completely depleted.  While there is a need for a causal link, the sense in which causation appears in the situation of a custodial fiduciary breach is a limited one, meaning that the court does not go further to determine whether the loss would still have occurred in the absence of the breach of duty.  Therefore, subject to what I will say about the remedy of an account of profits, the plaintiff is entitled to a claim of substitutive compensation to the plaintiff, as the principal, for the sum of US$1,028,455.00.  This is, in any event, the quantum of the sum which the plaintiff is seeking to be returned to him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 The plaintiff also seeks an account on a wilful default basis by the first defendant of the Unauthorised Transfers so that all profits arising from the Unauthorised Transfers can be determined and delivered to the plaintiff (see [136(e)] above).  There appears to be a conflation between an account on a wilful basis and an account of profits here. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 An account on a wilful default basis and a common account are procedures for the accounting of funds.  A common account does not depend on wrongdoing, so the beneficiary is entitled “as of right” to be given a common account of the trustee’s stewardship of the trust assets (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, an account for what was actually received and the trustee’s disbursement and distribution of it).  An account on a wilful default basis is premised on misconduct by the trustee and is not available to a beneficiary as of right.  Thus, the beneficiary must prove at least one act of wilful neglect or default.  The scope of an account on a wilful default basis is wider than that of a common account, as the trustee is not only required to account for what he has received, but also for what he <span class="font-italic">might</span> have received had it not been for the default.  Following the taking of an account, the beneficiary is entitled to ask for an inquiry to discover what the trustee did with any money that was misappropriated: see <span class="font-italic">UVJ and others v UVH and others and another appeal</span> [2020] 2 SLR 336 (“<span class="font-italic">UVJ</span>”) at [23]–[27].  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 The account, once furnished, may by challenged because it discloses discrepancies.  The beneficiary may then decide whether to seek an order for the falsification of a discrepant entry or for the surcharging of the account.  For the latter order of surcharging, the asset will be treated as if the trustee had performed his duty and obtained it for the benefit of the trust, so the trustee will be “ordered to make good the deficiency in the trust by payment of a monetary award”: see <span class="font-italic">Sim Poh Ping</span> at [120]; <span class="font-italic">UVJ </span>at [24] and [28].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 As alluded to above, it appears that what the plaintiff is presently seeking is an account on a wilful default basis, even though he also refers to an account of the unauthorised profits made by the first defendant (see [136(e)] above).  Unlike the taking of accounts, which is a <span class="font-italic">procedure</span>, an account of profits is a <span class="font-italic">remedy</span> that arises as an alternative to equitable compensation, and is available when a fiduciary makes unauthorised profits: see <span class="font-italic">Sim Poh Ping</span> at [105].  An account of profits is conceptually distinct from a surcharge, as the former is focused on the gain to the fiduciary while the latter is focused on the loss to the trust fund: see <span class="font-italic">UVJ </span>at [28]; <span class="font-italic">Sim Poh Ping</span> at [120]–[121].  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 As the plaintiff’s primary claim is for the return of the sum of US$1,028,455.00, I shall focus not on the remedy of an account of profits, but rather on whether an account on a wilful default basis is appropriate.  In any event, the taking of accounts may also reveal breaches of fiduciary duty for which an inquiry and account of profits may subsequently be ordered: see <span class="font-italic">UVJ </span>at [27] and [29].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 Though the cases generally discuss the taking of accounts in the context of a trustee’s breach, the taking of accounts is also available against a custodial fiduciary: see <span class="font-italic">UVJ </span>at [29], endorsing <span class="font-italic">Lalwani Shalini Gobind and another v Lalwani Ashok Bherumal</span> [2017] SGHC 90 at [26].  Therefore, the first defendant, as a custodial fiduciary, is also liable to account.  Given the egregious nature of the first defendant’s conduct, I find that the account by the first defendant is more appropriately to be conducted on a wilful default basis rather than on a common basis.  The fact that the total sum misappropriated seems to be larger than the sum deposited into the second defendant’s DBS bank account (see [143] above) also reinforces my conclusion that an account on a wilful default basis is clearly necessary.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 However, I note that there is a potential inconsistency between the remedies sought by the plaintiff.  Substitutive compensation of the sum of US$1,028,455.00 would require the first defendant to restore those unauthorised transfers to the plaintiff’s fund either <span class="font-italic">in specie</span> or by a monetary sum in lieu (see [139] above).  However, the plaintiff seeks, through the account on a wilful default basis, to ultimately disgorge the unauthorised profits earned by the first defendant as a result of the Unauthorised Transfers (see [136(e)] above).  This is permissible, as explained by Lord Millet in <span class="font-italic">Libertarian Investments</span> at [169], as endorsed by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">UVJ </span>at [27]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">169. <span class="font-italic">But the plaintiff is not bound to ask for the disbursement to be disallowed. He is entitled to ask for an inquiry to discover what the defendant did with the trust money which he misappropriated and whether he dissipated it or invested it, and if he invested it whether he did so at a profit or a loss</span>. If he dissipated it or invested it at a loss, the plaintiff will naturally have the disbursement disallowed and disclaim any interest in the property in which it was invested by treating it as bought with the defendant’s own money. If, however, the defendant invested the money at a profit, the plaintiff is not bound to ask for the disbursement to be disallowed. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">He can treat it as an authorised disbursement, treat the property in which it has been invested as acquired with trust money, and follow or trace the property and demand that it or its traceable proceeds be restored to the trust </span><span class="font-weight-bold">in specie</span>. [Court of Appeal’s emphasis in <span class="font-italic">UVJ</span> in italics; emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 However, therein lies the potential inconsistency which might arise.  If it transpires that the plaintiff recovers the unauthorised disbursement, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, US$1,028,455.00, by, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, the first defendant paying the plaintiff that sum, then he might no longer be entitled to elect to treat the misapplied disbursement as an authorised disbursement and demand that it or its traceable proceeds be restored to the plaintiff’s funds <span class="font-italic">in specie</span>.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 In this regard, I find Lord Millett’s observations in <span class="font-italic">Libertarian Investments</span> at [172], which were endorsed by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">UVJ </span>at [27], to be instructive:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">172. At every stage the plaintiff can elect whether or not to seek a further account or inquiry. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The amount of any unauthorised disbursement is often</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> established by evidence at the trial, so that the plaintiff does not need an account but can ask for an award of the appropriate amount of compensation</span>. Or he may be content with a monetary award rather than attempt to follow or trace the money, in which case he will not ask for an inquiry as to what has become of the trust property. <span class="font-italic">In short, he may elect not</span><span class="font-italic"> to call for an account or further inquiry if it is unnecessary or unlikely to be fruitful, though the court will always have the last word</span>. [Court of Appeal’s emphasis in <span class="font-italic">UVJ</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>in italics; emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 The present situation is exactly that as stated at [172] of <span class="font-italic">Libertarian </span><span class="font-italic">Investments</span>: the unauthorised disbursement has already been established by evidence at the trial, and the plaintiff is in fact seeking substitutive compensation of the full amount of the unauthorised transfers of US$1,028,455.00, which I will grant.  While I will order the first defendant to account on a wilful default basis, the plaintiff should bear in mind the foregoing considerations and carefully elect how he wishes to proceed, if and after such an account is provided.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 Finally, the plaintiff also submitted that this Court should make a disclosure order requiring the first defendant to disclose her assets in aid of tracing and recovery of the misapplied Funds.
