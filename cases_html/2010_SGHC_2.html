<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an application by the first defendant
                    (“PT Merak”) to set aside an <em>ex-parte</em> injunction (“the Injunction”) that I
                    granted on 9 March 2009 to the plaintiff (“Shanghai
                    Electric”). The Injunction ordered that PT Merak be restrained from
                    receiving any monies from the second defendant (“the Bank”)
                    pursuant to a call made on 6 March 2009 (“the Demand”)
                    by PT Merak on the Advance Payment Security No 065-311-1-00479-0(001)
                    (“the Bond”) issued by the Bank in favour of PT Merak, and from
                    making any further calls thereon until further order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       This case involves an interesting point of law
                    that has not arisen in previous decisions of the courts pertaining to on-demand
                    bonds: whether Singapore law is the applicable law in an application to restrain
                    a call on an on-demand bond which provides that English law is the governing
                    law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Shanghai Electric is a company incorporated in
                    China and is in the business of designing, manufacturing, sale and supply of,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, equipment used in the generation,
                    transmission and distribution of power. PT Merak is an Indonesian company with
                    plans to commence operations in power plant development and management in
                    2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       By a contract dated 10 August 2007
                    (“the Contract”), Shanghai Electric was engaged by PT Merak for
                    the design, engineering, manufacturing, procurement, construction, start-up,
                    testing, commissioning and completion of a 2 x 60 MW coal fired electricity and
                    steam generating power plant (“the Power Plant”) located in West
                    Java, Indonesia, for the sum of US$108m (“the Contract Price”). On
                    22 January 2008, PT Merak and Shanghai Electric (referred to
                    collectively as “the Parties”) entered into an addendum to the
                    Contract (“the Addendum”) which amended several clauses of the
                    Contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The Contract provided for PT Merak to pay
                    Shanghai Electric an advance payment of 10% of the Contract Price (“the
                    Advance Payment”) amounting to US$10.8m. The Advance Payment was a
                    condition precedent for the issuance of the notice to proceed. In turn,
                    s 7.7(a) of the Contract required Shanghai Electric to procure the Bond for
                    the sum of US$10.8m in favour of PT Merak. This was performed on
                    20 November 2007 with the issue of the Bond for the sum of US$10.8m by
                    the Singapore branch of the Bank. On 1 April 2008, PT Merak effected
                    payment of the sum of US$10.8m to Shanghai Electric. With this, Shanghai
                    Electric commenced work under the Contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Under the Bond, the Bank undertook to pay to PT
                    Merak the sum of up to US$10.8m (which is the amount of the Advance Payment)
                    upon receipt of:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">the Owners’ first written demand stating</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1)    the amount to be paid to the Owner,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    that such amount is due to the Owner pursuant to
                            the Agreement, and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3)    that notice of default was previously given to the
                            Contractor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Essentially, the substantive condition for payment was a letter by
                    PT Merak to the Bank stating the amount to be paid, that this was due to PT
                    Merak pursuant to the Contract and that Shanghai Electric had been given notice
                    of default. This is the nature of an on-demand bond: that it is payable upon
                    demand, often accompanied by a statement by the beneficiary as to the existence
                    of a certain set of facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       On 2 February 2009, PT Merak issued to
                    Shanghai Electric a “Notice of Contractor Default” pursuant to
                    s 19.2.2(b) of the Contract. PT Merak alleged that since
                    10 August 2007 (the date of the Contract), “very little
                    progress was made on the construction of the Power Plant. Apart from the
                    temporary site office, temporary warehouse, temporary site roads, test pilings,
                    excavation and some lean concrete (levelling concrete) for the foundations of
                    the Boiler and Turbine Buildings, there is nothing else on site. Significantly,
                    [Shanghai Electric] failed to complete the work in respect of Payment Milestones
                    1 to 5. Further, [PT Merak] also encountered numerous difficulties with
                    [Shanghai Electric]. Although [PT Merak] tried to resolve these difficulties
                    through meetings and correspondence, this proved futile”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       On 11 February 2009, Shanghai Electric
                    sent a letter (“the first Letter”) to PT Merak stating
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    Shanghai Electric required more than the 10 days
                            from receipt of the Notice of Contractor Default to prepare the full
                            Contractor Remedial Plan, due to the length of the Notice of Contractor
                            Default;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    a detailed reply from Shanghai Electric in respect
                            of the Contractor Defaults set out in the Notice of Contractor Default
                            will be furnished to PT Merak within 2 days from 11 February 2009;
                            and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(c)    the portion of the Contractor Remedial Plan
                            relating to the “NCR and Remedial proposal” is set out in
                            the attachments to the letter of 11 February 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       This was followed by a second letter from
                    Shanghai Electric dated 13 February 2009 (“the second
                    Letter”) setting out its response to various items of alleged
                    “Contractor Defaults” contained in the notice of contractor
                    default. On 16 February 2009, PT Merak
                    replied – acknowledging receipt of the “Contractor
                    Remedial Plan” attached to the letter of 11 February 2009 and
                    stating that it was “currently reviewing the Contractor Remedial Plan and
                    will revert with [its] response in accordance with s 19.2.2(b) of the
                    Contract”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On 19 February 2009, PT Merak sent a
                    second letter to Shanghai Electric, stating, amongst other things, that
                    “until such time as [PT Merak has had] the opportunity to evaluate
                    [Shanghai Electric’s] Contractor Remedial Plan, [Shanghai
                    Electric’s] request for a meeting is unnecessary”. By a letter
                    dated 27 February 2009 (“the third Letter”), Shanghai
                    Electric furnished further details of the Contractor Remedial Plan to PT
                    Merak.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     On 6 March 2009, three events
                    occurred: first, PT Merak delivered a notice of termination to Shanghai Electric
                    to terminate its appointment under the Contract (“the Notice of
                    Termination”); second, Shanghai Electric wrote to PT Merak, accepting the
                    termination and alleging that such termination amounted to a repudiation of the
                    Contract by PT Merak; third, after delivery of the notice of termination to
                    Shanghai Electric, PT Merak delivered a letter of demand to the Bank calling for
                    payment under the Bond (“the Demand”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     On 9 March 2009, Shanghai Electric
                    filed the Injunction application on an <em>ex parte</em>
                    basis, which I heard and granted on the same day. On 26 March 2009, PT
                    Merak filed the present application to set aside the Injunction.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Issue of Law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     As alluded to at the outset of this judgment,
                    there is an issue as to the applicable law governing the restraint on the
                    calling of an on-demand bond. The Contract itself is governed by English law, it
                    being an express provision in s 26.8 thereof. Section 25.1 provides for
                    disputes to first be attempted to be resolved by good faith negotiations.
                    Failing this, s 25.2.1 provides such dispute to be submitted to arbitration
                    at the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (“SIAC”) to be
                    conducted in accordance with the ICC Rules. It is also expressly provided in the
                    Bond that the governing law is English law. Although the Bond is an agreement
                    between the Bank and PT Merak, it was given pursuant to s 7.7(b) of the
                    Contract which required Shanghai Electric to procure an advance payment security
                    in the form annexed in exhibit N-2 of the Contract. The terms of the Bond
                    essentially mirrored the form in exhibit N-2. The governing law clause in the
                    Bond – which also provides that Singapore courts have
                    non-exclusive jurisdiction over any proceedings arising out of
                    it – states as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This [Bond] shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws
                        of England. We hereby irrevocably submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction
                        of the courts of [Singapore] for the purposes of any … proceedings
                        arising out of this [Bond].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     PT Merak submitted that, as the Contract and,
                    especially, the Bond expressly provide that English law is the governing law,
                    this court should apply English law in relation to the decision whether to
                    restrain PT Merak from making a demand under the Bond. Shanghai Electric, on the
                    other hand, submitted that notwithstanding that English law is the governing law
                    of the Bond, this application was governed by the procedural law of the forum
                    and therefore Singapore law would apply. This is an important point as Singapore
                    law and English law diverge on whether fraud is the only basis upon which the
                    court would restrain a call on an on-demand bond.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     This divergence was brought about by the
                    decision of the Court of Appeal in <em>Bocotra Construction Pte
                        Ltd v Attorney-General (No 2)</em> [1995] 2 SLR 733
                        (“<em>Bocotra</em>”). I would note that
                    nowhere in the judgment in <em>Bocotra</em> was it said
                    that the court had departed from English law. Indeed, <em>Bocotra</em> cited the leading English precedents on the issue
                    without any suggestion that Singapore law was different. The expression
                    “fraud or unconscionability” appeared three times in <em>Bocotra</em> without any explanation for the inclusion of the
                    latter word or elaboration as to what it meant. I had pointed this out in my
                    decision in <em>New Civilbuild Pte Ltd v Guobena Sdn
                        Bhd</em> [1999] 1 SLR 374 (“<em>New
                        Civilbuild</em>”), in which I argued at [33] that the court in
                        <em>Bocotra</em> had, in all likelihood, used the
                    expression “unconscionability” interchangeably with
                    “fraud” because it could not have made such a drastic departure
                    from English law without giving any reason for it. I pointed out at [45] of
                        <em>New Civilbuild</em> that, while the fraud exception
                    was justified on the ground that it must be presumed that the caller must always
                    act in good faith (I add here that this is also the doctrine that <em>fraud unravels all</em>: see <em>United City
                        Merchants (Investments) Ltd v Royal Bank of Canada</em> [1983]
                    1 AC 168 at 184), there was no basis for the introduction of the
                    ground of unconscionability to frustrate the clear intention of the parties that
                    the issuer would pay the beneficiary upon written demand. However, in the
                    subsequent Court of Appeal decision of <em>GHL Pte Ltd v Unitrack
                        Building Construction Pte Ltd</em> [1999] 4 SLR 604
                        (“<em>GHL</em>”), the
                    court – having been referred to <em>New
                        Civilbuild</em> – stated that the Court of Appeal in
                        <em>Bocotra</em> had made a conscious departure from
                    English law on this issue. This appears at [16] of the judgment in <em>GHL</em>, as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is abundantly clear from [<em>Bocotra</em>] that
                        the court expressly held that ‘fraud or unconscionability’ was a
                        ground on which the court would interfere and restrain the enforcement of a
                        performance bond. It is significant that in that judgment the court on no
                        less than three occasions referred consistently to ‘fraud or
                        unconscionability’ as a ground for the grant of an injunction. We
                        should add that the concept of ‘unconscionability’ was adopted
                        after deliberation, and was not inadvertently inserted as a result of a
                        slip; nor was it intended to be used synonymously or interchangeably with
                        ‘fraud’. There is nothing in that judgment which can be said to
                        indicate or suggest that the court did not decide that
                        ‘unconscionability’ alone is not a separate ground as distinct
                        from fraud. We accept that to that extent, <em>Bocotra</em> is a departure, and if we may respectfully say so, a
                        conscious departure, from the English position.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     With the decision of the Court of Appeal in
                        <em>GHL</em>, there was no longer any question that
                    Singapore law had, since the <em>Bocotra</em> decision,
                    departed from English law in that, in addition to fraud, unconscionability is
                    also an exception. It must be borne in mind that an on-demand term of a similar
                    nature to that in the Bond in the present case is usually specified as a
                    requirement in the underlying contract for the purpose of obtaining security for
                    the performance of the contract by one party. In the building industry it was
                    usually provided by the contractor to the employer, or sub-contractor to the
                    main contractor. Before the practice of providing an on-demand bond became
                    common – in <em>Edward Owen Engineering Ltd v Barclays Bank
                        International Ltd</em> [1978] 1 QB 159 at 169A, it was
                    described by Lord Denning MR as “a new creature” – such
                    security was often in the form of cash. However this raised the capital
                    requirement of the contractor or sub-contractor, resulting in higher costs. The
                    giving of an on-demand bond that is “as good as cash” was found by
                    the industry to be a good alternative, presumably because contractors could
                    utilise lines of credit on the security of their immovable property, high-value
                    equipment or other acceptable assets without drawing down cash. As the
                    underlying contracts are invariably drawn up by the party requiring the
                    security, it is not surprising that such contracts provide for maximum ease of
                    conversion of the bond into cash. Therefore it is not unexpected that as soon as
                    Singapore law departed from English law on this issue, a party drawing a
                    contract that called for an on-demand bond would prefer to have it governed by
                    English law rather than Singapore law as it would be more difficult to obtain an
                    injunction, fraud being a higher threshold to clear than unconscionability. It
                    is not known whether this was the consideration in the present case, but there
                    was certainly no disadvantage to PT Merak in specifying English law in the Bond
                    even though it provided for arbitration under the Singapore Industrial
                    Arbitration Centre (“SIAC”) and for the non-exclusive jurisdiction
                    of Singapore courts. In <em>Marinteknik Shipbuilders (S) Pte Ltd
                        v SNC Passion</em> [2001] SGHC 140 (“<em>Marinteknik</em>”) I had foreseen just such a case
                    when I made the following observation at [31]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As unconscionability is not an exception in English law, there is the
                        question as to whether the Plaintiffs may rely upon this ground in addition
                        to fraud because the relevant contracts, i.e. the [underlying contract] and
                        the [on-demand bond], are governed by English law. However this issue is not
                        necessary for my decision and I did not have the benefit of submissions from
                        counsel. Therefore I will be content to merely raise it here and leave this
                        question to be decided elsewhere.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It appears that I have to pick up the gauntlet from where I threw
                    it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Returning to the issue of the applicable law
                    in this originating summons, it is trite legal principle that procedural matters
                    are governed by the <em>lex fori</em>, while substantive
                    matters are governed by the law to which the court is directed by its choice of
                    law rule: see <em>Dicey, Morris and Collins on the Conflict of
                        Laws</em>, 14th Ed (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, London, 2006)
                        (“<em>Dicey</em>”) at
                    [7-002]–[7-003]. The difficult question is whether the restraining of a
                    demand on an on-demand bond in the present circumstances is a substantive or
                    procedural matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     In <em>Star City Pty Ltd v Tan
                        Hong Woon</em> [2002] 2 SLR 22 (“<em>Star City</em>”), the Court of Appeal had to consider whether
                    s 5(2) of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed) was a
                    substantive or procedural provision. The court said that (at [12]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… one must look at the effect and purpose of that provision. If the
                        provision regulates proceedings rather than affects the existence of a legal
                        right, it is a procedural provision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In <em>John Pfeiffer Pty Ltd v
                        Rogerson</em> (2000) 203 CLR 503 (“<em>John Pfeiffer</em>”), the plaintiff suffered personal injury
                    in New South Wales but took out a suit in the Australian Capital Territory
                    (“ACT”). Unlike New South Wales, the ACT did not have a statutory
                    limit on the amount of damages that could be awarded for non-economic loss. The
                    High Court of Australia held that the assessment of damages was governed by the
                        <em>lex loci delicti</em> as it was not directed to
                    governing or regulating the mode or conduct of court proceedings and therefore
                    was a matter of substance rather than procedure. While this question is not
                    settled in Singapore (see <em>Goh Suan Hee v Teo Cher
                        Teck</em> [2009] SGCA 52 at [19]–[22]), the following
                    part of the judgment in <em>John Pfeiffer</em> at [99] is
                    apt:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… matters that affect the existence, extent or enforceability of
                        the rights or duties of the parties to an action are matters that, on their
                        face, appear to be concerned with issues of substance, not with issues of
                        procedure …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The essence of Shanghai Electric’s
                    submissions is that an injunction takes the form of a judicial remedy that is of
                    an equitable nature, and acts <em>in personam</em>.
                    Further, all matters relating to the nature of a claimant’s remedy invokes
                    questions of procedure, and should therefore be governed by the <em>lex fori</em> – as stated in <em>Halsbury’s Laws of England</em> vol 8(3) (LexisNexis, 4th
                    Ed Reissue, 2003) at para 21:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">All matters relating to the nature of the claimant’s remedy, such as
                        whether the claimant is entitled to an injunction or to an order for
                        specific performance or for an account of profits, are for the lex fori. A
                        claimant bringing an action in England to enforce a foreign right will not
                        be defeated merely because English remedies are greater or less than, or
                        otherwise different from, those in the foreign country …</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The above quotation is uncontroversial to the extent that it concerns
                    the availability of a remedy to the claimant. Indeed, the <em>lex
                        fori</em> must regulate remedies to a certain extent because the court
                    can only give its own remedies as opposed to alien remedies. As Lord Pearson
                    stated in <em>Chaplin v Boys</em> [1971] AC 356
                        (“<em>Chaplin</em>”) at 394C:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The lex fori must regulate procedure, because the court can only use its
                        own procedure, having no power to adopt alien procedures. To some extent, at
                        any rate, the lex fori must regulate remedies, because the court can only
                        give its own remedies[,] having no power to give alien remedies. For
                        instance, the English court could not make provision in its order to enable
                        the plaintiff, in the event of a possible future incapacity materialising,
                        to come back and recover in respect of it. That is alien procedure or an
                        alien remedy and outside the powers of an English court. On the other hand,
                        an English court may sometimes be able to give in respect of a tort
                        committed in a foreign country a remedy which the courts of that country
                        would be unable to give. For instance, the foreign courts might have no
                        power to grant an injunction or to make an order for specific performance or
                        for an account of profits.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     In the present case, what is in issue is not
                    whether the remedy of an injunction is available to Shanghai Electric: there is
                    no doubt that it is. The true question is whether the grant of an injunction in
                    the present application is a substantive right, in which case it would be
                    governed by the governing law of the Bond, or a matter of procedure in which
                    case it would be governed by the <em>lex fori</em>. To
                    determine this issue it is necessary to consider the purpose of the Bond. It was
                    issued by the Bank at the behest of Shanghai Electric who procured it pursuant
                    to the Contract. The issue of the Bond was a pre-condition for the Advance
                    Payment by PT Merak to Shanghai Electric of the sum of US$10.8m, and its purpose
                    was to provide security to PT Merak in the same amount in the event that
                    Shanghai Electric was unable to perform its obligations under the Contract.
                    Under the Bond, the Bank undertook to pay PT Merak up to US$10.8m upon written
                    demand. When PT Merak made the written demand, Shanghai Electric applied to this
                    court for an injunction to restrain the Bank from paying and to restrain PT
                    Merak from receiving payment. What is the nature of this right to the remedy of
                    an injunction?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     In the case of the fraud exception, as alluded
                    to in <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a> above, it is based on the
                    presumption of good faith. Although it is often characterised as an interim
                    measure to preserve the <em>status quo</em> pending final
                    resolution of the dispute between the parties, the true position must be that a
                    fraudulent call by a beneficiary on an on-demand bond would not be valid under
                    the contract between the issuer and the beneficiary on account of the
                    presumption of good faith. Thus the beneficiary would not be entitled to receive
                    the proceeds that the issuer would be otherwise be obliged to pay pursuant to
                    the call and so the injunction is final on the matter. If the parties then
                    proceed to final resolution of the dispute between them and the party that
                    procured the bond is found to be liable to the beneficiary for a certain sum,
                    the beneficiary can then make another call on the on-demand bond for that sum
                    and the procuring party would not be able to prevent the payment as he would not
                    be able to make out a case of fraud.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In the case of unconscionability, there have
                    been various expositions on the nature of the exception in several cases decided
                    after <em>Bocotra</em>. I set out below the various
                    authorities that have dealt with it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In <em>Raymond Construction Pte
                        Ltd v Low Yang Tong</em> [1996] SGHC 136 (“<em>Raymond Construction</em>”), Lai Kew Chai J
                    (“Lai J”) referred to <em>Bocotra</em>
                    and observed at [5]–[6] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5.    … The concept of "unconscionability" to
                            me involves unfairness, as distinct from dishonesty or fraud, or conduct
                            of a kind so reprehensible or lacking in good faith that a court of
                            conscience would either restrain the party or refuse to assist the
                            party. Mere breaches of contract by the party in question (in this case,
                            the first defendant) would not by themselves be unconscionable. Where
                            breaches are alleged, there would generally be (counter-allegations and)
                            disputes when the case is before the court. Therefore the first
                            defendant's breaches alone would not have sufficed. In my view,
                                <em>Royal Design Studio</em> (Thean J as
                            he then was) and <em>Kvaerner Singapore</em>
                            (Selvam J) are illustrations of the circumstances where payments
                            would have been unconscionable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">6.    … on the authorities considered, the
                            court was elaborating on what would amount to unconscionability
                            sufficiently grave and serious for equity to intervene. That proceeded
                            on the basis that equity would step in to prevent the enforcement of any
                            legal right if such enforcement would have been unjust. Any allegation
                            of fraud was put aside. Secondly, learned counsel for the first
                            defendant contended that mere allegations of breaches of contract by the
                            first defendant did not amount to unconscionability. I agreed with
                            him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In <em>Dauphin Offshore
                        Engineering &amp; Trading Pte Ltd v The Private Office of HRH Sheikh Sultan
                        bin Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan</em> [2000] 1 SLR 657
                        (“<em>Dauphin</em>”), the Court of Appeal
                    elaborated more fully on what would constitute unconscionability at
                    [42]–[47] in the following manner:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">42 We do not think it is possible to define
                        ‘unconscionability’ other than to give some very broad
                        indications such as lack of bona fides. What kind of situation would
                        constitute unconscionability would have to depend on the facts of each case.
                        This is a question which the court has to consider on each occasion where
                        its jurisdiction is invoked. There is no pre-determined
                        categorisation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">43 The genesis for the line of local cases applying the
                        concept of unconscionability as a separate ground to restrain a call on a
                        performance bond is to be found in the judgment of Everleigh LJ in
                            <em>Potton Homes Ltd v Coleman Contractors Ltd</em>
                        (supra) at p 28 where he said (obiter):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Moreover, in principle I do not think it possible to say that in no
                            circumstances whatsoever, apart from fraud, will the court restrain the
                            buyer. The facts of each case must be considered. If the contract is
                            avoided or if there is a failure of consideration between the buyer and
                            the seller for which the seller undertook to procure the issue of the
                            performance bond, I do not see why, as between seller and buyer, the
                            seller should not [sic — delete] be unable to prevent a call upon
                            the bond by the mere assertion that the bond is to be treated as cash in
                            hand. … If the contractor were unable to perform because the
                            employer failed to provide the finance, it would seem wrong to me if the
                            court was not entitled to have regard to the terms of underlying
                            contract and could be prevented from considering the question whether or
                            not to restrain the employer by a mere assertion that a performance bond
                            is like a letter of credit.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">44 In <em>GHL v Unitrack</em> (supra)
                        this court addressed an instance where the call would be
                        unconscionable:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">We are concerned with <em>abusive calls</em> on
                            the bonds. It should not be forgotten that a performance bond can be
                            used as an oppressive instrument, and in the event that a beneficiary
                            calls on the bond in circumstances, where there is <em>prima facie</em> evidence of fraud or unconscionability, the
                            court should step in to intervene at the interlocutory stage until the
                            whole of the circumstances of the case has been investigated. [Emphasis

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">45 In <em>Raymond Construction Pte Ltd v Low
                            Yang Tong &amp; Anor</em> (supra), Lai Kew Chai J
                        opined:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">The concept of ‘unconscionability’ to me involves
                            unfairness, as distinct from dishonesty or fraud, or <em>conduct of a kind so reprehensible or lacking in good
                                faith</em> that a court of conscience would either restrain
                            the party or refuse to assist the party. <em>Mere
                                breaches of contract by the party in question would not by
                                themselves be unconscionable</em>. [Emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">46 Other instances where unconscionability was held to apply are: (i) in
                            <em>Kvaerner Singapore Pte Ltd v UDL Shipbuilding
                            (Singapore) Pte Ltd</em> (supra), the beneficiary made a call
                        based on a breach induced by their own default and was not permitted to do
                        so; (ii) in <em>Royal Design Studios v Chang Development Pte
                            Ltd</em> (supra), an injunction was granted where the
                        beneficiary’s call on the bond was based on delays in construction
                        that were caused by the beneficiary’s own default in failing to make
                        timely payments on the interim certificates issued by the architect and a
                        considerable sum due to the account party under the joint venture agreement
                        was retained by the beneficiary; (iii) in <em>Min Thai
                            Holdings Pte Ltd v Sunlabel Pte Ltd &amp; Anor</em> (supra), the
                        defendant-buyer was restrained from calling on the performance guarantee
                        when the non-delivery of rice was due to floods caused by typhoon and there
                        was a ‘force-majeure’ clause in the contract, as the court felt
                        that it was unconscionable, in the circumstances, for the defendant-buyer to
                        receive payment under the performance guarantee.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">47 As for the argument that the efficacy and integrity of the
                        performance guarantee should not be undermined by a concept such as
                        unconscionability, which is less than precise, we would repeat the answer
                        given in <em>GHL v Unitrack</em> (at ¶24):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">It should also not be forgotten that a performance bond is basically a
                            security for the performance of the main contract, and as such we see no
                            reason, in principle, why it should be so sacrosanct and inviolate as
                            not to be subject to the court’s intervention except on the ground
                            of fraud. We agree that a beneficiary under a performance bond should be
                            protected as to the integrity of the security he has in case of
                            non-performance by the party on whose account the performance bond was
                            issued, but a temporary restraining order does not prejudice or
                            adversely affect the security; it merely postpones the realisation of
                            the security until the party concerned is given an opportunity to prove
                            his case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In <em>Eltraco International
                        Pte Ltd v CGH Development Pte Ltd</em> [2000] 4 SLR 290
                        (“<em>Eltraco</em>”), the Court of Appeal
                    said at [30] and [36]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">30    … Lai Kew Chai J said [in <em>Raymond Construction</em>] the concept of
                            ‘unconscionability’ involves unfairness. We agree. That
                            would be so. In every instance of unconscionability there would be an
                            element of unfairness. But the reverse is not necessarily true. It does
                            not mean that in every instance where there is unfairness it would
                            amount to ‘unconscionability’. That is a factor, an
                            important factor no doubt in the consideration. It is important that the
                            courts guard against unnecessarily interfering with contractual
                            arrangements freely entered into by the parties. The parties must abide
                            by the deal they have struck.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">36 It must be borne in mind that the court in restraining a beneficiary
                        from calling on a bond on the ground of unconscionability is exercising an
                        equitable jurisdiction …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The origin of the unconscionability exception
                    in Singapore appears to be the decisions of the High Court in <em>Royal Design Studio Pte Ltd v Chang Development Pte Ltd</em>
                    [1990] SLR 1116 and <em>Kvaerner Singapore Pte Ltd v
                        UDL Shipbuilding (Singapore) Pte Ltd</em> [1993] 3 SLR 350.
                    As noted by the Court of Appeal in <em>Dauphin</em> at
                    [45], both High Court cases relied on an <em>obiter
                        dictum</em> by Everleigh LJ in <em>Potton Homes v
                        Coleman Contractors</em> (1984) 28 BLR 19 at 28, to the
                    effect that as between the parties to the underlying contract, the situation is
                    not as straightforward as between the issuing bank and the beneficiary. It would
                    appear from the foregoing authorities that in restraining a call on an on-demand
                    bond on the ground of unconscionability, the court is exercising its equitable
                    jurisdiction based on some notion of fairness.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     I return to the question posed earlier at
                    [21], whether the grant of an injunction in the present application is a
                    substantive right. This issue was before the High Court in <em>Econ Corporation International Limited v Ballast-Nedam International
                        BV</em> [2003] 2 SLR 15 (“<em>Econ</em>”). The defendants there had sub-contracted
                    construction work to the plaintiffs who in turn procured a performance bond and
                    advance payment guarantee in favour of the defendants. The plaintiffs applied
                    for, <em>inter alia</em>, an injunction to restrain the
                    defendants from calling on the bond and guarantee. The plaintiffs also obtained
                    leave to serve the originating summons outside the jurisdiction on the
                    defendants in the Netherlands. The defendants applied, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, to set aside the order granting leave for service outside
                    jurisdiction. In support of its application, the defendants argued that the
                    court had no jurisdiction because no substantive relief was being sought by the
                    plaintiffs in the proceedings. The defendants relied on the case of <em>Mercedes-Benz AG v Leiduck</em> [1996] 1 AC 284
                        (“<em>Mercedes-Benz</em>”), where the
                    Privy Council, on appeal from Hong Kong, held that the Hong Kong court had no
                    jurisdiction to grant an order for service outside the jurisdiction solely for a
                        <em>Mareva</em> injunction, because such injunction did
                    not decide any substantive rights and did not call into existence any process
                    upon which the court could work. The plaintiffs distinguished <em>Mercedes-Benz</em> on the ground that the relief sought there was
                    akin to an attachment of the defendants’ assets pending the determination
                    of proceedings in another jurisdiction, which was unlike the injunction they
                    sought. Lai J agreed with the plaintiffs and held at [16] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... in this case the injunction sought by the plaintiffs is a substantive
                        relief and it determines the rights of the defendants under the Bond and the
                        Advance Payment Guarantees as to his entitlement to moneys thereunder and
                        the amount payable …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     I would respectfully agree with Lai J that the
                    right to injunction in the case of an on-demand bond pertains to a substantive
                    right. The essence of an on-demand bond is that the bank must pay according to
                    its guarantee, on demand, without proof or conditions. In <em>Bocotra</em>, the Court of Appeal had this to say about a performance
                    bond which possessed the nature of an on-demand bond (at 741H):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… It is important to bear in mind the commercial role that
                        performance bonds are intended to perform. The underlying purpose of a
                        performance bond is to provide a security which is to be readily, promptly
                        and assuredly realisable when the prescribed event occurs ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Any restraint on the right of the beneficiary
                    to receive immediate payment upon a demand on the Bond would effectively deprive
                    him of such right to immediate payment. The application by Shanghai Electric for
                    an injunction therefore concerns a substantive right vested in PT Merak under
                    both the Contract it had with Shanghai Electric and the terms of the Bond. It
                    follows therefore that English law governs the restraint on the calling of the
                    Bond.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the Demand was regular and valid</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     I turn now to consider the issues of fact. The
                    first issue is whether the Demand made by PT Merak was regular and valid. The
                    Bond states, <em>inter alia</em>, as follows (“the
                    Conditions”):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">WE HEREBY AGREE TO MAKE PAYMENT TO THE OWNER UPON OUR RECEIPT OF THE
                        OWNER’S FIRST WRITTEN DEMAND STATING:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1.    THE AMOUNT TO BE PAID TO THE OWNER,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.    THAT SUCH AMOUNT IS DUE TO THE OWNER PURSUANT TO
                            THE CONTRACT, AND</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.    THAT NOTICE OF DEFAULT WAS PREVIOUSLY GIVEN TO THE
                            CONTRACTOR.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     It is not disputed that the International
                    Chamber of Commerce Uniform Rules for Demand Guarantees (“ICC
                    URDG”) and English law governs the regularity and validity of the Demand.
                    Indeed, this is expressly provided for in the terms of the Bond:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">THIS GUARANTY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE
                        LAWS OF ENGLAND.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">THIS GUARANTY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH URDG
                        458 OF ICC, SAVE THAT IN THE EVENT OF ANY INCONSISTENCY BETWEEN THIS
                        GUARANTY AND URDG 458 OF ICC, THIS GUARANTY SHALL PREVAIL.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The question here is whether the Conditions
                    have been duly fulfilled. The answer, in my view, must be in the affirmative.
                    Turning to the Demand, it is evident that the Conditions have been met. The
                    material portions of the Demand are as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1.1    We refer to the
                            Advance Payment Security No 065-311-4-000479-0(001) for USD10,800,000.00
                            issued by the [Bank], Singapore branch on 20 November 2007, as
                            amended by the Advance Payment Security issued on 5 February 2008, in
                            favour of PT Merak Energi Indonesia (“the
                        Owner”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1.2    The Owner hereby
                            demands payment of USD10,800,000.00 (the

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1.3    The

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    The Amount is due to the Owner pursuant to the

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1.5    In accordance with

                            Commerce Rules (ICC Publication No. 458), the Owner confirms that
                            the Contractor has breached the Contract by, among others:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    Appointing subcontractors without
                                approval;</p>

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(c)    Failing to complete Payment Milestones by the
                                dates required by the Contract; and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(d)    Failing to implement a quality assurance
                                program as required by the Contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1.6    The Owner has terminated the Contract for
                            Contractor Default. The Advance Payment made to the Contractor is due
                            for repayment to the Owner and remains outstanding, notwithstanding the
                            Owner’s demand for repayment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     It is apparent that the Demand satisfied both
                    the Conditions and Art 20 of the ICC URDG. Firstly, the Demand is obviously
                    a “written demand”. Secondly, the Demand stated “the amount
                    to be paid to [PT Merak]”. Thirdly, the Demand stated “that such
                    amount is due to [PT Merak] pursuant to the Contract”. Fourthly, the
                    Demand stated “that Notice of Default was previously given to [Shanghai
                    Electric]”. Fifthly, PT Merak had complied with the requirements of
                    Art 20 of the ICC URDG by stating: (a) that Shanghai Electric was in breach
                    of the Contract, and (b) by setting out, in general terms, the respects in which
                    Shanghai Electric was in breach. It is therefore my view that the Demand is
                    regular and valid, and I am unable to agree with Shanghai Electric’s
                    submission that PT Merak had failed to adequately particularise the breaches and
                    to identify the “Notice of Default” given under the Contract upon
                    which the Demand was made.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether PT Merak acted fraudulently and/or unconscionably in making
                the Demand</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     That, however, is not the end of the matter as
                    Shanghai Electric contended that PT Merak had acted fraudulently and/or
                    unconscionably in making the Demand. I had held in <a href="#p1_30">[30]</a> that English law governs the restraint on the calling of
                    the Bond. Fraud therefore remains the only ground on which an injunction will be
                    granted to restrain PT Merak from calling on the Bond and the Bank from making
                    payment. However, for the sake of completeness I will also make my finding on
                    whether, even if Singapore law applied to this application, PT Merak had acted
                    unconscionably in making the Demand.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The law on Fraud</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Singapore law is no different from English law
                    on this issue. For fraud to be established, the party who is applying for the
                    injunction must show that the party who made the call (<em>ie</em> the beneficiary) had presented “a claim which he
                        <em>knows</em> at the time to be an invalid claim,
                    representing to the bank that he believes it to be a valid claim” (see
                        <em>GKN Contractors Ltd v Lloyds Bank plc</em> (1985)
                    30 BLR 53 at 63 (“<em>GKN
                    Contractors</em>”, emphasis added)) or that “the beneficiary
                    has no honest belief in the validity of the call on the performance
                    guarantee” (see <em>United Trading Corporation SA v Allied

                        (“<em>United Trading</em>”)). For the
                    fraud exception to be established, it must be shown that the beneficiary was
                    privy to the fraud.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The standard of proof that Shanghai Electric
                    must meet is a high one. Indeed, Ackner LJ in <em>United
                        Trading</em> opined on the standard of proof of the fraud exception at
                    561 as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The evidence of fraud must be clear, both as to the fact of fraud and as
                        to the bank's knowledge. The mere assertion or allegation of fraud would not
                        be sufficient (see <em>Bolivinter Oil S.A. v. Chase Manhattan
                            Bank N.A</em>., [1984] 1 Lloyd's Rep. 251 per Sir John
                        Donaldson, M.R., at p. 257). We would expect the Court to require strong
                        corroborative evidence of the allegation, usually in the form of
                        contemporary documents, particularly those emanating from the buyer. In
                        general, for the evidence of fraud to be clear, we would also expect the
                        buyer to have been given an opportunity to answer the allegation and to have
                        failed to provide any, or any adequate answer in circumstances where one
                        could properly be expected. If the Court considers that on the material
                        before it the only realistic inference to draw is that of fraud, then the
                        seller would have made out a sufficient case of fraud.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The first question is therefore … Have the plaintiffs established
                        that it is seriously arguable that, on the material available, the only
                        realistic inference is that [the beneficiary] could not honestly have
                        believed in the validity of its demands on the performance
                        bonds?”</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The law on Unconscionability</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     It is settled law in Singapore that in
                    addition to fraud, a bond injunction may be granted on the ground of <em>unconscionability</em>. The difficulty is what constitutes
                    “unconscionability”. In <a href="#p1_24">[24]</a>
                    to <a href="#p1_27">[27]</a> above I had set out various
                    expositions on the concept of unconscionability found in the authorities. As was
                    observed by Chao Hick Tin JA in <em>Eltraco</em> at
                    [31] however:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In determining whether a call on a bond is unconscionable, the entire
                        picture must be viewed, taking into account all the relevant factors
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     There is therefore no simple formula that
                    would enable a court to ascertain whether a party had acted unconscionably in
                    making a call on an on-demand bond. In the final analysis, whether or not
                    unconscionability has been made out is largely dependent on the facts of each
                    case. Having said that, in every case where unconscionability is made out, there
                    would always be an element of unfairness or some form of conduct which appears
                    to be performed in bad faith (see further <em>Raymond
                        Construction</em>). A mere breach of contract, by itself, is
                    insufficient to constitute unconscionability. Further, it is significant to note
                    that where there are genuine disputes between the plaintiff and the defendant, a
                    call on the bond cannot be termed as abusive as the defendant is entitled to
                    protect their own interest (see <em>Eltraco</em> at
                    [32]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The Court of Appeal in <em>Dauphin</em> set out the standard of proof to establish
                    unconscionability in the following manner at [57]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In coming to this view we have borne in mind the standard of proof
                        required of the alleged unconscionability. In <em>Bocotra</em> this court stated that “a higher degree of
                        strictness applies, as the applicant will be required to establish a clear
                        case of fraud or unconscionability in the interlocutory proceedings. It is
                        clear that mere allegations are insufficient.” In <em>GHL v Unitrack</em> this court implicitly endorsed the strong
                        prima facie standard propounded by the High Court in <em>Chartered Electronics Industries v Development Bank of Singapore
                            Ltd</em> [1999] 4 SLR 655. In our opinion, what must be
                        shown is a <em>strong prima facie case of
                            unconscionability</em> … [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Application of the law to the facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     I now turn to examine the bases upon which
                    Shanghai Electric contended that the Demand was fraudulent or unconscionable. In
                    this regard, Shanghai Electric’s factual allegations on the various
                    instances of fraudulent or unconscionable behaviour (on the part of PT Merak)
                    are as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41-p2_a"></a>(a)     PT Merak stated in its Demand that
                        it had made a prior demand for repayment of the Bond when it had not in fact
                        done so.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41-p2_b"></a>(b)     PT
                        Merak’s Notice of Termination was flawed and/or issued
                        prematurely.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41-p2_c"></a>(c)     PT
                        Merak was not entitled to call on the full amount of US$10.8m secured under
                        the Bond.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41-p2_d"></a>(d)     PT
                        Merak failed and/or refused to certify the completion of Payment Milestone
                        5.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41-p2_e"></a>(e)     The Addendum
                        was executed for the avoidance of tax by PT Merak.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41-p2_f"></a>(f)     PT Merak committed defaults under the
                        Contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41-p2_g"></a>(g)     PT
                        Merak unreasonably/unconscionably withheld approval of
                        subcontractors/subsuppliers.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41-p2_h"></a>(h)     PT Merak failed to certify and/or make payment to
                        Shanghai Electric expeditiously.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41-p2_i"></a>(i)     PT Merak refused to accept receipt of the Section 5.8
                        Certificate when it was allegedly delivered to their “office”
                        on 2 March 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     In respect of allegation (a), I find that PT
                    Merak in fact made a prior demand for repayment from Shanghai Electric in
                    para 9.2 of the Notice of Termination, where PT Merak informed Shanghai
                    Electric that “[t]he Advance Payment made by [PT Merak] to [Shanghai
                    Electric] is due for immediate repayment to [PT Merak]”. I note that the
                    Notice of Termination containing the prior demand was issued at 9.18am (Jakarta
                    time) (<em>ie</em> 10.18am Singapore time), and the Demand
                    was made on the Bank just after 11:00am (Singapore time). In the circumstances,
                    there clearly was a demand for repayment made prior to the Demand. Hence, I see
                    no merit in Shanghai Electric’s contention.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Turning to allegation (b), Shanghai Electric
                    asserted that PT Merak had “seemingly not given due (or any)
                    consideration to [Shanghai Electric’s] proposed Contractor’s
                    Remedial Plan as required by s 19.2.2(b) of the Contract,” had
                    “unreasonably rejected” the Contractor Remedial Plan, and
                    “abruptly terminated” the Contract. The salient portions of
                    s 19 of the Contract are as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>19.2.1Contractor Defaults</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The occurrence of any of the following events shall constitute a
                            “<b><em>Contractor

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b) Contractor otherwise fails adequately to perform any of its material
                        obligations under this Contract;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>19.2.2Rights of Owner upon Contractor
                            Default</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In addition to any other remedies Owner may have under this
                        Contract:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b) If a Contractor Default occurs under Section 19.2.1(b) Owner may
                        provide notice of default to Contractor (a “<b><em>Notice of Contractor Default</em></b>”). Contractor shall have
                        thirty (30) Days from its receipt of a Notice of Contractor Default in which
                        to cure such Contractor Default. If a Contractor Default is capable of being
                        cured, but not within thirty (30) Days from the receipt of a Notice of
                        Contractor Default regarding such Contractor Default, Contractor shall
                        deliver to Owner a plan (“<b><em>Contractor Remedial
                            Plan</em></b>”) within ten (10) Days from the receipt of the
                        Notice of Contractor Default (or within such longer time as Contractor may
                        reasonably require as demonstrated to the satisfaction of Owner within such
                        ten (10)-Day period), specifying what remedial actions Contractor plans to
                        take and the number of Days Contractor reasonably believes are necessary to
                        cure such Contractor Default. The Contractor Remedial Plan shall be subject
                        to Owner’s prior written approval, such approval not to be
                        unreasonably withheld. If (i) the Contractor Default is not cured within
                        such thirty (30)-Day period (or such longer period as Owner may have
                        approved in writing in the Contractor Remedial Plan), (ii) Contractor is not
                        at all times diligently proceeding to cure the Contractor Default, or (iii)
                        Owner reasonably withholds its approval of the proposed Contractor Remedial
                        Plan after not less than ten (10) Days following its submittal, Owner shall
                        have the immediate right to terminate this Contract by delivering to
                        Contractor a notice of termination, which termination shall be effective as
                        of the date of such notice.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It was also in dispute as to which (if any) of the letters sent out by
                    Shanghai Electric constituted the Contractor Remedial Plan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     In my view, this is a factual issue which is
                    best resolved in arbitration. In any event, I find that a plain reading of
                    s 19.2.2(b) of the Contract favours PT Merak’s case more than
                    Shanghai Electric’s allegation. Indeed, PT Merak’s submission that
                    it is entitled to terminate the Contract <em>as soon as after 20
                        days</em> from Shanghai Electric’s receipt of the Notice of
                    Contractor Default accords with an unstrained reading of s 19.2.2(b) of the
                    Contract. It is not obliged to wait until the end of the 30-day period. I
                    therefore cannot agree with Shanghai Electric’s contention that should PT
                    Merak choose to reasonably withhold their approval of the Contractor Remedial
                    Plan, Shanghai Electric would still have a <em>minimum</em>
                    of 30 days from receipt of the Notice of Contractor Default to cure the
                    Contractor Default(s).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Further, it is my view that only the first
                    Letter constituted the Contractor Remedial Plan which was in the form of an
                    attachment titled “Remedial proposal Rev. C”. By no stretch of the
                    imagination can one consider the second or the third Letters to be a part of the
                    Contractor Remedial Plan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     As for allegation (c), Shanghai Electric
                    argued that PT Merak failed to effect progressive reductions of the sum payable
                    under the Bond with respect to Payment Milestones 6, 7 and 8. However PT Merak
                    pointed out that as a consequence of the addendum, the parties reached an
                    understanding that the sum under the Bond would be made only in relation to
                    Payment Milestones for the “offshore” portion of the Work.
                    Therefore these progressive reductions only apply to the
                    “offshore” portion of the Work which included the procurement of
                    equipment and materials and the performance of the services by Shanghai
                    Electric, as more fully described in exhibit A and exhibit O of the Contract
                    (pursuant to the definition of “Work” under the
                Contract).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     In so far as allegations (d) to (i) are
                    concerned, these clearly concern genuine disputes of fact between the Parties.
                    Indeed, the best case that Shanghai Electric has is that all these allegations
                    (from (a) to (i)) constitute genuine disputes of fact between the Parties which
                    ought to be ironed out at the arbitration proceedings. In view of the foregoing,
                    the Demand by PT Merak clearly cannot be considered as fraudulent. The only
                    issue is whether it can be considered unconscionable. One important factor in
                    the present case is the fact that PT Merak had already paid the Advance Payment
                    of US$10.8m. By calling on the Bond, PT Merak is only effecting the return of
                    the monies it had paid out in advance to Shanghai Electric. This feature of the
                    case stands in stark contrast to the previous cases in which the Singapore
                    courts have restrained calls on on-demand bonds on the ground of
                    unconscionability. I do not see it as crossing the threshold of
                    unconscionability in the present case for PT Merak to obtain the money it had
                    advanced in the event of a dispute, as the parties had agreed to at the outset.
                    I can do no better than to turn to <em>Potton Homes</em>
                    which, according to the Court of Appeal in <em>Dauphin</em>
                    at [43], is the origin of the unconscionability exception in Singapore. There,
                    Eveleigh LJ had this to say about advance payments at 28:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">For a large construction project the employer may agree to provide finance
                        (perhaps by way of advance payments) to enable the contractor to undertake
                        the works. The contractor will almost certainly be asked to provide a
                        performance bond. If the contractor were unable to perform because the
                        employer failed to provide the finance, it would seem wrong to me if the
                        court was not entitled to have regard to the terms of the underlying
                        contract and could be prevented from considering the question whether or not
                        to restrain the employer by the mere assertion that a performance bond is
                        like a letter of credit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In the present case, the situation is reversed. The employer has
                    alleged that the contractor was unable to perform despite having been provided
                    the finance. It does not seem to me that it would be unconscionable for the
                    employer to make a call on the bond under these circumstances. Indeed it would
                    appear to me to be unconscionable to restrain him from doing so.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     For the reasons set out above, I am of the
                    view that the Injunction should be set aside and so order. I will hear parties
                    on the question of costs.</p>
