        Kan Ting Chiu J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiff, the Animal Concerns Research
                    &amp; Education Society, an Institution of Public Character under the Charities
                    Act (Cap 37, 2007 Rev Ed), had planned to establish a shelter for animals
                    (“the shelter”) comprising several structures on a plot of land
                    along Jalan Lekar (“the site”) leased from the Singapore Land
                    Authority (“SLA”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The first defendant, A.N.A. Contractor Pte Ltd,
                    a general contractor, became involved in the construction of the shelter. The
                    second defendant, Tan Boon Kwee, was a director of the first defendant as well
                    as the first defendant’s clerk of works and site supervisor for the
                    project.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Following discussions between the plaintiff and
                    the first defendant, the latter sent a letter dated 27 September 2006 to
                    the plaintiff, setting out the estimated costs of $694,000 for constructing the
                    shelter. On the basis of this letter the plaintiff and the first defendant
                    entered into a Memorandum of Undertaking dated 28 September 2006
                    (“MOU”) which set out in greater detail the first
                    defendant’s scope of works, which included:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1)    The preparation of plans for the proposed
                            development for submission to obtain the necessary approval from the
                            relevant authorities.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2)    The preparation of the site which includes site
                            clearance, removal of unwanted trees and shrubs, earthfill and disposal
                            of surplus material to formation of the required level of
                            development.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Under the heading “Summary and Understanding” it was
                    stated that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The [first defendant has] forwarded a preliminary pricing of the
                        development to the [plaintiff]. The [plaintiff] will begin to source and
                        raise the fund required for the development. The [plaintiff] will advise the
                        [first defendant] accordingly on the status of the fund raised from time to
                        time so as the [first defendant] will be able to gauged [<em>sic</em>] as and when the next stage of work can proceed. The
                        [plaintiff] will also inform the [first defendant] on the status of the
                        proposed project development from time to time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">(the “status-of-funding provision”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The first defendant commenced work in January
                    2007, and in February 2007, the plaintiff issued another document (“the
                    2007 Agreement”) which set out in even greater detail the scope of work,
                    concluding with:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The scope of work shall also include the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">–    The preparation of plans for the proposed
                            development for submission to obtain the necessary approval from the
                            relevant authorities.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">–    The preparation of the site which includes
                            site clearance, removal of unwanted trees and shrubs, earthfill and
                            disposal of surplus material to formation of the required level for the
                            development.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">–    Supply machinery with operator to break and
                            excavate area for the construction of reinforced concrete work such as
                            footings, slab, ramp, apron and surface drain for the various buildings
                            and enclosures.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">–    The list of buildings and enclosures to be
                            constructed are as shown in the Acres Wildlife Rescue Centre (AWRC)
                            layout plans.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>The construction of the AWRC will be completed and the
                            site handed over to [the plaintiff] by the end of April
                        2007</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This document was initialled by Choo Kong Leong, project manager of
                    the first defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The first defendant did not see the construction
                    of the shelter to fruition. Four issues arose which led to the present
                    proceedings. The first was the delay in the execution of the works. The second
                    was the use of wood chips as landfill and the consequences of that. The third
                    was the plaintiff’s complaint that the first defendant had failed to
                    construct the shelter in accordance with the specifications. The last issue was
                    the plaintiff’s refusal to pay some of the first defendant’s
                    claims.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The plaintiff sued the defendants for the delay,
                    the backfilling with the wood chips and the deficient construction, and the
                    first defendant counterclaimed against the first defendant for the unpaid
                    claims. The plaintiff based its action against the first defendant on contract
                    and negligence, and against the second defendant on negligence. The first
                    defendant’s counterclaim was founded on contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The delay</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The first defendant denied that there was an
                    agreement that the shelter was to be constructed by end April 2007, and
                    maintained that time for completion was at large under the status-of-funding
                    provision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The first defendant also raised a second defence
                    that the delay was caused by some unspecified “supervening event”
                    and “circumstances beyond the control of the 1st
                        Defendant”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The records of the correspondence exchanged
                    between the parties revealed the plaintiff’s concern over the progress of
                    the construction and the consequences of any delay. It wrote to inform the first
                    defendant on 15 May 2007<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> that all buildings must be completed by
                    20 May 2007 and on 17 May 2007<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> that the first defendant was to pay the
                    ground rent for the site until such time as the buildings were handed over to
                    the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The first defendant’s responded in an
                    email dated 19 May 2007<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> stating, <em>inter
                        alia</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Pursuant to our agreement whether in writing or verbally, we have not at
                        any point in time agreed to any compensation or damages resulting from our

                        follow a schedule and the <em>target date
                        set</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Due to the unforeseen disruption of sand and granite supply nation wide
                        since February 2007, its [<em>sic</em>] unavoidable for
                        any project to delay. In addition at our contracted sum without material
                        price compensation, any contractor would have abandoned the job by now.
                        Legal proceedings and arbitrations will only lead to further delay and kill
                        the project totally.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Even at the cost of material tripled [<em>sic</em>]
                        today, we took pain [<em>sic</em>] to continue since

                        to met [<em>sic</em>] with further critisms [<em>sic</em>]. The delay in our April 2007 progress payment
                        further dampened the situation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Despite the above, on a strictly without prejudice and goodwill basis, we
                        will pay your rental cost of $7,875 for May 2007. Beyond that, we will
                        further evaluate the occupational condition of the various buildings before
                        deciding further. Our offer will only apply if we receive our May 2007 and
                        subsequent progress payment promptly.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Apparently no handover was made after that,
                    and on 4 July 2007, the plaintiff’s executive director, Louis Ng,
                    wrote to the first defendant:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Please send us an official letter on [the first defendant’s]

                        delayed and when it is expected to be completed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The first defendant complied with its letter of 5 July 2007 which
                    stated: <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<u>Delay in Completion</u>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Main reasons caused for delay of the project</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1)    Commencement of site work begin [<em>sic</em>] only in early Mar 2007 instead of end Jan 2007 as
                            planned (Authorities requirements)</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2)    The unforeseen sand and granite supply disruption
                            causing severe material shortages in March 2007 and only stabilized
                            sometime in April 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3)    The unusually heavy rainfall in the month of April
                            2007 at Sungei Tengah area causing slow progress in work
                        done.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     These replies of the first defendant are
                    revealing and significant. The email of 19 May 2007 showed that there was a
                    set target date, in contradistinction to the defence that time for completion
                    was at large and dependent on the plaintiff’s ability to pay for the
                    development, and the letter dated 5 July 2007 indicated that completion was
                    delayed, allegedly by the shortage of supply of sand and granite and unusually
                    heavy rainfall.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     In the light of the admission that a target
                    completion date had been set, and that there was a delay, it was clear that the
                    first defendant had delayed the completion of the construction of the
                    shelter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The first defendant’s argument that the
                    date for completion was at large was unfounded as it was inconsistent with the
                    clear words of the 2007 Agreement and the clear admission of the first
                    defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The plea that the delay was caused by events
                    and circumstances beyond the first defendant’s control was not supported
                    by any evidence in respect of the disruption of supply of sand and granite and
                    unusually heavy rainfall and the first defendant also did not show that if those
                    conditions had existed, they had the effect of extending the target date or
                    excusing or reducing the liability of the first defendant to meet
                it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The wood chips</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The site was not level ground. Before the
                    construction of the structures was to proceed, the land had to be levelled, and
                    it was the first defendant’s duty to do that.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The first defendant sought to do that by using
                    backfill to raise the lower areas. It arranged with an entity known as Lok Sheng
                    Enterprises (“Lok Sheng”) to truck in wet soil and wood chips as
                    the backfill for that purpose. Lok Sheng was a one-man operation. The first
                    defendant did not know if the operator had any special qualification in land
                    fills. In its agreement with Lok Sheng, while there was mention of “wet
                    soil and wood chips”, there were no specifications set for the soil and
                    wood chips to be used.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> Lok
                    Sheng did not charge for the soil and the wood chips, and the first defendant
                    only paid the transport and labour costs for them to be delivered to the
                    site.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Soon after the back filling was done, there
                    were signs that something was amiss. A foul smell was detected, and dirty waste
                    water was discharged from the site. The plaintiff was concerned by the
                    development and had made known its unhappiness. This led the first defendant to
                    write to the plaintiff on 21 November 2007 that:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We regret and are perturbed by your action in broadcasting your complain
                            [<em>sic</em>] and making issue to various
                        departments with regard to the underground water discharge at the Quarantine
                        area. These happened at a time when we have just completed clearing the wood
                        chips that was accidentally buried at area [<em>sic</em>] near to the office block. Reinstatement works were also
                        completed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">By this letter, the first defendant accepted responsibility for the
                    wood chips and had regarded them as the cause of the problem although it was
                    disingenuous to say that the wood chips were “accidentally buried”
                    as it had arranged with Lok Sheng to use wet soil and wood chips as land fill on
                    the site. The “reinstatement works” alluded to were of no
                    effect.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The situation came to the attention of the SLA
                    and the National Environment Agency (“NEA”). NEA collected and
                    analysed the discharge and considered that it amounted to pollution of the
                    Kranji Reservoir and the environment. Following NEA’s instructions, the
                    first defendant engaged ENVIRONcorp Consulting (S) Pte Ltd
                    (“ENVIRONcorp”) to undertake a site contamination survey of the
                    site.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     ENVIRONcorp conducted site investigations
                    which involved drilling boreholes to obtain soil data and soil samples,
                    collecting representative soil and fill material samples at selected depths for
                    chemical analyses based on field observations and establishing groundwater
                    monitoring wells at each borehole location to collect groundwater
                    samples.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     In its draft report released in March 2008,
                    ENVIRONcorp concluded:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In summary, the Site Contamination Survey has identified <em>groundwater contamination at the site. The contaminants include
                            petroleum hydrocarbons, volatile organic compounds and semi-volatile
                            organic compounds</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As no significant concentrations of pollutants were detected in the soil
                        matrix and in the absence of initial soil baseline data for the site, it
                        cannot be concluded at this time as to the source of the groundwater
                        pollution. <em>Two possible scenarios are: (1) the pollutants
                            were introduced with the fill material and were subsequently leached
                            into the groundwater due to the heavy rainfall infiltration in recent
                            months; or (2) the groundwater was already impacted from historical
                            activities prior to the land filling</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Additionally, <em>the groundwater generally has elevated
                            [chemical oxygen demand] and [biochemical oxygen demand] concentrations;
                            the cause of which is likely to be from the decomposition of the fill
                            material (wood chip)</em>. Due to the highly permeable nature of
                        the fill, rainfall will readily infiltrate through the subsurface to the
                        shallow water table. The groundwater flow is towards the west and south
                        across the site. Rainfall infiltration will exacerbate the flow of
                        groundwater to the embankments and discharge as rainfall runoff along the
                        perimeters of the embankments, as noted by the dark brown/black stains along
                        the northern, western and southern slope embankments of the elevated
                        site.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The draft report was accepted and relied on by NEA, the first
                    defendant and the plaintiff, and no final report was issued.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     When the plaintiff received a copy of that
                    draft report, it engaged another company, Setsco Services Pte Ltd
                    (“Setsco”) to carry out further tests to ascertain whether the
                    backfill material caused the contamination. Setsco drilled boreholes to collect
                    soil samples and converted these boreholes into groundwater monitoring wells to
                    collect groundwater samples, examined the samples, and presented its report
                    (“the Setsco report”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Donald Folkoff, assistant manager in Setsco
                    and the writer of the Setsco report, referred to the two possible sources of
                    pollution mentioned in the ENVIRONcorp report. He agreed that the pollutants
                    could have been introduced with the fill material, but he did not agree that the
                    groundwater was polluted by historical activities prior to the land filling. He
                    explained that the latter hypothesis was inconsistent with the history of the
                    site as a rubber plantation; and the fact that the site was covered by brushes
                    and trees when construction of the site began in early 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The plaintiff forwarded the Setsco report
                    (with the report of ENVIRONcorp annexed) to Associate Professor Wang Jing-Yuan
                    of the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Nanyang Technological
                    University for his expert opinion. Dr Wang described his area of specialisation
                    as solid waste resource management, contaminated site assessment and
                    remediation, risk assessment and environmental management, and his curriculum
                    vitae showed him to be well qualified in these matters.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     After studying the reports, Dr Wang arrived at
                    the following conclusions:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">7.1    The land was contaminated;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">7.2    The contamination of the land did not arise out of
                            historical events;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">7.3    It is likely that the contamination of the land
                            was caused by the backfill; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">7.4    The backfill material is not suitable to be used
                            for the purpose of levelling the Site.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Another witness gave evidence on this issue.
                    The first defendant engaged as its expert witness Chua Giok Pien, a mechanical
                    engineer who claimed that over the years, he had acquired knowledge on
                    environment, safety and health matters. He presented a report in which he
                    stated, <em>inter alia</em>:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.    … As this site is zone for Agricultural use
                            by URA’s Master Plan and ACRE proposed use, it is completely
                            rational for the material for backfill to comprise earth with woodchips
                            etc</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4.    From my experience, wood chips is a by-product of
                            nature and its benefits to the environment is well documented as a
                            fertilizer the [<em>sic</em>] “back to
                            nature” compost. It is not a toxin per se</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Those opinions were of no value at all. He was
                    not saying that all wood chips, whether natural or contaminated, are suitable
                    land fill material, and he neither referred to the reports of ENVIRONcorp,
                    Setsco and Dr Wang nor considered whether there would have been polluted
                    discharge from the site if clean woodchips were used as backfill.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     On the evidence presented, I accept that the
                    woodchips used by the first defendant as landfill was the cause of the
                    contamination and pollution.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Compliance with building plans</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The plaintiff alleged that the first defendant
                    failed to comply with the specifications in the building plans of the shelter
                    that were submitted to the Building and Construction Authority
                    (“BCA”). The first defendant’s response was that although
                    the specifications were in the building plans, they were not in the layout
                    plan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The plaintiff pointed out that layout plans
                    and building plans serve different functions and contain different information.
                    Layout plans set out the layout of the different units of the shelter and the
                    internal arrangements of the units,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> while building plans set out the manner
                    in which the units were to be constructed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     If the first defendant’s contention were
                    accepted, it would mean that it was entitled to construct the units as located
                    in the plan to any design and with any material it chooses, without regard to
                    the particular designs and specifications laid down in the approved building
                    plans.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The unpaid claims</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The first defendant’s claim was for
                    $182,108.91. It was made up of two parts: firstly, for the sum of $145,402.56
                    due under its 7th progress claim dated 12 September 2007, and secondly, for
                    $36,706.35 for the progress of works from 12 September 2007 onwards. Two
                    forms of the 7th progress claim were produced. One claimed the sum of
                    $182,108.91 (<em>ie</em>, the sum of the counterclaim)
                    computed on the full completion of the items of work that were
                        undertaken.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> The other claimed the sum of
                    $145,402.51 based on partial completion of some of these items.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> It was not
                    explained how two progress claims were raised on the same day for different
                    sums. There were also no particulars given on the post-12 September 2007
                    claim for $36,706.35, <em>eg</em>, the work that was done,
                    and when the work was done.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     These were not the only difficulties with the
                    claim. The parties had not agreed on a procedure on the making and payment of
                    claims. The first defendant would have to establish that the work for which
                    payment is claimed has been done, and that the payment was in accordance with
                    the agreed sums, but the counterclaim was not presented in that way. All the
                    first defendant had done was to produce the two versions of the 7th progress
                    claim. No evidence was given to show that the work was done, or how the amount
                    claimed was arrived at. The first defendant had only shown that there was a
                    demand for payment in the 7th progress claim, but not the entitlement to the
                    payment demanded. For the claim in respect of $36,706.35 for work allegedly done
                    after 12 September 2007, neither demand nor entitlement was
                shown.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Findings of the court</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The claims against the first defendant</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The plaintiff had a contract with the first
                    defendant. When the first defendant delayed in the construction of the shelter
                    and caused the harmful backfill to be used, the first defendant was liable
                    towards the plaintiff for any loss or damage it suffered. As the contractual
                    relationship between the plaintiff and the first defendant was not in dispute,
                    it was not necessary for the plaintiff to have proceeded against the first
                    defendant on negligence, as any negligence on the part of the first defendant
                    would be a breach of an implied term of the contract that the first defendant
                    was to carry out its duties with due diligence to construct the shelter in
                    accordance with the approved building plans, and to use proper
                landfill.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     On the findings of fact I have made, the
                    plaintiff has proved its claims against the first defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The claim against the second defendant</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The plaintiff crystallised its case against
                    the second defendant in its closing submissions as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Plaintiff’s claim against the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                        Defendant is for negligence in supervising the Unauthorised Earthworks and
                        in particular, in ensuring that the Backfill material was suitable to be
                        used as backfill.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This was on the basis that the second defendant was appointed as the
                    Clerk of Works and site supervisor for the Project. The duties of a site
                    supervisor are set out in s 10(5) of the Building Control Act (Cap 29,
                    1999 Rev Ed) (“the Act”) which provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(5) Every site supervisor appointed under this section in
                        respect of any building works shall take all reasonable steps and exercise
                        due diligence in giving —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(a) in the case of large building works — full-time supervision
                            to the carrying out of the structural elements of the building works;
                            and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(b) in the case of small-scale building works — immediate
                            supervision to the carrying out of the critical structural elements of
                            the building works,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">to ensure that the structural elements or critical structural elements, as
                        the case may be, of the building works in question are carried out in
                        accordance with the plans of the building works supplied to him in
                        accordance with section 9(1)(<em>c</em>) by a qualified
                        person, and with any terms and conditions imposed by the Commissioner of
                        Building Control.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The definition of “building works” in s 2(1) of the
                    Act includes “site formation works” which is in turned defined in
                    reg 2 of the Building Control Regulations (S 643/2008) to include
                    earthworks for site stabilisation or any other kind of ground works. The
                    plaintiff then submitted that the backfill was a critical element of the
                    building works and that the second defendant was under a duty to supervise it,
                    and he had failed to do that.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     That submission was wrong. Section 10(5)
                    should be read carefully. Section 10(5)(<em>b</em>)
                    obliges a site supervisor to supervise the critical structural elements of the
                    building works, and s 2 of the Act states that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">"structural elements" means those parts or elements of a building which
                        resist forces and moments, and includes foundations, beams, columns, shear
                        cores, structural walls, struts, ground anchors, slabs, trusses, staircases,
                        load bearing walls and all other elements designed to resist forces and
                        moments but does not include doors, windows and non-load bearing
                        walls;</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Structural elements are parts or elements of a building. Earthworks
                    are not parts or elements of a building as they are not structural elements,
                    much less “critical structural elements” contemplated by
                        s 10(5)(<em>b</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Furthermore, even if the backfill was a
                    structural element, a site supervisor’s obligation under s 10(5) is
                    to ensure that it is carried out in accordance with the plans of the building
                    works or the terms and conditions imposed by the Commissioner of Building
                    Control. There was no evidence that the plans referred to the backfill material
                    to be used, or that the Commissioner had imposed any terms and conditions
                    relating to it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     In the circumstances, the plaintiff has failed
                    to establish that s 10(5)(<em>b</em>) of the Act
                    imposed on the second defendant a duty to supervise backfilling
                works.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The counterclaim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     As I have explained in <a href="#p1_32">[32]</a> –
                    <a href="#p1_33">[33]</a> above, the first defendant’s
                    counterclaim for the unpaid claims was not proved, and therefore
                fails.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
