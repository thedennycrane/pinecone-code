While the relevant third parties can and should be criticised for vacillating, there was ultimately no good reason to deny them their applications. No new facts were pleaded or relied on. Ms Lim was also not prejudiced since she was prepared to address the limitation defence as it was pleaded by Mr Chia, and his Striking Out Applications were brought on that basis; nor had she changed or compromised her position on account of the relevant third parties’ earlier position. To allow the relevant third parties to only plead and rely on limitation later would have been an inefficient and costly way to deal with the issue, and contrary to the Ideals of the Rules of Court 2021 (“ROC 2021”) under O 3 r 1.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The limitation issue</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 I agreed with the third parties that Ms Lim was time-barred from bringing an action for contribution against them by reason of s 6A of the LA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 The right to contribution arises from s 15(1) of the CLA:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Entitlement to contribution</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">15.—(1)  Subject to subsections (2) to (5), any person liable in respect of any damage suffered by another person may recover contribution from any other person liable in respect of the same damage (whether jointly with him or otherwise).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Section 6A of the LA imposes a two-year time limit for claiming contribution:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Special time limit for claiming contribution</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">6A.—(1)  Where under section 15 of the Civil Law Act 1909 any person becomes entitled to a right to recover contribution in respect of any damage from any other person, no action to recover contribution by virtue of that right shall, subject to subsection (3), <span class="font-italic">be brought after the end of the period of 2 years from the date on which that right accrued</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3)  If the person in question is held liable in respect of that damage —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) by a judgment given in any civil proceedings; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) by an award made on any arbitration,</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">the <span class="font-italic">relevant date shall be the date on which the judgment is given</span> or the date of the award, as the case may be.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(4)  For the purposes of subsection (3), <span class="font-italic">no account shall be taken of any judgment or award given or made on appeal</span> insofar as it varies the amount of damages awarded against the person in question.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 A defendant’s right to recover contribution arises from his liability in the original action. Where judgment is entered against two or more defendants jointly and severally, they have a common liability in respect of that judgment sum. Contrary to what Ms Lim appeared to be arguing, there is no separate or new right which arises at the point where a defendant seeks contribution against co-defendant(s) or third parties. As the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Tan Juay Pah v Kimly Construction Pte Ltd and others </span>[2012] 2 SLR 549 noted at [48] (citing Lord Bingham’s observation in <span class="font-italic">Royal Brompton Hospital NHS Trust v Hammond and others (Taylor Woodrow Construction (Holdings) Ltd) </span>[2002] 1 WLR 1397 at [5]), “[i]t is … a constant theme of the law of contribution from the beginning that B’s claim to <span class="font-italic">share with others his liability to A </span>rests upon the fact that they (whether equally with B or not) <span class="font-italic">are subject to a common liability to A </span>… the words ‘in respect of the same damage’, <span class="font-italic">emphasise the need for one loss to be apportioned among those liable</span>” [emphasis added]. Contribution is therefore simply an apportionment with others of the liability owed to the plaintiff in the original action. The right to contribution arises from that initial liability and there is no additional or different liability that arises at the point that a defendant seeks contribution from co-defendant(s) or third parties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Significantly, Ms Lim’s own pleaded case was that her claims against the third parties arose from her liability under the Suit 441 HC Judgment, and not some different liability.

This indicates that in the context of a judgment, the date of a judgment on <span class="font-italic">quantum</span> would be the relevant date for the purposes of s 6A(3). However, the problem for Ms Lim was that the Suit 441 HC Judgment was a judgment on both liability <span class="font-italic">and </span>quantum.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Although not strictly relevant to Ms Lim’s appeal against Mr Peter Chan, I make two points in respect of this claim for indemnity against VMIII and VMF3. First, Ms Lim was not precluded from seeking contribution or an indemnity from VMIII and VMF3 simply because they had been exonerated of liability in the Suit 441 Judgments. VMIII and VMF3 succeeded in their appeals on a narrow point relating to proof of attribution of Mr Tan’s knowledge (see <span class="font-italic">Crest Capital (Consequential Order</span><span class="font-italic">) </span>at [30]) – this did not preclude Ms Lim from seeking contribution from them <span class="font-italic">on some other basis</span>. However, Ms Lim’s basis for claiming the indemnity was unclear – she simply pleaded that it was “just and equitable” that VMIII and VMF3 indemnify her on the basis that the Geelong Payment was wrongfully diverted and misapplied towards one of the Disputed Facilities (“the Standby Facility”), without pleading how they were responsible for this.

</div> Second, in so far as Ms Lim was attempting to <span class="font-italic">challenge</span> findings made in the Suit 441 Judgments by claiming an indemnity in respect of the Geelong Payment, she may be precluded from doing so because of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> and/or abuse of process. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 I make further observations on the issue of <span class="font-italic">res </span><span class="font-italic">judicata</span> below at [64]–[76]. It suffices to note here that the High Court and the Court of Appeal did not appear to make conclusive findings on whether IHC had intended the Geelong Payment for the Geelong Facility and not the Disputed Facilities. Both courts found this issue irrelevant to the question of the Suit 441 Defendants’ liability towards IHC: the Suit 441 HC Judgment at [227] and the Suit 441 CA Judgment at [191(b)]. Hence, in so far as Ms Lim’s claim for indemnity was based on the argument that IHC had intended the Geelong Payment for the Geelong Facility, but the Crest Entities had wrongfully diverted the Geelong Payment to the Disputed Facilities (see [13] above), <span class="font-italic">res judicata </span>may not apply to preclude it. In the event, I did not have to deal with this issue since the claim for indemnity under the TPSOCs was likewise time-barred under s 6A of the LA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 For completeness, I address Mr Chia’s argument that the pleaded cause of action against him at para 13 of the TPSOCs – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>that he breached his duty to Ms Lim to take reasonable care in issuing instructions to her, and not to issue instructions for improper purposes which would expose her to legal liability – was also time-barred pursuant to s 24A(3) of the Limitation Act.

Essentially, the court may at or after the trial of the action, or, if the action is decided otherwise than by trial, on an application by summons, order such judgment as the nature of the case may require to be entered for the defendant against the co-defendant: see O 10 r 7.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The <span class="font-italic">time</span> at which a contribution claim may be made is also important. In this regard, as noted earlier at [41], a contribution claim may be made even <span class="font-italic">before </span>liability has been determined at trial. Hence, the Appellate Division in <span class="font-italic">Hwa Aik </span>(at [31]) emphasised that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Solicitor[s] should be <span class="font-italic">immediately aware of the possible need to seek contribution from another co-defendant under ss 15 and 16 of the CLA </span><span class="font-italic">where there is possibly more than one tortfeasor</span>, and then consider taking the step to file a formal claim for contribution. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 At first blush, it may appear inconsistent to state that a contribution claim may be made before liability has been determined at trial, when the right to recover contribution under s 6A of the LA only accrues when judgment is given. The two are not inconsistent. The “accrual” of the right to recover contribution under s 6A of the LA is different from when the entitlement to recover contribution arises under s 15(1) of the CLA. As the court in <span class="font-italic">Aer Lingus </span>observed at [10] in relation to s 1 of the Civil Liability (Contribution) Act 1978 (c 47) (UK) and s 10 of the UK Limitation Act (which are <span class="font-italic">in pari materia</span> to s 15 of the CLA and s 6A of the LA respectively):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[A]lthough the two-year period [under the UK Limitation Act] is said to run from the date on which a right to recover contribution “accrues”, <span class="font-italic">it is difficult to think, in the absence of contrary authority, that that expression is intended to convey that the cause of action for a contribution under the 1978 Act only arises at the time of any judgment</span> … the 1978 Act, which creates the right to contribution, is written in terms of the mere occurrence (or concurrence) of liability in respect of the same damage. There is no apparent need for that liability to have been established. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59  Indeed, the cause of action for contribution arises under s 15(1) of the CLA, not s 6A of the LA. The latter only deals with when the limitation period for seeking contribution expires – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, two years after a judgment/award is given or a settlement amount is agreed upon.<span class="font-italic"> </span>Thus, the “accrual” of the right to recover contribution under s 6A of the LA is characterised as such merely for the purpose of establishing a date from which the limitation period starts to run. This explains the practice of claiming contribution before trial. As observed by the court in <span class="font-italic">Aer Lingus </span>(at [10]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If the cause of action for a contribution only arose after judgment … then a defendant could never claim contribution from a co-defendant … at any earlier stage: but that is something which happens all the time. Rather, section 10 [of the UK Limitation Act] is stating a “special time limit for claiming contribution”, as the heading to the section indicates, and <span class="font-italic">the concept of the right accruing is fashioned merely for the purposes of dating the beginning of the two-year limitation period</span>. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 In the present case, Ms Lim sought contribution based on liability which was established in the Suit 441 HC Judgment. Section 6A(3) of the LA therefore clearly applied to impose a two-year limitation period on her claim for contribution starting from the date of the Suit 441 HC Judgment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 In the circumstances, it is important for parties or their counsel to (a) assess, as early as possible, the issue of seeking contribution from another co-defendant or third party; (b) follow the proper procedure for filing a contribution claim; and (c) take into account the application of the two-year limitation period under s 6A of the LA. This would avoid defendants being unable to obtain contribution due to the absence of a formal claim for contribution, as was the case in <span class="font-italic">Hwa Aik </span>(at [30]) and <span class="font-italic">Manickam Sankar v Selvaraj Madhavan (trading as MKN Construction &amp; Engineering) and another </span>[2012] SGHC 99 at [85]. It would also avoid the unfortunate situation of a defendant being time-barred from bringing his or her contribution claim, as was the case for Ms Lim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Further, while s 6A of the LA allows parties to file contribution claims after the rendering of judgment following trial, there are practical reasons why it may be preferable for parties to do so prior to trial:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) first, it may in some cases be beneficial to have contribution claims decided within the same proceedings, as the trial judge would be able to decide such claims with the facts and issues of the case still fresh in his or her mind; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) second, parties would avoid the time and costs associated with bringing a fresh and separate claim for contribution outside of the main proceedings. From the court’s case-management perspective, deciding contribution claims within the main proceedings would also be more efficacious; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) third, bringing all the relevant parties within the same action would allow a full ventilation of the evidence and issues in dispute, and bind them to the findings made by the court. This will avoid inconsistent findings of fact. It may also facilitate a settlement of the claims or issues in dispute; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) fourth, parties would avoid the risk of being time-barred from bringing their contribution claims. Parties who delay bringing their contribution claims in the hope that they will not be found liable or that their co-defendants will settle their common liability and not look to them for contribution are simply burying their heads in the sand.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 That said, in certain situations, it is understandable why parties may delay the bringing of contribution claims until after the pronouncement of judgment on liability; for example, where the main claim is not likely to succeed such that the party incurs unnecessary costs by bringing a claim for contribution. However, such concerns should be immaterial where contribution is sought against a co-defendant. In such a case, the procedure under O 10 r 8 of the ROC 2021 should almost always be invoked. If that had been done in this case, Ms Lim would not find herself in the situation she is in. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Res judicata</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Given his finding on the limitation issue, the AR did not consider it necessary to deal with the arguments on <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> and abuse of process. As noted above at [21], Ms Lim submitted that <span class="font-italic">res judicata </span>was not relevant since the AR decided not to hear arguments on this ground and no appeal had been filed by the third parties against the AR’s decision. I rejected that argument. The third parties could not have filed an appeal against the AR’s decision not to hear this ground given his decision to strike out Ms Lim’s third party actions. The arguments on <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> were made in the written submissions and not abandoned – they remained alive in the appeals before me. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Having said that, it was not necessary for me to decide the issue of <span class="font-italic">res judicata </span>given my finding that Ms Lim’s claim against the third parties was time-barred. Nevertheless, I make several observations on the issue. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 First, there was plainly an identity of parties and subject matter in the Contributions Claims with Suit 441:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the Crest Entities, along with Ms Lim, were parties to Suit 441 and the appeals therefrom to the Court of Appeal. They were also parties to the Contribution Claims;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the facts pleaded by Ms Lim to claim a contribution/indemnity from the Crest Entities arose in Suit 441 and were considered in both the Suit 441 HC and CA Judgments; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) based on the evidence led, the High Court concluded that Ms Lim was negligent on account of her failure to inquire as to the purposes of the drawdowns on the Disputed Facilities, and to raise the matter to the IHC board of directors before the legal documentation for the Standby Facility was executed (the Suit 441 HC Judgment at [135]). It was based on this finding of negligence that the High Court found her liable for certain amounts that were paid out, in that IHC would not have incurred that loss but for its entry into the Standby Facility (the Suit 441 HC Judgment at [335] and [336]). These findings were upheld by the Court of Appeal in the Suit 441 CA Judgment at [176]–[184];</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) the above finding of negligence was attributable to Ms Lim’s own conduct and breach of duty to IHC, and was independent of the conduct of the Crest Entities (see the Suit 441 CA Judgment at [157]); and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) the Suit 441 CA Judgment was a final and conclusive judgment on the merits of Ms Lim’s and the Crest Entities’ respective cases in relation to their liability to IHC for the damages awarded under the Suit 441 HC Judgment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Ms Lim in her TPSOCs appeared in some respects to be re-litigating matters decided in the Suit 441 Judgments. While apparently acknowledging that she breached the duty of due skill, care and diligence which she owed to IHC, the thrust of the TPSOCs was that the third parties should pay contribution because their actions <span class="font-italic">caused or contributed </span>to her breach of duty to IHC. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 There were two difficulties with Ms Lim’s pleaded case. First, she asserted that the relevant third parties were culpable to such an extent that they should bear the entirety of the amount in contribution claimed against her. Ms Lim pleaded, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, that the relevant third parties should bear the <span class="font-italic">whole</span> of her liability under the Suit 441 HC Judgment having regard to their culpability “in comparison to <span class="font-italic">an innocent error of judgment</span> or neglect on [her] part” [emphasis added].

</div></div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Mr Lim was “a servant or agent or representative of” the Crest Entities – in raising this point, Ms Lim was presumably seeking to make those entities vicariously responsible for Chu Pei’s statements; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Chu Pei’s statements were made “in agreement with and/or on the instruction and/or with the connivance of”, amongst others, Mr Peter Chan.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 But Chu Pei’s statements were in evidence in Suit 441, and no finding was made in the Suit 441 HC Judgment or the Suit 441 CA Judgment that they were in any way relevant to Ms Lim’s breach of duty. That also did not appear to be the case she ran in Suit 441, although she could have done so. More importantly, the Court of Appeal found (at [157] of the Suit 441 CA Judgment) that Ms Lim breached her duty because:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) she was aware that IHC had secured the Standby Facility for general working capital purposes;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) she was aware that the drawdowns under the Standby Facility must have taken place;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) she would have been aware that the drawdowns were concealed from IHC and her;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(d) she therefore did not know what the drawdowns were in fact used for;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(e) it was the confluence of such circumstances that should have caused Ms Lim to realise that there were some irregularities and improprieties in relation to the drawdowns; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(f) the fact that the drawdowns were concealed from her should have heightened her concern and caused her to alert the board of IHC. </div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 In other words, the fact that the drawdowns and purchases of IHC shares had been concealed from her did not cause or contribute to her breach of duty to IHC; on the contrary, it strengthened the case against her. Ms Lim’s pleaded case in the TPSOCs therefore appeared to directly challenge the factual findings made in the Suit 441 CA Judgment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 I note further that the position taken by Ms Lim in the TPSOCs – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that the third parties should pay contribution <span class="font-italic">because</span> their actions caused or contributed to her breach – presents challenges for the <span class="font-italic">merits</span> of the contribution claim itself, as regards the Crest Entities, Mr Peter Chan and Mr Lim. For the reasons above, the Court of Appeal found that their actions did not cause or contribute to Ms Lim’s breach; hence, these third parties cannot be liable to pay contribution on that ground. On the other hand, in so far as the conduct of these third parties was one of the causes of IHC’s loss, alongside Ms Lim’s (unrelated) breach, that may be grounds for her to claim contribution (subject to the limitation issue). But that was not how her case was pleaded.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 I also note that Ms Lim sought, in the TPSOCs, to minimise her role in IHC – she pleaded that her “role in oversight of the Corporate Finance team was confined to the administrative part of Corporate Finance; to see that the work was done in time”.
