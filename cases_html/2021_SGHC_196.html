Clause 18 of the Bill introduced amendments to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”) broadening the Director’s power to make treatment and rehabilitation orders (“DRC Orders”) and increasing the duration of DRC Orders and drug supervision orders (“Supervision Orders”). I refer to these amendments to the MDA as the “2019 amendments”. I found that the Applicant’s reliance on the Minister’s speech was misconceived and dismissed his application for leave to commence judicial review proceedings.

</div>
</div> At the second reading of the Bill introducing the 2019 amendments, the Minister had explained the enhanced rehabilitation regime for persons who only consume drugs, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, pure drug abusers. The Applicant and the Respondent relied on various parts of the Minister’s speech, the key excerpts of which are as follows (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</span> (15 January 2019) vol 94 (K Shanmugam, Minister for Home Affairs)):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… we have been studying how to bring down recidivism down even further. Our assessment is that for pure abusers, we can now afford to focus, shift our balance quite decisively, and focus more on rehabilitation as opposed to detention. We all know that long periods of detention can affect the abusers' employability after they are released. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Addiction is a complex problem. Staying clean is ultimately dependent on a variety of factors including the resolve of the abuser. But it is a difficult journey for the abusers. Often, they become estranged from their families, communities and the workplace. It is harder for them to reintegrate once released. A number get back into bad company, on drugs, and then they get re-arrested at various points; the cycle repeats itself over and over again.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">So, we have decided, let us try and distinguish between those who only consume drugs – I call them the “pure” abusers – from those who also face charges for other offences. For example, trafficking, property offences, violent offences. So, if they have abused drugs and they have committed some of these other crimes, we put them in one category. We put those who only abused drugs in one category.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">For the second group, those who consume drugs and commit other offences, they will continue to be charged for their drug-consumption offences as well as the other offences. If they are liable, they will be sentenced to LT [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Long-Term Imprisonment].</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">For those who only abuse but do not have any other criminal offence, that means they only consume drugs and they admit to their drug abuse, then the general approach, regardless the number of times, would be that the Director of CNB will make the appropriate supervision or detention order, and channel them into the rehabilitation regime.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">So, this group of abusers may also include those who have minor consumption-related offences like possession of drug-taking utensils or possession of small quantities of drugs. If AGC agrees with CNB that there is no need to charge the drug abusers for these minor offences, then these persons will also be channelled to the rehabilitation regime.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">This will be conditional on the abusers admitting to their drug offences. If they deny their drug abuse despite the evidence, that means they have really not accepted the need for rehabilitation, they are likely to be charged in court, if AGC concurs.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">And, really, to benefit as many persons as possible, CNB, with the concurrence of AGC, will generally not charge abusers, who meet the criteria I have explained, from tomorrow, 16 January 2019, on the assumption that the Bill is passed today.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Summary of the Applicant’s case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The Applicant sought the following orders:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) a quashing order to quash the Attorney-General’s Decision;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) a mandatory order that:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) the Director reconsider his Decision; and</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) the Attorney-General reconsider his Decision; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) a declaration that:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) the Director’s Decision was contrary to Art 12 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (1985 Rev Ed, 1999 Reprint) (“the Constitution”), was illegal, was irrational, or was contrary to the Applicant’s substantive legitimate expectations; and</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) the Attorney-General’s Decision was contrary to Art 12 of the Constitution, was illegal, was irrational, or was contrary to the Applicant’s substantive legitimate expectations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The Applicant argued that the materials before this court disclosed an arguable or <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case of reasonable suspicion in favour of granting the remedies sought.

The question in this case was whether the Minister’s statement in Parliament could constrain the considerations to be weighed by the decision-makers, who were the Director and the Attorney-General. A parliamentary speech by a minister cannot, to my mind, introduce factors which are otherwise irrelevant or exclude those which are otherwise relevant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 The Applicant argued that the reasonable decision-maker would have considered the prevailing moral standards as reflected in “the pronouncements and legislative acts of Parliament”.

</div> That is correct in that the decision-maker must exercise the discretion in accordance with the legislation conferring that discretion: see <span class="font-italic">Chng</span><span class="font-italic"> Suan Tze v Minister for Home Affairs and others and other appeals </span>[1988] 2 SLR(R) 525 at [86]. But it does not follow that the decision-maker is bound to take into account the considerations described in the minister’s speech. Neither does it follow that the decision-maker is forbidden from taking into account other considerations. That is because a minister’s speech at the second reading of a bill is not law. A second reading speech serves to open the debate at the second reading stage by setting out and explaining the clauses in the bill: see Thio Li-ann, <span class="font-italic">A Treatise on Singapore Constitutional Law </span>(Academy Publishing, 2012) at para 6.071. Such a speech may perhaps be relevant in respect of a claim of breach of legitimate expectation or estoppel, or a claim that the speech introduced a gloss to be applied to statutory language, both of which will be considered below; but aside from these, the speech itself creates no legal rights or obligations between the State and the individual.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 The discretion that Parliament creates by the statute is conferred on a particular office holder. That office holder must, absent specific language in the statute, be expected and permitted to examine relevant factors regardless of what is or is not contained in the second reading speech. Relevancy and irrelevancy are defined ultimately by the statute, which can prescribe what may, must or must not be considered: see Mark Aronson &amp; Matthew Groves, <span class="font-italic">Judicial Review of Administrative Action </span>(Lawbook Co, 5th Ed, 2013) at para 5.30. In the context of the exercise of a discretion or power, a parliamentary speech can only suggest considerations. Thus, beyond this, a parliamentary speech can be material only if it assists in interpreting the legislative provision itself or if it somehow prevents a departure from the position espoused in the speech by way of legitimate expectation or an estoppel, which will be considered next.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Substantive legitimate expectation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Turning then to substantive legitimate expectation, the question of whether this doctrine should be recognised in Singapore remains open: <span class="font-italic">Kardachi, Jason Aleksander v Attorney-General</span> [2020] 2 SLR 1190 at [56]–[57]. Earlier, in <span class="font-italic">SGB Starkstrom Pte Ltd v Commissioner for Labour </span>[2016] 3 SLR 598 (“<span class="font-italic">Starkstrom</span>”), the Court of Appeal<span class="font-italic"> </span>expressed concerns about adopting this doctrine as opposed to some form of procedural legitimate expectation. Doing so could lead to redefining the courts’ approach to the doctrine of separation of powers and the relative roles of the judicial and the executive branches of government: <span class="font-italic">Starkstrom </span>at [59]. With respect, I share that concern. As substantive matters generally lie within the purview of the executive and legislative branches of government, tying down the ability to change positions would seem to encroach on the bailiwick of others. Additionally, in so far as any restraint is necessary, the doctrine of estoppel, despite its origins in equity rather than the common law, could be a sufficient instrument of control if appropriately developed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Be that as it may, I note that the formulation of the doctrine of substantive legitimate expectation by Tay Yong Kwang J in <span class="font-italic">Chiu Teng @ Kallang Pte Ltd v Singapore Land Authority </span>[2014] 1 SLR 1047 (“<span class="font-italic">Chiu Teng</span>”) does not significantly differ from estoppel, as it requires detrimental reliance.

Although the Minister’s second reading speech might aid in determining the purpose of s 34(2) of the MDA, the starting point was the ordinary meaning of the text: see <span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock </span>at [43]. Section 34(2) of the MDA provides:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Supervision, treatment and rehabilitation of drug addicts</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">34.</span>— … (2) If, as a result of such medical examination or observation under subsection (1) or both the urine tests conducted under section 31(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) or the hair test conducted under section 31A, <span class="font-italic">it appears to the Director</span> that it is necessary for any person examined or observed, or who supplied the urine specimen for the urine tests, or who supplied the hair specimens for the hair test —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) to be subject to supervision, the Director may make a supervision order requiring that person to be subject to the supervision of an officer of the Bureau for a period not exceeding 5 years; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) to undergo treatment or rehabilitation or both at an approved institution, the Director may make an order in writing requiring that person to be admitted for that purpose to an approved institution.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Section 34(2) is clear and unambiguous, taking into account its context in the MDA and its purpose or object. There was no basis to read into the text a requirement that the Director have regard only to whether the person has admitted to consuming drugs and whether the person has committed offences distinct from his drug consumption.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Second, the Minister’s speech did not in fact clothe the text with the interpretation advanced by the Applicant. Rather than suggesting that the quantity of drugs in a person’s possession was an irrelevant consideration, the Minister’s speech suggested that it was relevant. The Minister’s speech focused on distinguishing pure drug abusers from those who might have committed other offences, including trafficking. He said that the former group could include those who might have committed minor consumption-related offences, including “possession of small quantities of drugs”, if the AGC agreed with the CNB that they not be charged for those minor offences (see [4] above). Because the Minister mentioned quantity as a relevant consideration, nothing in the speech could be taken as constraining the interpretation of the statutory text to conclude that the Applicant was meant to be entitled to or eligible for supervision or detention rather than prosecution.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 As for the Attorney-General’s Decision, the Applicant argued that the Attorney-General’s exercise of prosecutorial discretion conferred by Art 35(8) of the Constitution was <span class="font-italic">ultra vires</span>. The Applicant submitted that, like the Director, the Attorney-General took into account irrelevant considerations and failed to take into account the relevant considerations reflected in the Minister’s speech.
