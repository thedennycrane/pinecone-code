Some of these powers may be exercised on the liquidator’s own volition; others require the Court’s approval. Under s 272(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the CA,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the liquidator’s power to compromise debts owing to the company in liquidation is subject to approval by the Court or the committee of inspection. The main issue in these proceedings concerned the approach that the Court should take in deciding whether to grant such approval. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The applicants in both applications, Mr Seshadri Rajagopalan and Mr Jotangia Paresh Tribhovan, are the joint and several liquidators (collectively, the “Liquidators”) of The Wellness Group Pte Ltd (“Wellness”), which was ordered to be wound up in Companies Winding Up No 62 of 2018 (“CWU 62/2018”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The first application was Originating Summons No 434 of 2020 (“OS 434/2020”), in which the Liquidators sought the Court’s approval authorising them to compromise and discharge Wellness’ claims against (a) Sunbreeze Group Investments Ltd (“Sunbreeze”); and (b) Mr Manoj Mohan Murjani (“Manoj”) and Mrs Kanchan Manoj Murjani (“Kanchan”), on the terms of a draft Deed of Settlement (the “Settlement Deed”). Sunbreeze, which was wholly owned and controlled by Manoj and Kanchan, held 80.62% of the shareholding in Wellness. At the material times, Manoj and Kanchan were also directors of Wellness. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The second application was Summons No 1841 of 2020 (“SUM 1841/2020”), filed in Originating Summons No 1416 of 2019 (“OS 1416/2019”). In Originating Summons No 1416 of 2019 (“OS 1416/2019”), the Liquidators had applied for an order that they be at liberty to take all steps as they deem necessary to recover a sum of $8,866,057.70 from Sunbreeze. In SUM 1841/2020, the applicants sought the leave of Court to discontinue OS 1416/2019. It was common ground that SUM 1841/2020 was contingent on the Court’s approval in OS 434/2020. OS 1416/2019 would no longer be required if the approval sought in OS 434/2020 was granted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions, I granted the Liquidators’ applications in both OS 434/2020 and SUM 1841/2020. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Factual background</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 In April 2018, two shareholders of Wellness, Vickers Private Equity Fund VII LP and Vickers Fund II LP (collectively, "the Vickers Funds”), filed CWU 62/2018, in which they applied for a winding up order against Wellness under s 254(1)(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) and s 254(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) of the CA. Subsequently, the Vickers Funds withdrew their application and another shareholder, EQ Capital Investments Ltd (“EQ Capital”), was substituted as the plaintiff in place of the Vickers Funds. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 On 2 May 2019, I ordered Wellness to be wound up (see <span class="font-italic">EQ Capital Investments Ltd v The Wellness Group Pte Ltd </span>[2019] SGHC 154). I was satisfied that EQ Capital had established sufficient grounds to justify the winding up of Wellness under both ss 251(1)(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) and 254(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) of the CA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 On 17 May 2019, I approved the appointment of the Liquidators. No committee of inspection was established in Wellness’ liquidation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 Sunbreeze and Wellness appealed against my decision to wind up Wellness in Civil Appeal No 96 of 2019 and Civil Appeal No 114 of 2019 respectively. On 16 January 2020, the Court of Appeal dismissed both appeals, finding that the grounds for the winding up were satisfied and that the winding up order had been properly made in the circumstances of the case.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Settlement Deed</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 In CWU 62/2018, I had made the following findings, among others:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Manoj had caused Wellness to borrow $1.05m from Sunbreeze and this sum was used to pay the party-and party costs ordered against Wellness and Manoj in respect of an earlier action in High Court Suit No 187 of 2014 (“S 187/2014”). S 187/2014 was a claim by Wellness and Manoj for oppression; it was dismissed (see <span class="font-italic">The Wellness Group Pte Ltd and another v OSIM International Ltd and others and another </span><span class="font-italic">suit </span>[2016] SGHC 64) and the appeal to the Court of Appeal in Civil Appeal No 64 of 2016 was also dismissed.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Manoj had caused Wellness to distribute dividends to Wellness’ shareholders in excess of the company’s accumulated profit for the year ended 31 March 2011. The excess dividends amounted to $10,997,730.49.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 The Liquidators demanded payment of the excess dividends from the shareholders of Wellness. The Vickers Funds and EQ Capital repaid their respective shares of the excess dividends to Wellness. Sunbreeze declined to repay its share, which amounted to $8,866,057.70. Instead, Sunbreeze demanded that the Liquidators call for an extraordinary general meeting (“EGM”) to authorise and direct the Liquidators to divide among the shareholders in specie assignments of each shareholder’s respective share of the excess dividends, subject to payment of the company’s liabilities. The EGM was held on 11 November 2019 and, given Sunbreeze’s 80.62% shareholding, the resolution was passed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 The Liquidators did not believe that the resolution was in the best interests of the company. They also believed that Sunbreeze had a conflict of interests in voting on the resolution. They therefore filed OS 1416/2019 (see [4] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 After the appeals against my decision in CWU 62/2018 were dismissed, the Liquidators were approached to engage in without prejudice negotiations with Sunbreeze, Manoj and Kanchan on the global resolution of claims that Wellness may have against them and claims that each may have against Wellness. The negotiations resulted in the Settlement Deed that was the subject matter of OS 434/2020 (see [3] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 The Settlement Deed settled Wellness’ claims against: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Sunbreeze for $8,866,057.70, being Sunbreeze’s share of the excess dividends (the “Sunbreeze Excess Distribution”); and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Manoj for $522,056.89, being Manoj’s purported share of the taxed costs and disbursements relating to S 187/2014 that had been paid by Wellness (the “Manoj Suit 187 Costs)".</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 In summary, the Settlement Deed provided as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Sunbreeze, Manoj and Kanchan agreed to be jointly and severally liable to pay the Settlement Sum, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the<span class="font-italic"> </span>Sunbreeze Excess Distribution and the Manoj Suit 187 Costs less the Final Adjudicated Amount. The Final Adjudicated Amount was such amount that may be admitted by the Liquidators or the Court (in the event that Sunbreeze and/or Manoj appealed against the Liquidators’ decision) in respect of a sum of $4,595,000 claimed by Sunbreeze in its proof of debt.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Payment of the Settlement Sum was to be made in instalments:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) The first instalment of $1m was to be paid within three business days from the date of the court’s approval of the Settlement Deed (the “Initial Payment Date”).</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) A second instalment of $1m was to be paid within six months from the Initial Payment Date.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) The balance amount was to be paid by the later of five business days from the date the Final Adjudicated Amount was determined, or 12 months from the Initial Payment Date.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Sunbreeze, Manoj and Kanchan were to deposit the first instalment with Rev Law LLC upon execution of the Settlement Deed, and to furnish a bankers’ guarantee for the second instalment by the Initial Payment Date.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) If Sunbreeze, Manoj and/or Kanchan defaulted in making any payment or breached any of the terms of the Settlement Deed, the entire Settlement Sum would become immediately due and payable, with interest at 5.33% per annum from the due date up to the date of actual payment.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Kanchan, Manoj and Sunbreeze irrevocably agreed not to contest, and to consent to judgment in any legal proceedings that may be brought by Wellness and/or the Liquidators against Manoj and/or Sunbreeze in the first instance or against Kanchan in the second instance, to recover any sum due under the Settlement Deed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 The Liquidators then filed OS 434/2020 seeking the Court’s approval for them to compromise the claims against Sunbreeze and Manoj on the terms of the Settlement Deed.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">OS 434/2020: Application to approve the Settlement Deed</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 The Liquidators’ application was made pursuant to s 272(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the CA, which reads as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Powers of liquidator </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">272.</span>—(1) The liquidator may with the authority either of the Court or of the committee of inspection –-  </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) compromise any calls and liabilities to calls, debts and liabilities capable of resulting in debts and any claims present or future, certain or contingent, ascertained or sounding only in damages subsisting, or supposed to subsist, between the company and a contributory or other debtor or person apprehending liability to the company, and all questions in any way relating to or affecting the assets or the winding up of the company, on such terms as are agreed, and take any security for the discharge of any such call, debt, liability or claim and give a complete discharge in respect thereof; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2)  The liquidator may ––</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) compromise any debt due to the company, other than calls and liabilities to calls and other than a debt where the amount claimed by the company to be due to it exceeds $1,500;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">As there was no committee of inspection, the Liquidators sought the Court’s approval. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 I was informed that the only reported decision in Singapore on s 272(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) is the High Court decision in <span class="font-italic">Re Barring Futures (Singapore) Pt</span><span class="font-italic">e Ltd (in compulsory liquidation) </span>[2002] SGHC 15.

The liquidator was not in funds to pursue the court action. The Court sanctioned the compromise. Lightman J set out the approach to be adopted as follows (at 92):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Where a liquidator seeks the sanction of the court and takes the view that a compromise is in the best interest of the creditors, in any ordinary case, where…there is no suggestion of a lack of good faith by the liquidator or that he is partisan the court will attach considerable weight to the liquidator’s views unless the evidence reveals substantial reasons why it should not do so, or that for some reason or other his view is flawed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 <span class="font-italic">Re Edennote</span> was cited with approval by the English Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Re Greenhaven Motors Ltd (in liquidation) </span>[1999] BCLC 635 (“<span class="font-italic">Re Greenhaven</span>”). Chadwick LJ set out the following additional guidance on the approach to be taken by the Court (at 642):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In deciding whether or not to sanction a proposed compromise the court must consider whether the interests of those, whether creditors or contributories, who have a real interest in the assets of a company in liquidation are likely to be best served (i) by permitting the company to enter into that compromise with all the terms that it contains; or (ii) by not permitting the company to enter into that compromise. It is not for the court to speculate whether the terms of the proposed compromise were the best that could have been obtained; or whether the proposed compromise would have been better if it did not contain all the terms that it does contain. Unless it is satisfied that, if the company is not permitted to enter into the compromise on the terms which the liquidator has negotiated, there will then be better terms or some of compromise offer, the decision is between the proposed compromise and no compromise at all.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In reaching that decision, the court may have to weigh the different interests of creditors and contributories and, perhaps, the different interests of preferential and non-preferential creditors. It will not give weight to the wishes of those who will be unaffected whichever way the decision goes, for example, the interests of contributories who have no realistic prospect of receiving a distribution in any foreseeable circumstances, or the wishes of preferential or secure creditors who will be paid in full in any event. Subject to that, the court will give weight to the wishes of creditors and contributories whose interests it has to consider, for the reason that creditors and contributories, if uninfluenced by extraneous consideration, are likely to be good judges of where their own best interests lie. For the same reason the court will give weight to the views of the liquidator, who may, and normally will, be in the best position to take an informed and objective view. But, as I have said, at the end of the day it is for the court to decide whether or not to sanction the compromise.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 In <span class="font-italic">Re Greenhaven</span>, the Court of Appeal refused to sanction the compromise. The Court found that (a) the settlement agreement conferred no discernible benefit on any creditor or contributory of the company; (b) the fact that some benefit might be conferred on the Liquidator personally, was no reason for the Court to sanction the compromise; (c) there was some risk, perhaps remote, that the agreement might cause loss to the company by reason of the very wide terms of the release contained in it; and (d) by contrast there was no detriment to the company if it was not permitted to enter into the agreement.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The position in Australia</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Section 477(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) read with ss 477(2A) and 477(2B) of Australian Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (“ACA”) provide as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Powers of liquidator </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">477.</span>—(1) Subject to this section, a liquidator of a company may  </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">…</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) compromise any calls and liabilities to calls, debts and liabilities capable of resulting in debts and any claims (present or future, certain or contingent, ascertained or sounding only in damages) subsisting, or supposed to subsist, between the company and a contributory or other debtor or person apprehending liability to the company, and all questions in any way relating to or affecting the assets or the winding up of the company, on such terms as are agreed, and take any security for the discharge of, and give a complete discharge in respect of, any such call, debt, liability or claim. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2A) Except with the approval of the Court, of the committee of inspection or of a resolution of the creditors, a liquidator of a company must not compromise a debt of the company if the amount claimed by the company is more than:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) if an amount greater than $20,000 is prescribed-the prescribed amount;

The same restraint must apply when the question is whether the liquidator should be authorised to enter into a particular transaction the benefits and burdens of which require assessment on a commercial basis. Of course, the compromise of claims will involve assessment on a legal basis, and a liquidator will be expected (as was made plain in <span class="font-italic">Re Chase Corporation (Australia) Equities Ltd) </span>to obtain advice and, as a prudent person would in the conduct of his own affairs, advice from practitioners appropriate to the nature and value of the claims. But in all but the simplest case, and demonstrably in the present case, commercial considerations play a significant part in whether a compromise will be for the benefit of the creditors”. </div><div class="txt-body text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) the Court will not approve an agreement if its terms are unclear: <span class="font-italic">Re United Medical Protection (No 4) </span>[2002] NSWSC 741.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3) the role of the Court is to grant or deny approval to the liquidator’s proposal.

In my view, in deciding whether to approve an application by a liquidator under s 272(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the CA, the Court has to satisfy itself that the terms of the compromise are in the interests of the company. In making this determination, the Court:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) neither “rubber stamps” the liquidator’s decision to enter into the compromise nor reviews the liquidator’s decision as though it were hearing an appeal; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) does not speculate on whether better terms could have been obtained;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) should not approve a compromise if its terms are unclear;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) should accord weight to the liquidator’s view unless there are substantial grounds to suspect bad faith or that the liquidator’s view is clearly flawed; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) should consider the interests of those who have a real interest in the assets of the company and accord weight to their views unless there are substantial grounds to suspect bad faith or that the views are clearly flawed; if necessary, the court may direct that a meeting be called for this purpose;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) should disregard the interests of those who will be unaffected whichever way the decision goes, for example, the interests of contributories who have no realistic prospect of receiving a distribution in any foreseeable circumstances, or the wishes of preferential or secure creditors who will be paid in full in any event; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) should ask the question as to whether the interests of those who have a real interest in the assets of the company are likely to be served by permitting the company to enter into the compromise than by not permitting the company to do so. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the Settlement Deed should be approved</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Under the Settlement Deed, Sunbreeze, Manoj and Kanchan jointly and severally agreed to pay the Sunbreeze Excess Distribution and the Manoj Suit 187 Costs in full, less the Final Adjudicated Amount. In return, Wellness agreed to an instalment payment schedule (see [15(b)] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The Liquidators submitted that the Settlement Deed was in the interests of Wellness for the following reasons:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) There will be clear savings in terms of time and costs. Even if the Liquidators obtained an order under OS 1416/2019 granting them liberty to take the necessary steps to recover the Sunbreeze Excess Distribution, separate legal proceedings would still have to be commenced to pursue the recovery.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The first instalment payment of $1m would be deposited with Rev Law LLC upon execution of the Settlement Deed and the second instalment payment of $1m would be secured by a bankers’ guarantee. In the event of default, the entire amount payable under the Settlement Deed would become immediately due and payable with interest. Sunbreeze, Manoj and Kanchan have undertaken not to contest and to agree to judgment in any subsequent enforcement proceedings. They will also indemnify Wellness and the Liquidators for costs incurred in any such enforcement proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The Settlement Deed avoided expensive and protracted litigation and reduced risks of recovery occasioned by protracted litigation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 EQ Capital objected to the application and submitted that the Settlement Deed did not serve the interests of and was highly unfair to EQ Capital and the creditors of Wellness for the following reasons:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) There was no reason why Sunbreeze, Manoj and Kanchan should be given the benefit of repaying the Sunbreeze Excess Distribution and the Manoj Suit 187 Costs in instalments over such a long period. EQ Capital submitted that there could be no dispute that Sunbreeze was liable to repay the excess dividends that it had received. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) No interest was payable on the Sunbreeze Excess Distribution and the Manoj Suit 187 Costs (unless there was default).  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) There was no indemnity for the legal fees and costs incurred by Wellness in relation to OS 1416/2019, which the Liquidators were compelled to file because of (i) Sunbreeze’s repeated and wrongful refusal to repay its share of the excess dividends and (ii) the steps it took to block the Liquidators from recovering the monies, by pushing through the resolution at the EGM on 11 November 2019 (see [11] above).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) There was no justification for Sunbreeze, Manoj and Kanchan to be given the benefit of any set off against the amount claimed by Sunbreeze in its proof of debt since there could be no dispute that Sunbreeze and Manoj were liable to repay the Sunbreeze Excess Distribution and the Manoj Suit 187 Costs respectively, immediately and in full. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Taking all the circumstances into consideration, I was of the view that the Settlement Deed should be approved. The Settlement Deed was <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>in the interests of the company. Its terms were clear. There was no suggestion of bad faith and the Liquidators’ reasons could not be said to be flawed. Although Wellness’ claims for repayment of the Sunbreeze Excess Distribution and the Manoj Suit 187 Costs seemed to be strong ones, it did not necessarily mean that any action to recover the same would not be more costly and/or protracted.  With the Settlement Deed, the only matter that remained outstanding was the adjudication of Sunbreeze’s proof of debt (including the disposal of any appeal against the adjudication), which would have been necessary in any event. Further, even if the Liquidators did sue, obtain judgment and recover the moneys, it would not have been prudent for them to make use of the moneys pending the disposal of an appeal (if any). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 The Settlement Deed substantially reduced, if not removed, the risks and costs of protracted litigation. Under the Settlement Deed, Sunbreeze, Manoj and Kanchan undertook not to contest and to agree to judgment if the Liquidators had to sue on the Settlement Deed. In addition, the Liquidators would receive the first payment of $1m within three business days of the Court’s approval of the Settlement Deed and another $1m within six months of the first payment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 It seemed to me that the interests of Wellness and its contributories were better served by permitting the company to enter into the Settlement Deed. It could not be said that not entering into the Settlement Deed would be more beneficial to the company and its contributories.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 In my view, the objections raised by EQ Capital did not tilt the balance. EQ Capital’s argument based on the strength of Wellness’ claims has been dealt with above. It was not unreasonable that the Settlement Deed, being a compromise, did not provide for any interest (unless there was default) or for an indemnity for legal fees in relation to OS 1416/2019. EQ Capital’s objections merely showed that it disagreed with the Liquidators’ considered view that the Settlement Deed was in the interests of the company. The mere fact that EQ Capital came to a different conclusion was no reason to not approve the Settlement Deed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 It was understandable that EQ Capital felt that the Settlement Deed was unfair to it. After all, it had repaid its share of the excess dividends in response to the Liquidators’ demand whereas Sunbreeze had refused to do so and now was being given time to pay. However, in my view, this too was inadequate reason to not approve the Settlement Deed. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">SUM 1841/2020: Application to discontinue OS 1416/2019</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 As stated at [4] above, it was not disputed by the parties that SUM 1841/2020 was contingent on the Court’s approval of the Settlement Deed. As I granted the Liquidators’ application to approve the Settlement Deed, I thus also granted the Liquidators’ application in SUM 1841/2020 to discontinue OS 1416/2019. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 For the reasons stated above, I allowed both applications by the Liquidators. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 I made no order for costs in respect of OS 434/2020. As OS 1416/2019 was withdrawn following my approval for the Liquidators to compromise the claims against Sunbreeze and Manoj on the terms of the Settlement Deed in OS 434/2020, I similarly made no order as to costs for the discontinuance of OS 1416/2019 in SUM 1841/2020.  </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Chua Lee Ming  <br/>Judge  </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-right"><br/>Balakrishnan Ashok Kumar, Tay Kang-Rui Darius and                                            Lim Yin Li (BlackOak LLC) for the applicants; <br/>Jaikanth Shankar, Tan Ruo Yu, Yee Guang Yi and                                               Terence De Silva (Davinder Singh Chambers LLC) for the first non-party;  Lin Chunlong and Dana Chang (WongPartnership LLP) for the second non-party;                                                                                                                 Jasmine Yong (Tan Rajah &amp; Cheah) for the third non-party (watching brief).</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-right"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
