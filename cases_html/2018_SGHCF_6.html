Accordingly, in August 2015, the court ordered that the Fourth Son would be deemed to have renounced his rights and title to the probate and execution of the will unless he filed an application for grant of probate or if he contested the Grandson’s grant of probate within seven days.

</div> but this appears to be an arithmetic error. Half of $6,000 is $3,000, and adding that to $19,000 yields a total sum of $22,000. $22,000 and not $22,500 is 60.3% of $36,500. Thus, $22,000 appears to be the figure which the Grandmother intended to state in her pleadings as the total sum of her contribution. Separately, the sum of $19,000 is simply stated to come from the “savings and contributions from the family”.

Nevertheless, in light of the paucity of evidence and threadbare pleadings, I find that the Grandfather’s estate does not hold any beneficial interest in the Property on trust for the Grandmother. Neither does the Grandmother have a right to occupy the property. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issue 1: Laches</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 The doctrine of laches operates to bar any equitable claim by a plaintiff if the defendant can show that it would be unjust to give the plaintiff a remedy. The justice of the case is considered with regard to three factors in particular: (a) the length of delay before the claim was brought; (b) the nature of the prejudice said to be suffered by the defendant; and (c) any element of unconscionability in allowing the claim to be enforced: <span class="font-italic">Chng</span><span class="font-italic"> Weng Wah v Goh Bak Heng </span>[2016] 2 SLR 464 at [44]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 In my view, there was no unreasonable delay in the Grandmother’s bringing of this claim. She found out about the Grandfather’s intention in his will only after his death. That was in 2014. The Suit was brought in 2017. During the intervening period, the Grandmother was involved in another litigation with two of her sons concerning the ownership of a commercial property (see [13] above). In the circumstances, three years is not unreasonable delay in taking action to ascertain or enforce one’s interest in one’s matrimonial home. The Grandson observes that his efforts to sell the Property have been delayed by the commencement of the Suit, and that he has had to incur costs in defending the “frivolous claims” in the Suit.

</div> This does not, in my opinion, amount to prejudice of the kind contemplated by the doctrine of laches, because any litigation will involve time and money.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issue 2: Resulting trust</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The principles on when a resulting trust arises are not contested by the parties and may be summarised as follows. If a plaintiff can show that he made a financial contribution to the purchase price of a property, a defendant holding title to the property will be presumed to hold, on trust for the plaintiff, a beneficial interest in the property in the proportion of the plaintiff’s contribution to the purchase price. The defendant may attempt to rebut the presumption of a resulting trust by raising a presumption of advancement. To raise a presumption of advancement, the defendant must show, on the nature of his relationship with the plaintiff and on the state of that relationship, that the plaintiff may be presumed to have intended to make a gift to the defendant. Conversely, the plaintiff may attempt to prove the presumption of resulting trust by showing that he had no intention to gift his financial contribution to the defendant. These principles are stated in <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen </span><span class="font-italic">Lan v See Fong Mun </span>[2014] 3 SLR 1048 (“<span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen </span><span class="font-italic">Lan</span>”) at [160]; <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim v Yeo Guan </span><span class="font-italic">Chye Terence and another</span> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 108<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [56]–[57] and [77]–[78].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The Grandson denies that the Grandmother made a financial contribution to the purchase price of the Property. Having taken this position, he does not seek to raise a presumption of advancement in favour of the Grandfather’s estate because, on his case, there was nothing for the Grandmother to advance. Accordingly, the issues of fact which arise for determination are (a) the purchase price of the Property; and (b) whether the Grandmother made a financial contribution to the purchase price and, if so, what the size of that contribution is.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-justify font-italic"><span class="font-italic">(1) What was the purchase price of the Property?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 It is not disputed that the Grandfather and the Grandmother bought the Property from one Ms Chng Mei Lien, who had in turn bought it from the developer of the Property. The only available evidence on the purchase price comprises two letters relating to the Grandfather’s transaction with Ms Chng. The first is a letter dated 7 April 1967 and addressed to Ms Chng by her solicitors. In that letter, her solicitors write to confirm that she has agreed to sell to the Grandfather the benefit of her agreement with the developer to buy the Property. The letter says:

The letter of 7 April 1967 shows that Ms Chng had an agreement with the developer to buy the property for $33,900, and that as at that date, she had paid $17,900 to the developer, leaving $16,000 due. That letter also shows that at about that time, she decided to assign the benefit of the agreement to the Grandfather for the price of $20,500. The effect of the assignment was that the Grandfather would acquire the Property from the developer if he paid the developer the remaining $16,000. That is why the letter of 21 April 1967 indicated that, the assignment having been made, the developer was in a position to convey the Property to the Grandfather for $33,900. Accordingly, the Grandfather acquired the property for a total sum of $36,500, out of which $20,500 was payable to Ms Chng and $16,000 to the developer.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-justify font-italic"><span class="font-italic">(2) Did the Grandmother make a financial contribution to the purchase price and, if so, what is its size?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 I turn now to the main issue arising from the Grandmother’s case: whether and to what extent she contributed to the purchase price of the Property.

</div> due to an error she says she had made which I will explain at [36] below. Regardless, my finding, stated briefly here, is that she has failed to prove on a balance of probabilities that she contributed either 58.9% or 60.3% of the purchase price. Although I do not find her lacking in credibility, I do find that her evidence is confused and uncertain. In the total absence of documentary evidence, the result is that I have no basis upon which to find that she contributed a specific sum to the purchase price.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 I begin with a general observation on the state of the evidence. This is that the Grandmother herself accepts that her case on her contribution to the purchase price is bereft of documentary evidence, and that all that the court has to go on is her word. It is useful at this juncture to outline the Grandmother’s specific case on her contribution to the purchase price. She claims that she did so:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) first, by way of cash in the sum of half the compensation sum received from the Government when it acquired the land under the zinc roof house, although it is not clear whether the compensation sum was $5,000 or $6,000; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) second, by way of cash in the sum of $19,000, which came from:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) her savings from earning $92.60 or $96 a month as an amah at Alexandra Hospital from the time she gave birth to her first child in 1951 to the time she gave birth to her third child in 1955;

I can’t remember how much I borrowed from my elder sister, but there was insufficient fund, so I think she also used her jewellery and the jewelleries were pawned to make up the amount. It has been a long time ago, I can’t remember all the details. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 To be clear, I think it is quite explicable, considering the Grandmother’s age, for her to take inconsistent positions and to be unable to remember how she was able to contribute to the purchase price of the Property. I am willing to attribute these weaknesses in her evidence to the fact that the Property was purchased five decades ago, and that her memory has faded since, and that any documentation from that time is very likely now to be unavailable or at least limited. In this regard, I echo the observations of V K Rajah JA in <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen </span><span class="font-italic">Lan</span> ([26] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [63]–[64]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Fourth, and as adverted to by the Judge … the oral testimony of Mdm Chan was not very helpful to the court as she had lost most, if not all, of her memory of the relevant events which transpired. Her common refrain in cross-examination was that she had forgotten or did not know what had happened at the material time. This is <span class="font-italic">not</span>, of course, meant to be a criticism of her in any way.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Mdm Chan’s memory deficit underscores the fifth point that we wish to make here, which is that the events surrounding the Purchase took place some three decades earlier. That was a very long time ago. It was therefore understandable that the documentary evidence in this case was not complete. That said, we note that some potentially vital evidence was not adduced (whether due to the effluxion of time or to other reasons).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Nevertheless, as the plaintiff, she bears the burden of proof. Although the difficulties in her evidence are benign in this sense, they pose a serious obstacle to the court’s accepting her case. That is because all the court has now is (a) a complete absence of documentary evidence on the fact and extent of her contribution; and (b) evidence on the same given by her which is internally inconsistent and lacking in detail in material respects. In <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen </span><span class="font-italic">Lan</span>, there was at least a handwritten note contemporaneous with the purchase of the property in 1983 which listed the sources of the money which went towards the purchase price, and that list stated that the party who was asserting a resulting trust had contributed a specific figure of $290,000; the defendant did not dispute that the plaintiff had this amount of money and sought only to argue that she had advanced it as a loan: see <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen </span><span class="font-italic">Lan</span> at [18], [25] and [76]. In contrast, there is no documentary evidence in the present case to show that the Grandmother had contributed $22,000 (assuming the compensation sum was $6,000) or $21,500 (assuming the compensation sum was $5,000) to the purchase price of the Property.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 This absence of documentary evidence is also the reason I reject the contention put forward by counsel for the Grandmother, Mr Tan Siah Yong, that she would have, by 1967, saved an amount of $11,000 to $12,000. This is pure conjecture. Mr Tan’s calculation consists simply in (a) a summation of her wholly undocumented earnings from working as an amah, selling rice wine, and letting out rooms at the zinc house (see [32(b)] above); and (b) an application of a discount of 50% to that total sum on the assumption – which is unpleaded and not stated in her AEIC – that she would save 50% of her total earnings.

</div>
</div> There is simply no objective basis for any aspect of this calculation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 In my judgment, therefore, the Grandmother has failed to satisfy me on the balance of probabilities that she contributed 60.3% or 58.9% of the purchase price of the Property. The result is that there is no purchase price resulting trust.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issue 3: Common intention constructive trust</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 I turn now to the Grandmother’s alternative case. To establish a common intention constructive trust in the context of two parties who have contributed unequal amounts towards the purchase price of a property, it must be shown that the parties had a common intention, which may subsist at or subsequent to the time the property was acquired, that the property would be held (a) on trust for both parties and (b) in a certain proportion. Such an intention may be expressed or inferred, but it may not be imputed. Evidence of such intention must be sufficient and compelling. These principles are stated in <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen </span><span class="font-italic">Lan</span> ([26] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [160(b)] and [160(f)], and restated in <span class="font-italic">Su Emmanuel v Emmanuel </span><span class="font-italic">Priya Ethel Anne and another</span> [2016] 3 SLR 1222 (“<span class="font-italic">Su Emmanuel</span>”) at [83]. On what is “compelling evidence”, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen </span><span class="font-italic">Lan </span>at [114] referred to Lord Neuberger’s explanation of the term in <span class="font-italic">Stack v Dowden </span>[2007] 2 AC 432 (“<span class="font-italic">Stack</span>”) at [138]–[139]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… in [Lord Neuberger’s] view, such an alteration of the quantification of each party’s share of the beneficial interest required “compelling evidence”, which would normally involve “discussions, statements or actions, subsequent to the acquisition, from which an agreement or common understanding as to such change [could] properly be inferred” (see <span class="font-italic">Stack</span> at [138]), although he appeared to accept that it was possible to infer a common intention to alter a party’s share of the beneficial interest if that party carried out “significant improvements to the home” (see <span class="font-italic">Stack</span> at [139]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The burden is therefore on the Grandmother to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that she and the Grandfather had a common intention, either subsisting at the time of the purchase of the Property in 1967 or arising after that, that the Grandfather hold a certain proportion of the beneficial interest in the Property on trust for her. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In my judgment, the Grandmother’s case on common intention constructive trust must fail, for two reasons. First, her case was not pleaded with sufficient particularity. In my view, it is at least arguable that this was prejudicial to the Grandson as a defendant, and the consequence of this is that she cannot be permitted to rely on a common intention constructive trust. Secondly and more fundamentally, even if that aspect of her case were held to be sufficiently pleaded, the evidence is insufficient to establish, and is in fact contrary to, the existence of a common intention between her and the Grandfather, subsisting at any time, that the Grandfather would hold some part of the beneficial interest of the Property on trust for her. I now elaborate.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-justify font-italic"><span class="font-italic">(1) Is the Grandmother’s case on common intention constructive trust pleaded with sufficient particularity?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 It is well-established that for a pleading not to be embarrassing, it should state those facts which will put those against whom it is directed on their guard, and tell them what is the case which they will have to meet: <span class="font-italic">Philipps</span><span class="font-italic"> v Philipps</span> (1878) 4 QBD 127, cited in Foo Chee Hock (gen ed), <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure</span> <span class="font-italic">2018</span> <span class="font-italic">Vol</span><span class="font-italic">ume 1</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2018) at para 18/7/12. This requirement is implicit in the requirement in O 18 r 7(1) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R5, 2014 Ed) that every pleading must contain in a summary form the “material facts” on which the party pleading relies for his claim. “Material” means necessary for the purpose of formulating a complete cause of action, and if any one material statement is omitted, the statement of claim is bad: <span class="font-italic">Bruce v </span><span class="font-italic">Odhams Press Ltd </span>[1936] 1 KB 697 at 712 <span class="font-italic">per</span> Scott LJ, approved by the Singapore High Court in <span class="font-italic">Multi-Pak Singapore Pte Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> (in receivership) v Intraco Ltd and others</span> [1992] 2 SLR(R) 382 at [29].

Third, the use of the phrase “by reason of the matters set out” is vague and unhelpful because the matters set out before that paragraph in her pleading comprises the entirety of her narration of the background of their family, the loss of the zinc roof house, the Grandmother’s alleged contribution to the purchase price of the Property, and the setting up of the Grandfather’s watch business. It is unclear which of these facts are regarded by the Grandmother as relevant to her claim on common intention constructive trust.

But even if this interpretation were taken, the point remains that nothing is pleaded about any discussion, statement or action that forms the basis for inferring the existence of such an intention.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Furthermore, this construction of her pleading does not represent the case which she is now advancing on common intention constructive trust. She now submits that she and the Grandfather “had a common intention that the [Grandmother] would be a beneficial co-owner of equal share (50% interest) in the Property”.

</div> It appears therefore that she did not apply her mind at that time to who truly owned the Property and, if that is so, it is very unlikely that she and the Grandfather then had any common intention on how the beneficial interest of the Property would be held.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Second, she has adduced no evidence to show that she and the Grandfather had any discussions on the ownership of the Property after 1967.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Third, her own evidence on events occurring after 1967 shows that the Grandfather was fully aware of the implications of placing a property in a person’s name. He was intentional about whom he wished to benefit through the properties he owned, and he would, according to the Grandmother, agree with her on how those wishes would be carried out by conveying the property into the names of specific children. Against this background, it is difficult to say that the Grandfather’s sole legal title to the Property did not truly reflect his intention with regard to who was entitled to the Property’s beneficial interest. And it is also difficult to reconcile the Grandmother’s claim to the Property with the complete absence of any evidence or assertion on her part that they had discussed or agreed that some proportion of the beneficial interest of the Property belonged to her. The following are the relevant parts of the Grandmother’s evidence which bear out these points. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In an affidavit filed in the suit commenced by the Eldest Son in 2015 against the Grandmother concerning the ownership of a commercial property (see [13] above), the Grandmother explained the practice that she and the Grandfather adopted in allocating the benefit of their commercial properties:

</div> is evidence that the Grandfather did not think that he held any portion of the beneficial interest in the Property on trust for the Grandmother. It was drafted on the assumption that the Grandfather was the sole legal and beneficial owner of the Property, and it expresses his intention that his youngest son and his eldest grandson share in the proceeds of the sale of the Property. No suggestion has been made that the will is not to be taken at face value.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Having considered the evidence, I find that the Grandmother had the assumption, before the will was discovered, that the Property would belong to the Fourth Son, with whom she was living and today still lives. Nothing in her own evidence suggests that she expected that she had a share in the Property. As the Fourth Son lived with her, she would then have had an expectation, arising from that assumption, that she would continue to live in the Property after the Grandfather died. That is quite different from sharing a common intention, with the Grandfather, that she would be entitled to 50% or 60.3% of the beneficial interest in the Property. She has failed to prove that there was ever such an intention and, for this reason, her claim on common intention constructive trust must fail.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issue 4: Proprietary estoppel</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Next, the Grandmother in her closing submissions for the first time in these proceedings advances a case based on proprietary estoppel.

</div> I have no hesitation in rejecting it on the ground that it is not pleaded. In <span class="font-italic">V </span><span class="font-italic">Nithia (co-administratrix of the estate of Ponnusamy Sivapakiam, deceased) v Buthmanaban s/o Vaithilingam and another</span> [2015] 5 SLR 1422, the Court of Appeal held that the trial judge had erred in allowing the plaintiff’s claim on the ground of proprietary estoppel when that cause of action had not been pleaded and the plaintiff’s case had been one based principally on a purchase price resulting trust. In this regard, the Court of Appeal noted that the words “proprietary estoppel” did not have to be specifically pleaded, but the material facts supporting each element of the cause of action had to be. The Court said at [43]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The Judge was of the view that the words “proprietary estoppel” did not have to be <span class="font-italic">specifically</span> pleaded. We agree, except that if such a cause of action is to be relied on, the pleadings should at the very least disclose the material facts which would support such a claim, so as to give the opponent fair notice of the <span class="font-italic">substance</span> of such a case, especially in a claim based on proprietary estoppel. … [emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 After examining the relevant part of the respondent’s pleadings, the Court said at [46]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In our view, the aforesaid paragraphs do not support a claim based on proprietary estoppel but one based on a resulting trust. The 1st Respondent did not plead that the Deceased encouraged him to obtain an advance from Govindasamy or to repay Govindasamy on the understanding that he would have a beneficial interest in the Property. <span class="font-italic">There was no promise, reliance or detriment alleged in these paragraphs</span>. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 In my judgment, the Court’s observation in that last sentence which I have italicised applies squarely to this case. The elements of proprietary estoppel are (a) a representation on the part of the party against whom the estoppel is sought to be raised; (b) reliance on the representation on the part of the party seeking to raise the estoppel; and (c) detriment suffered by that party as a result of his reliance: <span class="font-italic">Hong Leong Singapore Finance Ltd v United Overseas Bank Ltd </span>[2007] 1 SLR(R) 292 at [170] <span class="font-italic">per</span> Sundaresh Menon JC (as the Chief Justice then was). In my view, nowhere in the Grandmother’s pleadings is it stated that the Grandfather had made a representation to her and, if so, what the substance of the representation was. Neither is it stated that the Grandmother relied on any such representation by taking or forbearing to take any action, much less suffering any detriment, in consequence of her believing the truth of the representation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The Grandmother now submits that the Grandfather and the Grandmother had “discussions” on whether the Property should be acquired and how it might be mortgaged to finance the family’s business, and that these discussions in some way constituted the Grandfather’s “representations” to the Grandmother that he intended her to have beneficial interests in the Property.

</div> I reject these submissions. None of these facts were pleaded and, in so far as they were, they were not framed as occurring as a result of the Grandmother’s reliance on any representation that she had perceived the Grandfather to have made. Correspondingly, the Grandson cannot be said to have been given a fair opportunity to cross-examine her on her evidence relating to what she now alleges to be the representation, reliance and detriment that establishes a proprietary estoppel. Accordingly, to allow the Grandmother now to rely on proprietary estoppel would be prejudicial to the Grandson, and I therefore do not permit her to do so. For this reason, her claim on proprietary estoppel must fail.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issue 5: Grandmother’s right of abode</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 The final aspect of the Grandmother’s case in the Suit is that even if she does not have a beneficial interest in the Property and even if there is no proprietary estoppel, she still has a right to occupy the Property.

</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 It seems to me that Mr Tan is referring either to what is known in England as the “deserted wife’s equity”, which was indeed addressed by the House of Lords in <span class="font-italic">Ainsworth</span>, or to a licence coupled with an equity, which English decisions like <span class="font-italic">Binions</span><span class="font-italic"> and another v Evans </span>[1972] Ch 359 (“<span class="font-italic">Binions</span>”) (on which the Grandmother relies) have recognised as giving rise to a right of occupation that is enforceable against third parties. I shall therefore consider whether, on the ground of either of these two lines of authority, the Grandmother does in fact have a right to occupy the Property which is enforceable against the Grandson.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">(1) Deserted wife’s equity</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 The question whether a widow has a right to occupy property which used to be the matrimonial home does not appear to be a question that the Singapore courts have addressed before. Professor Leong Wai Kum (see <span class="font-italic">Elements of Family Law in Singapore </span>(LexisNexis, 2nd Ed, 2013) at p 496) is of the view, and parties appear to accept, that <span class="font-italic">Ainsworth</span> represents the position at common law in Singapore. In <span class="font-italic">Ainsworth</span>, the House of Lords held<span class="font-italic"> </span>that a spouse’s right to occupy the matrimonial home was a “mere equity” and not an equitable interest, and that it was determinable at the discretion of the court. It was held to be an equity which arises under family law and enforceable only against the other spouse, not against third parties. It therefore has no proprietary effect.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 It is important to note that in <span class="font-italic">Ainsworth</span> at 1224C, Lord Hodson observed that the deserted wife’s equity “would not survive divorce”. That is no doubt because the equity is a family law right, and family law ceases to apply, so to speak, once the marriage is no longer subsisting, which would be the case when the parties have divorced. The same situation arises when the other spouse dies. The marriage will by that spouse’s death have terminated, and there will no longer remain any juridical basis for the common law to recognise the claimant spouse’s right to occupy what used to be the matrimonial home. Once the spousal status disappears by virtue of the marriage’s dissolution in a given case, there is no longer any reason for common law to regard the claimant as a deserted “wife”. Correspondingly, she therefore cannot be held to possess a deserted wife’s equity. Accordingly, in the present case, the Grandmother can rely on no such equity now because the Grandfather has passed away. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Notwithstanding the position at common law, I note that in England, the Family Law Act 1996 (c 27) (UK) and its predecessors confer on a spouse or civil partner what has been called “a judicially protected right of occupation”: <span class="font-italic">Richards v Richards</span> [1984] AC 174 at 211A–B <span class="font-italic">per</span> Lord Scarman; see generally Charles Harpum, Stuart Bridge &amp; Martin Dixon,<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Megarry &amp; Wade: The Law of Real Property</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 8th Ed, 2012) (“<span class="font-italic">Megarry</span><span class="font-italic"> &amp; Wade</span>”) at paras 34-023–34-024. The 1996 Act gives a spouse the right (a) not to be evicted from occupation; and (b) to enter and occupy with leave of the court. These rights are referred to as statutory matrimonial home rights and may be made enforceable against third parties by register entry. They may be brought to an end by the death of the other spouse, among other things. The court has the power to extend such a right even after the death of the spouse, although the application for such extension must be made during the marriage: see ss 33(5) and 33(9) of the 1996 Act. In exercising that power, the court must have regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the housing needs and resources of the spouse and any relevant child: see ss 33(6) and 33(8) of the 1996 Act. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 It is significant that the protections afforded by the 1996 Act are partly a legacy of the concern in the wake of <span class="font-italic">Ainsworth </span>that the strict rules of property law had left without remedy deserted wives to whom injustice had been occasioned: see <span class="font-italic">Megarry</span><span class="font-italic"> &amp; Wade</span> at para 34-022. This type of concern – over potential injustice arising from applying the strict rules of property law to familial situations – was also what motivated the majority in <span class="font-italic">Stack </span>([45] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) to hold that the starting point for jointly owned matrimonial homes was that each party has an equal share of the beneficial interest under a common intention constructive trust: see <span class="font-italic">Stack</span> at [4]–[5] <span class="font-italic">per</span> Lord Hope of Craighead and [56] <span class="font-italic">per</span> Baroness Hale of Richmond. The Singapore Court of Appeal has expressed disapproval of this approach in <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen </span><span class="font-italic">Lan</span> ([26] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>). Agreeing with Lord Neuberger’s minority opinion in <span class="font-italic">Stack</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the Court considered that the resulting trust should be the default analytical tool in the absence of proof of common intention between the parties as to how the beneficial interest in the property concerned is to be held (at [153] and [158]). The Court acknowledged that this would “lead to outcomes which some people may perceive as ‘unfair’ in certain cases”, but was “of the view that subjective fairness may not be the most appropriate yardstick to apply in resolving property disputes” (at [159]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Against this backdrop, it may be said that a legislative response similar to the 1996 Act may be apt in Singapore, all the more because our jurisprudence has expressly taken a different path from <span class="font-italic">Stack</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(although <span class="font-italic">Stack</span> would have been of no assistance to the Grandmother either in the case at hand because she was not a joint legal owner of the Property). It could be said to be somewhat inequitable, or even perverse, that a marriage of 65 years, out of which 50 were spent in the matrimonial home, could have resulted in a more equitable outcome if dissolved by divorce rather than death.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">(2) Licence coupled with an equity</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 I turn now to consider whether the Grandmother’s asserted right to occupy the Property may be supported by reference to the concept of a licence coupled with an equity. The orthodox position at common law was that a contractual licence did not bind the licensor’s successors in title because a licence was a personal transaction which created no proprietary interest in land. In England, there gradually emerged a view, advanced by Lord Denning, that a constructive trust would be imposed whenever a purchaser takes property subject to a contractual licence: see <span class="font-italic">Binions</span> at 368B <span class="font-italic">per </span>Lord Denning MR and <span class="font-italic">DHN Food Distributors Ltd </span><span class="font-italic">and others v London Borough of Tower Hamlets </span>[1976] 3 All ER 462 at 467<span class="font-italic">a</span><span class="font-italic"> per</span> Lord Denning MR. The English Court of Appeal then restored the law to its orthodox position in <span class="font-italic">Ashburn </span><span class="font-italic">Anstalt v Arnold and another </span>[1989] Ch 1 (“<span class="font-italic">Ashburn </span><span class="font-italic">Anstalt</span>”), where it was held that a contractual licence did not create an interest in land (at 25E–G <span class="font-italic">per</span> Fox LJ). The court also held that although a constructive trust might be imposed on a transferee of land in respect of an interest affecting that land which would not otherwise bind him (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, a licence), it would do so only where the transferee’s conscience was affected: <span class="font-italic">Ashburn </span><span class="font-italic">Anstalt</span> at 25H <span class="font-italic">per</span> Fox LJ.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Although there is no Singapore decision which discusses and rationalises this line of cases with reference to the specific issue of whether a contractual licence is capable of binding third parties, the Court of Appeal has by way of <span class="font-italic">obiter dicta</span> in <span class="font-italic">Guy Neale and others v Ku De Ta SG Pte Ltd </span>[2015] 4 SLR 283 (“<span class="font-italic">Guy Neale</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>endorsed the position set out in <span class="font-italic">Ashburn </span><span class="font-italic">Anstalt</span>. Sundaresh Menon CJ, delivering the court’s judgment, wrote the following in the context of cautioning against importing into trade mark law principles derived from land law (at [80]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A licence in respect of land, which is personal in nature, will generally not bind a purchaser of land <span class="font-italic">even if that purchaser had notice of the licence</span>, though admittedly, this has limits: thus, a court of equity will not permit such a purchaser to deny the licensee his rights if his conscience had been so affected that it would be inequitable to allow him to do so and a constructive trust will be imposed to uphold the rights of the licensee (<span class="font-italic">Ashburn </span><span class="font-italic">Anstalt v Arnold</span> [1989] Ch 1 (“<span class="font-italic">Ashburn</span>”) at 25–27). [emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Bearing in mind these principles, I note that Mr Tan purports to rely on the principle in <span class="font-italic">Binions</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>and other similar cases to establish that the Grandmother has a licence coupled with an equity which gives her the right to occupy the Property.

</div>
</div> Two observations are due in this regard. First, no analysis is provided in Mr Tan’s submissions on the specific requirements of the principle in <span class="font-italic">Binions</span> and on how the Grandmother’s case satisfies those requirements. Second, there is no discussion on whether <span class="font-italic">Binions</span> represents the position in Singapore even though in England it has been confined by <span class="font-italic">Ashburn </span><span class="font-italic">Anstalt</span>, which has in turn received <span class="font-italic">obiter </span>approval from the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Guy Neale</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 Moreover, to the extent that Mr Tan is suggesting that the Grandson’s conscience has been affected and that he is therefore bound by the Grandmother’s licence to remain in the Property, the facts relied upon supporting such a suggestion are the same as the facts which go towards her claim on proprietary estoppel.

That will in turn give him the right to seek an order for the sale of the property, and orders that procure the cooperation of the people currently occupying the Property to facilitate its sale. Such authority is said to inhere in his capacity as sole executor of the Grandfather’s estate. Accordingly, the Grandson seeks specifically to be characterised as such by an order of court. In addition, he seeks to be declared not to have stepped into the shoes of a trustee under the will. That is because if he were acting as a trustee, he would have no power to sell the Property by himself: By s 15(3) of the Trustees Act (Cap 337, 2005 Rev Ed) (“the Act”), the proceeds of sale arising under a trust of land cannot be paid to fewer than two trustees, and the Grandson accepts this to be the position in law.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issues to be determined</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 Having regard to the parties’ positions on the Probate Application, and to the terms of the orders prayed for, I consider there to be three broad issues for determination:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, does the Grandson have independent authority to sell the Property? The Grandmother does not dispute this point; her point, rather, is that the prayers requested are unnecessary. As I have received the Grandson’s submissions on the issue, I will set out my views on it, with a focus on the issue of whether the Grandson is now acting in his capacity as sole executor or as trustee of the Grandfather’s estate.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, may the court order the Property to be sold and, if so, should it? In particular, does the court have a discretion to postpone the sale of the Property and, if so, should it be exercised in the Grandmother’s favour?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, should the Grandson be awarded a commission of 1% to 2.5% on the assets collected?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 For the reasons below, I hold that the Grandson has independent authority to sell the Property and I give orders to facilitate his doing so. His claim for commission is, however, premature. I will deal with each issue in turn before setting out the appropriate orders to be granted.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issue 1: Grandson’s authority to sell the Property</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">(1) Applicable principles</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 An executor as a personal representative of a deceased person has vested in him the entire ownership of the deceased’s estate which he holds <span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">auter droit</span> for the purposes of administration: John Ross Martyn &amp; Nicholas Caddick, <span class="font-italic">Williams, Mortimer and </span><span class="font-italic">Sunnucks on Executors, Administrators and Probate</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 8th Ed, 2013) (“<span class="font-italic">Williams, Mortimer and </span><span class="font-italic">Sunnucks</span>”) at para 57-06. He holds such property without any differentiation between the legal and beneficial interests, and the beneficiaries merely have the right to ensure that he duly administers that estate. His powers and duties in relation to such property, like his general powers and duties, are governed by both legislation and the common law. The main piece of legislation for this purpose is the Act, which by s 3 defines a “trust” as extending “to the duties incident to the office of a personal representative” and defines “trustee” as including a personal representative “where the context admits”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 One of the powers that a personal representative has is the power to sell land belonging to the deceased person’s estate. A normal trustee will also have such a power (as well as a duty to exercise it) in so far as the trust is a trust for the sale of land, but he can only exercise that power together with another trustee. That is because s 15(2) of the Act prohibits a sole trustee from giving a valid receipt for the proceeds of sale arising under a trust for sale of land, and s 15(3) of the Act proscribes the payment of such proceeds to fewer than two trustees. The rationale for these provisions is generally understood to be to reduce the chance of fraudulent dealing with the trust property by means of requiring at least two trustees to act together. By contrast, a personal representative is not subject to this limitation. He has the right to sell the estate’s land and to receive the proceeds of sale by himself. Thus s 15(4) of the Act provides:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Subsection (3) does not affect the right of a sole personal representative as such to give valid receipts for or direct the application of the proceeds of sale or other capital money mentioned in that subsection; nor, except where capital money arises on a transaction, render it necessary to have more than one trustee.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 In my view, that is the position even if the will appointing the personal representative provides for a trust for sale to be executed by two trustees, as in the will of the Grandfather, which constitutes the Grandson and the Fourth Son as trustees for the sale of the Property. It is well-established that where property is bequeathed to executors, the proving of the will constitutes an acceptance of the particular trusts constituted by the will, and an executor who proves the will is clothed with those trusts and must carry them out: <span class="font-italic">Williams, Mortimer and </span><span class="font-italic">Sunnucks</span> at para 57-06. However, it has never been the position that such a trust <span class="font-italic">limit</span><span class="font-italic">s</span> the power an executor has as a personal representative. Instead, the idea is that by proving the will, he voluntarily undertakes to perform the trust, and he may therefore be held liable for breaching the duty he has adopted:<span class="font-italic"> </span>see <span class="font-italic">Mucklow</span><span class="font-italic"> v Fuller </span>(1821) Jac 198 at 201–202 <span class="font-italic">per</span> Lord Eldon LC; <span class="font-italic">Booth v Booth</span> (1838) 1 Beav 125 at 129 <span class="font-italic">per</span> Lord Langdale MR; <span class="font-italic">Stiles v Guy </span>(1832) 4 Y &amp; C Ex 572 at 575 <span class="font-italic">per</span> Lord Lyndhurst CB. And he is entitled to discharge that duty using the full powers of an executor.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 In <span class="font-italic">Herman </span><span class="font-italic">Iskandar v Shaikh Esa and another </span>[1992] 2 SLR(R) 395 (“<span class="font-italic">Herman </span><span class="font-italic">Iskandar</span>”) the High Court, dealing with the question whether a sole executor had the power to sell property under a statutory trust for sale imposed by the Residential Property Act (Cap 274, 1985 Rev Ed) (“the RPA”) in respect of residential property willed to a foreigner, held that effecting the sale was part of the duty of administering the testator’s estate which a legal personal representative under the RPA had to discharge (at [10]). Referring to <span class="font-italic">Wong Boon Pin</span><span class="font-italic"> v Wong Boon Wah </span>[1989] 1 SLR(R) 189 where Chan Sek Keong J (as the former Chief Justice then was) had characterised the statutory trust under the RPA as a trust for sale, Michael Hwang JC explained at [15] that the term “trust for sale” did not imply that a legal personal representative, in exercising his duty of sale, would lose his status of legal personal representative. Regardless of how the trust for sale had arisen, the point was that the beneficiaries’ interest lay in the sale proceeds of the property and it was mandatory under the RPA for the land to be sold in order that the proceeds may be distributed to the beneficiaries. Similarly, in my judgment, when an executor proves a will establishing a trust, and thereby becomes clothed with the trust, his undertaking to carry out the trust simply becomes part of his duty of administering the estate, which he is therefore entitled to discharge using the full powers of an executor. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 Of course, the proposition that a sole executor may sell a property that is subject to a trust for sale carries a potential for abuse. As the Supreme Court of the Straits Settlements observed in <span class="font-italic">Re A Contract between Wee </span><span class="font-italic">Poh Neo and Goona Veeragoo Naidoo</span> [1936] 1 MLJ 213 (<span class="font-italic">per</span> Clarke J):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">An executor remains an executor indefinitely, even though he be also nominated under the will to be a trustee of trusts created by that will. A dishonest person who is both executor and trustee under the will, by falsely alleging to an innocent purchaser that he is selling <span class="font-italic">qua</span> executor, may therefore be enabled, at any rate during a period of six years after the testator’s death, to sell all the trust property and to pocket the proceeds unimpeded by any necessity of abetment by a second trustee.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">However, that does not mean that there are no safeguards. In so far as the executor has undertaken to carry out the trust, he is liable to be sued by the beneficiaries of the trust for any breach of his undertaking. Thus, if the Grandson after selling the Property does not distribute the sale proceeds equally between himself and the Fourth Son, the Fourth Son can sue him for breach of trust.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 Finally, as a general rule, an executor’s power to dispose property ceases when he completes the administration of the deceased’s estate and clears it of all liabilities, whereupon he steps into the shoes of a trustee: <span class="font-italic">In re Ponder</span> [1921] 2 Ch 59 at 61 <span class="font-italic">per </span>Sargant J; <span class="font-italic">Herman </span><span class="font-italic">Iskandar</span> at [10] <span class="font-italic">per</span> Michael Hwang JC; <span class="font-italic">Lee Yoke San and another v </span><span class="font-italic">Tsong Sai Sai Cecilia and another </span>[1992] 3 SLR(R) 516 at [35] and [43] <span class="font-italic">per</span> K S Rajah JC. To this general rule, the Court of Appeal has recognised an exception, applicable particularly to small estates, to the effect that an executor’s power to dispose property survives the completion of administration in so far as it is needed to facilitate the distribution of assets: <span class="font-italic">Scan Electronics (S) Pte Ltd v Syed Ali </span><span class="font-italic">Redha Alsagoff and others</span> [1997] 1 SLR(R) 970 at [9] <span class="font-italic">per</span> M Karthigesu JA. In addition, the cessation of an executor’s powers must be distinguished from cessation of his office as an executor, which does not take place unless he renounces his office or unless the grant of probate is revoked, hence the maxim “Once an executor, always an executor”: Francis Barlow, <span class="font-italic">Williams o</span><span class="font-italic">n Wills</span> (LexisNexis, 10th Ed, 2014) at para 25.9. Thus, for example, he is entitled to receive a reversionary interest in the property falling in many years after the testator’s death.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">(2) Decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 In the present case, it is not disputed that the Grandson by extracting grant of probate was properly appointed as executor of the Grandfather’s estate and was conferred the right to administer it. Since the Grandfather’s will also named the Fourth Son as executor, it was entirely proper for the family court who heard the Grandson’s application for probate to reserve power to make a like grant in the form of double probate in favour of the Fourth Son: see <span class="font-italic">Williams, Mortimer and </span><span class="font-italic">Sunnucks</span> at paras 11-10 and 25-15. In the event, the Fourth Son did not apply for double probate, as he would have been entitled to do, and the result is that the Grandson is sole executor, in the sense that only he has the right to administer the Grandfather’s estate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 It is also not disputed that the Grandson has yet to complete his administration of the estate, given that he has yet to pay his Grandfather’s funeral expenses and testamentary expenses. Accordingly, he retains his powers as a personal representative and has yet to step into the shoes of a trustee. And as personal representative, he has the power to sell the Property by himself even though the will establishes a trust for sale, for the reasons explained at [86]–[87] above. Accordingly, I hold that the Grandson has both the authority and, indeed, the duty to sell the Property, to use the proceeds to clear the estate’s liabilities and then to distribute the net proceeds in equal shares between himself and the Fourth Son. In the light of these holdings, it is not necessary to make any declaration that he is able so to do, as he has prayed for in prayers 1 and 2 of the Probate Application. Such declarations would simply reflect the position at law with regard to the Grandson’s position as sole executor, and this position is not disputed. The dispute is in respect of the Grandson’s wish for an immediate sale of the Property, to which I now turn.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issue 2: Sale of the Property</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">(1) Power to order sale</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 Section 22(2) of the FJA provides that the Family Division of the High Court shall, when exercising jurisdiction relating to family proceedings, have all the powers of the High Court in the exercise of its original civil jurisdiction. One of those powers is the power to order the sale of land, which is contained in paragraph 2 of the First Schedule of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) (“the SCJA”), which reads:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Power to partition land and to direct a sale instead of partition in any action for partition of land; and in any cause or matter relating to land, where it appears necessary or expedient, to order the land or any part of it to be sold, and to give all necessary and consequential directions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 A similar power is contained in r 540 of the FJR. That provision falls under Part 17A of the FJR, which governs proceedings brought in relation to the Wills Act (Cap 352). Rule 540 reads:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(1) Where in any cause or matter relating to any immovable property it appears necessary or expedient for the purposes of the cause or matter that the property or any part of the property should be sold, the Court may order that property or part to be sold.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) Any party bound by the order and in possession of the property or part of the property, or in receipt of the rents and profits of the property or part, may be compelled to deliver up such possession or receipt to the purchaser or to such other person as the Court may direct.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 In the light of para 2 of the First Schedule of the SCJA and r 540 of the FJR, I consider that I do have the power to order a sale of the Property, and to make all necessary and consequential directions to effect its sale, including an order for its occupants to deliver vacant possession to the Grandson (see [79] above), which is a type of order specifically contemplated by r 540(2) of the FJR. In addition, I am persuaded that I should exercise my power to make such orders. This is because the Grandson, as I have found, has the authority to conduct the sale of the Property, and because ordering the sale of the Property will enable him to perform his duty as an executor of the Grandfather’s will to realise the Property, to use its proceeds to clear the estate’s liabilities, and to distribute the net proceeds equally between him and the Fourth Son. As I have decided that the Grandmother does not hold any beneficial interest in the Property, the trust for sale is therefore held for the benefit of only the Grandson and the Fourth Son. The Fourth Son has not filed any affidavits or sought to postpone the sale. It is the Grandmother who seeks to do so. Mr Tan invites me to postpone the sale of the Property, and I turn now to consider his submission in this regard. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">(2) Discretion to postpone sale</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 Mr Tan relies on the case of <span class="font-italic">Bedson</span><span class="font-italic"> v Bedson </span>[1965] 2 QB 666 (“<span class="font-italic">Bedson</span>”) to persuade me that I have an “equitable jurisdiction” to postpone the sale of the Property until the Grandmother passes on.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> In my view, his reliance on that case is misconceived. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 <span class="font-italic">Bedson</span> was decided during a period in England – before the enactment of the Trusts of Land and Appointment of Trustees Act 1997 (c 47) (UK) –where a trust for sale was imposed by statute upon land held by two or more persons beneficially: see ss 34 and 36 of the Law of Property Act 1925 (c 20) (UK). This was to provide overreaching machinery so that purchasers needed to investigate only the title to the legal estate. Under this regime, the English courts developed a number of principles as to how they would exercise their discretion to order the sale of the land in the event that its joint owners, being trustees of the sale of land, were in dispute over whether the land should be sold. One of the principles developed was that the court must have regard to the purpose of the trust and discern whether it was indeed to sell the land or to retain it for some other purpose. Many of these cases arose over the separation of married couples, and one of these was <span class="font-italic">Bedson</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 In <span class="font-italic">Bedson</span>, the husband and wife were joint owners of their matrimonial home, from which the husband ran his business, and in which they were held each to have had an equal beneficial share. The parties had not divorced, and the wife’s applied under s 17 of the Married Woman’s Property Act 1882 (c 75) (UK) for the home to be sold. The English Court of Appeal dismissed her application on the ground that a sale would “defeat both … contemplated purposes” of the property which was held on trust, namely to house the business which provided for the family and to provide a home for the parties and their children: <span class="font-italic">Bedson</span> at 679D–F <span class="font-italic">per</span> Lord Denning MR.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 Nothing in <span class="font-italic">Bedson</span> assists the Grandmother’s case. First, the court’s jurisdiction to order or postpone a sale in <span class="font-italic">Bedson</span> was statutory and not equitable. Second, in so far as I have any discretion to that effect, Mr Tan is wrong to rely on <span class="font-italic">Bedson</span> suggest that the purpose for which the Property was acquired is relevant to the exercise of that discretion. The equivalent purpose was relevant in <span class="font-italic">Bedson</span> only because the property there was, as a matter of the prevailing statutory law on joint ownership, held on a trust for sale: that is why the purpose of the joint owners in acquiring the property in question was relevant. If any purpose is to be relevant in the present case at all on the <span class="font-italic">Bedson</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>analysis, it should be the purpose for which the trust of land was established by the Grandfather’s will, and that purpose is for the proceeds of sale to be used to pay for the estate’s liabilities and to be distributed between the Grandson and the Fourth Son equally, as I have observed at [94] above. I therefore reject Mr Tan’s submission.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issue 3: Grandson’s entitlement to commission</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 The final issue concerns the Grandson’s claim for commission on the assets collected, pursuant to s 66(1) of the Probate and Administration Act (Cap 251, 2000 Rev Ed). The Grandmother submits that the Grandson is not entitled to commission as the assets of the Grandfather have yet to be collected and that the claim is excessive. She relies on the text of s 66(1) for her contention that an executor having collected and administered the assets is a pre-condition:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The court or a judge may in its or his discretion allow the executors or administrators a commission not exceeding 5% on the value of the assets <span class="font-italic">collected by them</span>, but in the allowance of disallowance of such commission the court shall be guided by its or his approval or otherwise of their conduct in the administration of the estate.

</div> However, I observe also that the bulk of the administration of the Grandfather’s estate has not been completed. That is largely because the Property, being the main asset under the will, has not been sold and the proceeds therefore have yet to be distributed.
