</div> There is no dispute that at the time of purchase, the couple had a common intention to hold the gold bars for their joint benefit, with the right of survivorship to apply. The dispute centres upon the intention of Mr Sulistio and Mdm Soemiati in and after 17 April 2016, when, at Mdm Soemiati’s request, Mr Sulistio put his signature under the “Delivery Instructions” section of the gold certificates. The defendants contend that this action signalled a change in the couple’s joint intention, which was, at that juncture, to gift the gold bars to Mdm Soemiati. Mr Sulistio contends that the earlier common intention remained, notwithstanding his action, and that the gold bars remained in Mdm Soemiati’s custody under a common intention constructive trust. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 Mdm Soemiati died in April 2017 and her will bequeathed the gold bars to the first, second, fourth and fifth defendants. Mr Sulistio, presently 87 years old, now sues these four defendants for the return of the bars. Rudy, the third defendant in the suit, has aligned himself with Mr Sulistio in this suit. All references, therefore, to “the defendants” in this judgment refer to Yetty, Yena, Yenny and Edy, unless otherwise stated.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 Mr Sulistio, now retired, was an extremely successful businessman in the timber logging business. The gold bars were purchased in 1989 from UOB Singapore as an investment. At the date of purchase, they were held under 6 UOB Gold Certificates (“the Original Gold Certificates”) bearing the serial numbers 00272, 00273, 00274, 00275, 00276 and 00277 and dated 11 February 1989.

</div> It is not disputed that, at the time, all the couple’s assets were held for their joint benefit. The gold bars were purchased with money from the couple’s joint account and were held in the joint names of Mr Sulistio and Mdm Soemiati.

</div> When the suit was first commenced, Mr Sulistio assumed that Mdm Soemiati’s name was listed as the transferee at the time of his signature. Parties realised just prior to trial and do not dispute that sometime later Mdm Soemiati was listed as the transferee within that section. The state of the relationship between the couple in the years leading up to this event is a matter in dispute, as is Mr Sulistio’s intention in signing the document.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 On 26 May 2016, Mdm Soemiati made a trip to UOB Singapore to effect a change of ownership of the Original Gold Certificates.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Analysis on the law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 I deal first with the correct approach to take in applying <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan</span> in this case. In my view, step (b), together with step (a) of the <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan </span>analysis, are conducted at the time the relevant property is acquired. This is because it is the financial contribution of parties that is key. A resulting trust, if any, crystalizes at the time the property is acquired: <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim v Yeo Guan Chye Terence and another </span>[2008] 2 SLR(R) 108 at [112] (“<span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span>”). It is “in theory strictly based on the parties’ respective contributions to the <span class="font-italic">purchase price </span>of the property”: <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim </span>at [113] (emphasis in original). Step (b), which seeks to answer <span class="font-italic">directly</span> what step (a) can only approximate/presume by reference to the parties’ financial contributions to the purchase, looks to identify the intentions of the parties <span class="font-italic">at the time of acquisition</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Here, the relevant point of acquisition was in 1989, when the gold bars were first purchased. They were fully paid for then, and the financial contribution of parties was made at that point. Any common intention analysed under step (b) of the <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan </span>analysis must be that which was subsisting at the time of the gold bar’s purchase. The common intention then was undisputed. The gold bars were to be held jointly. The couple’s financial contribution did not change in 2016 despite the change in legal status. Therefore, their intention at that poinr in time is more appropriately addressed at step (f) of the <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan </span>analysis. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Conversely, even where financial contribution changes between parties, so long as parties remain the same, it is still important to consider the initial agreement between parties at the time of acquisition, and in that specific context, whether that initial agreement has changed. In <span class="font-italic">Su Emmanuel v Em</span><span class="font-italic">manuel Priya Ethel Anne and another </span>[2016] 3 SLR 1222, for example, parties signed a sale and purchase agreement for one Priya to purchase 49% of the property in question. However, Priya serviced the mortgage on her own after the agreement, resulting in her contributing 70% of the mortgage payments. The Court of Appeal held that there was no “sufficient and compelling” evidence of any change in the agreement between parties. Priya’s ownership interest remained at 49%, and equitable accounting was used instead to take into account her additional financial contribution. In contrast, where new parties enter the fray, the analysis begins at that point: see, for example, <span class="font-italic">BUE and another v TZQ and another </span>[2019] 3 SLR 1022 at [45] – [46] and <span class="font-italic">Low Yin Ni and another v Tay Yuen Wei Jaycie (formerly known as Tay Yeng Choo Jessy</span>) <span class="font-italic">and another </span>[2020] SGCA 58. This is a logical application of <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span>. As envisaged at [24] above, any resulting trust would crystallise at the point the new parties make financial contribution; therefore, the intention of all relevant parties would require to be ascertained at that point to determine if any trusts arise. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 It follows, then, that the change in legal ownership in 2016 must be considered as part of, and together with other evidence on, the question whether under step (f) of the <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan </span>analysis, there was sufficient and compelling evidence of a change in the operative agreement between Mr Sulistio and Mdm Soemiati. Equity follows the law, as submitted by the defendants, “but not slavishly or always”, <span class="font-italic">per </span>Cardozo J in <span class="font-italic">Graf v Hope Building Corp </span>(1920) 254 NY 1, 9. I turn, therefore, to the evidence at hand.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Analysis on the facts </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Coming then, to what is “sufficient and compelling evidence”, Lord Neuberger’s minority judgment in <span class="font-italic">Stack v Dowden </span>[2007] 2 AC 432 (which the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan </span>cited with approval at [153] – [159]) explained it (at [146]) as normally involving: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… discussions, statements or actions, which can fairly be said to imply a positive intention to depart from [the original] apportionment…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The time period in question between the initial agreement in 1989 and Mr Sulistio’s signing of the certificates in 2016 is almost 30 years. I consider in turn the following to ascertain whether there was a change in the intention of parties in that time: the context of the couple’s relationship; Mdm Soemiati’s motivation for asking Mr Sulistio for his signature; Mr Sulistio’s evidence as to his own intention; and events that occurred after the signing. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The contextual frame of the couple’s relationship in 2016</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The defendants contend that the agreement was ultimately a reflection of Mr Sulistio and Mdm Soemiati’s relationship at that time.

Rudy’s explanation for Mdm Soemiati’s move was not a convincing one. Mdm Soemiati could have used the 2502 Apartment to play mah-jong, she did not have to move apartments to do so. There was no evidence that she was an avid mah-jong player, and it appeared that meals with friends were hosted at Mr Sulistio’s apartment. Mr Lee’s testimony about his good relationship with Mdm Soemiati was not convincing either. It was common ground that there was an occasion where a quarrel involving Mr Lee became extremely heated, during which security personnel from the apartment building were summoned.

Rudy did not challenge receiving some USD 7.2 million from 2010 to June 2016.

The agreement would explain why Mdm Soemiati had not disclosed the existence of the Will to Mr Sulistio, and took pains to have the Will signed outside her apartment. Mr Sulistio had agreed to give the gold bars to Mdm Soemiati. From her long experience with Mr Sulistio, it would have been plain to Mdm Soemiati that Mr Sulistio would have been deeply opposed to the Will’s content. Mr Sulistio’s supplementary affidavit of evidence in chief stated: “If my wife had told me about her Will, I would not have signed the gold certificates”.

Mdm Soemiati sought to gain sole ownership of the gold bars. She was the one who had approached Mr Sulistio to have the Original Gold Certificates signed. There was no other reason for her to do this, since she would, on Mr Sulistio’s own case, have been entitled to the gold bars if Mr Sulistio had pre-deceased her.

</div> While these statements explained that he did not want the defendants to benefit from Mdm Soemiati’s bequest, it did not explain how the declaration accurately reflected his intention in 2016.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 To the contrary, the rest of the evidence belied his position in the declaration and at trial. First, there was no denying the fact that he had signed the Delivery Instructions for the Original Gold Certificates. This, absent any indication otherwise, would suggest that he had intended to transfer (both legal and beneficial) ownership of the gold bars. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Second, Mr Sulistio’s initial recollection, when he first brought the suit, was that Mdm Soemiati’s name was in the delivery section. That initial recollection indicated that in his mind, the gold certificates were already signed to Mdm Soemiati.

</div> Parties discovered after the affidavits were exchanged, that at the time the certificates were signed, the transferee’s name had not been filled out in the delivery instruction section. This discovery did not assist his case, as the effect of signing delivery instructions without specifying any transferees explicitly was to give its holder a blank cheque to deal with the gold bars as she wished. It was not disputed that the certificates were thereafter retained by Mdm Soemiati. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Third, he has not contested the validity of the transfer itself. He has not suggested that there had been any form of duress, undue influence, mistake or unconscionability on Mdm Soemiati’s part. It was, in other words, a fully voluntary and deliberate transfer of title. Further, there is no dispute that the gold certificates, after Mr Sulistio signed, were thereafter kept in Mdm Soemiati’s custody. As an experienced businessman, he was no doubt aware that Mdm Soemiati could thereafter use the certificates at any time.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Fourth, Mr Sulistio was unable to offer a credible statement of his own intentions. Over the course of trial, Mr Sulistio advanced various explanations for why he signed the Delivery Instructions for the Original Gold Certificates. I found none of them convincing: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In his first affidavit of evidence-in-chief, he stated that he had signed the gold bars away because Mdm Soemiati had been “concerned about the state of [his] health and wanted [him] to sign the gold bars to her name so that she could be assured the gold bars would go to her after [his] death”.

Rudy asserted that the transfer had merely reproduced the same state of affairs that would have arisen if Mr Sulistio had pre-deceased Mdm Soemiati. Mdm Soemiati, expecting to outlive Mr Sulistio, had simply asked for the transfer as early, prospective assurance of what would have happened anyway.

</div> Rudy averred that Mdm Soemiati would not have needed to rely on the gold bars for her financial needs - the gold was only a small component of the couple’s fortune and Mdm Soemiati was the joint owner of <span class="font-italic">all</span> of the couple’s wealth. This ignores the defendants’ evidence that Mdm Soemiati was concerned about Rudy depleting the joint assets she shared with Mr Sulistio. The size of the fortune was not important to Mdm Soemiati. Her object was to secure funds for private care for the rest of her life. Her gift to the defendants was on the contingency that she no longer needed the extra fund. It would not have been her main motivation, because she was aware that Mr Sulistio had distributed much of his assets in 2007 to his children.

</div> The gold bars were specifically mentioned, in the same vein as her jewellery, because she was their sole owner.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 In my judgment, Mr Sulistio did intend to gift ownership of the gold bars to Mdm Soemiati. This was their common intention in 2016. He did so because that was the condition Mdm Soemiati imposed for her signature on the power of attorney for Rudy to deal with their Indonesian land. His signature on the gold certificates was not a neutral action and had legal effect - of which he has not pleaded he was unaware - and was in itself sufficient and compelling evidence. The onus was on him to explain why parties’ operative agreement remained unchanged despite the change in legal status, and his explanation at trial did not pass muster. Events subsequent to the signing support the same conclusion, and I turn to these.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Circumstances after April 2016</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Mdm Soemiati followed up with a trip to UOB in Singapore to finalise the transfer of the gold bars to herself.

</div> Mr Sulistio professed not to know even about the trip, but this was highly unlikely in view of the fact that the couple had meals together and lived in the same building. Of relevance was the fact that Mdm Soemiati listed the 4601 Apartment as the official address on the New Gold Certificates. This was a different address from that used for the Original Gold Certificates, and a different address from her own 2502 Apartment. The original ones listed Yenny’s American address

First, after 24 June 2016, Yena, who previously assisted her mother with the couple’s financial matters, found that the lock to the mailbox at the 4601 Apartment had been changed.

</div> She was thereafter denied access to the mailbox. The 4601 Apartment’s mailbox, once the receptacle for any correspondence concerning the couple’s jointly owned assets, was now closed to Yena. Second, a power of attorney was subsequently executed, appointing and authorizing Rudy to liaise and transact on behalf of the couple’s joint assets. Crucially, all proceeds were to be remitted to <span class="font-italic">Mr Sulistio’s </span>bank account in Hong Kong.

</div> The decision to remit proceeds to Mr Sulistio’s account was deliberate. Earlier drafts of the power of attorney showed that the original intention had been to remit proceeds directly to the couple’s <span class="font-italic">joint </span>account. In my view, the fact that Mdm Soemiati agreed to this change was consistent with my finding that the couple had made a new agreement regarding their assets. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Mr Sulistio averred in his statement of claim (and the defendants acknowledged in their defence) that he paid for all of Mdm Soemiati’s final hospital expenses.

</div>
</div> The implication here was that there could not have been any agreement to segregate the couple’s financial assets if the relationship had been amicable enough for Mr Sulistio to foot Mdm Soemiati’s entire medical bill. I do not agree that such an inference may be drawn. As stated above at [32], I find that the relationship between the parties was a complex one, in which they remained dutiful to each other despite their obvious disagreements. Mdm Soemiati did not seek to alienate her children from Mr Sulistio, even as the couple had their differences. On Yetty’s evidence, “[g]o pay a visit to your father” was her instruction to the children when they came to stay with her; she would also accompany them to the 4601 Apartment when they did so.

</div> Although she moved out of the 4601 Apartment, this was to a unit in the same building. The couple continued to meet for meals with friends in his apartment and travelled together. To be clear, Mdm Soemiati did not question Mr Sulistio’s desire to provide for her for the rest of his life. Mdm Soemiati’s concern in 2016, rather, was to ensure that the diversion of money to Rudy would not deplete the couple’s joint accounts beyond what would be sufficient to provide for her private health care. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 In my view, the agreement between Mdm Soemiati and Mr Sulistio to allow Rudy to manage the land in exchange for the transfer of the gold bars to her could rationally exist side by side with, and indeed explained, their continuing relationship with each other. The agreement they reached was a compromise. It put into the past a source of tension for Mdm Soemiati, after which she no longer worried about Rudy dealing with the Indonesian land and felt secure about her financial future. The couple were able to move forward on this basis. Mr Sulistio’s daily visits to her each day in hospital near the end of her life and his choosing to pay for her final hospital expenses are easily reconcilable with their mutual devotion to each other in the course of a marriage that weathered complex issues over many decades. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Rationalising the 2018 declaration</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Viewed in context of the events prior to Mdm Soemiati’s passing, the 2018 declaration is anomalous and is best explained as Mr Sulistio’s reaction to the contents of her Will. Nevertheless, once the certificates were gifted to Mdm Soemiati, they were hers to deal with as she pleased. No conditions or terms were put on his gift to her, and therefore her silence in respect of her will does not affect the gift. While his legal case has been run on the basis that each party would leave his or her property to his or her spouse upon death, that assumption arose from the joint ownership of the gold bars. That joint ownership was specifically changed in 2016.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 In my view, the existence of the agreement, paired with the signing of the Original Gold Certificates, adequately fulfils the requirement of “sufficient and compelling evidence”. As such, I find that the subsequent common intention of the parties in 2016 had been to transfer both beneficial and legal ownership of the gold bars to Mdm Soemiati. Accordingly, I dismiss Mr Sulistio’s claims.
