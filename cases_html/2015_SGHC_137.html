                    supplementary affidavit. I granted leave to both parties to file their
                    respective affidavits.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Further, Ms Kam sought leave towards the
                    end of the first day of the hearing to amend OS 250 to include
                    prayer 2A. Prayer 2A reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2A. A declaration that the Defendant has failed to make timely transfers
                        (in respect of the first and second quarters) or any transfer (in respect of
                        the third and fourth quarters) to the bank account of the Defendant’s
                        sinking funds for FY 2014/15 as required by the Town Councils Financial
                        Rules (Cap 329A, R 1, 1998 Rev Ed), Rule 4(2B)(<em>a</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Mr Low had no objections to the application and I allowed
                        the amendment accordingly.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The relevant facts underlying this application
                    are largely not in dispute. Following Singapore’s General Elections on
                    7 May 2011, the Hougang Town Council and Aljunied Town Council merged to
                    form the Aljunied-Hougang Town Council (“AHTC”) on 27 May 2011.
                    After the by-election for Punggol East Single Member Constituency, AHTC was
                    reconstituted as AHPETC with effect from 22 February 2013.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Under the TCA, the financial year
                    (“FY”) runs from 1 April to 31 March and Town Councils
                    are required to submit audited financial statements and auditor’s
                    observations report (“Audited Financial Statements and Reports”)
                    (if any) for each FY to the Minister for National Development (“the
                    Minister”) by 31 August and for the Minister to present the same to
                    Parliament.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       AHPETC (initially as AHTC) submitted its first
                    Audited Financial Statements and Reports for FY 2011/2012 (“FY
                    11/12”) to the Minister on 11 January 2013. They were late by four
                    months and 11 days. More importantly, the FY 11/12 financial statements were
                    disclaimed by their then auditors, M/s Foo Kon Tan Grant Thornton LLP
                    (“FKT”). FKT issued a Disclaimer of Opinion in respect of
                    AHPETC’s (then AHTC) financial statements for FY 11/12, listing four areas
                    as the bases for their disclaimers.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> These bases included the fact
                    that $32,079,316 of AHPETC’s (then AHTC) operating expenditure had been
                    allocated between residential property, commercial property and car park without
                    first identifying the expenditure relating to the rightful property type and the
                    fact that FKT was unable to ascertain the accuracy of the cash and bank balances
                    of AHPETC’s (then AHTC) bank accounts as a sum of $67,589 remained
                    irreconcilable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     AHPETC’s Audited Financial Statements
                    and Reports for its FY 2012/2013 (“FY 12/13”), which should have
                    been submitted by 31 August 2013 to the Minister, were again late. This
                    time it was submitted on 10 February 2014, five months ten days late.
                    Rather alarmingly, FKT not only issued a Disclaimer of Opinion on AHPETC’s
                    financial statements for FY 12/13, but this time it did so on 13
                        grounds.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Three of these grounds were the same as those
                    issued for the FY 11/12 financial statements. The remaining ten grounds
                    included:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_a"></a>(a)     FKT’s inability to obtain
                        necessary documents to ascertain the collectability of the service and
                        conservancy receivables;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_b"></a>(b)     FKT’s inability to determine the accuracy of the
                        lift upgrading expenses of $18,162,857;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_c"></a>(c)     FKT’s inability to determine the validity
                        and accuracy of advance receipt from residents in respect of service and
                        conservancy charges (“S&amp;CC”) amounting to
                    $507,809;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_d"></a>(d)     AHPETC’s failure to comply with r 4(2B)(<em>a</em>) of the Town Council Financial Rules (Cap 329A,
                        R 1, 1998 Rev Ed) (“TCFR”) which was in relation to the
                        transfer of funds into the sinking fund; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_e"></a>(e)     FKT’s inability to obtain details of the
                        project management service fees AHPETC paid to a related
                    party.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>FKT eventually concluded that AHPETC
                        “[had] not complied with the provisions of the [TCA] and the
                        [TCFR].”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     According to the Minister, the observations in
                    the above two reports by FKT “raised[d] serious questions about the
                    reliability and accuracy of AHPETC’s financial and accounting
                        systems.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> Hence, the Auditor-General
                    (“AGO”) was appointed on 19 February 2014 by the Deputy Prime
                    Minister and the Minister for Finance to conduct an audit on AHPETC’s FY
                    12/13 financial accounts, records and books (“the AGO
                    Audit”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Pending completion of the AGO Audit, the MND
                    withheld the grants-in-aid to AHPETC for FY 2014/2015 (“FY 14/15”)
                    because of its concerns surrounding the adequacy of AHPETC’s financial and
                    accounting systems and as to whether moneys held by AHPETC (“Town Council
                    Moneys”) were properly applied.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     In response, AHPETC wrote to the MND on
                    16 June 2014 stating that the withholding of the grants-in-aid to AHPETC is
                    “likely to critically and adversely affect the [Town Council’s]
                    cash flow position, resulting in a disruption of essential services to the town
                    because the [Town Council] would not be able to pay its
                        contractors”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> AHPETC also informed the MND in a another
                    letter dated 30 July 2015 that it would not be able to make its first
                    quarter sinking fund transfer due to the grants-in-aid being withheld and as it
                    needed to pay for essential services for the town.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     After further exchange of correspondence and
                    receiving certain information from AHPETC, the MND offered in a letter dated
                    7 October 2014 to disburse half of the grants-in-aid to AHPETC, subject to
                    the following conditions:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_a"></a>(a)     That AHPETC explains the decrease in
                        its cash and cash equivalent over a period of 16 months;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_b"></a>(b)     That AHPETC’s Chairman confirms
                        and declares that the statements on AHPETC’s financial accounts which
                        were provided earlier were true;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_c"></a>(c)     That AHPETC’s Chairman gives an assurance of
                        measures in place to account explicitly for the use of the FY 14/15 S&amp;CC
                        Grant if disbursed; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_d"></a>(d)     That AHPETC’s Chairman ensures that AHPETC would
                        make all necessary transfers to its sinking fund bank accounts for the
                        entire FY.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     However, AHPETC did not accept the MND’s
                    offer for half the grants-in-aid. It stated in an email dated 12 November 2014
                    that it would reply substantively “should [it] wish to take the option of
                    the half-grant while awaiting the conclusion of the [AGO
                        Audit]”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> AHPETC never took the MND up on its offer. At
                    present, the grants-in-aid for FY 14/15 have not been disbursed, but it should
                    be noted that the grants-in-aid for FY 2013/2014 (“FY 13/14”)
                    amounting to $6,021,285.05 were paid on or around 14 May
                2013.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     On 9 February 2015, the AGO released its
                    report on the AGO Audit (“the AGO Report”). In the overview of the
                    AGO’s Observations, the AGO stated that it had found several lapses in
                    governance and compliance with the TCA and the TCFR. The major lapses include
                    the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_a"></a>(a)     Failure to transfer monies into the
                        sinking fund bank accounts as required by the TCFR;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_b"></a>(b)     Inadequate oversight of related party
                        transactions involving ownership interests of key officers, hence risking
                        the integrity of such payments;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_c"></a>(c)     Not having a system to monitor arrears of S&amp;CC
                        accurately and hence there is no assurance that arrears are properly
                        managed;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_d"></a>(d)     Poor
                        internal controls, hence risking the loss of valuables, unnecessary
                        expenditure and wrong payments for goods and services;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_e"></a>(e)     Not having a
                        proper system to safeguard documents and keep proper accounts and records as
                        required by the TCA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>It is important to
                        note the key conclusion and view of the AGO:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Unless the weaknesses are addressed, there can be no assurance that
                        AHPETC’s financial statements are accurate and reliable and that
                        public funds are properly spent, accounted for and managed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The serious lapses identified by the AGO merit
                    setting out in some detail. If similar lapses occurred in the context of a
                    public limited company or a Management Corporation Strata Title Committee
                    (“MCST Committee”), there would have been severe consequences to
                    the office holders. In relation to the lapses in the management of the sinking
                    funds, r 4(2B)(<em>a</em>) of the TCFR mandated AHPETC
                    to make the requisite payments into the sinking fund within one month from the
                    end of each quarter of the financial year. AHPETC had failed to make the
                    requisite transfers to sinking fund bank accounts for the last three quarters of
                    FY 11/12 as required by r 4(2B)(<em>a</em>) of the
                    TCFR. AHPETC did make some transfers for FY 12/13 but these were late and short
                    of the required amounts. Most of the transfers were made only after the
                    auditor’s queried AHPETC on it. Additionally, there were other instances
                    of non-compliance with the TCA involving the wrong use of monies in sinking fund
                    bank accounts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The setting aside of sinking funds of Town
                    Councils, or MCST Committees for that matter, is a well-recognised, mandatory
                    and prudent measure that must be complied with. Sinking funds represent sums in
                    the nature of savings, set aside periodically to cater for major cyclical
                    expenses of a long-term nature and which usually involves relatively large sums
                    of money. Thus, blocks of flats have to be painted every five years or so;
                    roofing systems, water tanks, pumps and water supply systems, electrical supply
                    systems, lightning protection and lifts require periodic renewal or replacement.
                    If money is not set aside regularly each FY, when the time comes to, <em>eg</em>, replace lifts, the funds collected during that
                    financial year will be insufficient to pay for the same. The setting aside of
                    funds for such periodic medium- to longer-term expenditure are covered under
                    s 33(6) of the TCA. In addition, s 33(6) also caters for payments from
                    the sinking fund for expenditure incurred in lift upgrading works, major repairs
                    and maintenance of the common property, boundary walls of the Housing and
                    Development Board (“HDB”) and upgrading works. It is, amongst
                    other things, the height of financial irresponsibility to ignore such
                    obligations. They are not mere technicalities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     In relation to receivables from various
                    stakeholders such as Sundry Debtors, the AGO found that there was poor
                    monitoring and lack of due diligence by AHPETC in following up on amounts due
                        (<em>ie</em>, receivables) and monies received
                        (<em>ie</em>, receipts) from external parties, to
                    ensure that payments due were collected on a timely basis and that receipts were
                    accurately captured in the accounting records. For example, the AGO found that
                    as at 1 July 2014, $376,316 owed by various Sundry Debtors remained outstanding,
                    and have been outstanding for 17.5 to 37.6 months. If these sundry debtors
                    included owners of flats within AHPETC, then monies that are collected from
                    those flat owners who dutifully pay their dues are used to fund those defaulting
                    flat owners who have not paid their S&amp;CC contributions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     More severely, AHPETC did not fully disclose
                    its related party transactions in its financial statements.
                    PricewaterhouseCoopers Consulting Pte Ltd (“PwC”) (who was
                    appointed by the AGO to carry out a review of selected areas of AHPETC’s
                    accounts) found that there was inadequate management of the conflicts of
                    interests of related parties arising from ownership interests of its key
                    officers. For example, FM Solutions and Integrated Services
                    (“FMSI”) and FM Solutions and Services Pte Ltd
                    (“FMSS”) were engaged by AHPETC to carry out managing agent
                    services and essential maintenance and lift rescue services. The Secretary of
                    AHPETC was the owner of FMSI, a sole proprietorship. The Secretary, General
                    Manager and both Deputy General Managers of AHPETC were directors and
                    shareholders of FMSS. AHPETC’s General Manager and Secretary are spouses.
                    To compound matters, some invoices issued by FMSS and FMSI were verified by
                    AHPETC’s General Manager and Deputy General Manager (both of whom are
                    shareholder-directors of FMSS). The General Manager also approved the payment
                    vouchers and/or cheques before they were handed over to the payment signatories
                    for signing, one of whom is the Secretary of AHPETC (who is the owner of FMSI).
                    According to the AGO Report, the total value of the related party transactions
                    entered into between AHPETC and FMSS and FMSI is in excess of $25.9 million.
                    There were also control gaps in processing 84 related-party transactions
                    amounting to some $6.61 million. After the release of the AGO Report, AHPETC
                    conducted a check on the amounts actually billed by FMSS for essential
                    maintenance and lift rescue services for the period between October 2011 to June
                    2012 and discovered that it had computed the rates for FMSS’s services
                    incorrectly, thereby leading to AHPETC overpaying FMSS $122,411.98. This amount
                    has since been credited back to AHPETC. This overpayment might have gone
                    unnoticed if not for the AGO Report.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     On 12 February 2015, Parliament convened
                    to debate on the AGO Report and its findings. After two days of debate, AHPETC
                    Members of Parliament unanimously supported the motion in Parliament that noted
                    with concern, <em>inter alia</em>, the various deficiencies
                    in AHPETC’s financial and accounting systems, record-keeping and
                    safeguards, the uncertain accuracy and reliability of AHPETC’s accounts
                    and the risk that AHPETC has not properly managed and spent public funds. During
                    the Parliamentary Debate, there were also calls by various members of the House
                    for AHPETC to be transparent about its affairs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     On 20 March 2015, the MND filed
                    OS 250 and SUM 1299.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In addition to the above background, the
                    parties also agree on the following facts and positions:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_a"></a>(a)     AHPETC has been submitting
                        disclaimed Audited Financial Statements and Reports since
                    inception;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_b"></a>(b)     There
                        have been breaches by AHPETC of the TCA and the TCFR insofar as they are
                        stated in the AGO Report;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_c"></a>(c)     The accountants appointed by AHPETC to address the
                        weaknesses identified in the AGO Report, Business Assurance LLP, have yet to
                        give any advice on how to improve the processes of AHPETC. AHPETC has simply
                        stated it is still a “work in progress”;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_d"></a>(d)     AHPETC has a duty to make sure that its payments
                        are properly made and duly authorised. If a payment is not properly made or
                        duly authorised (<em>eg</em>, there was overpayment for
                        works), AHPETC has a duty to recover those sums;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_e"></a>(e)     The sinking fund transfers for the
                        third and fourth quarter of FY 14/15 have not been
                made.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">My Decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The facts set out above are not really in
                    contention. The related documents, like the AGO report and the Disclaimed
                    Accounts by FKT, are also a matter of public record having been placed before
                    and debated in Parliament over two days on 12 and 13 February 2015. Insofar
                    as they are not agreed, the foregoing forms my findings of fact on the evidence
                    before me as are the further facts that I refer to hereafter. There can be
                    little doubt that AHPETC has breached several of its duties under the TCA and
                    the TCFR, and continue to be in breach of some of them. I asked Mr Low over
                    two days of oral submissions how far along the road AHPETC is to resolving the
                    qualifications made by FKT and the only answer AHPETC could give was that
                    “it’s work in progress.” Mr Low did, however, assure me that
                    the 30 June 2015 deadline would be kept. I also asked whether
                    AHPETC’s consultant has advised them over their processes, as this was one
                    of the major weaknesses pointed out by the AGO. Mr Terence Tan, second
                    counsel for AHPETC said on the second day of oral submissions, “not as
                    yet”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Given these facts, I now turn to the orders
                    and declarations sought by the MND against AHPETC.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Prayer 3(a) and the first part of prayer 3(b) </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Prayer 3(a) seeks to appoint independent
                    accountants (“IAs”) to co-authorise and co-sign all payments of
                    AHPETC in excess of $20,000 from segregated bank accounts (for sinking funds and
                    operating funds respectively) (“the Special Accounts”) into which
                    the grants-in-aid for FY 14/15 and FY 2015/2016 (“FY 15/16”) will
                    be paid by the MND to AHPETC. Prayer 3(b) can be divided into two parts. The
                    first part relates to the IAs’ power to do all things necessary to ensure
                    proposed payments out of the Special Accounts are correctly made and properly
                    authorized. The second part relates to the IAs’ power to do all things
                    necessary to ensure that adequate control is maintained over Town Council Moneys
                    and the expenditure incurred by AHPETC. It therefore becomes clear that prayer
                    3(b) refers to two separate categories of AHPETC’s moneys (though there is
                    some degree of overlap). The first is the moneys in the Special Accounts (which
                    comprises the grants-in-aid for FY 14/15 and FY 15/16), and the second is the
                    Town Council Moneys (which comprises all moneys held by AHPETC including but not
                    limited to the grants-in-aid and S&amp;CC). In this portion of my decision, I
                    deal only with prayer 3(a) and the first part of prayer 3(b), as those are the
                    prayers which relate to the grants-in-aid that are to be disbursed by the
                    MND.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Mr Low argues that s 42 of the TCA
                    allows the Minister to impose such conditions as he determines on the
                    grants-in-aid the MND makes to the Town Council. Section 42 of the TCA
                    reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Grants</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>42.</b>  For the purposes of enabling
                        a Town Council to carry out its functions under this Act or any other Act,
                        the Minister may from time to time make grants-in-aid to the Town Council of
                        such sums of money and subject to such conditions as the Minister may
                        determine out of moneys to be provided by Parliament.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Mr Low accepts that the Minister may
                    impose the very orders that are sought in prayer 3(a) as conditions,
                        <em>ie</em>, that the grants-in-aid for FY 14/15 and FY
                    15/16 are to be paid into the Special Accounts, and payments in excess of
                    $20,000 from the Special Accounts will have to be co-authorised and co-signed by
                    IAs. In fact, Mr Low goes further to argue that the court should not grant
                    prayer 3(a) because the Minister can simply impose the relevant conditions
                    and an application to court for such an order is unnecessary.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     I am in agreement with Mr Low that the
                    orders sought in prayer 3(a) and the first part of prayer 3(b) are matters
                    that are left to the Minister under s 42 of the TCA. That provision
                    unambiguously provides the Minister with the power to subject the grants-in-aid
                    to such conditions as he may determine. Should the Minister decide to impose
                    conditions, it then falls on AHPETC to decide whether they would accept the
                    conditions in order to receive the grants-in-aid. If they feel the conditions
                    are unreasonable in the <em>Wednesbury</em> sense, then
                    judicial review proceedings are always an option open to them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Ms Kam argues that it was necessary to
                    make this application to court because the MND imposed conditions for the
                    release of half of the grants-in-aid in October 2014, but this was not accepted
                    by AHPETC.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> As noted above at [16], AHPETC stated it would
                    “reply substantively” should it decide to “take the option
                    of the half-grant”. Ms Kam asks the court to issue the order as
                    otherwise it is only a matter of time before this matter came back to the court.
                    There is some truth in this because, on the first day of oral arguments before
                    me, Mr Low, in consultation with his client, indicated that the ceiling of
                    $20,000 was much too low and it should be set at $100,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     There was also some disagreement over the
                    identity of the IAs and who should select the IAs. These two questions are
                    related. Mr Low alleges that the two IAs proposed by the MND are
                    inappropriate as they are from PwC, and PwC was engaged by the AGO to review
                    selected areas of AHPETC’s accounts during the AGO’s Audit in 2014.
                    He argues that the proposed IAs will come with “preconceived
                    notions” that AHPETC has done wrong, and in any event, will have an
                    appearance of bias.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> He suggests that the IAs should
                    be appointed by a neutral third party, such as a retired judge or a senior
                    counsel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     I must say that I fail to appreciate
                    Mr Low’s or AHPETC’s objections to the proposed IAs. First, it
                    is not at all clear that the proposed IAs are the very same accountants who had
                    worked on the AGO Report. Secondly, even if they were, the proposed IAs are
                    professionals who were exercising their professional judgment in the discharge
                    of their duties. No allegations have been raised by AHPETC thus far as to the
                    impartiality, expertise, or professionalism of the PwC accountants who worked on
                    matters that were also set out in the AGO’s Report. In fact, AHPETC even
                    fully accepted the AGO’s Report in Parliament, stating that the
                    “AGO’s work is thorough [and] fair”. Since AHPETC accepts
                    the professionalism and integrity of the AGO and its Report, it must accept the
                    PwC Report and the work done by its accountants. At no point did AHPETC draw a
                    distinction in terms of their overall satisfaction with the AGO Report between
                    the portions done by the AGO and the portions done by PwC. It is unfair to the
                    proposed IAs to say that they would come with preconceived notions, and it would
                    be improper to allege that their appointment will lead to an appearance of bias
                    as there is no basis for any such allegation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In my view, if the Minister determines the
                    identity of the IAs as part of the condition he imposes under s 42 of the
                    TCA and AHPETC has objections to the identity of the IAs, AHPETC can take it up
                    with the Minister. If the Minister stands firm, it remains a condition the
                    Minister has imposed under s 42 of the TCA. If AHPETC is of the view that
                    the Minister is acting <em>ultra vires</em> by selecting
                    the proposed IAs, or that there is otherwise something it wants to challenge,
                    there is nothing preventing AHPETC from coming to court to challenge the
                    Minister’s conditions. Of course, whether they will succeed or not depends
                    on the facts and issues raised in those proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     I have stated my view that whether any and, if
                    so, what conditions are imposed is a matter for the Minister to decide under
                    s 42 of the TCA. That should ordinarily be the end of the matter and the
                    court should not be involved in imposing such conditions. No order is required
                    from the court. A possible challenge by way of judicial review after the
                    conditions are made known is theoretically possible provided there are grounds
                    for doing so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     However, as stated above, I have seen
                    AHPETC’s letter dated 29 April 2015 and Ms Kam has also shown me the
                    MND’s response dated 2 May 2015, (also handed up to me in the course of
                    oral argument). I can see that Ms Kam is probably right in that any
                    conditions imposed by the Minister will be unacceptable to AHPETC and this will
                    result in further court proceedings. The letters referred to, however, show some
                    effort by both parties to compromise. On the second day of oral argument,
                    Mr Low also said his client agreed to the lower $20,000 ceiling as
                    reasonable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     To assist the parties, and I must emphasise it
                    is no more than that, and in an effort to obviate further court proceedings, I
                    will say a few words regarding the conditions as reflected in prayers 3(a)
                    and the first part of prayer 3(b). In my view, the imposition of these
                    conditions are reasonable in the light of the findings of the AGO Report, which
                    was also accepted without reservation by AHPETC. As indicated above,
                    AHPETC’s management of its funds and finances have been far from
                    satisfactory, and the problems continue to remain unrectified. Controls and
                    measures must be put in place to ensure that the grants-in-aid for FY 14/15 and
                    FY 15/16 are adequately managed and payments out of those grants are correctly
                    made and properly authorised in accordance with the law and the TCA. The
                    Government, through the MND, have a responsibility to make payments of public
                    money in accordance with the law and s 42 of the TCA reflects this
                    responsibility.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     In their letter of 2 May 2015, the MND
                    has offered to try and reach consensus on these conditions and suggested a
                    consent order be entered accordingly with appropriate amendments to the OS and
                    Summons to reflect the agreement. I can only urge parties to do so as I see the
                    remaining differences as minor and/or technical and can be overcome. A consent
                    order will also assist the parties to lower the likelihood of subsequent
                    disputes. I accordingly make no order on prayers 3(a) and the first part of
                    prayer 3(b). The parties have liberty to apply in the event they have reached an
                    agreement and wish to record a consent order.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The second part of prayer 3(b) and prayers 3(c)–(h)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     I now turn to deal with the most heavily
                    contested issue in these proceedings—the appointment of IAs to ensure that
                    adequate control is maintained over Town Council Moneys and to do all things
                    that are necessary to identify whether past payments of AHPETC have been
                    correctly made, properly authorised and lawfully made. The latter includes
                    taking accounts, directing inquiries of payments made to any persons related to
                    AHPETC (or AHTC) and/or whether there has been any breach of duty or unlawful
                    conduct by any person acting for AHPETC (or AHTC) or its agents and, where
                    necessary, recovering such payments incorrectly, improperly or unlawfully paid
                    out and taking appropriate action in respect of breaches of duties or unlawful
                    conduct by persons acting for AHPETC (of AHTC) or its agents. There are also
                    prayers asking that the IAs may disclose to the MND (or such other persons as
                    directed by the court) information obtained by the IAs in the course of their
                    work. There is also a prayer that these IAs may make applications to court from
                    time to time to seek further directions and that they may appoint such other
                    persons as they deem appropriate to assist them in their work. These have been
                    fully set out at [1] above as are the further ancillary prayers in
                    prayer 3.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The legal bases on which the MND relies on to
                    seek those prayers are:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_a"></a>(a)     a statutory mandate pursuant to the
                        TCA;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_b"></a>(b)     a

                    in the abstract. However, before I proceed to do so, it will be helpful to
                    examine the nature of a Town Council.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The nature of a Town Council</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Town Councils were born out of a pilot Town
                    Council project that was first started in Ang Mo Kio New Town some 20 months
                    before the second reading of the Town Councils Bill on 28 June 1988
                        (<em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official
                        Report</em> (28 June 1988) vol 51 (“Second Reading of
                    the Town Councils Bill”) at cols 373–374 (S Dhanabalan,
                    Minister for National Development)). The Government wanted to see how residents
                    could participate in the management of public housing estates, which was then
                    being carried out by the HDB across Singapore. The HDB was, <em>inter alia</em>, looking after the management and upkeep of public
                    housing estates which housed some 80% of the population of Singapore. The HDB
                    had to provide the same amenities and have the same rules and regulations in all
                    estates. There was no room for variation to suit individual housing estates and
                    neighbourhoods. The idea of a Town Council was to allow residents to have a say
                    and decide for themselves what kind of living environment they wanted and each
                    Town could develop its own distinctive character according to local conditions
                    and the desires of its residents. The pilot project showed that self-management
                    was a workable concept for public housing estates and the residents in the
                    project participated with enthusiasm. The Government accordingly decided to
                    extend the Town Council to all constituencies with HDB estates.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     During the Second Reading of the Town Councils
                    Bill, the then Minister for National Development, Mr S Dhanabalan
                    (“Mr Dhanabalan”) briefed Members of Parliament
                    (“MPs”) on the salient features of Town Councils, their
                    constitution, their functions and the financial provisions therefor. I highlight
                    some of the matters mentioned by Mr Dhanabalan:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_43-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Town Councils were to control,
                        manage, maintain and improve the common areas of the residential and
                        commercial property in the housing estates of the HDB within the
                        Town;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_43-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
                        Government may make grants-in-aid to Town Councils;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_43-p2_c"></a>(c)     Town Councils were required to set up
                        and maintain sinking funds to enable the carrying out of cyclical repair
                        works; contributions to the funds must not be lower than the prescribed
                        rates;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_43-p2_d"></a>(d)     For
                        estate management, the Government will provide the Town Councils with the
                        same financing as that provided to the HDB and worked out based on the
                        HDB’s current rate of service and conservancy expenditure; households
                        in the Town Council will be subsidised at levels no less than that of
                        households in estates which come directly under the HDB’s management;
                        the quantum will vary according to flat types and with the age of the
                        flats;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_43-p2_e"></a>(e)     Town
                        Councils will be given certain powers to levy and recover unpaid
                        S&amp;CC;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_43-p2_f"></a>(f)     It
                        was up to the residents of the Town Council to determine for themselves how
                        they wanted to shape the environment of their Town, what kind of additional
                        facilities they wanted to put in and how well they wanted to maintain their
                        surroundings; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_43-p2_g"></a>(g)     The framework in the Bill incorporates the necessary powers and
                        latitudes for the effective functioning of Town Councils with sufficient
                        built-in safeguards to protect the interest of the residents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Mr Dhanabalan also stated that there were very
                            important reasons for the setting up of Town Councils. It had to do with
                            Singapore’s survival under the system of representative government
                            and that it was crucial to understand the philosophy and arguments for
                            this approach.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The then First Deputy Prime Minister and
                    Minister for Defence Mr Goh Chok Tong stated that the Town Councils Bill was
                    meant to contribute to the attainment of two philosophical objectives, the first
                    being the increased participation of Singaporeans in building an even better
                    Singapore, and the second being the need to provide stabilisers to our
                    democratic political system (at cols 379–381).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     To achieve these twin objectives, the Bill
                    sought, first, to transfer some power from the HDB to the MPs and grassroots
                    leaders by giving the latter, and the residents, greater power and
                    responsibility to manage their own affairs and to participate in their
                    estate’s development. Hence, the Town Councils Bill intended for Town
                    Councils and their MPs to take over certain powers, duties and responsibilities
                    in relation to the public housing estates within the Town from the HDB. As
                    Mr Goh Chok Tong pointed out, all public housing estates at that time were
                    centrally managed by the HDB and this was viewed as undesirable. The Town
                    Council scheme was created in order to achieve greater flexibility and
                    efficiency in decision-making, and to confer upon the residents a sense of
                    ownership and the right to make choices.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Secondly, it was perceived at that time that
                    MPs had no direct responsibility for and accountability to their constituencies.
                    The Bill sought to increase the authority and responsibility of MPs, thereby
                    encouraging voters to vote more carefully and sincerely to choose honest and
                    effective MPs. Town Councils were thus to be allowed to run with a much lesser
                    degree of supervisory control from the Government. Mr Dhanabalan
                    stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The intention [of the Town Councils Bill] is to give the
                        Town Councils as much latitude as possible for them to manage their areas.
                        Broad principles, of course, will have to be laid down, as the Bill itself
                        now stipulates, in terms of how they manage their finances, publication of
                        accounts and so on. But the Town Councils will be given a lot of latitude to
                        employ the kind of people who are necessary, to pay them the kind of fees
                        that are necessary to get the work done. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The whole idea of this exercise is for people to be careful in the choice
                        of their MPs as well as in the choice of the Councillors, in the sense that
                        if the MP is good, he could choose good, honest, competent Councillors to
                        help him. It is important that people realize that they have to live with
                        the consequences of their choice. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     With the passing of the TCA, Town Councils
                    came into being. They were, by statute, bodies corporate with perpetual
                    succession and may sue or be sued in the corporate name of that Town Council.
                    The relevant MP or MPs for that constituency or constituencies would head the
                    Town Councils and they could appoint members to that Town Council. Under
                    s 18 of the TCA, the function of Town Councils are to control, manage,
                    maintain and improve the common property of the residential and commercial
                    property in the housing estates of the HDB within the Town and to keep them in a
                    state of good and serviceable repair and in a proper and clean condition. They
                    were to exercise such powers and perform such duties as may from time to time be
                    conferred on a Town Council by or under written law. Their functions include the
                    conservancy and landscaping of the common property of the residential and
                    commercial property in the housing estates of the HDB within the Town. They are
                    also subject to the TCFR, which was made pursuant to s 57 of the
                    TCA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The various legal bases argued</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     I will now turn to the legal bases that the
                    MND relied on.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Basis (d): Statutory right under s 21(2) of the Act</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Having dealt with the rationale and purpose
                    behind Town Councils, and having referred to some of the provisions of the TCA,
                    I now turn to deal with the MND’s claim to a right to seek the orders and
                    declarations prayed for under s 21(2) of the TCA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Ms Kam argues that the MND has a
                    statutory right under s 21(2) read with s 21(1)(<em>f</em>) of the TCA to seek an appropriate order from the High Court
                    to compel AHPETC to comply with s 35(<em>c</em>) of
                    the TCA. Section 21(1)(<em>f</em>) imposes a duty on
                    AHPETC to “comply with the provisions of [the TCA] and the rules made
                    thereunder”, and this includes s 35(<em>c</em>), which requires AHPETC to “do all things necessary to
                    ensure that all payments out of its moneys are correctly made and properly
                    authorised” and “adequate control is maintained over” its
                    “assets” and “expenditure incurred”. Ms Kam
                    argues that the MND is a “person for whose benefit” AHPETC’s
                    duty to comply with, <em>inter alia</em>,
                        s 35(<em>c</em>), is imposed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     It would be apposite to set out ss 21 and
                        35(<em>c</em>) of the TCA:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Mr Low on the other hand contends that
                    only the HDB or a resident voter may take advantage of s 21(2) of the TCA,
                    and that the phrase “any person for whose benefit” does not
                    include the MND.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> He relies on two authorities
                    to support his contention.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The first is that under s 2(1) of the
                    Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 2002 Rev Ed), both “person” and
                    “government” have been defined separately, and by virtue of the
                    legal maxim <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius</em>
                    (the expression of one thing is the exclusion of the other), the express
                    definition of “government” excludes it from the definition of
                        “person”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> I have little hesitation in dismissing
                    this argument as misconceived. If Mr Low is correct, then a “police
                    officer” which is also separately defined under s 2(1) of the
                    Interpretation Act cannot be a “person”. In any event, s 2 of
                    the Interpretation Act provides that the words stated therein are to have the
                    meanings respectively assigned to them <em>unless there is
                        something in the subject or context inconsistent with such
                        construction</em>. Notwithstanding s 2 of the Interpretation Act,
                    the word “person” in s 21(2) of the TCA must still be
                    construed in its context.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     The second authority Mr Low relies on is
                    the decision of the High Court in <em>Chee Soon Juan and others v
                        Public Prosecutor</em> [2011] 3 SLR 50 (“<em>Chee Soon Juan</em>”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> With respect, this authority does not
                    take Mr Low very far. In <em>Chee Soon Juan</em>, the
                    appellants were charged under r 5 of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public
                    Order and Nuisance) (Assemblies and Processions) Rules (Cap 184, R 1,
                    2000 Rev Ed) (“MOR”) for participating in an assembly intended to
                    demonstrate opposition to the actions of the Government where they ought
                    reasonably to have known that the assembly was held without a permit. One of the
                    issues was whether the Government was a “person” within the
                    meaning of r 2(1)(<em>a</em>) of the MOR, which
                    required, <em>inter alia</em>, that the assembly was
                    intended “to demonstrate support for or opposition to the views or
                    actions of any <em>person</em>” [emphasis added]. In
                    making certain observations about how the judge below dealt with this issue, Woo
                    Bih Li J held that he would prefer to define “person” in
                        r 2(1)(<em>a</em>) with “specific regard to
                    its evidently broad scope” and came to the conclusion that
                    “person” amounted to “any identifiable entity, whether or
                    not a legal person <em>stricto sensu</em>”, and this
                    included the Government (at [13] and [20]). <em>Chee Soon
                        Juan</em> stands for the principle that when defining the word
                    “person” in a particular provision, regard must be given to the
                    purpose and scope of that provision. This principle is axiomatic.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     During oral argument, Ms Kam made an
                    additional argument relying on ss 3 and 36 of the Government Proceedings
                    Act (Cap 121, 1985 Rev Ed) (“GPA”). Mr Low responded
                    with an “Aide Memiore 1”. Section 3 of the GPA provides that
                    the Government may make a claim against any person if such a claim would have
                    afforded grounds for civil proceedings between private persons. Section 36
                    of the GPA provides that the Government’s right to take advantage of the
                    provisions of any written law, although not named therein, is not prejudiced.
                    Section 3 of the GPA essentially sets out the right of the Government to
                    sue as if it were a private person; <em>eg</em>, where the
                    driver of a vehicle negligently collides into a military vehicle and s 36
                    makes it clear that the Government is entitled to take advantage of legislation
                    which does not specifically name the Government. However, the onus is still on
                    the Government to show that the legislation in question was intended to extend
                    to it. Therefore, despite ss 3 and 36 of the GPA, the MND must still show
                    that Parliament had intended for it to be able to take advantage of that
                    provision, in this case, s 21(2) of the TCA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Section 21(2) is preceded by
                        s 21(1)(<em>a</em>) to (<em>g</em>) which lays down certain requirements and duties upon a Town
                    Council. I agree with Ms Kam that under s 21(1)(<em>f</em>) the Town Council is duty bound to comply with the provisions
                    of the TCA. These provisions include s 35(<em>c</em>),
                    which requires AHPETC to “do all things necessary to ensure that all
                    payments out of its moneys are correctly made and properly authorised”
                    and “adequate control is maintained” over its assets and
                    expenditure incurred. It is also indisputable that AHPETC must make quarterly
                    payments into a sinking fund no later than one month after the end of each
                    quarter under the TCFR.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     But if there is a breach of or non-compliance
                    with these duties and requirements, who can complain? The TCA is not silent.
                    Section 21(2) provides that where a requirement or duty is imposed on a
                    Town Council “by this section”, certain parties or persons may
                    apply to court for an order compelling the Town Council to carry out the
                    requirement or perform the duty as the case may be. The last mentioned words
                    point to mandatory orders being made by the court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Section 21(2) of the TCA first names the
                    HDB as an entity that is entitled to seek redress from the court, and there is
                    no qualification that the duty or requirement imposed on the Town Council must
                    be for the HDB’s benefit. There are very obvious and sound reasons for
                    this. The HDB remains the lessor and owner of the HDB estates and buildings.
                    Sections 53(2) and (3) of the TCA makes it clear that, except as is
                    otherwise provided for in the TCA, the HDB shall be entitled to enforce the
                    performance of the terms, covenants and conditions in its leases as if the Act
                    had not been enacted. What was transferred from the HDB to the Town Councils was
                    the power, duty and responsibility to control, manage, maintain and improve the
                    HDB’s housing estates, which also included other facilities like car
                    parks, markets, hawker centres <em>etc</em> within the
                    Towns. After the transfer of such duties and obligations to the Town Councils,
                    s 54 of the TCA provides that the HDB is no longer liable in respect of any
                    action, claim or proceedings arising out of any repairs, maintenance,
                    improvements or other works carried out by the Town Council or for charges paid
                    to a Town Council by any person under the TCA to meet the costs of such repairs,
                    maintenance, improvements or other works.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     However it is important to emphasise, as I
                    have said above, that the HDB remains the lessor. Moneys that would have been
                    given to the HDB to maintain and upkeep these estates and buildings within the
                    Town Council are now given to the Town Council to do so. The HDB’s
                    interests are directly affected if a Town Council does not make payments into a
                    sinking fund resulting in a lack for funds for cyclical maintenance and
                    upgrading works. If Town Councils do not properly upkeep the estates and
                    buildings and allow decay and deterioration, it directly affects the
                    lessor’s property in the medium and longer term. It is therefore not
                    surprising that s 21(2) names the HDB as an entity that is entitled to take
                    action if a Town Council does not comply with its duties and obligations under
                    s 21(1).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     The second group specifically named in
                    s 21(2) is “any person for whose benefit, or for the benefit of
                    whose flat that requirement or duty is imposed on the Town Council”. On a
                    plain reading, bearing in mind the requirements and duties imposed on a Town
                    Council under s 21(1), (which includes compliance with s 35(<em>c</em>) and the TCFR), the persons for whose benefit such
                    requirements and duties are imposed on a Town Council are clearly the residents
                    of those towns, whether they own a flat (which is defined to include units for
                    the purpose of business) or not, and those persons who own a flat within the
                    town but might live elsewhere. The inclusion of the latter group is based on the
                    fact that these persons are liable to pay the S&amp;CC levied on the flat within
                    the Town Council and are correspondingly entitled to the benefits of that town
                    under the TCA. It is thus made clear that persons who are interested only as
                    flat owners are also entitled to avail themselves of s 21(2).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     However, to avail themselves of a right under
                    s 21(2) to bring an action against the Town Council, this person or group
                    of persons must be able to show that the breach they complain of was a duty or
                    requirement that was imposed on the Town Council for his or their
                    benefit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Ms Kam however, contends that “any
                    person for whose benefit … that requirement or duty is imposed” is
                    wide enough to include the MND. Ms Kam submits that under
                        s 21(1)(<em>f</em>), the Town Council has to
                    comply with the provisions of the TCA and the TCFR. Town Council moneys, which
                    include the grants-in-aid and S&amp;CC, are held by Town Councils for the
                    purposes of the TCA and for the benefit of residents in the town under the Town
                    Council’s purview and subject to the MND’s regulatory oversight. She
                    argues that Town Councils are therefore subject to a stringent statutory regime
                    of accountability to the MND and residents and the MND has a duty to ensure that
                    public funds are safeguarded at all times and that residents’ interests
                    are not compromised. The MND is thus a “person” for whose benefit
                    the requirements of s 35(<em>c</em>) of the TCA are
                    imposed on AHPETC so as to protect Town Council moneys in the interests of
                    residents and the MND.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     With respect, I cannot agree.
                    Section 21(2) clearly names one entity, the HDB, and a group, <em>viz</em>, any person for whose benefit, or for the benefit of
                    whose flat that requirement or duty is imposed on the Town Council. On a true
                    construction, the latter is read as one and not two independent groups. They
                    can, in one sense, refer to two groups of persons, but what they have in common
                    is the determining factor of staying within the town, whether they own a flat or
                    not, or owning a flat (which as noted earlier is defined to include a strata
                    unit for business) within the town but who may stay outside the town. If the
                    Minister or the MND was meant to be within s 21(2), nothing would have been
                    easier than to draft it so and to expressly include the Minister within
                    s 21(2). In contrast, the word “Minister” is used liberally
                    within other provisions of the TCA (see, <em>eg</em>, ss 9,
                    24I, 38, 42 and 43 of the TCA).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     If we go back to the intention of Parliament
                    when the Town Council Bill was proposed, it is clear that the responsibility of
                    running the Town Councils was laid squarely on the shoulders of the MPs of those
                    constituencies and their chosen Town Councillors. Self-management,
                    de-centralising local decision-making in respect of the HDB housing estates
                    within a town to Town Councils, the right to choose how they want to shape their
                    environment, what kind of additional facilities they want to put in and how well
                    they want to maintain their surroundings, were all matters in which they were
                    given the freedom to choose and with it came the responsibility therefor.
                    Mr Dhanabalan said: “The Members of Parliament and their appointed
                    councillors will be fully accountable to the residents for their actions and
                    decisions.” Mr Goh Chok Tong said this was because they were
                    responsible for “managing the social and physical environment of their
                    constituencies.” As noted above, one of the key philosophies was that
                    voters had to choose their MPs carefully as they would have to abide by the
                    consequences of their choice. Mr Goh Chok Tong also said: “If they
                    run their Town Councils efficiently, their constituencies will be safe, clean
                    and green. If they do not, they only have themselves to
                blame.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     This intention and philosophy behind the TCA
                    was further debated on 29 June 1988. The then Member of Parliament for Bo Wen
                    SMC asked what would happen in the event of errant town councillors and managers
                    and whether the HDB would step in to help if there is a need to do so.
                    Mr Dhanabalan’s reply was as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Member for Bo Wen made an important point. Who will monitor the Town
                        Councils and whether, in the course of monitoring, the Town Councils will be
                        closely controlled by the Government?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">That is not the intention. The intention is to give the Town Councils as
                        much latitude as possible for them to manage their areas. Broad principles,
                        of course, will have to be laid down, as the Bill itself now stipulates, in
                        terms of how they manage their finances, publication of accounts and so on.
                        But the Town Councils will be given a lot of latitude to employ the kind of
                        people who are necessary, to pay them the kind of fees that are necessary to
                        get the work done. The allowances for Chairman and for Town Councillors may
                        be prescribed by the Minister. But if the full-time workers, for example, if
                        the Chairman of a Town Council or a Town Councillor becomes a full-time
                        Councillor, then I think it is up to the Town Council to work out what is
                        necessary. We would not intervene in it. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">When the Town Councils are set up, the <em>whole
                            idea</em> is to <em>rest the responsibility of the
                            management of the funds as well as the estate with the Town
                            Council</em>. If a Town is mismanaged and HDB as the lessor finds
                        that it has to move in, <em>then there are provisions in the
                            law for HDB to move in.</em> But there is no question of the
                        Government coming in to bail the Town Council out, in the sense that if
                        funds are mis-spent, or if there is mismanagement, or people have lent to
                        Town Councils and these borrowings have been mis-spent and the lender cannot
                        recover, that the Government will come in and make good. If the Government
                        is going to stand here as a safety net, then that will only encourage more
                        mismanagement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… If they elect an MP who chooses a bunch of crooks to help
                        him and together they run through the coffers in no time and leave the
                        constituents in the lurch, well, they have to take the consequences. The
                        Government is not going to come in and say, “We will take over now
                        and make good all the losses.” At the time when the HDB comes in, of
                        course, whatever they collect from that point on will have to be used to
                        manage the constituency, to provide the services in the constituency. And
                        what has been mis-spent in the past, well, it is a loss. I think the
                        responsibility and the onus must be very clear, and very clearly laid on the
                        Chairman as well as on the Town Council as a whole. I think that is an
                        important principle that we should not deviate from. If the Government holds
                        out that this is an experiment, if you make a mess of it, we are going to
                        come in and pick up the pieces, then I think we are not going to start off
                        this whole project on the right basis. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     It is fairly clear from these speeches that
                    the intent of the TCA was to allow Town Councils latitude to operate and manage
                    their funds, operate with the necessary powers, impose the necessary duties,
                    obligations and requirements and to put in sufficient safeguards.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     The framing of the question by the then Member
                    of Parliament for Bo Wen SMC and the answer quoted above is telling. To the
                    question “Who will monitor the Town Councils and whether, in the course
                    of monitoring, the Town Councils will be closely controlled by the
                    Government?”, the Minister said: “That is not the
                    intention.” Hence, two other principles emerge. First, there is the
                    safeguard of the HDB moving in if it has to in the event of mismanagement. In
                    that event, the HDB will start to collect monies to manage and provide the
                    services in the constituency; what has been misspent in the past remains a loss,
                        <em>ie</em>, the HDB in stepping in is not going to
                    make good any losses suffered before it moved in. Hence if the S&amp;CC have to
                    be increased to make up for the loss, then the constituents have to bear that
                    increase. Secondly, if the funds are misspent, or mismanaged or the Town
                    Councillors turn rogue and run off with funds, there will be no bail-out by the
                    Government. The Government will not come in and make good the
                losses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     Given these principles of granting latitude to
                    Town Councils to run their towns with freedom subject to the requirements,
                    obligations and duties set out in the TCA, not closely controlling them and not
                    coming in to bail the constituents out in the event there is mismanagement or
                    defalcation, it is unlikely that Parliament had intended for the Government or
                    the MND to be able to take advantage of the remedy in s 21(2) of the
                    TCA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     There are other safeguards within the TCA. As
                    noted above, based on the Town Council’s accountability to its
                    constituents, s 21(2) of the TCA provides those with a direct interest the
                    right to come to court. Where there are breaches of a by-law, the owner or
                    tenant of a flat could apply to court for an order to enforce the performance of
                    or restrain the breach of any by-law or recover damages for loss or injury
                    arising out of the breach (see s 24(3) of the TCA). Where the Town Council
                    breaches ss 33(6)(<em>a</em>) or (<em>b</em>), then ss 33(6A) and (6B), which were introduced in
                    August 2008, provides for penal sanctions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     Another safeguard is found in s 50 of the
                    TCA which specifies two instances where the Minister is expressly empowered to
                    intervene. The first is where the Minister is satisfied that a Town Council has
                    failed to keep or maintain any part of the common property of any residential or
                    commercial property in the housing estates of the HDB within the town in a state
                    of good and serviceable repair or in a proper and clean condition. The second is
                    where any duty of a Town Council must be carried out urgently in order to remove
                    any imminent danger to the health or safety of residents of the housing estates
                    of the HDB within the town.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     Given this background and the statutory scheme
                    in the TCA and the TCFR, I find that the omission of the Minister in
                    s 21(2) of the TCA is intentional. The words “any person for whose
                    benefit … that requirement or duty is imposed on the Town Council”
                    does not and cannot include the Minister or the Government. The extent of the
                    MND’s intervention in the affairs of a Town Council under the TCA are
                    clearly delineated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     Ms Kam forcefully argues that reading the
                    MND out of “any person” under s 21(2) would lead to an
                    “absurd outcome”. She paints the following hypothetical to
                    illustrate her argument. Suppose an errant Town Council fails to make its
                    sinking fund transfers as required under r 4(2B) of the TCFR. A disgruntled
                    resident may then apply to the High Court under s 21(2) to compel the Town
                    Council to comply with its duty under r 4(2B). The court can, and will,
                    make an order compelling the Town Council to make the necessary transfers.
                    However, the Town Council will say it is unable to comply with the order because
                    the MND will not give them the grants-in-aid for the financial year. The MND
                    will in turn reply that it is more than willing to give the grants-in-aid, but
                    subject to such conditions (as permitted under s 42 of the TCA). The Town
                    Council may find these conditions unreasonable and refuse to accept them, thus
                    leaving us right where we began, <em>ie</em>, the necessary
                    sinking fund transfers are still not made. Ms Kam argues that this
                    “paper order” given by the court to the residents will not
                    “help the situation”. At the very worst, it is only the Town
                    Council’s officers that may be held in contempt. She submits that this is
                    what will occur should “person” under s 21(2) be “read
                    to exclude someone like the government in this case” and this is an
                    “absurd outcome”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     With respect, I do not see how excluding the
                    MND from taking advantage of s 21(2) will necessarily lead to an
                    “absurd outcome”. First, even if the MND was to come within
                    “any person” under s 21(2), there is no order or remedy that
                    the MND can seek that the HDB or a resident cannot already seek. For example, a
                    resident can equally seek the orders which the MND are currently seeking in this
                    OS (the appropriateness of such orders is discussed below at [145]–[152]).
                    In my view, reading “any person” to include the MND will not
                    “help the situation” either.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     Secondly, the outcome predicted by Ms Kam
                    may not be as “absurd” as she puts it. The Minister is entitled
                    under s 42 of the TCA to impose conditions on the grants-in-aid. If the
                    Town Council decides not to accept the conditions and the grants-in-aid are not
                    disbursed as a result, this is a decision of the Town Council that the
                    constituents of the Town will have to live with. This is consistent with what
                    was said by Mr Dhanabalan during the Second Reading of the Town Councils
                    Bill (at col 443), which I have quoted above and I set out again for
                    convenience:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is important that people realize that they have to live with the
                        consequences of their choice. If they elect an MP who chooses a bunch of
                        crooks to help him and together they run through the coffers in no time and
                        leave the constituents in the lurch, well, they have to take the
                        consequences. The Government is not going to come in and say, “We
                        will take over now and make good all the losses.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     While Mr Dhanabalan was speaking in
                    relation to a different situation where the Town Council’s officers have
                    gone rogue, the principle of his message is that residents must live with the
                    choices made by their Town Councils. Of course, if the Town Council is of the
                    view that the Minister is acting outside his powers or jurisdiction by imposing
                    such conditions, the Town Council is entitled to come before the courts to
                    challenge the conditions imposed by the Minister. But as noted above, whether
                    they will succeed or not will depend on the conditions imposed, the merits of
                    their case and the applicable principles of law. Short of that, the Town Council
                    will then have to find some other means of raising the funds to make the
                    necessary sinking fund transfers, or risk being held in contempt for
                    non-compliance of the court’s order. There is nothing absurd about such an
                    outcome. In the event that the sinking fund transfers remain unfulfilled, the
                    resident may then come to court to seek an alternative remedy, if any. It must
                    be remembered that under s 21(3) of the TCA, the court has the wide power
                    to make “such order as it thinks proper”. Depending on the
                    circumstances of the case, the court can tailor its order to achieve the most
                    appropriate and just outcome.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     I emphasise, however, that
                    Mr Dhanabalan’s statement above at [74] cannot, and must not, be
                    construed as indicating that a Town Council can breach the duties imposed on it
                    by the TCA with impunity, and remain only answerable to the electorate at the
                    next general elections, an outcome Mr Low submitted was inevitable in law.
                    While a constituent must live with the consequences of the choice he or she
                    made, it does not mean that a Town Council cannot be compelled by the court to
                    comply with its duties, and if it fails to do so, to be punished in accordance
                    with the law. Indeed, that is the whole point of provisions like ss 21(2),
                    33(6A) and 33(6B) of the TCA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     In any event, if a resident does not come
                    forward to bring an application under s 21(2) of the TCA or is unable to
                    show that the duty imposed on the Town Council was for his benefit or for the
                    benefit of his flat, the HDB can always do so. As mentioned above at
                    [58]–[59], s 21(2) provides that the HDB may apply to the High Court
                    to compel a Town Council to comply with <em>any</em> of its
                    duties under the TCA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     For completeness, I note that there are two
                    other statutes that contain similar provisions to ss 21(2) and (3) of the
                    TCA. The first is the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act
                    (Cap 30C, 2008 Rev Ed) (“BMSMA”). Section 88(3) provides
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Breaches of this Part</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3)  Where a requirement or duty is imposed on a management
                        corporation or subsidiary management corporation by this Part, any person
                        for whose benefit, or for the benefit of whose lot that requirement or duty
                        is imposed on the management corporation or subsidiary management
                        corporation, as the case may be, may apply to the court for an order
                        compelling the management corporation or subsidiary management corporation,
                        as the case may be, to carry out the requirement or perform the duty and, on
                        such an application being made, the court may make such order as it thinks
                        proper.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     The “Part” referred to in
                    s 88(3) refers to Part V of the BMSMA, which sets out the duties owed
                    by a management corporation, ranging from financial duties (such as mandatory
                    sinking fund transfers) to duties to maintain the common property. “Any
                    person” under s 88(3) of the BMSMA has been interpreted to include a
                    subsidiary proprietor (see <em>Management Corporation Strata
                        Title Plan No 1272 v Ocean Front Pte Ltd (Ssangyong Engineering and
                        Construction Co Ltd and others, third parties)</em> [1994] 3 SLR(R)
                    787 at [17], interpreting s 120 of the Land Titles (Strata) Act
                    (Cap 158, 1988 Rev Ed), the predecessor of s 88 of the BMSMA). In Teo
                    Keang Sood, <em>Strata Title in Singapore and Malaysia</em>
                    (LexisNexis, 4th Ed, 2012), the author opined that “any person”
                    under s 88(3) of the BMSMA would include “a tenant, resident or
                    occupier” (at p 274).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     The other statute is the HUDC Housing Estates
                    Act (Cap 131, 1985 Rev Ed) (“HUDCA”). Section 38(2)
                    provides that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Breaches of provisions of this Part</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)  Where a requirement or duty is imposed on the body
                        corporate or any person by this Part, any person for whose benefit, or for
                        the benefit of whose flat that requirement or duty is imposed on the body
                        corporate or first-mentioned person may apply to the court for an order
                        compelling the body corporate or that person to carry out the requirement or
                        perform the duty, as the case may be, and, on such an application being
                        made, the court may make such order as it thinks proper.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Section 38(2), however, has not been the subject of a
                        dispute before the court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     The commonality that runs through the TCA,
                    BMSMA and HUDCA is that they all deal with an entity that is independent of the
                    Government, and has been provided with certain powers, functions, duties and
                    responsibilities in relation to the common property of a particular estate (see
                    s 19 of the TCA, s 29 of the BMSMA and s 4 of the HUDCA).
                    Provisions such as s 21(2) of the TCA, s 88(3) of the BMSMA and
                    s 38(2) of the HUDCA are thus necessary in order to allow the constituents
                    of the estate to protect their interests. However, each statute must ultimately
                    be interpreted in accordance with its own purpose, structure and scheme. The
                    BMSMA and HUDCA thus provide little assistance in determining whether the MND
                    has the right to apply under s 21(2) of the TCA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     It remains for me to deal with the case of
                        <em>Attorney-General v Lee Kwai Hou Howard</em> [2015]
                    SGDC 114 (“<em>Lee Kwai Hou</em>”), which
                    Ms Kam tendered to the court via fax after the hearing for OS 250 and
                    SUM 1299 ended. The interpretation of “person” under
                    s 21(2) of the TCA is to be distinguished from the interpretation adopted
                    in <em>Lee Kwai Hou</em>. In <em>Lee Kwai
                        Hou</em>, the learned district judge had to consider the issue of
                    whether the word “person” under s 15(1) of the Protection
                    from Harassment Act 2014 (Act 17 of 2014) (“PHA”) included
                    the Ministry of Defence. Section 15(1) of the PHA provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>False statements of fact</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>15.</b>—(1) Where any statement of fact
                        about any person (referred to in this section as the subject) which is false
                        in any particular about the subject has been published by any means, the
                        subject may apply to the District Court for an order under
                        subsection (2) in respect of the statement complained of.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     The district judge found that the Government
                    is not precluded from taking out an application under s 15 of the PHA
                    because ss 3 and 36 of the GPA allows the Government to take advantage of
                    s 15(1) of the PHA, though not expressly named therein (at
                    [32]–[39]). More importantly, the district judge found that Parliament had
                    not intended for s 15(1) to apply to “natural persons” only
                    because “it would lead to a situation where companies and other
                    non-natural persons will be deprived of this remedy under section 15 of
                    [the PHA] to correct falsehoods about themselves” (at [40]). This
                    position was also confirmed by the Parliamentary Debates and there was no
                    contrary intention indicated in the PHA (at [41]–[43]). It is clear from
                    the district judge’s decision, and as I have alluded to above at
                    [52]–[53], that, in the final analysis, each statute must be interpreted
                    in its own context and according to what Parliament had intended. In contrast to
                        <em>Lee Kwai Hou</em>, for all the reasons I have
                    indicated above at [56]–[77], I find that Parliament had not intended for
                    “any person” under s 21(2) of the TCA to include the
                    Government. The TCA and the PHA have vastly different purposes—the former
                    is a statute which governs the relationship between the Government, the HDB, the
                    Town Councils and the residents, while the latter aims at protecting persons
                    that have been the subject of falsehoods and harassment. It is pursuant to this
                    latter purpose that s 15 of the PHA may be broad enough for the Government
                    to take advantage of (I use the word “may” because I stress that I
                    am not making any decision or finding as to the interpretation of s 15 of
                    the PHA). The same, however, cannot be said of s 21(2) of the TCA, which
                    carefully delineates which parties may take advantage of the remedy provided
                    therein.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     Nonetheless, for all the reasons set out
                    above, I am of the view that the MND does not have a right to make an
                    application under s 21(2) of the TCA for a court order compelling AHPETC to
                    comply with its duty under s 35(<em>c</em>) read with
                        s 21(1)(<em>f</em>) of the TCA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Applicability of the common law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     Before going into the other legal bases the
                    MND relies on, I address the issue of whether Parliament, through specifically
                    providing for certain limited remedies for breaches of the provisions of the
                    Act, intended to exclude the application of general common law or equitable
                    remedies for the same. This point was taken quite strongly by Mr Low and
                    Ms Kam also addressed it extensively.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     Mr Low’s argument, as I understand
                    it, is that the TCA clearly spells out the duties and responsibilities of a Town
                    Council, and specifically provides for what may be done and who may do it should
                    the Town Council breach its duties and responsibilities under the TCA. I have
                    already referred to some of the remedies encompassed within the TCA. If there is
                    a breach in any of the duties of the Town Council under s 21(1) of the TCA,
                    and this includes complying with the provisions of the TCA and the rules made
                    thereunder pursuant to s 21(1)(<em>f</em>), there is
                    the relief provided under s 21(2). If there are circumstances that require
                    the MND to intervene, such as the health or safety of the residents being
                    endangered or the common property of the Town is not kept in a state of good and
                    serviceable repair or in a proper and clean condition, the Minister has powers
                    under s 50 of the TCA to rectify the situation. Finally, if a Town Council
                    has contravened its duty not to disburse any moneys from the sinking fund and
                    the Town Council Fund other than for the purposes stipulated under s 33(6)
                    of the TCA, ss 33(6A) and (6B) provide for penal sanctions against that
                    Town Council and its officers. Mr Low argues that these statutory
                    provisions, when viewed in the light of the statements made by
                    Mr Dhanabalan during the Second Reading of the Town Councils Bill to the
                    effect that the Government will not bail a Town Council out in the event of
                    mismanagement and that residents must live with the consequences of their
                    choices, mean that there is therefore an exclusion of the application of general
                    common law remedies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     In response, Ms Kam relies on the case of
                        <em>Goldring Timothy Nicholas and others v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [2013] 3 SLR 487 (“<em>Goldring</em>”). In <em>Goldring</em>,
                    the Commercial Affairs Department had seized certain documents from a company
                    pursuant to an order under s 58 of the Criminal Procedure Code
                    (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed). The officers of the company (“the
                    applicants”) were subsequently charged for abetment by conspiracy to
                    cheat. Prior to the trial, the applicants applied for an order for production of
                    some of these documents on the basis that, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, there is a common law right of access to documents seized
                    by law enforcement authorities that an accused person had ownership or legal
                    custody or a legal right to control immediately before the lawful seizure. The
                    Prosecution argued that the criminal disclosure framework found in Part IX
                    of the Criminal Procedure Code 2010 (Act 15 of 2010) (“CPC
                    2010”) had curtailed the applicants’ common law right of access to
                    the documents prior to the applicants serving their Case for the Defence. In
                    rejecting the Prosecution’s argument, V K Rajah JA held that it is a
                    fundamental presumption of statutory interpretation that Parliament would not
                    have removed rights pre-existing in common law if there was no express provision
                    or clearly evinced intention to that effect. The learned judge found that the
                    Prosecution had not rebutted this presumption because, first, there was no
                    mention in the legislative debates of the common law right of access in relation
                    to the relevant documents, let alone how it was intended to be affected by the
                    CPC 2010; secondly, there was no provision in the CPC 2010 which were expressly
                    inconsistent with the common law right of access to the documents; and thirdly,
                    there was in fact positive signposts indicating why Parliament could not have
                    intended for the CPC 2010 to exclude or restrict an individual’s common
                    law right of access to the relevant documents (at
                [50]–[55]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     I entirely agree with the presumption of
                    statutory interpretation articulated by the learned judge in <em>Goldring</em>. Like the facts in <em>Goldring</em>, there was no reference made to the TCA being a
                    self-contained statute or to common law rights and remedies during the Second
                    Reading of the Town Councils Bill. There are only the statements made by
                    Mr Dhanabalan referred to at [65] above. These statements are equivocal and
                    do not clearly evince that Parliament had intended for the MND’s common
                    law rights and remedies, if any, to be curtailed. Mr Dhanabalan’s
                    statement as to the Government not bailing the Town Council out in the event
                    that funds are misspent or mismanaged could simply be referring to financial
                    bailout, <em>ie</em>, the Government will not be acting as
                    a guarantor for the Town Council. Mr Low also relies heavily on the current
                    Minister for National Development Mr Khaw Boon Wan’s recent statement
                    in Parliament that “the Town Councils Act deliberately takes a light
                    touch approach to regulation and enforcement” (<em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</em>
                    (12 February 2015) vol 93 (Khaw Boon Wan, Minister for National
                    Development and MP for Sembawang GRC)). With respect, the recent comments of the
                    current Minister in Parliament do not go very far in elucidating what Parliament
                    had intended <em>at the time</em> the Town Councils Bill
                    was passed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     Further, there are no provisions in the TCA
                    that are expressly inconsistent with other common law remedies continuing to
                    exist outside of the TCA. Section 21(2) of the TCA, which enables the HDB
                    or a constituent to apply for certain remedies when the duties stipulated in
                    s 21(1) have been breached or not complied with by the Town Council, can
                    operate in conjunction with common law rights and remedies. In <em>Diora-Ace Ltd and others v Management Corporation Strata Title Plan
                        No 3661 and another</em> [2015] SGHC 88, Hoo Sheau Peng JC
                    had to consider the question of whether a subsidiary proprietor could apply for
                    declaratory relief outside s 88 of the BMSMA. Section 88(3) of the
                    BMSMA (set out above at [77]) is similar to s 21(2) of the TCA. Hoo JC
                    held (at [40]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… s 88 of the BMSMA enables a subsidiary proprietor to
                        apply for certain remedies when a provision of Part V of the BMSMA has been
                        breached or not complied with. <em>However, there is nothing
                            within s 88 which suggests that the court only has jurisdiction to
                            hear disputes about the breaches of the BMSMA under the
                            provision.</em> It is also noteworthy that the provision does not
                        restrict the power of the court to order any relief. In the absence of
                        express wording, s 88 of the BMSMA does not oust the court’s
                        jurisdiction and powers under the SCJA and ROC to hear the dispute and order
                        the appropriate relief, including bare declaratory relief. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     Similarly, I find that there is nothing within
                    s 21(2) of the TCA which suggests that the court cannot hear disputes about
                    a Town Council’s breaches of the TCA that are brought outside of
                    s 21(2). I am reinforced in my view by s 58(3) of the TCA, a savings
                    provision which provides that “[n]othing in [the TCA] shall affect any
                    rights or remedies that the [HDB] or an owner or tenant of a flat in any
                    residential or commercial property may have in relation to the flat or the
                    common property … apart from [the TCA]”. Although s 58(3)
                    only applies to the HDB or an owner or tenant of a flat, it indicates that
                    Parliament was alive to the issue of common law rights and remedies and had
                    wanted to preserve it. Bearing in mind the statutory presumption in <em>Goldring</em>, if Parliament had wanted to exclude the
                    application of common law rights and remedies, it would have expressly provided
                    so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     The present case is also distinguishable from
                    situations such as those in <em>Tan Ah Tee and another
                        (administrators of the estate of Tan Kiam Poh (alias Tan Gna Chua),
                        deceased) v Lim Soo Foong</em> [2009] 3 SLR(R) 957 (“<em>Tan Ah Tee</em>”). In <em>Tan Ah
                        Tee</em>, one of the issues the court considered was whether the court
                    had the power to declare a marriage void due to lack of consent, which prior to
                    1981, rendered a purported marriage void. Judith Prakash J held that by
                    introducing s 105 of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 1997 Rev Ed),
                    which provided an exhaustive list of grounds on which a marriage may be declared
                    void, the operative words being “shall be void on the following grounds
                    only”, Parliament had intended to classify lack of valid consent as a
                    ground to hold a marriage <em>voidable</em> only. The court
                    is bound by this change in the law and no longer has the power to hold or
                    declare a marriage void on the basis of lack of valid consent (at
                    [38]–[39]). The learned judge further found a second reason for her
                    conclusion – that the Women’s Charter is a complete code on the law
                    of civil marriage in Singapore. Marriages celebrated in Singapore therefore
                    cannot be declared void on any ground that is not reflected in s 105 (at
                    [43]). In contrast, nowhere in the Parliamentary Debates leading up to the
                    passing of the Town Councils Bill has it been mentioned that the TCA was meant
                    to be a “complete code”. Neither does the TCA contain provisions
                    like s 105 of the Women’s Charter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     Lastly, I refer to some examples of statutes
                    (which Ms Kam has helpfully pointed me to) that have expressly abrogated
                    the application of common law rules. For example, s 8 of the Civil Law Act
                    (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed) (“CLA”) provides that the “rule
                    of law known as the rule in Bain v Fothergill is abolished in relation to
                    contracts made on or after 1st January 1999”. Another example is
                        s 47(1)(<em>c</em>) of the Land Titles Act
                    (Cap 157, 2004 Rev Ed), which provides that a person dealing with a
                    proprietor shall not be required “to be affected by notice (actual or
                    constructive) of any trust or other unregistered interest, <em>any rule of law or equity to the contrary
                    notwithstanding</em>” [emphasis added]. These are unequivocal
                    expressions that certain rules of the common law or equity are not to apply and
                    such expressions are not to be found in the TCA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     In summary, I am of the view that the TCA does
                    not exclude the application of common law rights and remedies. The more
                    important question, however, is what rights and remedies the MND is entitled to
                    in relation to the present case. I will now deal with the common law grounds
                    which the MND relies on.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Basis (a): Statutory mandate pursuant to the TCA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     The MND argues that it has “regulatory
                    oversight” of the TCA and, since AHPETC holds the Town Council Moneys for
                    the purposes of the TCA, the MND has an interest in ensuring that, first, Town
                    Council Moneys are correctly, properly and lawfully applied and, secondly, any
                    Town Council Moneys wrongfully paid out are recovered. The MND then goes on to
                    assert that it must thus have a remedy to require AHPETC to take appropriate
                    steps to safeguard Town Council Moneys and pursue recovery of any Town Council
                    Moneys wrongfully paid out.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     With respect, I do not agree. I have already
                    addressed the nature and purpose of Town Councils and I have referred to some of
                    the provisions in the TCA which provide specific remedies to particular entities
                    or persons. The word “oversight” means and connotes supervision or
                    superintendence, having charge or care of, control, management and direction
                    over something or body. That word is inapt to describe the relationship between
                    the Government and a Town Council. This was made very clear by the Parliamentary
                    Debates during the Second Reading of the Town Councils Bill.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     While it is true that a Town Council holds its
                    moneys for the purposes of the TCA and that the MND has some interest in a loose
                    sense in ensuring that a Town Council complies with its statutory duties, I am
                    of the view that this does not give rise to a <em>right</em> on the part of the MND to come to court to enforce a Town
                    Council’s duty <em>simpliciter</em>. Once the
                    grants-in-aid by the Government are made, how it is allocated and spent on the
                    various projects or purposes within the TCA is no longer under the control of
                    the Government but the Town Council. If more of the funds are spent on one type
                    of project like landscaping, instead of say sheltered walkways, that is up to
                    the Town Council. If the funds are embezzled or a criminal breach of trust has
                    occurred, then the full weight of the criminal law and its processes can be
                    brought to bear. If moneys are not set aside as prescribed under the Act, then
                    as noted above, the HDB or persons entitled to under s 21(2) can seek
                    redress, including seeking a mandatory order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     Ms Kam refers to ss 33(1), (2),
                        (6)(<em>b</em>), (6A) and (6B), 35, 36 and 38(1), (6),
                    (11), (13) and (14) of the TCA to show that the Minister has “regulatory
                        oversight”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> In
                    relation to the sub-sections Ms Kam relies on under s 33, there is no
                    mention of the Minister or the role that he is to play. All those provisions do
                    is mandate the constitution of the Town Council Fund and prescribe the purposes
                    for which the funds may be used. Section 35 similarly makes no mention of
                    the Minister. It simply sets out the duties of a Town Council in relation to its
                    accounts and finances. Section 36 provides for the duty of a Town Council
                    to prepare and submit its financial statements for the year to the AGO and it
                    too makes no mention of the Minister. Section 38 does, however, make
                    reference to the Minister. Under s 38(1), the accounts of the Town Council
                    is to be audited by the AGO or such other auditor as may be appointed by the
                    Minister in consultation with the AGO. Under s 38(6), the auditor is to
                    submit periodical and special reports to the Minister and the Town Council upon
                    any matter arising out of the audit. Section 38(11) states that the audited
                    financial statements are to be submitted to the Minister and displayed in
                    public. Sections 38(13) and (14) provide that the Minister is to be given a
                    copy of the audited financial statements and annual report and is to present
                    them in Parliament.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     While these provisions may show some semblance
                    of oversight by the Minister over the TCA, it is not oversight in the true
                    meaning of the word. Administratively asking for accounts to be submitted and
                    then presented to Parliament, with or without comment, is not
                    “oversight”. There are specific provisions like s 43 and
                    s 50 which set out instances when the Minister can intervene. However, such
                    functions and powers of the Minister under the TCA were meant to, in the words
                    of Professor Craig, “strike the balance between enabling the [M]inister
                    to fulfil his or her responsibilities to Parliament, and giving the public body
                    the desired degree of independence” (Paul Craig, <em>Administrative Law</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 7th Ed, 2012) at
                    p 85). Simply because the TCA delineates certain functions to the Minister
                    does not mean that the MND has an unfettered right to come to court to seek a
                    Town Council’s compliance with its duties. Ms Kam has not shown me a
                    single authority, other than the provisions of the TCA, in support of her
                    statutory mandate argument that the MND has a right to seek a remedy to require
                    a Town Council to comply with its duties under the TCA <em>simpliciter</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     I have already cited passages from the
                    Parliamentary Debates when the Town Councils Bill was presented in Parliament.
                    The whole tenor of the speeches showed a clear intention to transfer power from
                    the HDB to the MPs and Town Councillors. With that power came responsibility and
                    accountability to the constituents. If things went wrong then there would be no
                    bail out and no safety net provided by the Government. The constituents would
                    have to bear any loss or consequences in such an event. This philosophy behind
                    the Town Councils Bill does not sit well with the “statutory
                    oversight” argued for by Ms Kam. Specific safeguards were
                    articulated. Mr Dhanabalan said: “This Bill, therefore, has been
                    very thoroughly considered and it is not just something drafted by legal
                    draftsmen. It has the benefit of very high level consideration and the actual
                    experience that we have had so far in Ang Mo Kio” (Second Reading of the
                    Town Councils Bill at col 375).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    I have also already stated if there is
                    wrongdoing, then the state has powers of investigation and if warranted, to
                    bring criminal charges. However that is another matter altogether.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    I agree that it seems counterintuitive that
                    Town Councils have to comply with certain obligations and duties laid down in
                    the TCA and the TCFR and yet if it appears that there is non-compliance, and
                    public funds are involved, the MND, under whose administrative sphere Town
                    Councils fall, cannot bring an action such as this to appoint forensic
                    accountants to investigate the expenditure of such funds by a Town Council and
                    to recover any moneys which have been improperly paid or paid without proper
                    authority and approvals. However, as I have stated above, Town Councils were
                    created by statute, set up with specific aims and based on a philosophy that was
                    thought to be for the good of the country.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    Nonetheless, the MND strongly asserts that
                    it “would not comport with logic or justice if MND were to have no
                    remedy”. This may not necessarily be true and it suffices for me point to
                    the following instructive passages from H W R Wade and C F Forsyth, <em>Administrative Law</em> (Oxford University Press, 11th Ed,
                    2014) at pp 520–521:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The prerogative remedy of mandatory order has long provided the normal
                        means of enforcing the performance of public duties by public authorities of
                        all kinds. Like the other prerogative remedies, it is normally granted on
                        the application of a private litigant, though it may equally well be used by
                        one public authority against another. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Mandamus reached the zenith of its utility in the eighteenth century, when
                        as well as protecting the citizen it played a conspicuous part in the
                        machinery of government. It proved to be one of the few effective
                        instruments of public policy in the era between the abolition of the Star
                        Chamber in 1640 and the creation of the modern system of local government in
                        the nineteenth century. During that interregnum the business of
                        administration was mainly in the hands of local magistrates and other
                        authorities who enjoyed an extraordinary measure of independence. A mandamus
                        from the King’s Bench was virtually the only effective means of
                        forcing some such body to carry out its duties under common law or Acts of
                        Parliament. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The essence of a mandatory order is that it is a royal command, issued in
                        the name of the Crown from the Court of King’s Bench (now the
                        Queen’s Bench Division of the High Court), ordering the performance of
                        a public legal duty. … It has never lost the wide scope
                        which the courts gave it in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries,
                        when it was so vital a part of the mechanism of the state. But in the highly
                        organised administrative system of the modern state it has no longer this
                        prominent role to play. Governmental bodies today respond more naturally to
                        the political stimulus, and the ultimate legal sanction has to be invoked
                        only in a handful of stubborn cases.</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Basis (b): Beneficial interest under a Quistclose trust</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    The MND relies on the eponymous case of
                        <em>Barclays Bank Ltd v Quistclose Investments Ltd</em>
                    [1970] AC 567 (“the <em>Quistclose</em>
                    case”) and <em>Twinsectra Ltd v Yardley and
                        others</em> (“<em>Twinsectra</em>”)
                    [2002] 2 AC 164 for the proposition that it has a beneficial interest under a
                        <em>Quistclose</em> trust, which arises where a sum of
                    money is advanced with the mutual intention that it would be used for a specific
                    purpose.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    More specifically, the MND cites Lord
                    Wilberforce’s speech in the <em>Quistclose</em> case
                    (at 581–582), which in turn was cited with approval by Belinda Ang Saw
                    Ean J in <em>Pacific Rim Palm Oil Ltd v PT Asiatic Persada
                        and others</em> [2003] 4 SLR(R) 731 (at [17]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[W]hen the money is advanced, the lender acquires an equitable right to

                        question arises if a secondary purpose (i.e. repayment to the lender) has
                        been agreed, expressly or by implication: if it has, the remedies of equity
                        may be invoked to give effect to it … In the present case
                        the intention to create a secondary trust for the benefit of the lender, to

                        clear and I can find no reason why the law should not give effect to
                        it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    The MND also cites Lord Millett’s
                    speech in <em>Twinsectra</em> (at
                    [100]–[101]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">100    … the <em>Quistclose</em> trust [is] an entirely orthodox example of
                            the kind of default trust known as a resulting trust. The lender pays
                            the money to the borrower by way of loan, but he does not part with the
                            entire beneficial interest in the money, and in so far as he does not it
                            is held on a resulting trust for the lender from the
                            outset. … [I]t is the borrower
                            who … [is] obliged to apply it for the stated purpose
                            or return it. He has no beneficial interest in the money, which remains
                            throughout in the lender subject only to the borrower's power or duty to
                            apply the money in accordance with the lender's
                            instructions. …</p>

                            stated with sufficient clarity for the court to be able to determine
                            whether it is still capable of being carried out or whether the money
                            has been misapplied, it is sufficiently certain to be
                            enforced. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    Lord Wilberforce’s model in the
                        <em>Quistclose</em> case is inconsistent with Lord
                    Millett’s model in <em>Twinsectra</em>. Lord
                    Wilberforce envisaged two trusts (at 581–582): a primary trust, and a
                    secondary trust in favour of the donor if the primary trust fails. Lord Millett
                    (at [100]–[101]) propounded a model whereby there is only one trust in
                    favour of the donor, but that trust is subject to a power or duty to apply the
                    trust money in accordance with the donor’s stated purpose or instructions.
                    The differences between the two models are not merely jurisprudential in nature,
                    and have practical implications for when a <em>Quistclose</em> trust can be found.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">The nature of a <em>Quistclose</em>
                trust</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    Before embarking on the question of whether
                    there is an extant <em>Quistclose</em> trust, it is
                    necessary to first enquire into the nature of a <em>Quistclose</em> trust. No Singapore court has, as of yet,
                    definitively pronounced on this issue. <em>Pacific Rim</em>
                    cited both the <em>Quistclose</em> case (at
                    [16]–[17]) and <em>Twinsectra</em> (at [18]) but did
                    not endorse either model. <em>Singapore Tourism Board v
                        Children's Media Ltd and others</em> [2008] 3 SLR(R) 981
                        (“<em>STB</em>”) likewise cited both the
                        <em>Quistclose</em> case (at [88]) and <em>Twinsectra</em> (at [89]) without approving either model.
                        <em>Sitt Tatt Bhd v Goh Tai Hock</em> [2009] 2 SLR(R)
                    44 cited only the <em>Quistclose</em> case, but did not
                    consider which model was right and merely stated that balance money would be
                    held on a resulting trust for the funder (at [58]). <em>Tee Yok
                        Kiat and another v Pang Min Seng and another</em> [2012] SGHC 85 cited
                    both cases, but did not distinguish between the two models and stated that,
                    “on one view, at least, a <em>Quistclose</em> trust
                    may be rationalised as a resulting trust…” (at [28]; the Court of
                    Appeal in <em>Tee Yok Kiat v Pang Min Seng</em> [2013] SGCA
                    9 did not add to this analysis). <em>Aero-Gate Pte Ltd v Engen
                        Marine Engineering Pte Ltd</em> [2013] 4 SLR 409 noted that the
                    classification of the <em>Quistclose</em> trust within the
                    taxonomy of trusts is not free from controversy (at [58]), but did not take a
                    definitive view.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    In <em>Twinsectra</em>,
                    Lord Millett noted that Lord Wilberforce’s analysis in the <em>Quistclose</em> case had formidable difficulties and had
                    hitherto garnered little academic support. In particular, where the primary
                    trust is not for identifiable persons, but to carry out an abstract purpose,
                    there are uncertainties over where the beneficial interest lay pending the
                    application of the money for the stated purpose or the failure of the purpose
                    (at [79]). Lord Millett proceeded to analyse where the beneficial interest could
                    lie. It could not lie with the recipient, because if it were so vested, the
                    recipient would have unconditional use of the money (at [82]). It could not lie
                    with a contemplated beneficiary, because this cannot accommodate gifts and loans
                    for an abstract purpose (at [89]). The beneficial interest could not be in
                    suspense, because a resulting trust would arise to fill the gap and leave no
                    room for any part to be in suspense (at [92]). There are yet other difficulties.
                    If the primary trust were a pure purpose trust, it would be void <em>ab initio</em> due to the prohibition in <em>Morice v Bishop of Durham</em> (1805) 10 Ves Jr 522 against
                    non-charitable purpose trusts. If the primary trust is in favour of a
                    contemplated beneficiary, the primary trust would prevent any subsequent
                    variation of the arrangement between the donor and the recipient of funds
                    without the beneficiary’s consent; this is because the funds would belong
                    to that contemplated beneficiary in equity and it would be a breach of trust for
                    the funds to be used in a way that is inconsistent with that vested beneficial
                    interest (see Zhuang WenXiong, “The (<em>Quistclose</em>) Resulting Trust as a Proprietary Response to Unjust
                    Enrichment: A Bridge Too Far?” (2014) 26 SAcLJ 649 at para
                14).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    Lord Millett therefore concluded that the
                    beneficial interest is held on a resulting trust for the donor from the outset
                    (at [100]). Lord Millett’s model has been cited in preference to Lord
                    Wilberforce’s model in subsequent English cases (see, <em>eg</em>, <em>Freeman v HM Commissioners of Customs and
                        Excise</em> [2005] BCC 506 (“<em>Freeman</em>”) at [11]–[19]; <em>Challinor v Juliet Bellis &amp; Co and another</em> [2013] All ER (D)
                    6 (Mar) (“<em>Challinor</em>”) at [543]; and
                        <em>Bieber and others v Teathers Ltd (in
                        liquidation)</em> [2013] 1 BCLC 248 at [14]–[15]). On the weight
                    of both principle and authority, I am of the view that Lord Millett’s
                    model in <em>Twinsectra</em> should be adopted as the law
                    in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    There remain three loose ends to tie up.
                    First, although Lord Millett characterised the <em>Quistclose</em> trust as a resulting trust for the transferor with a
                    mandate to the transferee to apply the money for a stated purpose (<em>Twinsectra</em> at [92]), there is nothing in principle that
                    prevents the constitution of an express trust that operates in the same manner
                    as a resulting <em>Quistclose</em> trust. Lord Millett
                    himself said at [99]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… I do not think that subtle distinctions should be made between
                        “true”
                        <em>Quistclose</em> trusts and trusts which are merely
                        analogous to them … there is clearly a wide range of
                        situations in which … one party [has] a limited use of the
                        other’s money for a stated purpose, is not free to apply it for any
                        other purpose, and must return it if for any reason the purpose cannot be
                        carried out.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Indeed, in <em>Latimer and others v
                            Commissioner of Inland Revenue</em> [2004] 1 WLR 1466, the
                            <em>Quistclose</em> trust found “in favour
                        of the settlor is express; whereas it is more usually implied” (at
                        [41]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    Secondly, and with respect to <em>Quistclose</em> trusts, there is a marked distinction between
                    contract and trust. In all <em>Quistclose</em> trusts, only
                    the intention (or lack thereof) of the donor is relevant. In an express trust,
                    the donor’s intention is to constitute the legal recipient as trustee and
                    thereby impose the full panoply of duties incident to trusteeship (<em>Knight v Knight</em> (1840) 3 Beav 148 (“<em>Knight</em>”) at 172). This intention must be
                    sufficiently certain (<em>Knight</em> at 173). Resulting
                        <em>Quistclose</em> trusts arise in response to the
                    donor’s lack of intention to pass the entire beneficial interest to the
                    recipient (<em>Twinsectra</em> at [92] and [100]).
                    Contracts, in contrast, arise from the bilateral intentions of both the donor
                    and recipient and are subject to their own rules on formation. Thus a trust may
                    arise even if, on the facts, a contract does not. The facts of <em>Challinor</em> are particularly apposite. The second
                    defendant ran investment schemes that entitled investors to control special
                    purpose vehicles (“SPVs”). It was a common feature of the
                    investment schemes that the investors would rely on the solicitors advising the
                    SPVs to ensure that their subscription monies would not be released unless and
                    until the investors’ participation and control was safely arranged. The
                    first defendant was a firm of solicitors which so acted. The first defendant,
                    however, released investor monies before the claimants’ participation in
                    and control of one particular SPV was secured. The court declined to find that
                    there was a valid and enforceable escrow agreement between the
                    investor-claimants and the solicitor-defendant because, first, there was nothing
                    to signify any objective intention to establish a contractual relationship (at
                    [528]) and, secondly, there were no terms of sufficient certainty to found a
                    contract (at [530]). Despite this, the court found that a resulting <em>Quistclose</em> trust had arisen, as the solicitor-defendant
                    received the investor monies on terms that were sufficiently certain to negate
                    any intention that the monies were to belong beneficially to the second
                    defendant (at [554] and [561]–[563]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    Thirdly, for both express and resulting
                        <em>Quistclose</em> trusts, the certainties of subject
                    matter and objects must be present (<em>Knight</em> at
                    173). With regard to subject matter, a trust cannot be duly executed if it was
                    uncertain what property is or is not subject to the trust (see, <em>eg</em>, <em>Palmer v Simmonds</em>
                    (1854) 2 Drew 221). With regard to objects, the settlor of the <em>Quistclose</em> trust would certainly be a sufficiently
                    certain beneficiary. However the requirement for certainty of objects also
                    extends to the recipient’s power or duty to apply trust money for
                    stipulated purposes: this must be sufficiently certain for a court to determine
                    if the purposes are still capable of being carried out or if the money has been
                    misapplied (<em>Twinsectra</em> at [101]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    Bearing the above in mind, the propositions
                    of law which can be gleamed are as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_114-p2_a"></a>(a)     Whenever a donor transfers money to
                        a recipient for a specified purpose, a <em>Quistclose</em> trust may arise. In a <em>Quistclose</em> trust, the donor possesses the beneficial
                        interest in the money, but this is subject to a power or duty on the
                        recipient’s part to use the money for the specified purpose. If the
                        recipient is unwilling or unable to use the money for the specified purpose,
                        the money is to be returned to the donor. Such a trust may be either express
                        or resulting.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_114-p2_b"></a>(b)     For a <em>Quistclose</em> trust to arise, the twin
                        certainties of subject matter and objects must be present. In particular,
                        the purpose must be stated with sufficient clarity for a court to determine
                        if it is still capable of being carried out or if the money has been
                        misapplied.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_114-p2_c"></a>(c)     For an express <em>Quistclose</em> trust, the
                        settlor-donor must intend to constitute the recipient as a trustee, and
                        confer a power or duty on the recipient-trustee to apply the money
                        exclusively in accordance with the stated purpose.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_114-p2_d"></a>(d)     For a resulting <em>Quistclose</em> trust to arise, the donor must have a lack of
                        intention to part with the entire beneficial interest in the transferred
                        money. The recipient must not have free disposal of the money (<em>Twinsectra</em> at [73]) and must be under a power or
                        duty to apply the money exclusively in accordance with the stated purpose
                            (<em>Twinsectra</em> at [74]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">Is there an express or resulting <em>Quistclose</em> trust?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    Neither an express nor a resulting <em>Quistclose</em> trust arises on the facts. In my judgment,
                    there is insufficient certainty of intention to found an express <em>Quistclose</em> trust. Grants-in-aid were intended to be at
                    the disposal of AHPETC, albeit for the purposes set out in the TCA. However,
                    their freedom to allocate that sum on the very many kinds of projects with the
                    purposes set-out in the TCA, which can include a project that could be very
                    expensive with not much utility and on which not all their constituents would
                    agree upon, shows that no resulting <em>Quistclose</em>
                    trust can arise. In respect of objects, s 33(6) of the TCA would have no
                    bite whatsoever if AHPETC residents or the MND held beneficial ownership of
                    disbursed grants-in-aid. Further, in respect of subject matter, any <em>Quistclose</em> trust cannot extend to all monies held by
                    Town Councils.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">Insufficient certainty of intention to found express <em>Quistclose</em> trust</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    I deal first with certainty of intention. As
                    has been mentioned, s 42 of the TCA explicitly allows the Minister to
                    impose conditions on grants-in-aid. The MND sent letters accompanying the
                    grants-in-aid in 2011, 2012 and 2013. All these letters did not impose any
                    conditions, and merely set out the total amount payable to AHPETC based on fixed
                    quanta for different flat types, including adjustments for changes to the number
                    of dwelling units managed in the previous year.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    The lack of express documentary evidence is,
                    of course, not determinative of this issue; a trust may be inferred from the
                    surrounding circumstances and structure of the transactions. The AGC also relied
                    on the provisions of the TCA to found the requisite intention for the
                    constitution of a <em>Quistclose</em> trust.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    The starting point is that the courts have a
                    general disinclination to see the intricacies and doctrines connected with
                    trusts introduced into the non-familial context (<em>Neste Oy v
                        Lloyds Banks Plc</em> [1983] 2 Lloyds Rep 658 (“<em>Neste Oy</em>”) at 665; <em>Westdeutsche Bank Girozentrale v Islington London Borough
                        Council</em> [1996] AC 669 at 704–705). This is all the more so
                    where the government is concerned. The judgment of Megarry VC in <em>Tito and others v Waddell and others (No 2)</em> [1977] 1 Ch
                    106 (“<em>Tito</em>”) at 211 is instructive
                    in this regard:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">When it is alleged that the Crown is a trustee, an element which is of
                        especial importance consists of the governmental powers and obligations of
                        the Crown; for these readily provide an explanation which is an alternative
                        to a trust. … Another explanation can be that, without
                        holding the property on a true trust, the Crown is nevertheless
                        administering that property in the exercise of the Crown's governmental
                        functions. This latter possible explanation, which does not exist in the
                        case of an ordinary individual, makes it necessary to scrutinise with
                        greater care the words and circumstances which are alleged to impose a
                        trust.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>While the Town Council is not, <em>stricto
                            sensu</em>, a government body, it is nevertheless a special body
                        created by statute that carries out functions which were previously carried
                        out by the HDB, a statutory body which carries out government functions and
                        whose board members are appointed by the Minister (see s 6 of the
                        Housing and Development Act (Cap 129, 2004 Rev Ed)). Town Councils are
                        sufficiently analogous to the Crown in <em>Tito</em>
                        for heightened care to be warranted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    In the absence of an explicit term creating
                    a trust, the fact that funds were segregated has been held to be crucial to
                    constituting the funds as trust property (<em>Hinckley Singapore
                        Trading Pte Ltd v Sogo Department Stores (S) Pte Ltd (under judicial
                        management)</em> [2001] 3 SLR(R) 119 (“<em>Hinckley</em>”) at [22]). The converse proposition also holds
                    true: where an alleged trustee has the right to mix a fund with other funds,
                    this is incompatible with the existence of a trust relationship in regard to
                    that fund (<em>Hinckley</em> at [22], in turn citing
                    Slade J in <em>Re Bond Worth Ltd</em> [1980] Ch 228 at
                    261). Section 42 of the TCA is silent on whether grants-in-aid need to be
                    segregated. Section 33(1) of the TCA and r 3(1) of the TCFR mandate
                    the creation of separate funds for residential and commercial property while
                    s 33(4) of the TCA and r 4 of the TCFR mandate separate sinking funds.
                    However none of the foregoing provisions mandate the separation of grants-in-aid
                    from S&amp;CC. Grants-in-aid were in fact not segregated in special accounts:
                    the letters from the MND accompanying the grants in 2011 and 2013 state that
                    “[t]he Accountant-General has [been advised to credit a sum of money]
                    into your Town Council’s account” while the letter accompanying the
                    grant in 2012 states that “[t]he Accountant-General has credited [a sum
                    of money] into your Town Council’s account.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    More fundamentally a <em>Quistclose</em> trust does not arise simply because money is paid for
                    a particular purpose. As Lord Millett pointed out, commercial life would be
                    impossible if payments ordinarily create a trust (<em>Twinsectra</em> at [73]). Although those comments were made in the
                    context of the resulting <em>Quistclose</em> trust, the
                    position is <em>a fortiori</em> for express <em>Quistclose</em> trusts. Under s 42 of the TCA,
                    grants-in-aid are made “for the purposes of enabling a Town Council to
                    carry out its functions under this Act or any other Act.” But this is
                    neither here nor there. A purpose can be readily discerned for all payments: a
                    buyer could be said to pay money in advance to a seller for the purpose of
                    obtaining goods; a lender could be said to lend money to a borrower for the
                    purpose of earning interest. But, tellingly, we do not speak of express trusts
                    arising over the money in these sorts of situations; the default position is
                    that the recipient enjoys full beneficial ownership (see, <em>eg</em>, <em>In Re Stapylton Fletcher Ltd</em>
                    [1994] 1 WLR 1181 which concerned advance payment for undelivered wine). The
                    crux is the requisite intention to create an express trust by bifurcating the
                    legal and equitable interests, and imposing trust duties on the part of the
                    recipient to manage trust property on behalf of beneficiaries. It would be a
                    leap to infer all of this from the plain text of s 42 of the TCA. This is
                    all the more so where Town Councils, which carry out government functions
                    previously within the purview of the HDB, are concerned.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    There is therefore insufficient certainty of
                    intention to found an express <em>Quistclose</em>
                    trust.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">No absence of intention to part with entire beneficial interest to
                found resulting <em>Quistclose</em> trust</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    As I have already stated, there are two
                    starting points: the courts are reluctant to introduce equitable doctrines into
                    non-familial matters (at [118]); and commerce would be impossible if payments
                    ordinarily create a trust (at [120]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    The “intention” that is
                    relevant to the founding of a resulting <em>Quistclose</em>
                    trust is not an extant intention, but an absence of intention to pass the entire
                    beneficial interest to the recipient. A finding that there was an intention to
                    pass the entire beneficial interest would therefore foreclose a resulting
                        <em>Quistclose</em> trust from arising, and in this
                    regard “[t]he question in every case is whether the parties intended the
                    money to be at the free disposal of the recipient” (<em>Twinsectra</em> at [74]). Lord Millett in turn cited <em>In re Goldcorp Exchange Ltd</em> [1995] 1 AC 74
                        (“<em>Goldcorp</em>”) at 100, where Lord
                    Mustill said that “the moneys should not fall within the general fund of
                    the company’s assets but should be applied for a special designated
                    purpose”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    At the bottom-line, money is at the free
                    disposal of the recipient if it falls within the recipient’s general
                    funds; and if the money is to be applied for a special designated purpose it
                    cannot fall within the general funds.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    I have already pointed out that the TCA and
                    TCFR do not mandate the segregation of grants-in-aid; neither did the Minister
                    impose any conditions for the grants disbursed in 2011, 2012 and 2013 (above at
                    [119]). The grants-in-aid were in fact not segregated in special accounts and
                    were directly deposited into AHPETC’s general account. Upon mixture with a
                    pre-existing fund (which in all probability included S&amp;CC collected from its
                    constituents and funds from sources other than Government moneys), the
                    grants-in-aid were spent and the beneficial interest in the grants-in-aid passed
                    to AHPETC. The grants-in-aid were thus ultimately at the free disposal of
                    AHPETC. This raises the more fundamental point that the MND cannot assert a
                    beneficial interest over all the monies held by AHPETC to ground the relief
                    sought, a point I deal with more comprehensively later at
                    [134]–[136].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    It is true that AHPETC is constrained to
                    spend its general funds in accordance with the provisions in the TCA and TCFR.
                    Ms Kam contended that these provisions suffice to found the requisite
                    purpose. I have already said that all payments could in a sense be said to be
                    made with purposes in mind (at [120]). The facts of <em>Goldcorp</em> are particularly apposite, and demonstrate that purpose
                    cannot be looked at in isolation from free disposal. The eponymous company sold
                    unascertained bullion to the claimants for future delivery. Lord Mustill held
                    that a <em>Quistclose</em> trust did not arise despite the
                    fact that the claimants “paid the purchase price for one purpose alone,
                    namely to perform his side of the bargain under which he would in due course be
                    entitled to obtain delivery” because
                    “nothing … can be implied, which constrained in any way
                    the company’s freedom to spend the purchase money as it chose” (at
                    101). As I have noted above, the grants-in-aid were credited directly into
                    AHPETC’s general account and were immediately mixed into a pre-existing
                    pool of funds. The most that can be said is that the grants-in-aid were in fact
                    used for a purpose, that purpose being to increase the quantity of funds
                    available to AHPETC for it to discharge its duties under the TCA and TCFR. But,
                    analogous to the facts in <em>Goldcorp</em>, this purpose
                    is insufficient to found a <em>Quistclose</em>
                    trust.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    All the facts point towards the conclusion
                    that there was an intention to fully pass the beneficial interest to
                    AHPETC.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">The MND cannot be beneficial owners</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    Ms Kam also contended that the MND had
                    a beneficial interest in grants-in-aid disbursed. The TCA does not assist
                    Ms Kam. Section 33(6) of the TCA imposes limitations on the use of
                    funds: s 33(6)(<em>a</em>) states that moneys shall
                    not be disbursed from sinking funds otherwise than for what can be described
                    cyclical work with an as infrastructural element; while s 33(6)(<em>b</em>) states that moneys shall not be disbursed from the
                    Town Council Fund except for the purpose of exercising its powers or carrying
                    out its duties and functions or the payment of a fine. The duties of a Town
                    Council are in turn defined by s 21(1) of the TCA, and these largely
                    pertain to the maintenance of common property (with the exception of
                        s 21(1)(<em>f</em>) of the same, a catch-all
                    provision which mandates compliance with the provisions of the TCA and all rules
                    made thereunder). The benefits of carrying out major cyclical work and
                    maintaining common property redound to the benefit of town council residents
                    and, as noted above, to the HDB. It would be strange, to say the least, for the
                    MND to be said to be the beneficial owner if the proper administration and
                    expenditure of the aforementioned funds would directly benefit residents or the
                    HDB.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    However, holding that the residents are
                    beneficially entitled to the grants-in-aid would lead to a <em>reductio ad absurdum</em> due to the operation of the rule in
                        <em>Saunders v Vautier</em> (1841) 4 Beav 115. In
                    modern times, the rule in <em>Saunders v Vautier</em> has
                    been held to entail (<em>Goulding v James</em> [1997] 2 All
                    ER 239 at 247):</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    If all the residents of a Town Council were
                    to be the beneficial owners of grants-in-aid, they could theoretically come
                    together and call for the disbursement of the monies in contravention of the
                    listed purposes in s 33(6) of the TCA. Indeed, exactly the same problem
                    would arise if the MND were to be the beneficial owner of the
                    grants-in-aid.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    Quite apart from s 33(6) of the TCA,
                    the overall statutory scheme cannot countenance a <em>Saunders v
                        Vautier</em> call by either the MND or the Town Council residents.
                    Section 37 of the TCA mandates the public display of estimates not later
                    than one month before the end of each financial year whereby, amongst other
                    things, there is a projection of revenue. There are three revenue sources:
                    grants-in-aid, S&amp;CC, and interest (I leave to one side fund raised through
                    other means like community activities for obvious reasons). It stands to reason
                    that S&amp;CC rates are set with reference to the expected amount of
                    grants-in-aid that will be received.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132    Additionally, if either the MND or Town
                    Council residents were to be the beneficial owners of grants-in-aid, the
                    grants-in-aid would not be payable to the general creditors of a Town Council in
                    the event of insolvency, but to the beneficial owners. It is highly doubtful if
                    this was an intended outcome of the statutory scheme. Even outside of an actual
                    insolvency, the fact that general creditors would be subordinated to either the
                    MND or Town Council residents would adversely impact the creditworthiness of
                    Town Councils: this would also lead to the anomalous situation where S&amp;CC
                    funds would be payable to the general creditors, while grants-in-aid are not and
                    will be refunded to the government. If anything one would expect the situation
                    to be reversed, and for residents’ money to be refunded to them in the
                    event of insolvency.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a>133    The ineluctable conclusion is that AHPETC is
                    the beneficial owner of the grants-in-aid. There is therefore no bifurcation of
                    the legal and equitable interests, and no subsisting <em>Quistclose</em> trust. AHPETC has full legal and equitable ownership
                    over grants-in-aid, subject only to the express statutory requirements and
                    duties imposed by the TCA and TCFR.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">The subject matter of the <em>Quistclose</em>
                trust cannot extend to all Town Council monies</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a>134    The final obstacle to the existence of a
                        <em>Quistclose</em> trust is the fact that any such
                    trust would necessarily only extend to money transferred by the government, that
                    is, grants-in-aid, and not all monies held by AHPETC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_135"></a>135    This in itself would not be fatal if there
                    were a concomitant duty to segregate. But on the facts before me there is none,
                    and grants-in-aid were in fact not segregated (at [119]). This would lead to
                    grave difficulties over trust administration because money would have to be
                    followed into comingled funds. The beneficiary would be entitled to a
                    proportionate part of the comingled fund only if the comingling was unauthorised
                        (<em>Foskett v McKeown and others</em> [2001] 1 AC 102
                    at 130). If the comingling was authorised, the beneficiary’s proprietary
                    rights are extinguished and there is nothing to trace (<em>Space
                        Investments Ltd v Trust Co (Bahamas Ltd) and others</em> [1986] 1 WLR
                    1072).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_136"></a>136    The TCA and the TCFR do not prohibit the
                    comingling of grants-in-aid with S&amp;CC funds, and grants-in-aid were in fact
                    so comingled. Any <em>Quistclose</em> trust found must
                    countenance such comingling; it would be absurd to suggest that AHPETC had
                    committed a breach of trust merely by mixing grants-in-aid with S&amp;CC funds.
                    Any beneficial interest in grants-in-aid would pass to AHPETC once the
                    grants-in-aid are comingled with S&amp;CC funds and mixed funds from previous
                    years. Therefore, even if there were a <em>Quistclose</em>
                    trust, any beneficial interest in the grants-in-aid cannot be followed into
                    mixed funds. The MND cannot rely on any such <em>Quistclose</em> trust to appoint an independent accountant for all of
                    AHPETC’s funds.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Basis (c): Legal interest pursuant to a contractual mandate</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137"></a>137    Ms Kam also relies on <em>Conservative and Unionist Central Office v Burrell (Inspector of
                        Taxes)</em> [1982] WLR 522 (“<em>Burrell</em>”) for the proposition that it had a legal
                    interest in disbursed grants-in-aid pursuant to a contractual
                mandate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a>138    Ms Kam argues that the MND retains a
                    legal interest in the S&amp;CC grants disbursed to AHPETC, and as
                    recipient-agent, AHPETC owes a duty to act with due skill and care as would be
                    reasonably expected by an agent. With respect, I cannot agree. Such a mandate
                    does not arise. In the first place, grants-in-aid were disbursed unconditionally
                    by the MND (at [119]). It is true that this is not in itself conclusive, because
                    the use of the disbursed funds remains subject to the duties and conditions
                    imposed by the TCA. But I have already shown how Town Councils are unique legal
                    entities established by statute. The TCA is a comprehensive regime that
                        <em>inter alia</em> regulates the quadripartite
                    relationship between the Government, the Town Councils, its constituents within
                    the purview of those Town Councils and the HDB. Absent a transfer of money
                    accompanied by an explicit contractual mandate, any bilateral principal-agent
                    relationship rooted in the provisions of the TCA would be far too nebulous and
                    uncertain. Take for instance the s 21(1)(<em>f</em>)
                    duty to comply with the provisions of the TCA and the rules made thereunder.
                    Assuming that the town council owes that duty in the capacity of an agent, it is
                    not clear if the principal is the government or the residents of the town
                    council. Another example would be the s 19(1)(<em>aa</em>) power to deal with facilities outside of common property,
                    which expressly stipulates that the approval of the Minister and the consent of
                    the owner of the property is required. Again it is unclear if the principal is
                    the government or the owner of that property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a>139    There are also grave difficulties with the
                    very notion of a principal-agent relationship where the “agent”
                    has a mandate to spend a sum for stipulated purposes. An agent is oft defined as
                    one who has the capacity to directly affect the legal relations of his principal
                        <em>vis-à-vis</em> third parties (see, <em>eg</em>, <em>Scott and others v
                        Davis</em> (2000) 204 CLR 333 at [227], cited with approval in
                        <em>Fact 2006 Pte Ltd v First Alverstone Capital Ltd and
                        another</em> [2015] SGHCR 5 at [1]). The recipient in a <em>Burrell</em>-type situation does not have the capacity to
                    affect the legal relations of his principal in the classic sense, and would be
                    more accurately described as having the capacity to use the donor’s money
                    for stipulated purposes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_140"></a>140    Tellingly, Brightman LJ himself
                    admitted in <em>Burrell</em> that his discussion of
                    mandates was “all very remote and theoretical” (at 530), and
                    conceded that donors to the Conservative party would believe that they are
                    making out and out gifts. Emery has criticised the artificiality of the
                    analysis, and pointed out that title to the money remains with the donor. The
                    donor would find that he would need to pay taxes on his “gift”,
                    and he would be able to demand his money back at any time if it remains unspent
                    (C T Emery, “The Party Treasurer as Agent” (1983) NLJ 87 at
                    p 88).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_141"></a>141    I agree with Emery’s conclusion that
                    the government must be able to call for grants-in-aid back if it were to be
                    legal owner. But I have already explained how the general statutory scheme of
                    the TCA and s 33(6) of the TCA in particular must exclude the
                    government’s beneficial ownership of grants-in-aid; otherwise s 33(6)
                    would have no bite (at [130]) and s 37 estimates would be otiose (at
                    [131]). Analogously, the general statutory scheme of the TCA and s 33(6)
                    must exclude the government from retaining legal ownership of the
                    grants-in-aid.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_142"></a>142    Although not a major factor, it bears
                    mentioning that if title to the money remains with the Minister, one would
                    expect the Minister to be entitled to the interest earned from grants-in-aid
                    before they are spent. But this is not so. Rule 89(2) of the TCFR mandates
                    interest and investment income to be credited back to the respective funds from
                    which the principal or capital amount originated, rather than to a separate
                    account, while r 4(2B)(<em>a</em>) of the same
                    mandates interest to be transferred to sinking funds within one month from the
                    end of each quarter of each financial year (and comingled with <em>inter alia</em> interest earned from S&amp;CC
                funds).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_143"></a>143    It is also unlikely for grants-in-aid to
                    remain segregated: r 4(2B)(<em>a</em>) of the
                    Financial Rules mandates the transfer of S&amp;CC funds and grants-in-aid to
                    sinking funds within one month from the end of each quarter of each financial
                    year while r 89 of the same allows the investment of funds not required for
                    immediate use, without any requirement for segregating S&amp;CC funds from
                    grants-in-aid. Once a grant-in-aid is comingled with S&amp;CC funds, the
                    Minister would be unable to call for the comingled fund to be unscrambled for
                    his benefit (Burrell at 529H). I have already established that grants-in-aid
                    were in fact comingled with S&amp;CC funds and mixed funds from previous years.
                    Analogous to the analysis in the trust section above (at [134]-[136]), assuming
                        <em>arguendo</em> that the MND did have a legal
                    interest in grants-in-aid, any such legal interest would pass entirely to AHPETC
                    once the grants-in-aid are comingled with other funds. The MND cannot thereby
                    rely on a legal interest over the entirety of the AHPETC funds which are those
                    of a body corporate with perpetual succession (s 5 of the TCA), with a
                    power to borrow (s 40 of the TCA) and make investments (s 41 of the
                    TCA).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_144"></a>144    All of this indicates that the entire legal
                    interest in a grant-in-aid passes to the town council upon disbursement. It
                    would be implausible and artificial for the MND to retain a legal interest in
                    disbursed grants-in-aid.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Court’s power to appoint the IAs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_145"></a>145    Having addressed the various legal bases
                    upon which the MND has brought OS 250, it remains for me to deal with the
                    issue of the court’s power to appoint the IAs. Since parties have agreed
                    for me to decide both OS 250 and SUM 1299 at the same time, it is no
                    longer unnecessary for me to consider the issue of the Interim Independent
                    Accountants (under prayer 1 of SUM 1299). Any decision I make on
                    OS 250 will obviate the need for a decision on SUM 1299. I hence limit
                    my discussion to the appointment of the IAs only.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_146"></a>146    Ms Kam submits that the court has a
                    general power in equity to appoint a receiver, and since the powers envisaged
                    for the IAs are “limited, focused and less intrusive than those of a
                    receiver and manager”, the court must therefore, <em>a
                        fortiori</em>, have the power to appoint the IAs with the powers as
                        contemplated.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> Insofar as Ms Kam is
                    stating that the court has a general power to appoint a receiver with powers

                    Ms Kam is envisioning some other “independent officer” that
                    is not a receiver but exercises some of the powers that a receiver usually
                        enjoys,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> I am of the view that whatever requirements or
                    circumstances that must ordinarily be satisfied before the court will appoint a
                    receiver must similarly be satisfied presently for the court to appoint the IAs
                    as envisioned. In the case of <em>Don King Productions Inc v
                        Warren &amp; Ors</em> [2000] BCC 263 (“<em>Don
                        King</em>”) which Ms Kam relies on, Neuberger J had
                    appointed independent accountants to the partnership in dispute instead of
                    appointing a receiver. However, the learned judge first found on the facts that
                    it was an appropriate case to appoint a receiver before he saw fit to adopt the
                    regime of appointing independent accountants. It must be noted that in <em>Don King</em>, the regime of appointing independent
                    accountants was a proposal <em>by the defendants</em> to
                    avoid the appointment of a receiver. The learned judge then found that on
                    balance, the regime proposed by the defendant would be more appropriate than
                    appointing a receiver. In contrast, it is the MND in the present case that is
                    seeking to impose the IAs on AHPETC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_147"></a>147    I turn to the law on appointing receivers.
                    The jurisdiction of the court to appoint a receiver is contained in s 4(10)
                    of the CLA, which provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b><em>Injunctions and receivers granted or appointed by
                            interlocutory orders</em></b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(10)  A Mandatory Order or an injunction may be granted or a
                        receiver appointed by an interlocutory order of the court, either
                        unconditionally or upon such terms and conditions as the court thinks just,
                        in all cases in which it appears to the court to be just or convenient that
                        such order should be made.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_148"></a>148    I accept Ms Kam’s submission that
                    s 4(10) of the CLA does not limit the court’s power to appoint a
                    receiver only on an interlocutory basis.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> The
                    court has the power to appoint a receiver on both an interlocutory and final
                    basis. However, there are limits to when such a receiver may be appointed. In
                        <em>Channel Tunnel Group Ltd and Another v Balfour Beatty
                        Construction Ltd and Others</em> [1993] 2 WLR 262 (“<em>Channel Tunnel Group</em>”), the then House of Lords
                    had the occasion to consider s 37(1) of the Supreme Court Act 1981
                    (c 54) (UK), which is phrased in very similar language to s 4(10) of
                    the CLA. Section 37(1) of the Supreme Court Act 1981 (UK) reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Powers of High Court with respect to injunctions and
                            receivers.</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>37.</b>—(1) The High Court may by
                        order (whether interlocutory or final) grant an injunction or appoint a
                        receiver in all cases where it appears to the court to be just and
                        convenient to do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_149"></a>149    In <em>Channel Tunnel
                        Group</em>, Lord Mustill held at 284:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… Although the words of section 37(1) and its forebears are very
                        wide it is firmly established by a long history of judicial self-denial that
                        they are not to be taken at their face value and that their application is
                        subject to severe constraints. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Referring to a principle previously laid down by the House of
                        Lords in <em>Siskina (Owners of cargo lately laden on board)
                            v Distos Compania Naviera SA</em> [1979] AC 210, Lord Mustill went
                        on to hold at 285 that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… the right to an interlocutory injunction cannot exist in
                        isolation, but is always incidental to and dependent on the enforcement of a
                        substantive right, which usually although not invariably takes the shape of
                        a cause of action. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_150"></a>150    Although <em>Channel Tunnel
                        Group</em> dealt with an interlocutory injunction, the learned authors
                    in <em>Kerr &amp; Hunter on Receivers and
                        Administrators</em> (Sandra Frisby and Malcom Davis-White QC eds)
                    (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 19th Ed, 2010) are of the view that the limitation extends
                    equally to the appointment of receivers. They state at para 1-5:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The jurisdiction to appoint a receiver, like the
                        jurisdiction to grant an injunction, is only exercisable for the purpose of
                        protecting, or enforcing, a legal or equitable right, which will usually
                        need to be represented by, or identifiable as, a cause of action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_151"></a>151    In other words, the court’s power to
                    appoint a receiver is merely a remedy used to protect or enforce a legal or
                    equitable right, and is not a cause of action in itself (see <em>Bank of Commerce v Tanjung Petri Enterprise</em> [1992] 2 MLJ 322 and
                        <em>Suppiah Chettiar v Ong Pee Koi and Another</em>
                    [1951] MLJ 49). If the right to appoint a receiver is provided by statute, that
                    is another matter altogether. But the court cannot simply appoint a receiver
                    because it is “just or convenient”, “necessary” or
                    “in the interest of justice” to do so.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> In the present case, the legal or equitable
                    rights that the MND claims are their rights pursuant to a statutory mandate, a
                        <em>Quistclose</em> trust and a contractual mandate (as
                    indicated above at [39]). I have already dealt with these arguments above and
                    found that no such rights exist. Ms Kam has also not argued that AHPETC owed
                    fiduciary duties of any kind to the MND, which I find in any event is an
                    argument that will be difficult for Ms Kam to mount seriously. Accordingly, it
                    is not open to the court to appoint a receiver or the IAs as
                envisioned.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_152"></a>152    I make some observations about <em>The City of Sunderland v PS (by her litigation friend the Official
                        Solicitor) and another</em> [2007] EWHC 263 (Fam) (“<em>City of Sunderland</em>”), another case relied on by
                    Ms Kam. In <em>City of Sunderland</em>, an elderly
                    lady, PS, lost the mental capacity to manage her financial affairs. The Official
                    Solicitor, who was PS’s litigation friend, sought the appointment of a
                    receiver to manage PS’s property for fear that they would be dissipated by
                    CA, PS’s daughter, who had practical control of the property. The court,
                    in the exercise of its inherent jurisdiction with respect to incapacitated or
                    vulnerable adults, appointed the receiver. The court held at [31] that it should
                    do so because it was the most appropriate way of protecting the incapacitated
                    adult’s interest and promoting his welfare. It would appear from <em>City of Sunderland</em> that there was no property in dispute
                    or any legal or equitable rights being protected or enforced, yet the court went
                    on to appoint a receiver. However, <em>City of
                        Sunderland</em> deals with a very exceptional circumstance where the
                    court was exercising its “‘protective jurisdiction’ in
                    relation to vulnerable adults just as it does in relation to wards of
                    court” (at [12]). It is only in the exercise of this protective
                    jurisdiction that the court finds that it has “no limits to [its]
                    powers” (at [15]). The same jurisdiction, however, is not being exercised
                    in the present case and I am not prepared to extend it. Furthermore, the
                    situation is not as dire in the present case as it is in <em>City
                        of Sunderland</em>. In that case, the elderly lady was at the mercy of
                    her daughter who had control over her property and there was no one that could
                    have done anything about it. In contrast, AHPETC owe duties under the TCA to
                    manage its funds properly, and there is an existing regime under the TCA to
                    ensure that AHPETC complies with its duties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_153"></a>153    Accordingly, I dismiss the second part of
                    prayer 3(b) and prayers 3(c)–(h).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Prayers 1 and 2</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_154"></a>154    The MND premises their entitlement to
                    prayers 1 and 2 on the MND having a “statutory, legal and beneficial
                    interest in the Town Council Moneys”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> Since I have
                    found that the MND has not established any of its legal bases, I dismiss prayers
                    1 and 2.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Prayer 2A</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_155"></a>155    Under prayer 2A, the MND seeks a bare
                    declaration that AHPETC has not complied with r 4(2B)(<em>a</em>) of the TCFR because AHPETC has either failed to make timely
                    transfers or any transfers to its sinking funds account. Pursuant to
                        r 4(2B)(<em>a</em>) of the TCFR, AHPETC was
                    supposed to make four quarterly transfers to the sinking funds bank account for
                    FY14/15. The four quarterly transfers were to have taken place on 31 July
                    2014, 31 October 2014, 31 January 2015 and 31 April 2015
                    respectively. The first transfer of approximately $4,413,692.83 that was due on
                    31 July 2014 was only made on 6 November 2014.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> The second transfer of approximately
                    $4,372,905.54 that was due on 31 October 2014 was only made on
                    11 February 2015.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> Both transfers were hence more than three
                    months late. The third and fourth transfers that were due on 31 January
                    2015 and 31 April 2015 have not been made to date. AHPETC does not dispute
                    any of these facts. AHPETC argues that it informed the MND on 30 July 2014
                    that it was unable to make the first transfer on time due to the grants-in-aid
                    being withheld by the MND. I have noted above that the MND had informed AHPETC
                    that the MND was willing to consider releasing half of the FY 14/15
                    grants-in-aids, subject to conditions. However, AHPETC never accepted this
                    offer. If AHPETC has anyone to blame for failing to make the transfers on time,
                    it was itself.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_156"></a>156    Against the backdrop of these undisputed
                    facts, it is curious that Ms Lim made the following statement in Parliament
                    on 12 February 2015, just one day after it made the late second transfer
                    and 12 days after the third transfer was due:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Town Council accepts that it should have transferred the full amounts
                        due to the sinking funds each quarter and should have paid sinking fund
                        expenses directly from the sinking fund accounts. <em>We have
                            taken steps and made good the transfers. For [FY 11/12] and [FY 12/13],
                            the necessary transfers have been done. We have also done the transfers
                            for [FY 13/14] and have been making transfers for [FY
                        14/15]</em>. … [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_157"></a>157    Ms Lim, however, insists that her
                    statement in Parliament on 12 February 2015 was “true and
                    correct”. While it may be “true and correct” that AHPETC
                    had been making transfers for FY 14/15 (since they have made two out of the four
                    transfers for that financial year), Ms Lim failed to mention that both of
                    these transfers were late, one of which was only made the day before her said
                    statement in Parliament. She also failed to mention that the third transfer was
                    already due at that time but AHPETC has yet to make it. I find the Latin phrase
                        <em>suppressio veri, suggestio falsi</em> (suppression
                    of the truth is equivalent to the suggestion of what is false) particularly apt
                    to this statement of Ms Lim’s.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_158"></a>158    Despite the above facts, the court’s
                    power to make a binding declaration under O 15 r 16 of the Rules of
                    Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) is discretionary in nature. The
                    court need not in all cases where a declaration is asked for, if it finds the
                    facts on which the application is based to be correct, grant the declaration
                    requested. Specifically, the court will not make a binding declaration if it
                    “would not give [the plaintiff] ‘relief’ in any real sense,
                        <em>ie</em> relieve him from any liability or
                    disadvantage or difficulty” (<em>Salijah bte Ab Latef v
                        Mohd Irwan bin Abdullah Teo</em> [1995] 3 SLR(R) 233 at [17]).
                    Further, the court will also not grant a binding declaration if the declaration
                    will not serve any useful or practical purpose (<em>Latham Scott
                        v Credit Suisse First Boston</em> [2000] 2 SLR(R) 30 at [74]). Having
                    dismissed prayers 1, 2 and 3 of OS 250, I fail to see how the declaration
                    in prayer 2A will serve any useful purpose to the MND. AHPETC has also
                    accepted that the first two quarterly sinking fund transfers for FY 14/15 were
                    late and that the last two quarterly transfers have not been made. Additionally,
                    Ms Kam has not pointed out any such purpose to me. I therefore make no
                    order as to prayer 2A.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Prayers 4, 5, 6 and 7</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_159"></a>159    The remaining prayers are consequential
                    prayers and I dismiss them accordingly.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_160"></a>160    It is clear that there are grave and serious
                    questions that have been raised regarding the state of AHPETC’s accounts
                    and the validity and propriety of payments previously made by AHPETC to related
                    parties or otherwise. There have also been numerous breaches of the provisions
                    of the TCA and the TCFR. If AHPETC was a managing corporation subject to the
                    BMSMA, I have no doubt that AHPETC or its officers will be exposed to the
                    possibility of civil liability (under ss 88(1) and (2) of the BMSMA) or, in
                    an extreme scenario, criminal liability (for example, under s 60 of the
                    BMSMA). I can only say it is a travesty for AHPETC to have ignored their duties
                    and obligations imposed on them by the TCA and TCFR. They owe a duty and a heavy
                    responsibility to their constituents to run AHPETC properly and it is incumbent
                    on them to put their house and finances in order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_161"></a>161    Nevertheless, for the reasons set out above
                    I am unable to grant the prayers that the MND is seeking. I emphasise, <em>ex abundanti cautela</em>, that nothing I have held in this
                    judgment can be the basis for any form of estoppel against any resident or the
                    HDB from bringing an action against AHPETC if they wish to do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_162"></a>162    I will hear the parties on
                costs.</p>
