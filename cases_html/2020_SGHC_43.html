The Plaintiff, Chan Chi Cheong, seeks to retire pursuant to s 40 of the Trustees Act (Cap 337, 2005 Rev Ed) (“Trustees Act”). This provision sets out several conditions to be fulfilled before a trustee who is desirous of being discharged from the trust may do so. For instance, the instrument of discharge must be by deed, and have the other trustees’ consent by deed to the discharge. The Defendant, Chan Yun Cheong, on the other hand, seeks to resign in accordance with Clause 3 of the trust instrument (“Clause 3”), which contains far less onerous requirements than s 40 of the Trustees Act. The novel and pivotal issue is whether a trustee who seeks to be discharged from a trust must comply with s 40 of the Trustees Act or the trust instrument. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background facts </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The trust instrument, under which the Plaintiff and Defendant were appointed as trustees, is a Will dated 5 February 1947 (the “Will”) belonging to Chan Wing alias Chan Min Sang alias Chan Chung Sui alias Chan Chun Wing (the “Testator”). The Testator passed away on 27 February 1947. By his Will, the Testator appointed his sons, Chan Hin Cheung, Chan Tak Cheung, Chan Kat Cheung, Chan Ting Cheung and Chan Sze Chuen, to act as executors and trustees of his estate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The Will was attested in The Supreme Court of Kuala Lumpur, Federation of Malaya in Petition No. 628 of 1947. Probate of the Will was granted on 1 December 1947 to all of the Testator’s sons, save for Chan Sze Chuen (collectively, the “Original Trustees”). Thereafter, the Grant of Probate of the Will was resealed in The Colony of Singapore in Probate No. 374 of 1949 on 18 August 1949. This was done on the petition of Chan Hin Cheung and Chan Tak Cheung.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4  Since the grant of probate, a series of Deeds of Appointments and Retirements of trustees have been executed. By way of background, the particulars of the appointments and the events giving rise to them are as follows:

The Defendant cannot resign by letter of resignation as that is contrary to s 40(1) of the Trustees Act.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Secondly, the Defendant can only resign if a new trustee is appointed to take his place.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Thirdly, any resignation has to be accompanied by a transfer of property held by the retiring trustee to the new trustee. Such a transfer cannot be effected by way of a letter of resignation and no other method has been relied upon by the Defendant.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Fourthly, the provisions of the Will only make sense when read with s 40 of the Trustees Act, particularly when the Will is silent as to matters such as the mode of resignation, whether the consent of the other trustees should be obtained, whether the trust assets should be transferred to the continuing trustees and whether there should be at least two remaining trustees. The Defendant can only be discharged or resign in accordance with s 40 of the Trustees Act.

A trustee can resign without any formalities. The resignation neither has to be in the form of a deed nor with the consent of the other trustees.

</div>
</div>
</div> It is on this basis that the Defendant argues that his Letter of Resignation sufficiently fulfils the disagreement requirement under Clause 3.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Clause 3 may be contrasted against s 40 of the Trustees Act, which provides:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Retirement of trustee without a new appointment </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">40.</span>—(1) Where a trustee is desirous of being discharged from the trust, and after his discharge there will be either a trust corporation or at least 2 individuals to act as trustees to perform the trust, then — </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) if such trustee by deed declares that he is desirous of being discharged from the trust; and </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) if his co-trustees and such other person, if any, as is empowered to appoint trustees, by deed consent to the discharge of the trustee, and to the vesting in the co-trustees alone of the trust property, </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">the trustee desirous of being discharged shall be deemed to have retired from the trust, and shall, by the deed, be discharged therefrom under this Act, without any new trustee being appointed in his place. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) Any assurance or thing requisite for vesting the trust property in the continuing trustees alone shall be executed or done.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 These requirements under s 40 of the Trustees Act are far more onerous than those under Clause 3. Pursuant to this section, any trustee seeking to retire without appointing a replacement has to comply with the following. Firstly, there are at least two remaining trustees or a trust corporation after his discharge. Secondly, this discharge is done by way of a deed. Lastly, the consent of the remaining co-trustees, or persons empowered to appoint trustees, is obtained by way of deed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 It is, thus, unsurprising that the Defendant seeks to argue that he is only required to meet the requirements under Clause 3. The question that, therefore, arises is whether s 40 of the Trustees Act, which sets out inflexible mandatory requirements for a trustee to be discharged, can be substituted by a differing and simpler provision under Clause 3. Alternatively, can the court agree with the Defendant’s submissions that the Letter of Resignation and Deed of Retirement are both acceptable and valid?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 The starting point for the inquiry is to look at the scope of application of the Trustees Act to a trust instrument.

Specifically, s 2 of the Trustees Act replicates s 69(2) of the UK Trustee Act 1925, which was a unique provision specifically inserted by the draftsman at that time. This is summarised in <span class="font-italic">Underhill and Hayton</span> at paras 70.7 and 70.8:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">70.7</span> The Trustee Act 1925 was stated in terms to be ‘An Act consolidating certain enactments relating to trustees in England and Wales’ (eg Trustee Act 1893, Law of Property Act 1922, Law of Property Amendment Act 1924), so as to simplify the Parliamentary procedure…Parliament’s intention was not to change the law.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">70.8</span> However, the draftsman in his consolidation exercise boldly inserted a <span class="font-italic">general </span>contrary intention provision at the end of the 1925 Act in s 69(2):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">‘The powers conferred by this Act on trustees are in addition to the powers conferred by the instrument, if any, creating the trust, but those powers, unless otherwise stated, apply if and so far only as a contrary intention is not expressed in the instrument, if any, creating the trust, and have effect subject to the terms of that instrument…’</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Implications of s 2 of the Trustees Act on Clause 3</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Section 2(1) of the Trustees Act unambiguously states that the Trustees Act “shall apply to trusts including, so far as this Act applies thereto, executorships and administratorships constituted or created either before, on or after 1st September 1929.” Section 2(1) of the Trustees Act applies to the trust instrument in this case as the Will cum trust instrument was made and executed on 5 February 1947. Hence, s 2(1) clearly seeks to import provisions from the Trustees Act into trust instruments. This is to augment the trust instrument so as to ensure that the interests of the trust estate, beneficiaries and the trustees are adequately addressed, provided the imported provision does not contradict any provision of the trust instrument. However, this relates only to the powers conferred by the Trustees Act on the trustees. I shall now deal with the various issues pertaining to the applicability of the Trustees Act to this case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Whether s 40 of the Trustees Act confers a power on the trustees</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Under the Trustees Act, trustees are conferred a wide range of powers. Part III of the Trustees Act, in particular, sets out the “General Powers of Trustees and Personal Representatives”. The powers under Part III span from powers to insure (s 21) to powers of advancement (s 34). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 I note that s 40 falls under Part IV (relating to Appointment and Discharge of Trustees) and not Part III of the Trustees Act. However, the position of the various sections are, strictly speaking, not determinative of whether that section constitutes a power. This is because the powers conferred upon trustees under the Trustees Act are not contained exclusively in Part III. For instance, the power to appoint new or additional trustees is provided for in s 37 of the Trustees Act, which incidentally also falls within Part IV of the Trustees Act.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 In <span class="font-italic">Leo Teng Choy v Leo Teng Kit and others </span>[2000] 3 SLR(R) 636, the Court of Appeal held that s 56 was not subject to s 2(2) of the Trustees Act (Cap 337, 1999 Rev Ed). In doing so, the court stated at [22] that: “[i]t is significant to note that s 56 falls under Pt V of the Act, intitled [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] “Powers of Court” whereas Pt III is intitled [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] “General Powers of Trustees and Personal Representatives.” However, the reason why the court held that s 2(2) did not operate on s 56(1) was because s 56(1) conferred powers <span class="font-italic">on the court</span> and not on trustees. Therefore, the placement of the particular provision does not necessarily determine whether it deals with the power of the trustee which is subject to the general contrary intention requirement in s 2(2) of the Trustees Act. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 This issue was also dealt with in <span class="font-italic">London Regional Transport Pension Fund Trust</span><span class="font-italic">ee Co Ltd v Hatt </span>[1993] PLR 227 (“<span class="font-italic">Hatt</span>”). In that case, it was held that s 37(1) of the UK Trustee Act 1925, which is <span class="font-italic">in pari materia </span>to s 38(1) of the Trustees Act, was susceptible to contrary intention in a trust instrument. This was as a result of the application of s 69(2) of the UK Trustee Act 1925, which is <span class="font-italic">in pari materia </span>to s 2(2) of the Trustees Act, as discussed above at [33]. Relying on the logic in <span class="font-italic">Hatt</span>, the authors in <span class="font-italic">Underhill and Hayton</span> argue at para 70.13 that s 39 of the UK Trustee Act 1925 (the equivalent of s 40 of the Trustees Act) would also fall within the definition under s 69(2) of the UK Trustee Act 1925:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It would seem that the <span class="font-italic">power to obtain his discharge without appointment of a successor is one of the powers conferred on trustees</span> which under s 69(2) of the Trustee Act 1925 yield to the express terms of the settlement, …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 I agree with the position put forth by the authors of <span class="font-italic">Underhill and Hayton</span> in the above quote. Section 40 of the Trustees Act confers the power on the trustee to obtain a discharge, without having to appoint a successor, provided there are at least two remaining trustees. Although s 40 of the Trustees Act is not expressly titled as a power, it very much fulfils the same purpose as other power-conferring provisions. I, therefore, find that s 40 falls within the definition of “powers conferred … on trustees” under s 2(2) of the Trustees Act. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Whether s 40 of the Trustees Act is contrary to the Will</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 What constitutes a “contrary intention” under s 2(2) of the Trustees Act? This very question was answered by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Rajabali Jumabhoy and others v Ameerali R Jumabhoy and others </span>[1998] 2 SLR(R) 434 (“<span class="font-italic">Raj</span><span class="font-italic">abali Jumabhoy </span>(CA)”) at [60]–[64]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">60  In the case of <span class="font-italic">In re Warren</span> [1939] Ch 684 the testator, by his will in 1880, directed the trustees to invest his residuary estate in certain American securities and to appropriate those securities to the value of £35,000 for the purpose of certain legacy. The public trustee was subsequently appointed a trustee of the testator’s will and the deed set out a list of investments for the trust fund which were not expressly authorised under the will. The trustee therefore sought directions from the court as to the investment of money arising out of the testator’s estate, and the question was whether the investment clause in the will amounted to a “contrary intention”, such that s 1 of the Trustees Act 1925 which gave to the trustees powers of investment under the Act would not apply. Simonds J drew reference to the previous Trustee Act (<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>the Trustee Act 1893) which prevented trustees from investing under the Act, if it was “expressly forbidden by the [trust] instrument” and held, at 688: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The 1925 Act was intended to be a consolidating Act, and, though it contains some new provisions, it would be strange if there were any serious departure from the 1893 Act: <span class="font-italic">Re Turner’s Will Trusts</span> [1937] Ch 15. The principle that a consolidating Act is not intended to alter the law is applicable here. It is inconceivable that the Legislature intended to depart, as to investment, from the position under the 1893 Act. I am therefore bound to give to the words ‘contrary intention’ in the Trustee Act 1925 s 69(2) the same force as that given to the words ‘unless expressly forbidden’ contained in the 1893 Act. Accordingly, I have here a direction that the trustee shall invest in certain specified investments, but no prohibition against other investments. It follows, in my judgment, that the Public Trustee has power to invest the fund in any of the investments authorized by the 1925 Act. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">61 What emerged from <span class="font-italic">In re Warren</span> was that “contrary intention” was being construed to mean “unless expressly forbidden”, having regard to the earlier Trustees Act governing trustees’ powers of investments. Since that decision, however, several other English authorities have taken a more liberal approach to construing the expression “contrary intention”. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">62  In <span class="font-italic">Inland Revenue Commissioners v Bernstein</span> [1961] Ch 399, the Court of Appeal held that the terms of the trust which expressly provided for accumulation of income during the life of the settlor showed an intention which was in conflict with the powers of advancement under s 32(1) of the Trustees Act 1925, and that in considering the applicability of s 69(2) (identical with s 2(2) of our Trustees Act) it was not required that the statutory powers of advancement should be expressly excluded. The statutory power would be inapplicable if, on a fair reading of the trust instrument, it could be said that the application of the statutory powers would be inconsistent with the purport of the instrument. Lord Evershed MR said, at 412–413:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Section 69(2), which I have read, uses the language ‘so far only as a contrary intention is not expressed in the instrument … creating the trust,’ though those words are followed by this later phrase ‘and have effect subject to the terms of that instrument.’ At a first reading of the subsection it might seem that in order to exclude the power of advancement there would have to be an express exclusion or something equivalent thereto. But Mr Bathurst for the Crown has not here contended that the section requires anything so positive in expression. He has conceded (and for reasons which will in a moment appear, I think, if I may say so, rightly conceded) that it suffices to make the statutory power of s 32 inapplicable if, on a fair reading of the instrument in question, one can say that such application would be inconsistent with the purport of the instrument.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">63  In <span class="font-italic">In re Evans’s Settlement</span> [1967] 1 WLR 1294, the settlor by a settlement made in 1946 directed the trust fund to be paid to his wife for life and subject thereto the trust fund was to be held in equal shares for the two children of the marriage if living at the wife’s death. The settlement contained express powers for raising funds for the benefit of the wife and children. By cl 7 the trustees were empowered to raise a sum not exceeding £5,000 for the benefit of the wife or children, and by cl 8 the trustees were empowered to raise a second sum not exceeding £5,000 in addition to the first sum. Both these powers had been fully exercised. The trust fund was of great value, and a moiety of it much exceeded the aggregate sum raisable under the express powers. The question of whether the statutory powers of advancement applied in addition to the express powers arose for consideration and the court had to consider whether there was sufficient contrary intention appearing in the settlement to exclude the application of the statutory powers. It was held that although the existence of an express power of advancement in a settlement did not exclude the statutory power of advancement under s 32 of the Trustee Act 1925, the powers conferred by the settlement to raise and pay the second sum “not exceeding £5,000” would be inconsistent with the application of the statutory powers. Stamp J said, at 1297:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Stopping at the first phrase, ‘The powers conferred by this Act on trustees are in addition to the powers conferred by the instrument, if any, creating the trust …,’ a possible approach is that those words, if they mean anything, mean that if in the trust instrument there is an express power of advancement, the power conferred by the Act is additional to it. The words cannot mean that if there are two powers of a different nature: eg, a power of maintenance in the settlement and a power of advancement in the statute, one is to be additional to the other, for, if so, those words would be merely stating what is abundantly obvious and clear. If, therefore, the statutory power does not apply in any particular case it can only be by force of one of the latter limbs of s 69(2). The second phrase is: ‘… but those powers, unless otherwise stated, apply if and so far only as a contrary intention is not expressed in the instrument, if any creating the trust …’ Since the first phrase contemplates the statutory powers being additional to the powers conferred by the instrument, the mere fact that the instrument confers express powers cannot, without more, amount to an expression of intention to exclude the statutory power. Where, then – so the argument may run – is the expression of a contrary intention to be found?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The learned judge then dealt with this question as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Although the mere existence of an express power does not exclude the statutory power – for s 69(2), as I have indicated, contemplates the existence of both – when one examines its terms as distinct from its mere existence, and the surrounding circumstances by reference to which all instruments fall to be construed, one may find an expression of intention that the statutory power shall not apply. And in construing the instrument for this purpose I see no escape from the general rule of construction – that intention may be expressed by necessary implication or by ascertaining the meaning of the instrument by reference to all its terms and by reference to the surrounding circumstances. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The learned judge followed the approach of Lord Evershed MR in <span class="font-italic">Inland Revenue Commissioners v Bernstein</span> ([62] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) and held that the statutory power of advancement was excluded so far as it would otherwise be exercisable in favour of the settlor’s two children.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">64  <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">We would respectfully adopt the “fair reading” approach</span> adumbrated by Lord Evershed MR in <span class="font-italic">Inland Revenue Commissioners v Bernstein</span>. The trust instrument <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">need not expressly forbid any statutory powers</span> from applying so long as it can be said that <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">on a “fair reading” of the trust instrument the application of the statutory powers would be inconsistent with the purport of the trust instrument</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in bold italics] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 It is crystal clear from s 2(2) of the Trustees Act that the provisions of the Trustees Act that are expressly or impliedly in contravention of or inconsistent with the trust instrument will not override the powers of the trustee under the trust instrument. To address the epicentre of the parties’ hotly contested arguments of whether a letter of resignation is adequate under Clause 3, it is critical to ascertain whether a fair reading of Clause 3 expresses a contrary intention to the application of s 40 of the Trustees Act. If it is in the affirmative, then s 2(2) of the Trustees Act allows Clause 3 to take precedence notwithstanding that s 40 of the Trustees Act is the law of the land while Clause 3 is a private trust instrument.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42  A fair and objective reading of Clause 3 does not <span class="font-italic">expressly</span> forbid the operation of s 40 of the Trustees Act. Clause 3 says that the trustee “is at liberty to resign”. There are no words or phrases, such as “notwithstanding s 40 of the Trustees Act”, which suggest or imply that the Testator’s intention was to void the application of s 40 of the Trustees Act for the trustee who is desirous of being discharged. However, I notice that Clause 3 does not state or prescribe the mode of how the trustee can resign. It merely states that the trustee “is at liberty to resign”. Clause 3 also does not say that a letter of resignation is sufficient. The Defendant’s contention that Clause 3 allows a trustee to resign by a letter of resignation is misconceived. Since the Trustees Act is applicable to the trust instrument and there is no contrary intention in Clause 3 then s 40 of the Trustees Act is applicable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43   As mentioned at [30], s 40 of the Trustees Act lists out a number of requirements that trustees seeking to retire must comply with. There is no doubt that the structure for the retirement of the trustee has been very carefully and comprehensively considered by the legislature for the Trustees Act to ensure that the trustee who seeks to retire does so responsibly and at the same time safeguards the interests of those involved in the trust via s 40 of the Trustees Act. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 I disagree with the Defendant’s argument that s 40 of the Trustees Act is contrary to what the Testator had intended. The failure of the Testator to provide any mechanism whatsoever does not <span class="font-italic">ipso facto</span> mean that he obviated the need for any mechanism to apply at all. If the Testator truly intended for a low threshold that clearly disregarded the requirements under s 40 of the Trustees Act, surely the Will would have expressed this contrary intention clearly or provided its own method of retirement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The Defendant’s interpretation simply cannot be consistent with a fair reading of Clause 3, given the consequences that may arise. If his interpretation that a letter of resignation suffices to satisfy the phrase “liberty to resign” is accepted, it would mean that any trustee is allowed to resign using any method, under any circumstance and, particularly, without the consent of the other trustees. A practical illustration may help to exemplify the undesirable outcome which may arise on this interpretation. Hypothetically, in a situation where there are only two trustees that are left to administer the trust, any one of them could simply phone or email and inform the other trustee of his resignation with immediate effect. That would mean that, in an instant, the trustee would be able to disregard the interests of the beneficiaries to the trust and to leave the trust estate in a lurch. This would also undermine the rule of trust law that a retiring trustee is not discharged from the trust unless there remain two trustees or a trust corporation (see ss 38 and 40 of the Trustees Act). By the Defendant’s counsel’s own admission, that cannot be the case, as the Testator must have known of this minimum requirement when he drafted the Will. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 I, therefore, find that an effective resignation in this case must be pursuant to the requirements under s 40 of the Trustees Act, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, by way of a deed of retirement and a deed of consent to the discharge from the co-trustees, which are stated at [30] above. The Defendant’s Letter of Resignation was, therefore, not an effective and valid discharge, and he remains a trustee. In <span class="font-italic">Rajabali Jumabhoy and others v Ameerali R Jumabhoy and others</span> [1997] 2 SLR(R) 296 (“<span class="font-italic">Rajabali </span>(HC)”) at [112], Judith Prakash J (as she then was) said that the letters of resignation were ineffective because of s 43(1) of the Trustees Act (Cap 337, 1985 Rev Ed), which is <span class="font-italic">in pari materia</span> to s 40(1) of the Trustees Act:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… In my judgment, none of the resignations contained in the joint surrender letter were effective because of the overriding effect of s 43(1) of the Trustees Act. Under that section, a trustee may only retire if after his discharge there will be either a trust corporation or at least two individuals to act as trustees to perform the trust. Additionally, the retirement has to be by deed and the co-trustees and the person empowered to appoint trustees must consent, by deed, to the discharge of the retiring trustee. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Assuming <span class="font-italic">arguendo</span> that s 40 of the Trustees Act does not apply and that a letter of resignation is sufficient, will the Defendant’s Letter of Resignation be effective? This will require an analysis of the sequence of events leading to the Defendant tendering his Letter of Resignation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 It will be recalled that prior to the Defendant’s Letter of Resignation dated 1 February 2019, the Plaintiff had made known his intention to resign as early as the 10 January 2019 letter to CTLC Law Corporation, mentioned at [6] above. That intention would have come to the Defendant’s attention on 16 January 2019, or at the very latest on 19 or 20 January 2019, which was the weekend on which he claims to have received the 16 January 2019 letter mentioned at [8] above.

</div> The reason for such omissions was because the Plaintiff was under the impression, rightly so, that resignation could only occur by way of a deed. In substance, however, it is clear that the 10 January 2019 letter was an obvious manifestation of his intention to resign. It is for this very reason that the Plaintiff continued to act as a trustee, authorising Citi Private Bank in relation to the Disputed Transaction. The Plaintiff cannot be faulted for continuing to act, as he thought a responsible trustee should, while awaiting effective resignation. This is because the Plaintiff thought that he was still a trustee as the process of retirement under s 40 of the Trustees Act had not been completed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 This would leave the Defendant and Chan Chee Chiu as the two remaining trustees to the estate.

In my view, if the Plaintiff can prove, on a balance of probabilities, that the Defendant has withheld his consent unreasonably to frustrate the Plaintiff’s desire to retire, then the court has both the statutory powers (under s 14 and s 18 of the SCJA) and inherent powers under O 92 r 4 of the Rules of Court to order the Defendant to grant his consent. In the event the Defendant fails or refuses to execute the Deeds, the court can direct the Registrar of the Supreme Court to execute the Deeds on the Defendant’s behalf.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Section 14 of the SCJA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 I shall first refer to s 14 of the SCJA, which states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Execution of deed or indorsement of negotiable instrument</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">14.</span>—(1)  If a judgment or order is for the execution of a deed, or signing of a document, or for the indorsement of a negotiable instrument, and the party ordered to execute, sign or indorse such instrument is absent, or neglects or refuses to do so, any party interested in having the same executed, signed or indorsed, may prepare a deed, or document, or indorsement of the instrument in accordance with the terms of the judgment or order, and tender the same to the court for execution upon the proper stamp, if any is required by law, and the signature thereof by the Registrar, by order of the court, shall have the same effect as the execution, signing or indorsement thereof by the party ordered to execute.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2)  Nothing in this section shall be held to abridge the powers of the court to proceed by attachment against any person neglecting or refusing to execute, sign or indorse any such instrument.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The Defendant argues that s 14 of the SCJA is inapplicable in this case as there must be a pre-existing judgment or order compelling the Defendant to grant his consent and he failed to do so. At the time of the filing of OS 703/2019 there was no such judgment or order against the Defendant. Therefore, this pre-requisite of s 14 of the SCJA has not been fulfilled. Hence, the court cannot exercise its powers under s 14 of the SCJA. I disagree with the Defendant’s interpretation of s 14 of the SCJA as this is an erroneous application of s 14 of the SCJA to this case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 In <span class="font-italic">Yeo Guan Chye Terence and another v Lau Siew Kim </span>[2007] 2 SLR(R) 1, the plaintiffs in that case sued their step-mother, the defendant, claiming that several properties she held jointly with their late father was held on trust for the deceased’s estate.

I have earlier explained that the Defendant’s Letter of Resignation is ineffective and that the proper mode for a trustee to resign is by way of a Deed of Retirement as prescribed in s 40 of the Trustees Act. Therefore, when the Defendant received the Plaintiff’s Retirement Deed on 16 January 2019, the Defendant was still a trustee together with Chan Chee Chiu who had already signed the Deed of Retirement and Confirmation of Chan Fatt Cheung (a former trustee who retired by way of a letter of resignation dated 9 March 2009). On the other hand, the Defendant has categorically stated that he will not give his consent. Is this withholding of consent reasonable?</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Is the Defendant reasonable in refusing to grant his consent? </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The Defendant alleges that he was not satisfied with the management of the trust funds, as elaborated upon at [9] and [28].

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 The Defendant alleges that he was unhappy over the Plaintiff’s management of the trust funds and he felt that he was not able to act as a trustee for the benefit of the estate. Therefore, it would appear that from the Defendant’s perspective the management of the trust funds would be better off without the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff’s role as a trustee was the main source for the Defendant wanting to resign. These are the allegations of the Defendant which are unverified and the Plaintiff has not expressed his views on these allegations as he intends to resign but is being frustrated by the Defendant. Under the circumstances, as explained by the Defendant, it seems that the refusal of the Defendant to grant his consent for the Plaintiff to retire is illogical and unreasonable. Instead, the Defendant submitted his Letter of Resignation on 1 February 2019. It is clear that the Defendant was attempting to beat the Plaintiff to the resignation by trying to circumvent the requirements of s 40 of the Trustees Act which the Plaintiff is attempting to assiduously comply with. The Defendant was trying to avoid the inconvenience of seeking a replacement trustee as required under s 40 of the Trustees Act, if the Plaintiff’s resignation is successful. The conduct of the Defendant is unfair as he knew that the Plaintiff wanted to resign sometime in the middle of January 2019 and he is preventing him from doing so as he is also desirous to resign.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 For the above reasons, there are sufficient justifications for the court to invoke its powers under s 14 of the SCJA. I, therefore, order the Defendant to execute both the Plaintiff’s Retirement Deed and Chan Fatt Cheung’s Deed of Retirement and Confirmation within 14 days of the date of this order, failing which the Registrar of the Supreme Court is hereby directed to execute the Deeds on the Defendant’s behalf. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 On this ground alone the court can grant orders in term to the Plaintiff’s application in OS 703/2019. However, for completeness I shall address s 18 of the SCJA and the inherent powers of the court.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Section 18 of the SCJA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Section 18 of the SCJA states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Powers of High Court</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">18</span>.—(1) The High Court shall have such powers as are vested in it by any written law for the time being in force in Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), the High Court shall have the powers set out in the First Schedule.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3) The powers referred to in subsection (2) shall be exercised in accordance with any written law, Rules of Court or Family Justice Rules relating to them.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Under the First Schedule to the SCJA, to which s 18(2) refers, the “Additional Powers of the High Court” include the “[p]ower to issue to any person or authority any direction, order or writ for the enforcement of any right conferred by any written law or for any other purpose…” This provision empowers the court to order an individual to execute a trust deed, while simultaneously directing the Registrar of the Supreme Court to execute the deed on his behalf should he fail to do so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Accordingly, I find that the court does have the power under s 18 of the SCJA to compel the Defendant to grant his consent, or the Registrar of the Supreme Court will do it on his behalf.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Inherent powers of the court</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67  In addition to s 14 and s 18 of the SCJA, the court also has inherent powers to grant the Plaintiff’s application. The inherent powers of the courts are in O 92 r 4 of the Rules of Court which states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Inherent powers of Court (O. 92, r. 4)</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold" style="color: rgba(51,51,51,1)">4.</span>  For the avoidance of doubt it is hereby declared that nothing in these Rules shall be deemed to limit or affect the inherent powers of the Court to make any order as may be necessary to prevent injustice or to prevent an abuse of the process of the Court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 These inherent powers of the court are invoked only in situations where the justice of the case so requires.

To this end, they purchased a property using, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, a bank loan. The property was registered in Lim’s name at the bank’s request, but the interest was repaid by the crèche. When Lim subsequently became bankrupt, Hwa paid off the sums owed to Lim and used her own funds to renovate and run the property.

The court gives effect to the intention of the settlor or testator as expressed in the trust instrument and has not arrogated to itself any inherent overriding power to disregard or rewrite the trusts. However, apart from cases where a change has been effected in a minor’s property, or the court has approved a compromise on behalf of minors and of possible after-born beneficiaries, there have been cases in which the court has allowed trustees exceptionally to obtain remuneration or increased remuneration for their services or to enter into some beneficial business transaction by way of management or salvage or in emergency, which was not a transaction authorised by the trust, and cases in which, in allowing maintenance out of income, the court has altered beneficial interests, for example because accumulation is thereby suspended.

If the facts alleged in the pleadings, or if the facts ascertained in working out the judgment pronounced at the trial or the inquiries properly added to it according to the practice of the Court, shew that the <span class="font-italic">removal of the trustees is necessary for the welfare of the trust</span>, I have no doubt that, as the Court is carrying out the trusts into execution under its direction, it would have jurisdiction to do that which is one of the incidents to the execution of the trusts, namely, <span class="font-italic">do that which is necessary for the preservation of the trust property or the welfare of the cestuis que trust</span><span class="font-italic">. </span>…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">You must find something which induces the Court to think either that the <span class="font-italic">trust property will not be safe, or that the trust will not be properly executed in the interests of the beneficiaries</span>. Is that so here, and is it for the welfare of the trust generally, and not merely of the plaintiffs, that these trustees should be removed? I think it is not. The trustees were undoubtedly guilty of a breach of trust, and they undoubtedly in the statement to which I have referred expressed views which have occasioned the blame which has been attached to the trustees both by Buckley J. and myself, but, having regard to the fact that the Court has now the power of seeing that the trust is properly executed, to the fact that a large proportion of the beneficiaries do not require the trustees to be removed, and further (and this is of great importance), to the extra expense and loss to the trust estate which must not be occasioned by the change of trustees, I think it would not be for the welfare of the cestuis que trust generally, or necessary for the protection of the trust estate, that these trustees should be removed. I must therefore refuse the application for their removal as well as the application for the further accounts and inquiries.  </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 In <span class="font-italic">In the Matter of the E</span><span class="font-italic"> A Scott 1991 Children’s Settlement No 1</span> [2012] EWHC 2397 (Ch), a dispute had arisen between two brothers, Andrew and Martin, who were the sole trustees of a trust set up by their mother. Andrew sought the removal of Martin, and <span class="font-italic">vice versa</span>, while both were content for a third-party, Simon, to replace the removed trustee. In deciding to remove Andrew as a trustee, Behrens J stated:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Removal of Andrew</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… In my view Andrew’s hostility to Martin has had and is continuing to have a <span class="font-italic">deleterious effect on the administration of the trust</span>. The most obvious example is in the refusal to finalise the accounts based on the wholly irrational and unreasonable grounds that there is a partnership between Andrew, Martin and Simon despite clear advice that no such partnership exists. However, the matter does not end there. Andrew’s attitude throughout the proceedings including the allegations that he has made which have proved unfounded have convinced me that Andrew’s hostility is affecting the welfare of the beneficiaries. In those circumstances I have decided to remove Andrew as a trustee. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 In addition to the instances elaborated above, trustees may also be removed where one invests based on considerations other than the interests of the beneficiaries (see <span class="font-italic">Cowan</span><span class="font-italic"> and others v Scargill and others </span>[1985] Ch. 270), or sets up a rival business that conflicts with his duties as a trustee (see <span class="font-italic">Moore v M’Glynn</span> [1894] 1 Ir.R. 74), or ignores one’s duties (see <span class="font-italic">Walker v Walker </span>[2010] W.T.L.R. 1617).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 From the foregoing analyses, what emerges as the overarching principle is that while the court will not rewrite the trust, the inherent power of the court is most likely to be exercised to ensure the welfare of the beneficiaries and/or the trust estate.  This was underscored by Lord Blackburn in <span class="font-italic">Letterstedt</span><span class="font-italic"> (now Vicomtesse Montmort) v Broers and another</span> [1884] 9 App Cas 371 at 386<span class="font-italic"> </span>to 387 as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The reason why there is so little to be found in the books on this subject is probably that suggested by Mr Davey in his argument. As soon as all questions of character are as far settled as the nature of the case admits, if it appears clear that the <span class="font-italic">continuance of the trustee would be detrimental to the execution of the trusts</span>, even if for no other reason than that human infirmity would prevent those beneficially interested, or those who act for them, from working in harmony with the trustee, and if there is no reason to the contrary from the intentions of the framer of the trust to give his trustee a benefit or otherwise, the trustee is always advised by his own counsel to resign, and does so. If without any reasonable ground, he refused to do so, it seems to their Lordships that the Court might think it proper to remove him; but cases involving the necessity of deciding this, if they ever arise, do so without getting reported. It is to be lamented that the case was not considered in this light by the parties in the Court below, for, as far as their Lordships can see, the Board would have little or no profit from continuing to be trustees, and as such coming into continual conflict with the appellant and her legal advisers, and would probably have been glad to resign, and get out of an onerous and disagreeable position. But the case was not so treated.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In exercising so delicate a jurisdiction as that of removing trustees, their Lordships do not venture to lay down any general rule beyond the very broad principle above enunciated, that their <span class="font-italic">main guide must be the welfare of the beneficiaries</span>. Probably it is not possible to lay down any more definite rule in a matter so essentially dependent on details often of great nicety. But they proceed to look carefully into the circumstances of the case. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 The inherent powers of the court, thus, include the power to compel the Defendant to provide his consent to the retirement of the Plaintiff as it is unfair and unreasonable, under the circumstances of this case, not to grant his consent. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Deed of Retirement and Confirmation of Chan Fatt Cheung</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 I turn to the issue of the Deed of Retirement and Confirmation of Chan Fatt Cheung. Based on my findings in Issue 1, Chan Fatt Cheung’s letter of resignation would have been ineffective as well. Notwithstanding that, all parties, including the Defendant, had acted on the basis that Chan Fatt Cheung was no longer a trustee from that time henceforth. In this regard, reference can be had to the analysis in <span class="font-italic">Rajabali </span>(HC) at [114]–[115]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">114 <span class="font-italic">Davis v Richards &amp; Wallington Industries Ltd</span> [1991] 2 All ER 563 is authority for the proposition that in certain circumstances a written resignation by a trustee may be effective although it is not in the form of a deed and no other deeds have been executed by the co-trustees accepting it in accordance with the provision of s 43 of the Trustees Act. What matters is whether all relevant parties have acted upon the resignation such that it would be inequitable to later allow them to contend that the trustee who retired nevertheless retained his position. Scott J expressed his understanding of the law as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">All concerned had treated Mr Parson’s written resignation as effective. The other trustees had done so. Industries, both before and after the appointment of the receivers, had done so. Godwins &amp; Scottish Widows had done so. For the court to hold that, notwithstanding the resignation letter and the common understanding of its consequences, Mr Parsons still owed fiduciary duties and still had fiduciary responsibilities that required him to approve the new rules and to execute the definitive deed, would be to permit the merest technically [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] to override the apparent intentions of all the parties. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">115 In the circumstances of this case, the intentions of the parties clearly were that Mustafa should cease to be trustee as early as possible. They and he acted accordingly and it would not be correct for me to hold that his resignation did not take effect shortly after its date when Rajabali accepted it. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 It would, therefore, be inequitable to allow the Defendant to now argue that Chan Fatt Cheung is still a trustee and that the Deed of Appointment appointing both the Plaintiff and the Defendant was ineffective. Thus, notwithstanding that Chan Fatt Cheung’s resignation was not in compliance with s 40 of the Trustees Act, his resignation on 9 March 2009 can be considered valid as for all intents and purposes the trustees and those who had dealings with him over the last 10 years acknowledged his discharge from the trust. Further, given the opportunity now, there is no basis for the Defendant to object to the Plaintiff’s application to regularise the retirement of Chan Fatt Cheung by way of the Deed of Retirement and Confirmation. It is obvious that the reason for the Defendant’s objection is for a self-serving purpose, so that he can rely on Chan Fatt Cheung’s resignation as precedence to justify that his Letter of Resignation is valid. I shall elaborate in the next paragraph.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 I also reject the Defendant’s argument that the acceptance of Chan Fatt Cheung’s letter of resignation serves as a “representation to the Defendant that a letter of resignation sent by the Defendant would be effective for him to resign from being a trustee of the estate.”

</div> He alleges that it is inequitable and unjust for the Plaintiff and Chan Chee Chiu to reject his Letter of Resignation. As stated at [26], Chan Fatt Cheung’s letter of resignation was sent to Chan Sze Chuen and Chan Chee Chiu. The Plaintiff and the Defendant both subsequently acted on this purported resignation at the same time, when they were appointed as trustees. Moreover, two wrongs (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Chan Fatt Cheung’s and the Defendant’s letters of resignation) do not make it the correct and valid way for a trustee to retire. There is nothing inequitable and unjust to the Defendant.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82  In summary, Clause 3 allows the trustee to resign but it does not prescribe the mode of resignation. The effect of s 2 of the Trustees Act is that s 40 of the Trustees Act supplements Clause 3. This means that any trustee who is desirous to resign will have to comply with the requirements under s 40 of the Trustees Act. Therefore, the Defendant’s Letter of Resignation is invalid as it fails to comply with the requirements under s 40 of the Trustees Act. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Section 14 of the SCJA does not require the Plaintiff to have a pre-existing order or judgment at the time he files OS 703/2019 seeking the court to direct the Defendant to execute the Deed of Retirement and Confirmation and the Plaintiff’s Retirement Deed. In addition, the court also has the powers under s 18 of the SCJA and the inherent powers under O 92 r 4 of the Rules of Court to direct the Defendant to execute the Deeds. The facts disclose that the Defendant attempted to beat the Plaintiff to the resignation by trying to circumvent s 40 of the Trustees Act so that he does not have to face the inconvenience of seeking a replacement trustee as required under s 40 of the Trustees Act. The Trustees Act prescribes that after the discharge of the trustee there will be either at least two remaining trustees or a trust corporation. The Defendant has unreasonably and unjustly withheld his consent to allow the Plaintiff to resign. The Plaintiff was desirous of being discharged way before the Defendant tendered his Letter of Resignation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 Accordingly, I order the Defendant to execute both the Plaintiff’s Retirement Deed and Chan Fatt Cheung’s Deed of Retirement and Confirmation within 14 days of the date of this order, failing which the Registrar of the Supreme Court is hereby directed to execute the Deeds on the Defendant’s behalf. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 I shall now hear parties on the issue of costs.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Tan Siong Thye<br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Menon T P B (Wee Swee Teow LLP) for the plaintiff;<br/>Paul Wong Por Luk and Lau Wen Jin (Dentons Rodyk &amp; Davidson  LLP) for the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
