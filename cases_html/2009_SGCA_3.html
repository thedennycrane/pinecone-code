<p class="Judg-Author" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">Andrew Phang Boon Leong JA (delivering the judgment of the court):</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><strong>Introduction</strong></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">1          These are two related appeals against the decision made by the High Court in Suit No 341 of 2005, taken out by Loh Sze Ti Terence Peter, the plaintiff, against Gay Choon Ing, the defendant, respectively. For ease of reference, we shall continue to refer to the parties here as “the plaintiff” and “the defendant”. The appeals arise out of the same facts, and it is convenient to deal with them together in this judgment.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">2          In Civil Appeal No 33 of 2008 (“CA 33/2008”), the defendant appealed against the orders made by the trial judge (“the Judge”) which included, <i>inter alia</i>, an order declaring that the defendant held 1.55 million ordinary shares of $1 each (“the Shares”) in the defendant’s family company, Gay Lip Seng &amp; Sons (Pte) Ltd (“the Company”), on trust for the plaintiff. Being dissatisfied with various aspects of the decision made by the Judge (see <i>Loh Sze Ti Terence Peter v Gay Choon Ing</i> <nobr>[2008] SGHC 31</nobr> (“the GD”)), the plaintiff appealed to this court via Civil Appeal No 34 of 2008 (“CA 34/2008”). Three documents signed and concluded between the plaintiff and the defendant are particularly integral to the proceedings themselves: first, a trust deed concluded between both parties as at 3 January 1994 (“the Trust Deed”); second, points of agreement (“the POA”) signed between both parties on 27 October 2004; and, third, a waiver letter concluded contemporaneously with the POA.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">3          Having heard and carefully considered the submissions of the respective parties, we have decided to allow the defendant’s appeal in CA 33/2008 and dismiss the plaintiff’s appeal in CA 34/2008. We now set out the reasons for our decision.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><strong>The decision in the court below</strong></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">4          The Judge carefully considered the arguments of both parties in the court below and arrived at the conclusion, <i>inter alia</i>, that the defendant held the Shares on trust for the plaintiff and that the POA should be rescinded. Central to her decision was the emphasis placed on the construction of the Trust Deed. First, she held, <i>inter alia</i>, that the approach to adopt towards the acrimonious dispute was to “construe the Trust Deed in its entirety to determine whether or not the declaration of trust was to create a trust of the Shares with [the plaintiff] as the beneficial owner” (see the GD at [19]). She reasoned that the <i>substance and</i> <i>form</i> of the Trust Deed suggested that the document bore the “hallmarks of an express trust” (at [20]). Further, cl 3 of the Trust Deed specifically indicated that the beneficiary would indemnify the defendant for obligations arising by reason of the Shares being registered in his name.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">5          Secondly, the Judge had to consider if the sum of $1.55m, which the plaintiff had allegedly paid for the Shares, was a loan to the defendant or an investment in the Company. The Judge embarked on an extensive analysis of the testimony of both parties during cross-examination as well as the various arguments canvassed by both parties. She held that there was no contemporaneous documentary evidence of the purported loan extended by the plaintiff, and accepted that the only formal documentation of the parties’ relationship was embodied in the Trust Deed. Further, and notwithstanding the defendant’s assertions, she acknowledged that while both the plaintiff and defendant shared a close relationship, the circumstances were not such “that the common sense of the situation bore out a loan even out of kindness” (at [31]). Contrary to the defendant’s suggestion of a loan, the plaintiff’s investment represented a substantial block of shares in the Company and allowed the defendant to take control of the Company. On this basis, she found that the defendant held the Shares on trust for the benefit of the plaintiff.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">6          Having decided these two issues in favour of the plaintiff, the Judge proceeded to consider the plaintiff’s complaints in relation to, <i>first,</i> breaches during the period of trusteeship before the signing of the POA and <i>second</i>, whether the signing of the POA had been induced by misrepresentation or breach of trust.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">7          The plaintiff alleged, <i>inter alia</i>, that the defendant had misappropriated his share of profits and dividends, dealt with the Shares without informing him or obtaining his prior consent, held himself out as the beneficial owner of the Shares and withheld material information of the Company from him. The plaintiff further averred that the defendant had fraudulently or negligently misrepresented to him that the dividends due to him amounted to $100,000 and that the fair value of the Shares was $1.4 m. The plaintiff therefore sought to have the POA rescinded on the ground of misrepresentation. He also sought to have the POA rescinded for alleged breach of trust by the defendant.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">8          The Judge discussed extensively the scope of the defendant’s duties as trustee under the Trust Deed. Addressing the plaintiff’s four main allegations, the Judge concluded, <i>first</i>, that there were neither pre-emption provisions in the Company’s articles of association restricting the transfer of shares by a member to an existing member or stranger nor any legal obligation on the part of a member “desiring to sell his shares to first offer them for sale to all the existing members of the Company”, and not just to the defendant (see the GD at [52]). <i>Second</i>, the Judge found that the plaintiff was, on a balance of probabilities, aware that the issue of the Company’s bonus shares were “for the original ten shares as the bonus issue was a result of a capitalisation of the revaluation of the Company’s property <i>prior</i> to the issuance of the new shares” [emphasis in original] (at [63]). <i>Third</i>, she held that the plaintiff was only entitled to dividends declared on the 1.55 million shares. The plaintiff was entitled to receive dividends in respect of the Shares from the time they were first declared in 1999 up to recent times and credit was to be given for all sums received by the plaintiff already. <i>Fourth</i>, she found that there had been no breach of trust in relation to the purchase of an apartment by the defendant using the Company’s funds, on the basis that the plaintiff could not conflate the defendant’s “role as trustee director and as trustee of the Shares” (at [74]).</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">9          Turning to the POA, the Judge considered whether the signing of the POA was induced by misrepresentation or in breach of trust. <i>First</i>, on the allegation of misrepresentation, she held that the plaintiff was unable to point to any representations made by the defendant and, further, that the elements of inducement and reliance had not been made out. <i>Second</i>, she considered if the POA could be rescinded on the basis of the “fair dealing” rule. She held that a conflict of interest had arisen when the defendant failed to disclose the value of the Shares by the date of execution of the POA. Further, she reasoned that, considering that there had been a lack of material disclosure (at [92] of the GD):</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">I find that [the defendant] intentionally refrained from acquiring and providing material information as to the value of the Shares, and his conduct was such as to attract the application of the fair dealing rule. The application of the rule, as I have stated earlier, does not depend on any finding of dishonesty. [The defendant’s] non-disclosure involved a conscious act of disloyalty to make his conduct a breach of fiduciary duty in the sense explained by Millet[t] LJ in <i>Bristol &amp; West Building Society v Mothew</i> [[1998] Ch 1] at 19:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">Conduct which is in breach of this duty need not be dishonest but it must be intentional.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">Clearly, [the defendant] took over [the plaintiff’s] beneficial interest in circumstances in which there was, in my judgment, no informed consent.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">This then led the Judge to consider the defendant’s argument that the POA was a compromise settlement between the parties, having regard to the contemporaneous waiver letter that both parties had signed. Her reasons for rejecting this argument can be broadly classified into two main categories: <i>first</i>, she held that the defendant had not furnished <i>sufficient</i> consideration in law as the waiver letter “was <i>vis-à-vis</i> [the plaintiff] in his capacity as representative of ASP [a Kenyan company of which the plaintiff was the managing director and shareholder] and not in his personal capacity” (at [95]); <i>secondly</i>, she was of the view that the defendant’s denial of the contents of the waiver letter and his subsequent “fresh assertion through his Kenyan lawyers for severance pay [pursuant to his resignation from ASP] even after the POA was signed” did not support his contention that the POA and the waiver letter were to be construed as a valid compromise or settlement between the parties (<i>ibid</i>).</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">10        Having rejected the defendant’s argument, she concluded that the defendant had breached the fair dealing rule and ordered that the POA be set aside. As a condition of rescission, she further ordered the plaintiff to hand over a sum of $1.5m (which the defendant had paid to the plaintiff pursuant to the POA) to the defendant and that he (the plaintiff) would be allowed to set off, from this sum, dividends payable to him.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">11        It must be noted that the Judge addressed each issue in great detail and spared no effort in considering the arguments put forth by the parties. Based on the arguments presented before her, she arrived at a conclusion as to the legal status of the Trust Deed. With respect, however, there is an issue which (for reasons which we will elaborate upon below) is of signal importance to the resolution of the appeal in CA 33/2008, but which was dealt with as a subsidiary issue by the Judge (see the GD at [95]). This centres on whether or not there had, by virtue of the contemporaneous execution of the POA and the waiver letter, been a valid compromise agreement between the parties. If there had been such an agreement, then the defendant would have been released from all his legal obligations under the Trust Deed provided that he had complied with the relevant terms of the POA, and the plaintiff would be released from any possible liability to the defendant with respect to the latter’s claims in relation to severance pay (see [9] above). However, this question (as to whether or not there had indeed been a valid compromise agreement between the parties) appears to have been dealt with only tangentially by the parties themselves. This (unfortunate) lack of assistance by the parties relegated this important issue to the margins and was (justifiably) dealt with as such by the Judge. The Judge came to the conclusion that there had been no valid compromise agreement (at [94]–[95]; see also above at [9]). Running slightly ahead of the story, so to speak, we regretfully differ from this conclusion for reasons which we set out in detail below. Before proceeding to do so, however, it would be apposite to set out the relevant factual background to the present appeal.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><strong>Factual background</strong></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><strong><em>Development of friendship between both parties</em></strong></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">12        Aristotle once observed in <i>Nicomachean Ethics</i>, Book VIII (Cambridge University Press, 2000) (Roger Crisp trans &amp; ed) ch 3, at p 147:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">As the saying goes, [people] cannot know each other until they have eaten the proverbial salt together, nor can they accept each other or be friends until each has shown himself to be worthy of love and gained the other’s confidence. Those who are quick to show the signs of friendship to one another wish to be friends, but are not, unless they are worthy of friendship and know it. For though the wish for friendship arises quickly, friendship does not.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">This was, in a sense, true of the relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant, whose chapters of friendship unfolded over the last 30 years. Both parties were by no means strangers to each other and the history of their acquaintance can be traced back to its roots, nearly three decades ago in the early 1970s, when both men served alongside each other in the Singapore Armed Forces (“SAF”). As fellow comrades-in-arms, a steady friendship blossomed between both men that surpassed the vagaries of time and continued even after they left the SAF and embarked on their separate paths in life.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">13        This friendship was further cemented when both men worked alongside each other in managing the plaintiff’s business. The plaintiff was the managing director and a shareholder of a company called ASP Company Limited (“ASP”), located in Nairobi, Kenya. In the early 1980s, the plaintiff, who had business interests in Thailand, sounded out the defendant as to whether he would be interested in taking up employment in Thailand. The defendant was agreeable to this and commenced his employment in 1980 with Sathask Driam Company in Thailand. In 1981, the plaintiff asked the defendant to move to Kenya and the defendant was (again) willing to do so, joining ASP as its general manager in 1981. Thereafter, from 1981 to 2004, he continued to work for the plaintiff who was both his friend as well as his immediate boss. After 1995, the plaintiff and his family moved back to Singapore from Kenya and the defendant was left to run ASP by himself, reporting to the plaintiff often by e-mail. The defendant rose through the ranks and was eventually named a director of ASP although he did not hold any shares in ASP. During his tenure of employment with ASP, the defendant’s job entailed travelling to states where ASP had its business interests, to places such as China, even as he continued to be based in Kenya.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">14        With the development of such a close-knit and inextricably intertwined bond between both men, it was hardly surprising that there was a level of implicit trust and mutual respect that developed between both parties. Indeed, this almost symbiotic friendship continued to thrive through the years, extending beyond purely business relations into their personal lives. Both families were close and went on family outings together, with the plaintiff serving, in some respects, as a mentor and role model to the defendant’s two children, Rosemary and Larry. As an illustration of the close bond shared between both men, the plaintiff further arranged for Rosemary to gain admission to a good school and also financed the defendant’s children’s education in Australia entirely out of his own pocket. It was telling that despite the spate of proceedings in the present case, we note, in passing, that in the defendant’s affidavit of 3 November 2006, he acknowledged this close bond and remarked affirmatively of the plaintiff that “[h]e was my friend, my boss and the most trusted person outside my immediate family”.</span><a href="#_ftn1" id="_ftnref1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB">[note: 1]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><strong><em>Events leading up to the signing of the Trust Deed in 1994</em></strong></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">15        The defendant was a shareholder of the Company, a family business started by the defendant’s father. The Company owned and operated a hotel known as Tai Hoe Hotel (“the Hotel”), a two-storey pre-war building located in Little India. Prior to 1993, the defendant held one of ten ordinary shares of $1 each in the equity of the Company. The other shareholders in the Company were the defendant’s brothers and his father. After his father’s demise in 1989, his father’s shareholding was transferred to the defendant’s mother in 1995.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">16        In 1993, the Company decided to redevelop the Hotel. Pursuant to this suggestion, a meeting of the shareholders of the Company was called sometime in 1993 when it was agreed that $3m represented the value of the Hotel’s property and it was further agreed that for each one share currently held, additional shares of 299,999 shares would be issued (“the bonus shares”). The Company increased its authorised capital to $5.5m. The bonus shares were to be distributed “amongst the persons who were registered as holders of the issued share capital of the Company at the closing of the Register on 13 December 1993”.</span><a href="#_ftn2" id="_ftnref2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB">[note: 2]</span></span></span></span></a> <span lang="EN-GB">Therefore, a total of 2,999,990 shares would be issued, giving a total of $3m in issued share capital, and $2,999,990 was credited to the capital reserve account of the Company.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">17        The construction cost of the redevelopment of the Hotel was estimated to be about $5.5m. The bank agreed to finance the construction but required a contribution of 20% to be put up by the shareholders of the Company. The defendant agreed to invest $2.5m in return for 2.5 million shares. The other shareholders were agreeable to this.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">18        Having undertaken to raise $2.5m for this redevelopment project, the defendant turned to the plaintiff in view of the friendship they shared. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant approached him to entice him into investing in the Company to enable the rebuilding and redeveloping of the Hotel. However, the defendant’s recollection of this event differed – he alleged that the plaintiff “readily agreed to extend a <i>loan</i>”</span><a href="#_ftn3" id="_ftnref3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB">[note: 3]</span></span></span></span></a> <span lang="EN-GB">[emphasis added] to him and that he (the plaintiff) would do anything to have him remain in Kenya as he required him to continue to run the operations of ASP’s business. The defendant further alleged that he confided in the plaintiff that he would prefer to secure the loan and would pledge an equivalent number of shares to him. This was to ensure that, in the event of his demise, the plaintiff would be able to recover his loan.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">19        Whether the sum of money extended by the plaintiff was an <i>investment</i> or a <i>loan,</i> what is clear is that, pursuant to this arrangement between the parties, the defendant issued shares to the plaintiff. According to the plaintiff, both he and the defendant appointed Peter Chua, a solicitor with M/s Peter Chua &amp; Partners, to document the arrangement. Both of them were agreeable to the terms and signed the Trust Deed on 3 January 1994. The Trust Deed provided as follows:</span></p>

However, the plaintiff understood it, on the contrary, to be an <i>investment</i> and that the defendant held the Shares on trust for him. Quite apart from this particular dispute,</span> <span lang="EN-GB">the quantum of money the defendant received for the Shares was the subject of some dispute between both parties; the defendant vigorously contended before the Judge that he had only received $1.4m but the plaintiff argued that the amount in question was higher, <i>viz</i>, $1.55m. The defendant contended that when a total of $1.4m was eventually received from the plaintiff after the signing of the Trust Deed, he did not endeavour to correct the Trust Deed as he trusted the plaintiff.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><strong><em>Events after signing of the Trust Deed –- 1995 to 2003</em></strong></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">21        After the signing of the Trust Deed, the plaintiff continued to render assistance in the form of guidance to the defendant in relation to the development of the Hotel and the structure of the Company. Sometime in January 2001, the defendant acknowledged the plaintiff’s contributions and wrote to the plaintiff thanking him for his help. In February 2003, the plaintiff contacted Rosemary to ask for details of dividends paid by the Company. Rosemary responded to the plaintiff’s query and he was informed of the dividends paid in relation to 1.4 million shares. On 2 June 2003, the plaintiff followed up with further enquiries relating to the dividends payable for 2002. He was informed that these had not been paid.</span></p>

<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">22        However, relations between the plaintiff and the defendant began to sour in 2003. In August 2003, the defendant indicated to the plaintiff that he wished to retire from ASP and mentioned that ASP paid retirement sums to its employees on their retirement from ASP. The plaintiff sought to persuade him to stay on for another year. The defendant agreed to do so but this did not dissuade him from wanting to retire eventually. On 30 July 2004, the defendant wrote to the plaintiff reiterating his intention to retire from ASP with effect from 31 October 2004 and asked that ASP “work out [his] terminal dues before [his] departure date”.<a href="#_ftn4" id="_ftnref4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB">[note: 4]</span></span></span></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">23        Subsequently, in August 2004, the defendant again informed the plaintiff of his intention to retire but the plaintiff asked him to stay on for another three months to assist in a project and for time to work out the termination money payment. On 11 August 2004, the defendant wrote an e-mail to the plaintiff as follows:<a href="#_ftn5" id="_ftnref5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB">[note: 5]</span></span></span></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">You asked me about what is the fair value of your shares. I think the answer does not lie entirely in that it lies in how much blessing and good will you would give me when I leave you today and start on my own alone. I am not really concerned about how much you paid-in when you decided to help me out in 1993 and the value the shares were transacted just a few months ago. What I cannot afford is the value derives from the valuation of the property such as when my brother Gary did it to me.</span></p>

<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">25        The relationship between the parties began to spiral out of control, taking a turn for the worse with the plaintiff, on one hand, accusing the defendant of withholding information from him and treating the Trust Deed as an investment and the defendant, on the other hand, becoming increasingly exasperated by the deepening rift that was widening between them. On 5 October 2004, the defendant wrote to the plaintiff seeking to work out the severance pay with regard to the local contract (what he had referred to in his earlier letter of 30 July 2004 as his “terminal dues” (see above at [22])).

<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">In this letter, the defendant proceeded to cite several instances of how he had succeeded in resolving business problems encountered in his employment at ASP.

With respect to this document, the defendant alleged before this court, first, that he had no input into the POA; second, that the document was prepared by the <i>plaintiff</i>; and third, that the waiver of the retirement dues was only for the <i>foreign</i> contract and the plaintiff would pay him under the <i>local</i> contract as the amount involved was small.

<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">It should be noted that the contents of this particular letter belied the parties’ intention and effort, at the point of execution of the POA, to extinguish their claims against one another and the plaintiff’s intention, by extending the Waiver Letter on the same day and requesting the defendant to countersign on the letter, to cement this effort at reaching a final (and legally binding) reconciliation. This was by no means a half-hearted attempt at putting a stop to the escalating tensions mounting between them.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><strong>The issues on appeal</strong></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">37        The defendant appealed, <i>inter alia</i>, against the following aspects of the Judge’s decision:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(a)        that he held the Shares on trust for the benefit of the plaintiff;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(b)        that the POA between the parties be rescinded; and</span></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(c)        that he account for dividends payable to the plaintiff in respect of the Shares, which dividends were first declared by the Company in 1999 right up to recent times.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">38        The plaintiff appealed against those aspects of his case which the Judge did not agree with, including, <i>inter alia</i>:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(a)        that as a condition to the rescission of the POA, he was to hand over the sum of $1.5m to the defendant;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(b)        that he was not entitled to 61.9% of the shares of the Company; and</span></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(c)        that the defendant was not in breach of his duties as trustee and at law in failing to offer him the proportion of the Shares held on trust.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">39        In our view, these issues, with respect, miss the real focal point of the dispute between the parties. The key inquiry, having regard to the events that transpired and led to the present proceedings as mentioned above, was whether or not the POA and the Waiver Letter constituted a valid compromise agreement between the parties. Running slightly ahead of the story, so to speak, it was in fact clear to us, from a close analysis of these documents as well as the context furnished by</span> <span lang="EN-GB">the course of correspondence between the parties from October 2004 to February 2005, that both the plaintiff and the defendant, for all intents and purposes, <i>acted</i> <i>and</i> <i>proceeded</i> on the basis that there was a concluded compromise. The plaintiff promised to release the defendant from <i>all</i> his obligations under the Trust Deed in accordance with the terms of the POA while the defendant in turn, agreed to relinquish <i>all</i> claims against ASP. It is also pertinent to note, first, that the settlement sum extended was ultimately paid and received <i>without</i> any qualification; and, second, that the plaintiff wished the defendant well in his <i>future</i> endeavours. Both parties clearly were keen to move on and put aside their differences. What appeared to derail these hitherto settled relations were the purported threats made over the dinner in Shanghai. However, this would <i>not</i></span> <span lang="EN-GB">affect the <i>already concluded</i> compromise agreement between the parties which, in our view, effected a “clean break” between them, leaving no outstanding legal issues between them under the Trust Deed as well as between the defendant and ASP with regard to the former’s claims for severance pay.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">40        We should, however, emphasise, at the outset, that we find the findings and reasoning by the Judge with regard to all the remaining issues to be both meticulous as well as correct. Hence, we need focus only on whether or not the parties concluded a valid compromise agreement. Our decision on this particular issue is relevant to the appeal in CA 33/2008. This is because, although we have affirmed the findings and reasoning of the Judge with respect to the remaining issues, the defendant would nevertheless succeed in his appeal if there is a valid compromise agreement. However, it necessarily follows then that the plaintiff’s appeal in CA 34/2008 must fail. We turn now to the reasons why we find that the parties had concluded a valid compromise agreement.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><strong>Our decision</strong></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><strong><em>The law on compromise</em></strong></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">41        In the leading Commonwealth textbook on compromise and settlements, Foskett QC sets out the following definition of a “compromise” (see David Foskett, <i>The Law and Practice of Compromise</i> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 6th Ed, 2005) at para 1-01):</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">Compromise can be defined as <i>the settlement of dispute by mutual concession, its essential foundation being the ordinary law of contract</i> … A more practical and, perhaps, more apt definition would be <i>the complete or partial resolution by agreement of differences before final adjudication by a court or tribunal of competent jurisdiction.</i> [emphasis added]</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">This definition finds, in fact, judicial expression in several old English cases such as the English Court of Appeal decision of <i>Plumley v Horrell</i> (1869) 20 LT 473, where Lord Romilly MR observed, as follows (at 474):</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><i><span lang="EN-GB">Primâ facie</span></i> <span lang="EN-GB">everybody would suppose that a compromise means that the question is not to be tried over again. That is the first meaning of a compromise. When I compromise a law suit with my adversary, I mean that the question is not to be tried over again.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">In the (also) English Court of Appeal decision of <i>Knowles v Roberts</i> (1888) 38 Ch D 263, Bowen LJ reiterated (at 272) that a compromise essentially puts a dispute to an end:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">As soon as you have ended a dispute by a compromise you have disposed of it.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">42        Bearing in mind the mechanics of an adversarial system of litigation, it is not surprising that parties may seek to give effect to the terms of their agreement to compromise and settle their disputes, whether <i>prior</i> to or <i>at</i> the trial itself. The courts would permit this, if certain requirements are satisfied. The rationale for this has been alluded to briefly by K S Rajah JC in the Singapore High Court decision of <i>Lee Hong Choon v Ng Cheo Hwee</i> <nobr>[1995] 2 SLR 663</nobr>, as follows (at 666, [11]):</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">This is known as the principle of ‘party control’ or ‘party autonomy’, and it is of exceptional importance since its effect is to promote the resolution and disposal of pending proceedings and thus to reduce to a fairly acceptable minimum the number of actions or proceedings which are actually tried by a judge at a plenary trial or are finally adjudicated upon by the court. The law encourages the compromise or settlement of civil disputes and employs a number of devices or techniques for this purpose. These include:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(1)        the right of the parties to negotiate under the protection of the privilege of ‘without prejudice’;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(2)        the device of a payment into court in satisfaction of a claim for debt or damages;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(3)        the making of an ‘open offer’ in claims other than for debt or damages;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(4)        the making of a written offer expressed to be ‘without prejudice save as to costs’;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(5)        the offer of a contribution in third party proceedings;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(6)        the offer to accept liability up to a specified proportion.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">Put simply, where parties have demonstrated that they intend to dispose of their dispute by reaching an amicable resolution agreeable to both parties, this compromise or settlement will be recognised and given effect to by the courts.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">43        As Foskett observes (at para 3-01), a compromise is essentially founded on contract. Before a compromise can be reached between two parties, there must, of necessity, be an <i>actual</i> <i>or</i> <i>potential</i> <i>dispute</i> between parties that can be disposed of, as established in cases such as <i>Chapman v Chapman</i> [1954] AC 429, <i>Mercantile Investment and General Trust Company v International Company of Mexico</i> [1893] 1 Ch 484 (“<i>Mercantile</i>”) and <i>Sneath v Valley Gold, Limited</i> [1893] 1 Ch 477. In the English Court of Appeal decision of <i>Mercantile</i>, an action was brought by the holders of 125 debentures (issued by the defendant American company) with the aim of recovering interest due on them. The defendant company alleged that, at a prior company resolution, a majority of the debenture holders had resolved that the debentures of the company be exchanged for paid-up preference shares in an English company which had taken over the assets and liabilities of the defendant company. Hence, the defendant company argued that the plaintiffs’ rights as debenture holders had determined, given that the resolution was binding on the plaintiffs. In considering the validity of the resolution and whether it modified or compromised the rights of the debenture holders against the defendant company, Fry LJ observed (at 491) that:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">[I]n my opinion, this transaction is not a compromise of these rights. In our older legal language the word “compromise” appears to have been used, in accordance with its etymology, to express the mutual promises of “persons at controversy” to submit to the arbitrament of a third person the matters in dispute between the two (see “A compromise defined,” 2 West Symboleography, 163). <i>In our present language</i> <i>it undoubtedly embraces an agreement between two or more persons for the ascertainment of their rights when there is <b>some question in controversy</b> between them or some difficulty in the enforcement to the uttermost farthing of the rights of the claimant. But, in my opinion, the word is applicable only where there is some such controversy or some such difficulty.</i> Nothing of the sort existed in the present case. [emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">44        In the Singapore High Court decision of <i>Info-communications Development Authority of Singapore v Singapore Telecommunications Ltd (No 2)</i> <nobr>[2002] 3 SLR 488</nobr> (“<i>Info-communications</i>”), Lai Kew Chai J, citing Foskett, observed at [120] that:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">A compromise is little more than a species of contract. What distinguishes it from other contracts is <i>the requirement of a dispute or differences between parties which are eventually settled</i>. In Foskett <i>The Law and Practice of Compromise</i> it is written (at p 5):</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">Bearing in mind its essential nature, it is submitted that a compromise in the true sense of the term cannot arise until some dispute or difference of view exists between the parties which, by agreement, they resolve. It is not necessary for there to be pending litigation, but there must be some ‘actual’ or ‘potential’ dispute.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">The learned judge further noted, in a similar vein, as follows (at [124]):</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">In essence a compromise is to contract to settle disputes. If the elements of contractual formation are satisfied on the facts, then a compromise was entered into by the parties.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">45        What can be gleaned from the aforementioned extracts is that without an <i>actual</i> <i>or potential</i> <i>dispute</i>, it is obvious that nothing can be settled or compromised. A compromise or settlement is the <i>result</i> of the resolution of an actual or potential dispute.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><strong><em>Essential requirements of a compromise</em></strong></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">46        As already alluded to above, the general principles of contract law apply with equal force to the law of compromise as in other contractual contexts. As Foskett has observed (at para 3-01, and adopted in <i>Info-communications</i> (at [115])), a compromise will not arise unless certain requirements are fulfilled; these include (differing somewhat, though, from the precise sequence Foskett has adopted) what is, in fact, traditionally required under the general common law of contract, <i>viz</i>, an identifiable agreement that is complete and certain, consideration, as well as an intention to create legal relations. As these requirements are elaborated upon in detail in all the leading textbooks on contract law, just a basic outline will suffice for the purposes of the present appeal.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><em>An identifiable agreement that is complete and certain</em></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">47<i>        First</i>, there must be an identifiable agreement, which is complete and certain. Essentially, this means that negotiations between the parties must have crystallised into a contractually-binding agreement in which there is no uncertainty as to the terms of the contract concerned. The traditional tools of analysis centre around the concepts of offer and acceptance. An “offer” has been described as follows (see M P Furmston, <i>Cheshire, Fifoot and Furmston’s Law of Contract</i> (Oxford University Press, 15th Ed, 2007) (“<i>Cheshire, Fifoot and Furmston</i>”) at p 40):</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">An offer, capable of being converted into an agreement by acceptance, must consist of a definite promise to be bound, provided that certain specified terms are accepted.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">An “acceptance” has been described as follows (see Edwin Peel, <i>Treitel:</i> <i>The Law of Contract</i> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 12th Ed, 2007) (“<i>Treitel</i>”) at para 2-015):</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">An acceptance is a final and unqualified expression of assent to the terms of an offer.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">48        An “offer” must be distinguished from an “invitation to treat”. The former has already been defined above (at [47]). The latter, on the other hand, is simply an attempt to initiate negotiations, to induce offers; hence, a response to an “invitation to treat” can never result in a concluded contract. Although there are decisions illustrating specific instances of “invitations to treat”, the distinction between an “offer” on the one hand and an “invitation to treat” on the other is, at bottom, a question of the <i>intention</i> of the party concerned (<i>viz</i>, whether his or her intention was to make “a definite promise to be bound provided that certain specified terms are accepted” (an offer; and see above at [47]) <i>or</i> merely attempting to induce offers instead (an invitation to treat)).</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">49        It should be noted, however, that the concepts of offer and acceptance are not always helpful – not, at least, where they are applied in a mechanistic fashion. But, of that, more later (see below at [61]–[63]).</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">50        It should be further noted that before a contract can be said to have been concluded, the terms of the contemplated contract must be both certain and complete (see the oft-cited House of Lords decision of <i>G Scammell and Nephew, Limited v HC and JG Ouston</i> [1941] AC 251). Possible gaps may be filled by a previous course of dealing between the parties or by trade practice or where a definite formula exists (see, in this last-mentioned regard, for example, the English decision of <i>Brown v Gould</i> [1972] Ch 53; the Malaysian Privy Council decision of <i>Kepong Prospecting Ltd v Schmidt</i> <nobr>[1968] 1 MLJ 170</nobr>; and the decision of this court in <i>British Malayan Trustees Ltd v Sindo Realty Pte Ltd</i> <nobr>[1999] 1 SLR 623</nobr>).</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">51        Turning to a specific illustration where a valid compromise agreement was found by the court, in the Malaysian Federal Court decision of <i>The Ka Wah Bank Ltd v Nadinusa Sdn Bhd</i> <nobr>[1998] 2 MLJ 350</nobr>, the respondents were directors of a company that had been granted banking facilities by the appellant bank. The respondents defaulted in payment and the bank commenced three suits against them. The respondents contended that the first suit had been <i>compromised</i> as a result of an exchange of correspondence passing between their solicitors and an authorised agent of the bank. They averred that the totality of the letters read as a whole constituted a binding agreement in full and final settlement. Not surprisingly, the bank denied that this was a valid compromise.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">52        The Federal Court focused on the construction and the effect of the correspondence exchanged between the parties to see if “there [was] to be found in them an offer substantially accepted in terms which constitute a contract” (at 366). Citing the House of Lords decision of <i>Gibson v Manchester City Council</i> [1979] 1 WLR 294 (“<i>Gibson</i>”), the court referred to Lord Diplock’s observation in that case (at p 297) that:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">[T]here may be certain types of contract, though … exceptional, which do not fit easily into the normal analysis of a contract as being constituted by offer and acceptance; but a contract alleged to have been made by an <i>exchange of correspondence between the parties</i> in which the successive communications other than the first are in reply to one another, is not one of these. [emphasis added]</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">Adopting this approach, the Federal Court considered the chain of correspondence between the bank’s authorised agent and the respondents’ solicitors and came to the conclusion that there was a <i>valid</i> compromise in the circumstances, on the basis of <i>two</i> letters suggesting that the bank would accept shares owned by the respondents (and the transfer forms duly executed) as <i>full and final settlement</i> of the sum owed.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">53        The aforementioned paragraphs suggest (correctly, in our view) that the courts look at the <i>whole</i> course of the negotiations between both parties in order to ascertain if an agreement is reached <i>at any given point in time</i>. It should further be noted that where such a point is identified, the mere fact that negotiations are continued <i>thereafter</i> does not of itself affect the existence of the agreement <i>already concluded</i>. Of course, if the continued negotiations disclose <i>an agreed rescission</i> of an agreement already concluded, then the position is quite different.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">54        Once an agreement has been established by the court, that concludes the matter. In the Singapore High Court decision of <i>Tan Kee v The Titular Roman Catholic Archbishop of Singapore</i> <nobr>[1997] SGHC 281</nobr>, for example, G P Selvam J observed, as follows (at [31]):</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">A compromise is a settlement agreement arrived at, either in court or out of court, either before or after action, for resolving a dispute or settling a claim upon what appears to the parties, and in particular the conceder, to be fair and equitable terms, having regard to the uncertainty they are in regarding the facts or the law and facts together. <i>Once concluded neither party may resile from the compromise or settlement as that would [be] tantamount to a breach of contract and courts find such conduct unacceptable.</i> [emphasis added]</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">55        More recently, in <i>Man Financial (S) Pte Ltd v Wong Bark Chuan David</i> <nobr>[2008] 1 SLR 663</nobr>, this court considered whether a termination agreement entered into between the appellant and the respondent constituted a <i>fresh contract</i> or a <i>settlement agreement</i>, and observed (at [40]) that:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">On a more general level, we should emphasise that <i>if a particular agreement between existing contracting parties is intended to encompass or embody a settlement or compromise, it would be prudent for the parties concerned to state this clearly in the contract itself. If that is not done</i>, the court will, as in the <i>present</i> case, construe the contract concerned objectively, having regard to the relevant terms in the <i>context</i> in which they were arrived at and the substance of the contract. In the final analysis, substance is more important than form. In the present appeal, what is important is the fact that the correspondence set out above points clearly to one thing (and one thing alone): <i>The very pith and marrow of the Termination Agreement centred on the closure of the existing employment relationship between the appellant and the respondent</i>. This agreement was <i>not</i>, in other words, a contract that sought to compromise or settle <i>existing disputes</i> between the parties in respect of <i>existing covenants or clauses in restraint of trade.</i> [emphasis in original]</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">56        Indeed, the <i>objective</i> nature of the entire inquiry has been underscored in many cases. For example, in the decision of this court in <i>Aircharter World Pte Ltd v Kontena Nasional Bhd</i> <nobr>[1999] 3 SLR 1</nobr>, M Karthigesu JA noted (at [30]) that:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">Under this test [for determining whether the parties have reached an agreement], once the parties have to all outward appearances agreed in the same terms on the same subject-matter, then neither can, generally, rely on some unexpressed qualification or reservation to show that he had not in fact agreed to the terms to which he had appeared to agree. Such subjective reservations of one party, therefore, do not prevent the formation of a contract.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">57        In a similar vein, Yong Pung How CJ, also in a decision of this court in <i>Tribune Investment Trust Inc v Soosan Trading Co Ltd</i> <nobr>[2000] 3 SLR 405</nobr>, observed as follows (at [40]):</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">Indeed the task of inferring an assent and of extracting the precise moment, if at all there was one, at which a meeting of the minds between the parties may be said to have been reached is one of obvious difficulty, particularly in a case where there has been protracted negotiations and a considerable exchange of written correspondence between the parties. Nevertheless, the function of the court is to try as far as practical experience allows, to ensure that the reasonable expectations of honest men are not disappointed. To this end, it is also trite law that the test of agreement or of inferring consensus ad idem is objective. Thus, the language used by one party, whatever his real intention may be, is to be construed in the sense in which it would reasonably be understood by the other.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">58        And, in the Singapore High Court decision of <i>Chia Ee Lin Evelyn v Teh Guek Ngor Engelin née Tan</i> <nobr>[2004] 4 SLR 330</nobr>, Lai Kew Chai J held, <i>inter alia</i>, that there had been no valid compromise arrived at by the parties concerned on the facts. The learned judge emphasised the importance of the objective test which has just been referred to, as follows (at [43]):</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">As this action concerns the formation of five oral contracts of the purport to be explained later, <i>the primary test of the court when analysing the totality of the evidence, which is entirely oral, is to find if there was in each alleged oral contract an intention to enter into a binding contract</i>. It is important to note that the test of a person’s intention is not a subjective one, but an <i>objective</i> one. In other words, the intention which courts will attribute to a person is always that which that person’s conduct and words amount to when reasonably construed by a person in the position of the offeree, and not necessarily that which was present in the offeror’s mind. [emphasis added]</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">59       </span> <span lang="EN-AU">On appeal, his decision was affirmed (see the decision of this court in <i>Teh Guek Ngor Engelin n</i></span><i><span lang="EN-GB">é</span></i><i><span lang="EN-AU">e Tan v Chia Ee Lin Evelyn</span></i> <span lang="EN-AU"><nobr>[2005] 3 SLR 22</nobr>). Choo Han Teck J, delivering the judgment, noted that it was doubtful that a valid compromise had arisen given the lack of convincing evidence (at [12]):</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">In the contract of compromise that had been alleged in this case, not only was there insufficient evidence that the terms had been fully negotiated and properly communicated between, and to, the parties, <i>the communication through Dorothy Chia [a friend of the two parties] also did not appear to have been made with the intention to create a binding contract</i>, as Dorothy Chia herself regarded her conversation with Evelyn Chia as a “social call”. Where three experienced lawyers, including a Senior Counsel, were unable to <i>adduce clear evidence of a simple “drop hands” agreement, the trial judge would be entitled to dismiss the allegation of such a contract on the basis that the party relying on it had not discharged the burden of proof on a balance of probabilities.</i> That appeared to be the case here. The trial judge only go so far as to find … that Dorothy Chia “was advising both parties not to pursue their claims against the other in court”. This fits the evidence that the role played by Dorothy Chia was closer to that of an agony aunt than a contract agent. … In the circumstances, this court will not interfere with the trial judge’s finding that there was no compromise agreement. [emphasis added]</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">60        It should, however, be mentioned (in passing) that although the objective test is adopted (and is, indeed, necessary in order to enable the courts to administer legal criteria that are not inherently arbitrary), the <i>practical reality</i> is that much will depend on the precise facts before the court concerned. In particular, the court will, wherever possible, rely on relevant documents. Where, however, there is a dearth of objective criteria (such as documents), the court will nevertheless attempt its level best by examining closely (and in particular) the precise factual matrix.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">61        As alluded to above, however, the rules relating to offer and acceptance can, on occasion, be rather technical. One result is that rather fine distinctions have sometimes been drawn (see, for example, the English Court of Appeal decisions of <i>Chapelton v Barry Urban District Council</i> [1940] 1 KB 532 and <i>Thornton v Shoe Lane Parking Ltd</i> [1971] 2 QB 163). On other occasions (thankfully not often), entire contracts might even be “invented”, resulting in no small measure of artificiality (see, for example, the oft-cited House of Lords decision of <i>Clarke v The Earl of Dunraven and Mount-Earl</i> [1897] AC 59 and the English High Court decision of <i>Shanklin Pier Ld v Detel Products Ld</i> [1951] 2 KB 854). Indeed, in the Privy Council decision of <i>New Zealand Shipping Co Ltd v A M Satterthwaite &amp; Co Ltd</i> [1975] AC 154 (“<i>The Eurymedon</i>”), Lord Wilberforce, delivering the judgment of the majority of the Board, observed thus (at 167):</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">… English law, having committed itself to a rather technical and schematic doctrine of contract, in application takes a practical approach, often at the cost of forcing the facts to fit uneasily into the marked slots of offer, acceptance and consideration.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">62        It was perhaps the somewhat technical nature of the rules relating to offer and acceptance that prompted Lord Denning MR in the English Court of Appeal decision of <i>Butler Machine Tool Co Ltd v Ex-Cell-O Corporation (England) Ltd</i> [1979] 1 WLR 401 (“<i>Butler Machine Tool Co</i>”) to adopt a somewhat more fluid (and, in our view, rather radical) approach, as follows (at 404):</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">The better way is to look at all the documents passing between the parties – and glean from them, or from the conduct of the parties, whether they have reached agreement on all material points – even though there may be differences between the forms and conditions printed on the back of them.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">63        It should, however, be noted that Lord Denning was alone in advocating the above approach. The majority of the court in <i>Butler Machine Tool Co</i> adopted the traditional method of analysis, examining each “shot” which was “fired” by each of the respective parties, finding a concluded agreement only when a final and unqualified acceptance had been identified in accordance with the principles set out briefly above. It is also noteworthy that Lord Denning himself, despite advocating the broad approach referred to in the preceding paragraph, nevertheless <i>also</i> endorsed the traditional approach. More importantly, perhaps, Lord Denning’s broader approach has not really found favour with the courts and, indeed, appears to have been all but rejected in <i>Gibson</i> ([52] <i>supra</i>). Whilst it is true that the court concerned must examine the whole course of negotiations between the parties (see above at [53]), this should be effected in accordance with the concepts of offer and acceptance. What <i>is</i> required, however, is a less mechanistic or dogmatic application of these concepts and this can be achieved by having regard to the <i>context</i> in which the agreement was concluded. Looked at in this light, the traditional approach is not, in substance at least, that different from the broad approach advocated by Lord Denning. Indeed, the traditional approach is probably the approach that has hitherto been adopted in the Singapore context (see, for example, the Singapore Privy Council decision of <i>The Master Stelios</i> <nobr>[1982-1983] SLR 39</nobr> as well as the Singapore High Court decision of <i>Pac-Asian Service Pte Ltd v Westburne International Drilling Ltd</i> <nobr>[1986] SLR 390</nobr>) and, as just mentioned, we see no reason why it should not continue to be adopted (albeit with the context of the contract always being borne in mind).</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><em>Consideration</em></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">64        Another pre-requisite is that of consideration. As we shall see (in the coda to this judgment), the doctrine of consideration has been heavily criticised. There have even been calls for its abolition. However, the doctrine itself has weathered such criticism and is still a standard requirement before a valid contract can be said to have been formed.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">65        The doctrine is, however, dispensed with for contracts under <i>seal</i> (<i>ie</i>, which are concluded by way of a <i>deed</i>). This is due to historical circumstances which we need not go into in the present appeal. That this is the position in Singapore is clear (see, for example, the Singapore High Court decisions of <i>Development Bank of Singapore Ltd v Yeap Teik Leong</i> <nobr>[1988] SLR 796</nobr> at 802, [28] and <i>Hong Leong Finance Ltd v Tay Keow Neo</i> <nobr>[1992] 1 SLR 205</nobr> at 223, [59]; but <i>cf</i> with regard to covenants in restraint of trade, as to which see the (also) Singapore High Court decision of <i>Asia Polyurethane Mfg Pte Ltd v Woon Sow Liong</i> <nobr>[1990] SLR 407</nobr> at 411, [15]).</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">66        Very generally put, consideration signifies a return recognised in law which is given in exchange for the promise sought to be enforced. That is why it is stated as a matter of course that consideration must always move from the promisee to the promisor.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">67        On a more specific and precise level, the traditional definition adopted is the “benefit-detriment analysis”. It also functions as a practical approach. Although various criticisms have been levelled against it, it continues to remain the most workable of all the definitions. The most oft-cited formulation is by Lush J in the English decision of <i>Currie v Misa</i> (1875) LR 10 Exch 153 (affirmed in <i>Misa v Currie</i> (1876) 1 App Cas 554), as follows (at 162):</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">A valuable consideration, in the sense of the law, may consist either in some right, interest, profit, <i>or benefit</i> accruing to the one party, <i>or</i> some forbearance, <i>detriment</i>, loss, or responsibility, given, suffered, or undertaken by the other … [emphasis added]</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">68        An alternative definition was suggested by that great jurist, Sir Frederick Pollock, and was adopted in the House of Lords decision of <i>Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Company, Limited v Selfridge and Company, Limited</i> [1915] AC 847 at 855. It utilises the language of “purchase and sale”. In other words, the promisee “purchases” the promisor’s promise by either doing some act or by offering a counter-promise in return. Whilst this particular definition is <i>theoretically</i> attractive (and has been accepted in many quarters as the “bargain theory of consideration”), the “benefit-detriment analysis” is probably more helpful in terms of <i>practical application.</i> Indeed, there is, in our view, no <i>necessary</i> inconsistency between both definitions (as suggested in some quarters (see, for example, <i>Cheshire, Fifoot and Furmston</i> ([47] <i>supra</i>) at pp 96–97; but <i>cf</i> <i>Treitel</i> ([47] <i>supra</i>) at para 3-007), with (as just mentioned) the former focusing on the theoretical aspect and the latter focusing on the practical aspect (and leaving aside nice theoretical arguments as to whether or not the “benefit-detriment analysis” is consistent with the concept of executory consideration, which is discussed in the following paragraph).</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">69        Consideration can, of course, be either executory <i>or</i> executed. Consideration is executory when it consists in a <i>counter-promise</i>, and is executed when it consists of <i>an act</i>. The former occurs, therefore, in the context of a <i>bilateral</i> contract (where there is a counter-promise by the promisee, which constitutes (as just mentioned) the consideration for the promisor’s promise; see also the recent decision of this court in <i>Ong Chay Tong &amp; Sons (Pte) Ltd v Ong Hoo Eng</i> <nobr>[2008] SGCA 42</nobr> at [30] (“<i>Ong Chay Tong</i>”)). The latter occurs in the context of a <i>unilateral</i> contract (where (as also just mentioned) the act by the promisee constitutes the consideration for the promisor’s promise), a classic example of which can be found in the fact situation in the leading English Court of Appeal decision of <i>Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Company</i> [1893] 1 QB 256. We note that there remains some controversy as to whether or not executory consideration may contain an element of self-reference. This has, in fact, been dealt with convincingly by Prof Treitel (see <i>Treitel</i>, especially at para 3-008). However, the concept of executory consideration in the context of a bilateral contract is now too well established to admit of any doubt.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">70        There are several other legal principles, many of which will be dealt with in their application to the facts of the present appeal as well as in the coda to this judgment. At this juncture, it might be appropriate, however, to mention briefly the English Court of Appeal decision of <i>Williams v Roffey Bros &amp; Nicholls (Contractors) Ltd</i> [1991] 1 QB 1 (“<i>Williams</i>”). The importance of this particular decision lies in its endorsement of the much wider concept of consideration to the effect that a <i>practical</i> benefit or detriment (as opposed to a (narrower) <i>legal</i> benefit or detriment) could constitute sufficient consideration in law. Indeed, this principle in <i>Williams</i> has been ostensibly applied (or at least recognised) in the Singapore context (see, for example, the decision of this court in</span> <span lang="EN-GB"><i>Sea-Land Service Inc v Cheong Fook Chee Vincent</i> <nobr>[1994] 3 SLR 631</nobr> (commented upon in</span> <span lang="EN-GB">J W Carter, Andrew Phang &amp; Jill Poole, “Reactions to Williams v Roffey” (1995) 8 JCL 248 (“the Reactions article”) at 262–264); the Singapore High Court decision of <i>Teo Seng Kee Bob v a</i></span><i><span lang="EN-GB">rianecorp Ltd</span></i><span lang="EN-GB"><nobr>[2008] 3 SLR 1114</nobr> at [88]–[92]; as well as the (also) Singapore High Court decisions cited below at [96] and [97]).</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><em>Intention to create legal relations</em></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">71        There is also the requirement that there be an intention to create legal relations on the part of the parties concerned. Put simply, it must be demonstrated that there was an intention on the part of both parties that the transaction entered into was to <i>have legal effect</i> before a valid contract can be said to have been formed. Put another way, the parties must have intended that, if a disagreement arose or the contract was not honoured subsequently, the aggrieved party could invoke the assistance of the court. Much will of course depend upon the interpretation the court takes of the particular factual matrix concerned. Indeed, it has been argued that, in the light of the doctrine of consideration itself, there is no real need for a separate requirement that there be an intention to create legal relations (<i>cf</i> <i>Treitel</i> at para 4-027). However, the requirement that there be an intention to create legal relations on the part of the parties concerned is a well-established one. More importantly, perhaps, the suggestion that the doctrine of consideration is an appropriate substitute for the requirement that there be an intention to create legal relations presupposes a relatively problem-free doctrine of consideration. As we shall see in the coda to this judgment, however, that is far from being the case.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">72        It is unnecessary, for the purposes of the present appeal, to enter into a detailed discussion of this particular doctrine which (as already noted in the preceding paragraph) is, in any event, heavily dependent on the specific factual matrix concerned. It may nevertheless be observed that there are established presumptions. In particular, in <i>social and domestic</i> arrangements, there is a presumption that the parties do <i>not</i> intend to create legal relations (see, for example, the leading English Court of Appeal decision of <i>Balfour v Balfour</i> [1919] 2 KB 571). However, in <i>business and commercial</i> arrangements, there is a <i>converse</i> presumption to the effect that it is presumed that the parties <i>do</i> intend to create legal relations (see, for example, the leading English Court of Appeal decision of <i>Rose and Frank Company v J R Crompton and Brothers, Limited</i> [1923] 2 KB 261, which was affirmed by the House of Lords in <i>Rose and Frank Company v J R Crompton and Brothers, Limited</i> [1925] AC 445).</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><strong><em>Whether there was a valid compromise or settlement in the present proceedings</em></strong></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">73        Let us now apply the general principles to the facts of the present proceedings in order to ascertain whether there was a valid compromise or settlement in the present case, bearing in mind that the test is an objective one. Counsel for the defendant, Mr Tan Teng Muan (“Mr Tan”), in his written submissions, briefly alluded to the issue of the legal status of the POA and the Waiver Letter.</span><a href="#_ftn16" id="_ftnref16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB">[note: 16]</span></span></span></span></a> <span lang="EN-GB">He argued that, <i>first</i>, it was the plaintiff who had decided to link the defendant’s claim for severance pay together with the cancellation of the Trust Deed. He further averred that it was the plaintiff who required the Waiver Letter to be signed <i>before</i> the POA was executed. <i>Second</i>, he drew a distinction between a foreign contract component and a local contract component, submitting that the waiver was supposed to be limited to the defendant’s foreign contract component and that he should still be paid his local contract component. <i>Third</i>, he argued that the defendant did furnish consideration even though it did not flow to the plaintiff. He emphasised that:</span><a href="#_ftn17" id="_ftnref17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB">[note: 17]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">It is the Defendant’s case that the POA constituted a valid and binding settlement agreement between the parties and was what the Plaintiff had drawn up to settled [<i>sic</i>] both the outstanding issues of his alleged investment in the Company and the Defendant’s demands for his severance package.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">74        Counsel for the plaintiff, Mr Manjit Singh (“Mr Singh”), on the other hand, in his written submissions</span><a href="#_ftn18" id="_ftnref18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB">[note: 18]</span></span></span></span></a> <span lang="EN-GB">endorsed the Judge’s findings that <i>first</i>, there could not have been a valid compromise as the defendant had undermined this by making a fresh assertion for severance pay via his Kenyan lawyers <i>after</i> the signing of the POA. <i>Second</i>, Mr Singh argued that the Waiver Letter involved different parties and the plaintiff acted only as a representative of ASP.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-AU">75        As already mentioned earlier in this judgment, we found that both parties neglected to direct their minds in the court below to what, in our view, constituted the crux of the issue in the present proceedings, neglecting (in particular) to see the importance of the POA and the Waiver Letter being executed contemporaneously on the same day (see, further, the reference by the Judge in the GD at [94] (quoted in the next paragraph) to the fact that this was merely a “fallback argument” by counsel on behalf of the defendant).</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-AU">76        Not surprisingly, therefore, the Judge dealt with this particular issue in accordance with the importance (or, more to the point, lack thereof) with which both counsel accorded to it. As already mentioned above (at [9]), the Judge came to the conclusion that there had been no valid compromise agreement and her reasons are to be found in the GD at [94]–[95], as follows:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">Mr Tan’s fallback argument is that [the defendant] said that the POA was a compromise settlement between [the parties] having regard to the contemporaneous waiver letter that [the defendant] signed to give up all claims against ASP for any severance payments. [The defendant] explained that both the POA and the waiver letter were prepared by [the plaintiff] and [the defendant] was required to sign the waiver letter before the POA was executed. [The plaintiff] disputes this.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">Unfortunately for [the defendant], the waiver letter is irrelevant to whether he had complied with the fair-dealing rule. First, the waiver letter was <i>vis-à-vis</i> [the plaintiff] in his capacity as representative of ASP and not in his personal capacity. Thus, it could not properly be linked to the sale of [the plaintiff]’s beneficial interest. [The defendant] also failed to establish that [the plaintiff] was the alter ego of ASP. There is no evidence that [the plaintiff] was the majority shareholder in ASP much less the controlling figure in ASP. [The plaintiff] had explained that he is one of six shareholders of ASP. His shareholding, he said was less than 1% of ASP’s share capital. [The defendant] himself in an email dated 16 October 2004 recognised that ASP was not owned by [the plaintiff] alone. He mentioned there were others like “the Wongs” and “Edesa”. Second, notwithstanding the parties to the waiver letter and the POA being different, [the defendant] failed to show how signing the waiver letter satisfied the fair dealing rule. It is not enough for [the defendant] to argue that the contemporaneous waiver letter showed that the POA was a compromise on the part of [the plaintiff]. [the defendant] had to show that [the plaintiff] was fully aware that this was the case. Finally, and in any event, [the defendant]’s own denial of the contents of the waiver letter coupled with his fresh assertion through his Kenyan lawyers for severance pay even after the POA was signed completely undermines his position that the POA and waiver letter were a compromise.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-AU">77        In our view, the POA and the Waiver Letter were executed contemporaneously on the same day and this marked the crystallisation of the ongoing negotiations between both parties into a legally binding agreement in which all existing disputes between them were compromised or settled. As alluded to above (at [23]–[29]), the series of correspondence leading up to the signing of the POA and the Waiver Letter between the plaintiff and the defendant demonstrated that both parties had originally been locked in a dispute. However, as the correspondence between them progressed, both parties expressed a desire to resolve the ongoing disputes amicably and to move on with their respective lives. Viewed in this light, the POA and the Waiver Letter were concluded at a crucial point in time. Both parties</span> <span lang="EN-GB">voiced how they wished to work out an amicable solution because they were “friend[s] and strong all[ies]”.<a href="#_ftn19" id="_ftnref19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB">[note: 19]</span></span></span></a></span> <span lang="EN-AU">In</span> <span lang="EN-GB">the midst of the spate of correspondence between them, both men were weary of fighting the ongoing dispute and acknowledged, as well as recognised, their past bond as friends and business allies. On the basis of this friendship once enjoyed (and perhaps, their initial reluctance to institute legal proceedings), they sought to reconcile matters amicably rather than litigate them. The result of this intention was the POA and the Waiver Letter.</span> <span lang="EN-AU">We also note that,</span> <span lang="EN-GB">on 16 October 2004, barely ten days <i>before</i> the POA and the Waiver Letter were executed, the defendant replied to the plaintiff’s e-mail and agreed with the plaintiff that resorting to litigation “can be [a] long drawn battle” but admitted that he was “not fighting the battle”. Instead, the defendant looked forward to being called by one of the “mediators” on behalf of ASP for a final agreement.<a href="#_ftn20" id="_ftnref20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB">[note: 20]</span></span></span></a> The fact that both parties had sought to resolve their disputes by mediation also served to support this particular construction of the POA and the Waiver Letter.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">78        By way of a preliminary observation, what the parties intended – and, in our view, effected – through the POA and the Waiver Letter was a “clean break”. Perhaps such terminology (used in the context of matrimonial proceedings) is not wholly inappropriate, given the hitherto close relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant which had (unfortunately) then (to adopt the terminology of matrimonial proceedings once again) broken down irretrievably. Turning to specifics, the plaintiff promised to release the defendant from all his obligations under the Trust Deed in accordance with the terms of the POA (“the plaintiff’s promise”) in return for which the defendant would relinquish all his claims against ASP (“the defendant’s promise”). There was no doubt, in our view, that the parties clearly intended to create a legal relationship through the signing of these documents. However, did it matter (as the Judge appeared to suggest) that the <i>defendant’s</i> claims were against ASP instead of the plaintiff? One approach would be to pierce the corporate veil and state that these claims were therefore (and in effect) against the plaintiff as well. However, there was insufficient evidence to arrive at such a conclusion. In our view, this was not legally relevant in any event. Let us elaborate.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">79        It was clear – and this was borne out by the entire factual context leading to the signing of both the POA and the Waiver Letter on the same day – that the plaintiff had a more than passing interest in ensuring that the defendant’s claims against ASP were settled amicably. Indeed, as we have noted, the defendant signed the Waiver Letter at the request of the plaintiff. It was also clear, in our view, that he had done so in the light of what he (the defendant) stood to gain as a result of the plaintiff’s promise. Indeed, as we observed in the preceding paragraph, both parties would, as a result of the combined legal effect of the POA and the Waiver Letter, effect a “clean break”. However, at this juncture, it might be queried whether the defendant’s promise to relinquish his claims against ASP for severance pay constituted sufficient consideration in the eyes of the law in return for the plaintiff’s promise.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">80        In our view,</span> <span lang="EN-GB">the fact that the Waiver Letter was entered into between the defendant and ASP (and not the plaintiff) is legally irrelevant with regard to the issue as to whether or not the defendant had, by signing the Waiver Letter, furnished sufficient consideration to the plaintiff in return for the plaintiff’s promise. It is true that <i>ASP</i> stood to benefit as a result of the defendant’s signing of the Waiver Letter. <i>However</i>, this was done <i>at the request of the plaintiff</i>. Indeed, the Waiver Letter itself was <i>signed by the plaintiff</i> on behalf of ASP. The status of the plaintiff’s shareholding in ASP as well as other related matters mentioned in the GD at [95] (reproduced above at [76]) are immaterial inasmuch as the defendant had, by signing the Waiver Letter, <i>suffered a detriment at the plaintiff’s request and had thereby furnished sufficient consideration in law</i> for the plaintiff’s promise since (as already noted at [67] above), either a detriment or a benefit can constitute sufficient consideration in the eyes of the law (a point to which we will also return in some detail in the next paragraph). The fact that <i>the plaintiff</i> had not personally benefited (in an <i>obvious</i> manner) from the defendant’s signing of the Waiver Letter was not relevant in the present context; neither was the (related) fact that the request was <i>literally</i> made by the plaintiff on behalf of ASP. To elaborate, it is clear, from the correspondence between the parties set out above, that although the plaintiff was <i>literally</i> acting on behalf of ASP, he <i>also</i> had a <i>personal interest</i> in the defendant signing the Waiver Letter (and there was therefore a benefit to him, albeit in a less obvious manner). Further, one cannot, in the nature of things, look at the Waiver Letter in isolation, shorn of its context. As already mentioned, it is crucial, for the purposes of the present appeal, to view <i>both</i> the Waiver Letter <i>and</i> the POA <i>as set in their relevant context</i>. Looked at in this light, it is clear (having regard, in particular, to the fact that both documents were signed contemporaneously as well as, in general, to the correspondence referred to above) that the plaintiff clearly had a <i>personal</i> interest in requesting (and ensuring) that the defendant sign the Waiver Letter.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">81        In many contractual situations, it is true that there will be, <i>simultaneously</i>, a detriment incurred by the promisee (here, the defendant) and a benefit conferred on the promisor (here, the plaintiff). However, as already mentioned in the preceding paragraph, this need not necessarily be the case; there is sufficient consideration if there is <i>either</i> detriment incurred by the promisee (at the request of the promisor) <i>or</i> a benefit conferred by the promisee on the promisor (again, at the request of the promisor) (and see generally above at [67] as well as <i>Treitel</i> ([47] <i>supra</i>) at para 3-005). That having been said, having regard to the analysis in the preceding paragraph, it is <i>equally</i> clear, in our view, that the defendant had, by signing the Waiver Letter, <i>also</i> conferred a <i>benefit</i> on the plaintiff (having regard to the latter’s <i>personal</i> interest in the matter). This benefit was not merely factual but was also legal in nature inasmuch as the plaintiff had hitherto no legal entitlement as such <i>vis-à-vis</i> the signing of the Waiver Letter by the defendant.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">82        It should be noted, parenthetically but not unimportantly, that the element of request is necessary in order to establish a link between the parties concerned. So, for example, if the promisee chooses, of his or her own volition (and without more), to confer a benefit on the promisor, this will not constitute sufficient consideration in the eyes of the law. Likewise, if the promisee chooses, of his or her own volition, to incur a detriment, then (as the leading English Court of Appeal decision of <i>Combe v Combe</i> [1951] 2 KB 214 (“<i>Combe</i>”) clearly illustrates) that would <i>not</i> constitute sufficient consideration in the eyes of the law. In <i>Combe</i>, the plaintiff wife failed in an action against her ex-husband for a promise made by him to pay her maintenance as the court held that the fact that she had voluntarily refrained from claiming maintenance against him in a court of law did not constitute sufficient consideration because it was done entirely at her behest, with no request whatsoever coming from her ex-husband. She also failed in her claim based on promissory estoppel as the court held that the doctrine of promissory estoppel could only be used as a “shield” and not as a “sword” (see also below at [115]).</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">83        It should also be noted that an absence of linkage between the parties can also occur if the consideration is <i>past</i> – hence, the oft-cited principle that “past consideration is no consideration”. However, the courts look to the substance rather than the form. Hence, what looks at first blush like past consideration will still pass legal muster if there is, in effect, a <i>single</i> (contemporaneous) transaction (the common understanding of the parties being that consideration would indeed be furnished at the time the promisor made his or her promise to the promisee). This was established as far back as the 1615 English decision of <i>Lampleigh v Braithwait</i> (1615) Hob 105; 80 ER 255 and, whilst often referred to as an exception to the principle, is not really an exception for (as just stated) its application results in what is, in substance, a single transaction to begin with. A somewhat more recent decision is that of the English Court of Appeal in <i>In re Casey’s Patents</i> [1892] 1 Ch 104, and a modern statement of this particular legal principle can be found in the Hong Kong Privy Council decision of <i>Pao On v Lau Yiu Long</i> [1980] AC 614 (“<i>Pao On</i>”), where Lord Scarman, delivering the judgment of the Board, observed thus (at 629):</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">An act done before the giving of a promise to make a payment or to confer some other benefit can sometimes be consideration for the promise. <i>The act must have been done at the promisors’ request: the parties must have understood that the act was to be remunerated either by a payment or the conferment of some other benefit: and payment, or the conferment of a benefit, must have been legally enforceable had it been promised in advance.</i> [emphasis added]</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">84        The element of request (see above at [82]) may also be usefully noted. It bears mention that the statement of principle in <i>Pao On</i> quoted in the preceding paragraph has, in fact, been affirmed in the local context. Indeed, in the Singapore High Court decision of <i>Sim Tony v Lim Ah Ghee</i> <nobr>[1994] 3 SLR 224</nobr>, Lai Siu Chiu J also referred to this particular statement of principle (at 237, [51]) as being “one <i>apparent</i> exception” [emphasis added] to the general rule that past consideration cannot constitute sufficient consideration in law. This court affirmed Lai J’s decision and endorsed her view to the effect that a court should not take a <i>strict view from literal chronology</i> in ascertaining whether the consideration concerned was past: see <i>Sim Tony v Lim Ah Ghee</i> <nobr>[1995] 2 SLR 466</nobr>, especially at 471–472, [16].</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">85        In the present appeal, no issue of past consideration in fact arises. Both the POA as well as the Waiver Letter were in fact entered into contemporaneously and were clearly intended to constitute a contemporaneous compromise agreement.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">86        We should add that there were no other legal impediments from the perspective of the doctrine of consideration. Indeed, it has been long established that <i>legal</i> sufficiency must be <i>distinguished</i> from the <i>layperson’s</i> perception of adequacy in so far as the doctrine of consideration is concerned. In the circumstances, the court will <i>not</i> inquire into the actual adequacy of the consideration concerned so long as there is sufficient consideration furnished by the promisee in the eyes of <i>the law</i>. Indeed, as we allude to below, this somewhat artificial approach (mandated, in our view, by the perceived need of the courts to give effect to the rationale of freedom of contract) in fact contributes toward the emaciation of the doctrine of consideration itself.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">87        Other possible legal impediments relate to various situations where the promisee merely promises to perform (or performs): (a) an existing duty imposed on the promisee <i>by law</i>; or (b) an <i>existing contractual duty</i> owed to <i>a third party</i>; or (c) an <i>existing contractual duty</i> owed to the <i>same party</i> (<i>viz</i>, <i>the promisor</i>). The facts of the present appeal do <i>not</i> relate to any of these situations and we therefore say no more about them at the moment save that these situations, whilst standard “fare” for every contract textbook, are not unproblematic. In particular, situation (c) must now, apparently, be viewed quite differently in the light of recent decisions (especially that of the English Court of Appeal in <i>Williams</i> ([70] <i>supra</i>), which has been referred to briefly above (at [70]). None of these situations arises on the facts of the present appeal. However, given the difficulties engendered by each of these situations as well as the need to consider them from the perspective of possible reform when they are raised squarely for consideration by this court (or even the Legislature), we will deal with them in the briefest of fashions in a coda to the present judgment.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-AU">88        Although the defendant appeared to deny the contents of the Waiver Letter, subsequent to the signing of the POA, by making a fresh assertion through his Kenyan lawyers with regard to his claim for severance pay, it is important to note that the POA and the Waiver Letter had already been concluded and that this fresh assertion was, in any event, wholly at variance with the terms and tenor of the concluded contract between the parties and ought not, therefore, to have been taken into account. In addition, we have already noted that, after the parties had concluded their agreement, further acrimony arose and the defendant’s later actions ought to be construed in the light of these further (and unfortunate) developments. Whilst this court observed, in <i>Zurich Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd v B-Gold Interior Design &amp; Construction Pte Ltd</i></span> <span lang="EN-GB"><nobr>[2008] 3 SLR 1029</nobr> at [132(d)], that “there should be no absolute or rigid prohibition against evidence of previous negotiations or subsequent conduct”, it also observed that “such evidence is likely to be inadmissible for non-compliance” with the requirement that the parties’ intentions be objectively ascertained and the threshold requirement (in order for the court to adopt a different interpretation from that suggested by the plain language of the contract) that the context of the contract be clear and obvious. The court did also add that “the relevance of subsequent conduct remains a controversial and evolving topic that will require more extensive scrutiny by this court at a more appropriate juncture” (<i>ibid</i>). That having been said, it is clear that the subsequent conduct in the present proceedings, being in direct contradiction of the terms of the concluded contract between the parties, cannot be admitted.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">89        In the circumstances, therefore, we are of the view that the POA and the Waiver Letter constituted a valid compromise or settlement agreement between the plaintiff and the defendant.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1" xmlns=""><strong><span lang="EN-GB">Conclusion</span></strong></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">90        For the reasons set out above, we allow the appeal in CA 33/2008 and dismiss the appeal in CA 34/2008.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">91        Given the manner in which the appeals were argued and the reasoning we have adopted (particularly in relation to CA 33/2008), we are of the view that a fair costs order would be that the defendant be entitled to half of his costs in CA 33/2008 and to full costs in both CA 34/2008 and Suit No 341 of 2005. The usual consequential orders are to follow.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><strong>A coda on the doctrine of consideration</strong></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><strong><em>Introduction</em></strong></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">92        Fortunately, as can be seen from the analysis above, no fundamental difficulties with respect to the doctrine of consideration were raised on the facts of the present appeal. However, that the doctrine both continues to be an entrenched part of the Singapore contract law landscape <i>and</i> is simultaneously bedevilled by both theoretical as well as practical difficulties is well known (indeed, in the latter respect, the academic literature is prodigious and includes many pieces (and the occasional book or monograph) that focus on the theoretical foundations of the doctrine as well (see, for example, the recent comprehensive article by Roy Kreitner, “The Gift Beyond the Grave: Revisiting the Question of Consideration (2001) 101 Colum L Rev 1876)); indeed, the doctrine has also been the occasion for the clash of intellectual titans (see the now classic debate between Prof P S Atiyah, <i>Consideration in Contracts: A Fundamental Restatement</i> (Australian National University Press, 1971) (an inaugural lecture which has since been reprinted as “Consideration: A Restatement” in P S Atiyah, <i>Essays on Contract</i> (Clarendon Press, 1986), Essay 8, pp 179–243 (which also contains a <i>further</i> response to Prof Treitel’s article, below)) and Prof G H Treitel, “Consideration: A Critical Analysis of Professor Atiyah’s Fundamental Restatement” (1976) 50 ALJ 439). Despite the copious academic literature (only a small sampling of which will be referred to below), empirical evidence is – not surprisingly – lacking. Nevertheless, the dearth of cases on the doctrine thus far might be some indication, <i>ceteris paribus</i>, that the doctrine might now be outmoded or even redundant, and that its functions may well be met by more effective alternatives.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">93        We do <i>not</i> propose to delve into the issue of possible <i>reform</i> as it does not arise before us. Suffice it to state that, as far back as 1937, the UK Law Revision Committee (“the UK Committee”) was highly critical of the doctrine and came very close to recommending the <i>abolition</i> of the doctrine itself (see Law Revision Committee, <i>Sixth Interim Report (Statute of Frauds and the Doctrine of Consideration</i> (Cmd 5449, 1937) (“the Report”). However, the doctrine is still with us almost eight decades later. And it has had some of the staunchest of supporters (see, for example, K O Shatwell, “The Doctrine of Consideration in the Modern Law” (1954) 1 Syd LR 289), some of whom have roundly criticised the Report (see, for example, C J Hamson, “The Reform of Consideration” (1938) 54 LQR 233). Equally, though, the doctrine has also had some of its staunchest detractors (see, for example, Lord Wright, “Ought the Doctrine of Consideration to be Abolished from the Common Law?” (1936) 49 Harv L Rev 1225 (although it should be pointed out that the learned author was also the chairman of the UK Committee)). There are some who have adopted a “middle view”, advocating abolition of the doctrine only in relation to the modification of existing contracts (see, for example, Tan Cheng Han, “Contract Modifications, Consideration and Moral Hazard” (2005) 17 SAcLJ 566).</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">94        We will, however, set out (in the briefest of fashions) the principal <i>difficulties</i> which exist as well as the main alternatives that are available to the court when the issue of reform does squarely arise before this court in the future (we would add, parenthetically, that these issues would also be of direct relevance should a <i>legislative</i> approach be adopted instead). Before proceeding to do so, however, an equally brief summary of the history and rationale of the doctrine will be attempted, for it is only by understanding the past that we may know where we are (here, in the midst of difficulties) and (more importantly) where we might be going (here, the possible alternatives).</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">95        That having been said, the doctrine of consideration has, in fact, been commented on (albeit <i>obiter</i>) in two recent Singapore High Court judgments.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">96        In the first, <i>Chwee Kin Keong v Digilandmall.com Pte Ltd</i> <nobr>[2004] 2 SLR 594</nobr> (affirmed on appeal in <i>Chwee Kin Keong v Digilandmall.com Pte Ltd</i> <nobr>[2005] 1 SLR 502</nobr> without considering this particular issue), V K Rajah JC observed thus (at [139]):</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">Next, the defendant contends that no</span> <span lang="EN-GB">consideration passed from the plaintiffs to them. The credit card payments had not been processed. No cash had been collected. Consideration was less than executory and non-existent. This contention is wholly untenable. The modern approach in contract law requires very little to find the existence of consideration. Indeed, in difficult cases, the courts in several common law jurisdictions have gone to extraordinary lengths to conjure up consideration. (See for example the approach in <i>Williams v Roffey Bros</i> <i>&amp; Nicholls (Contractors) Ltd</i> [1990] 1 All ER 512.) No modern authority was cited to me suggesting an intended <i>commercial transaction of this nature</i> could ever fail for want of consideration. Indeed, the time may have come for the common law to shed the pretence of searching for consideration to uphold commercial contracts. The marrow of contractual relationships should be the parties’ intention to create a legal relationship. Having expressed my views on consideration, I should also add for good measure that, in any event, there is ample consideration. There was a promise to pay made by the plaintiffs in exchange for the delivery of the requisite laser printers. Mutual promises, by all accounts, on the basis of existing case law, more than amply constitute consideration. [emphasis in original]</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">97        In a similar vein, in the second decision, <i>Sunny Metal &amp; Engineering Pte Ltd v Ng Khim Ming Eric</i> <nobr>[2007] 1 SLR 853</nobr> (“<i>Sunny Metal</i>”), it was observed as follows (at [28]–[30]):</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">28         The doctrine of consideration was similarly not an issue because the Deed was precisely that – a contract under seal and which, under current Singapore law, does not require consideration (see, for example, the Singapore High Court decisions of <i>Development Bank of Singapore Ltd v Yeap Teik Leong</i> <nobr>[1988] SLR 796</nobr> at [28] and <i>Hong Leong Finance Ltd v Tay Keow Neo</i> <nobr>[1992] 1 SLR 205</nobr> at [59]). In any event, as the Deed itself points out, consideration <i>was</i> furnished. As a matter of general observation, it should be noted that the doctrine of consideration itself, although long established, has come under increasing fire – especially in recent years. For example, in the Singapore High Court decision of <i>Chwee Kin Keong v Digilandmall.com Pte Ltd</i> <nobr>[2004] 2 SLR 594</nobr> (“<i>Digilandmall</i>”), affirmed on appeal in <i>Chwee Kin Keong v Digilandmall.com Pte Ltd</i> <nobr>[2005] 1 SLR 502</nobr> without considering this particular issue, V K Rajah JC (as he then was) observed, as follows (at [139]):</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">[the passage quoted in the preceding paragraph]</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">29<b>        </b> Indeed, the doctrine of consideration may be outmoded even outside the context of purely commercial transactions, even though commercial transactions constitute (admittedly) the paradigm example where the doctrine ought to be abolished. To elaborate, on a more general level, there exists, first, the somewhat inconsistent approaches adopted between situations where it is sought to enforce a promise to pay more (see, for example, the leading English decisions of <i>Stilk v Myrick</i> (1809) 2 Camp 317 and <i>Williams v Roffey Bros &amp; Nicholls (Contractors) Ltd</i> [1991] 1 QB 1) and where it is sought to enforce a promise to take less (see, for example, the leading English decisions of <i>Foakes v Beer</i> (1884) 9 App Cas 605 and <i>Re Selectmove</i> [1995] 1 WLR 474). The present situation in Singapore is also not unambiguously clear in this regard (see the Court of Appeal decision of <i>Sea-Land Service Inc v Cheong Fook Chee Vincent</i> <nobr>[1994] 3 SLR 631</nobr>, where <i>Williams v Roffey Bros &amp; Nicholls (Contractors) Ltd</i> was ostensibly applied).</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">30         More importantly, perhaps, the combined effect of <i>Williams v Roffey Bros &amp; Nicholls (Contractors) Ltd</i> (to the effect that a <i>factual</i>, as opposed to a legal, benefit or detriment is sufficient consideration) and the well-established proposition that consideration must be sufficient but need not be adequate (see, for example, the Singapore Court of Appeal decision of <i>Wong Fook Heng v Amixco Asia Pte Ltd</i> <nobr>[1992] 2 SLR 342</nobr> at 348, [23]) is that (as Rajah JC had pointed out in <i>Digilandmall</i> (see [28] above)) it will, absent exceptional circumstances, be all too easy to locate some element of consideration between contracting parties. This would render the requirement of consideration otiose or redundant, at least for the most part. On the other hand, there are other possible alternatives available that can perform the tasks that the doctrine of consideration is intended to effect. These include the requirement of writing, as well as the doctrines of promissory estoppel, economic duress and undue influence (for these two last-mentioned doctrines, in the context of the modification of existing legal obligations). However, the doctrine of consideration in general, and its possible abolition or reform in particular, does not, thankfully, arise for decision on the facts of the present proceedings.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">[emphasis in original]</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">Reference may also be made to the recent decision of this court in <i>Ong Chay Tong</i> ([69] <i>supra</i> at [29]).</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><strong><em>History and rationale</em></strong></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">98        It is now generally accepted that the precise historical origins of the doctrine of consideration are not entirely clear (see, for example, the excellent summary by Prof A W B Simpson in <i>Cheshire, Fifoot and Furmston</i> ([47] <i>supra</i>) at p 10 and, by the same author, <i>A History of the Common Law of Contract – The Rise of the Action of Assumpsit</i> (Clarendon Press, 1987) at chs IV–VII as well as C H S Fifoot, <i>History and Sources of the Common Law – Tort and Contract</i> (Stevens &amp; Sons Limited, 1949) at ch 16 and the perceptive essay by J L Barton, “The Early History of Consideration” (1969) 85 LQR 372). The “modern” view is, however, less contentious and is, in any event, consistent with the circumstances of Singapore (see s 3(2) of the Application of English Law Act (Cap 7A, 1994 Rev Ed); put simply, the “modern” purpose of the doctrine of consideration is to <i>put some legal limits on the enforceability of agreements, even where they would otherwise be legally binding</i>. As Prof Atiyah observed ([92] <i>supra</i> at p 181), “[s]ince it is unthinkable that any legal system could enforce <i>all</i> promises it has always been necessary for the courts to decide which promises they would enforce” [emphasis in original]. In a similar vein, Prof Reiter emphatically put it thus (see B J Reiter, “Courts, Consideration, and Common Sense” (1977) 27 UTLJ 439 at 439–440):</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">Our legal system does not enforce all promises. This is hardly surprising: no legal system has ever enforced all promises and no legal system ever will. …</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">There are good reasons for not attaching the sanctions of law to all promises. It would be impractical, if not impossible, to enforce every promise. …</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">It is therefore essential that some rational process be developed to identify which interests of which promises will be protected by the law and which will not.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">99        However, if this is the case, then a related issue (already alluded to) is whether or not there exist possible <i>alternatives</i> that are more appropriate (and which are dealt with briefly below at [111]–[116]).</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><strong><em>Difficulties</em></strong></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">100      The very practical difficulties generated by <i>Williams</i> ([70] <i>supra</i>) have taken centre stage in recent times and have, in fact, been referred to in <i>Sunny Metal</i> ([97] <i>supra</i>), where it was observed (at [30]) that (see also above at [91]):</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">[T]he combined effect of <i>Williams v Roffey Bros &amp; Nicholls (Contractors) Ltd</i> (to the effect that a factual, as opposed to a legal, benefit or detriment is sufficient consideration) and the well-established proposition that consideration must be sufficient but need not be adequate (see, for example, the Singapore Court of Appeal decision of <i>Wong Fook Heng v Amixco Asia Pte Ltd</i> <span class="Judg-Quote-1Char"><nobr>[1992] 2 SLR 342</nobr></span> at 348, [23]) is that (as Rajah JC had pointed out in <i>Digilandmall</i> …) it will, absent exceptional circumstances, be all too easy to locate some element of consideration between contracting parties. This would render the requirement</span> <span lang="EN-GB">of consideration otiose or redundant, at least for the most part.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">101      It ought to be noted, at this juncture, that the concept of a factual (as opposed to a legal) benefit or detriment is not new. Although ostensibly appearing in judicial form for the first time in <i>Williams</i>, it was referred to by two authors as far back as 1965 (see F M B Reynolds &amp; G H Treitel, “Consideration for the Modification of Contracts” (1965) 7 Mal L Rev 1). Be that as it may, <i>Williams</i> has, by introducing the concept of a factual benefit or detriment, led (in conjunction with the rule that consideration must be sufficient but need not be adequate) to a practical redundancy (in the main, at least), as noted in the passage quoted in the preceding paragraph. It comes, therefore, as no surprise that <i>Williams</i> has been the subject of a copious amount of academic commentary and critique (see, for example, Brian Coote, “Consideration and Benefit in Fact and in Law” (1990) 3 JCL 23; Roger Halson, “Sailors, Sub-Contractors and Consideration” (1990) 106 LQR 183; and John Adams &amp; Roger Brownsword, “Contract, Consideration and the Critical Path” (1990) 53 MLR 536). It has also elicited a number of judicial responses from other Commonwealth jurisdictions (see generally the Reactions article ([70] <i>supra</i>); reference may also be made to the New South Wales Court of Appeal decisions of <i>Tinyow v Lee</i> <nobr>[2006] NSWCA 80</nobr> at [61] and <i>Dome Resources NL v Silver</i> <nobr>[2008] NSWCA 322</nobr> at [63]–[68] as well as John Burrows, Jeremy Finn &amp; Stephen Todd, <i>Law of Contract in New Zealand</i> (LexisNexis NZ Limited, 3rd Ed, 2007) at pp 114–117).</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">102      It should also be noted that <i>Williams</i> related to the attempt by the promisee to enforce a promise by the promisor to <i>pay more</i>. There is another possible situation which relates, instead, to the attempt by the promisee to enforce a promise by the promisor to <i>take less</i> – in other words, the promisor accepts part payment in discharge of the entire debt owed by the promisee. The classic decision is, of course, that of the House of Lords in <i>Foakes v Beer</i> (1884) 9 App Cas 605 (which premised its decision, in turn, on the seminal decision in <i>Pinnel’s Case</i> (1602) 5 Co Rep 117a; 77 ER 237). There was, in fact, a powerful judgment by Lord Blackburn in <i>Foakes v Beer</i> which (not unlike the approach in <i>Williams</i>) adopted a very practical approach. However, the learned law lord ultimately relented and agreed with the decision of the rest of the House. It should be observed that the decision in <i>Foakes v Beer</i> itself may not have been on sure substantive ground in following <i>Pinnel’s Case</i>, as the latter may have been decided on a point of pleading and has, in any event, been subject to not inconsiderable criticism (see, for example, Michael Lobban, “<i>Foakes v Beer</i> (1884)” in <i>Landmark Cases in the Law of Contract</i> (Hart Publishing, 2008) (Charles Mitchell &amp; Paul Mitchell eds) ch 8, especially at pp 227–230 and 241–243 (as well as the literature and case law cited therein), which chapter also contains a valuable historical perspective of this famous decision; <i>contra</i> Janet O’Sullivan, “In Defence of <i>Foakes</i> v. <i>Beer</i>” <nobr>[1996] CLJ 219</nobr>).</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">103      However, the English Court of Appeal in <i>In re Selectmove Ltd</i> [1995] 1 WLR 474 refused to extend the holding in <i>Williams</i> to the situation where part-payment is taken as discharge of the entire debt owed (reference may also be made to the recent English Court of Appeal decision of <i>Collier v P &amp; M J Wright (Holdings) Ltd</i> [2008] 1 WLR 643 (“<i>Collier</i>”), where, however, the court held that there was a triable issue on promissory estoppel which would operate as an exception to the rule in <i>Foakes v Beer</i> (this case is also noted in Richard Austen-Baker, “A Strange Sort of Survival for <i>Pinnel’s Case: Collier</i> v <i>P &amp; M J Wright (Holdings) Limited</i>” (2008) 71 MLR 611)). It would in fact have required no great leap of logic – let alone faith – to have extended the holding in <i>Williams</i> to a <i>Foakes v Beer</i> situation (see also Edwin Peel, “Part Payment of a Debt is No Consideration” (1994) 110 LQR 353 at 355; <i>contra</i> O’Sullivan, <i>supra</i>). The court in <i>In re Selectmove Ltd</i> was, it should be observed, bound by the House of Lords decision in <i>Foakes v Beer</i>. No such constraint exists, of course, in the Singapore context. This furnishes yet another string to the legal bow of those who would seek the abolition of the doctrine of consideration.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">104      <i>Williams</i>, as already alluded to above, related to a situation where there was the promise to perform (or the performance of) an existing duty owed to the <i>same</i> party. There are also two other situations which have been alluded to above (at [87]).</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">105      The first relates to the promise to perform (or the performance of) an existing duty imposed by <i>law</i> (the oft-cited case in this regard is the House of Lords decision in <i>Glasbrook Brothers, Limited v Glamorgan County Council</i> [1925] AC 270 (“<i>Glasbrook</i>”)). The general rule is that the mere performance of such a public duty imposed by law does not, without more, constitute sufficient consideration in law for the promisor’s promise. If, however, something <i>extra</i> is furnished by the promisee, this would constitute sufficient consideration in law.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">106      Two observations may be made with respect to this particular situation. The first is that if the <i>same</i> <i>approach</i> is adopted as in <i>Williams</i> (which related to a different situation concerning the promise to perform (or the performance of) an existing duty owed to the same party), then it would of course be easy to locate consideration in virtually every fact situation since (as we have already noted) factual benefit or detriment is not difficult to locate. We pause here to further observe that it could be argued – at a <i>threshold</i> level – that <i>Williams</i> ought <i>not</i> to apply to such a situation in the first instance on the basis that “it is in fact at variance with the very principle underlying [<i>Glasbrook</i>] itself which stands for the completely contrary point: there is no consideration because only if the duty is exceeded is there legal benefit or detriment” (see the Reactions article ([70] <i>supra</i>) at 267). It should also be noted, in this regard, that <i>Glasbrook</i>, being a decision of the House of Lords, would generate (in <i>England</i>) issues of precedent similar to those considered briefly above (at [102]) in relation to <i>Foakes v Beer</i>. However, as already noted, no such constraint exists in the Singapore context and there is hence no legal impediment from the perspective of precedent preventing the Singapore courts from extending the reach of <i>Williams</i> to such a situation as well, should it be minded to do so.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">107      The second observation is this: A close look at this particular situation in general and <i>Glasbrook</i> in particular demonstrates that the <i>broader</i> concept of <i>public policy</i> is an important consideration (in particular, the danger (or even the actual effecting) of extortion by public authorities (as was the case in <i>Glasbrook</i>)). Looked at in this particular light, the <i>alternative</i> doctrine of <i>economic duress</i> might well prove to be an appropriate <i>replacement</i> for the doctrine of consideration itself (of this, more later: see generally below at [111]–[114]). Indeed, it should be noted that <i>even if</i> the doctrine of consideration is <i>retained</i>, the doctrine of economic duress could still override it inasmuch as even if consideration is located in a technical sense, economic duress may nevertheless operate to render the contract concerned voidable.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">108      The second situation relates to the promise to perform (or the performance of) an existing duty owed to a <i>third party</i>. In this regard, the existing case law suggests that this is sufficient consideration in law (see generally the relatively recent Privy Council decisions of <i>The Eurymedon</i> ([61] <i>supra</i>) and <i>Pao On</i> ([83] <i>supra</i>) (the latter case of which was applied by Lai Siu Chiu JC in the Singapore High Court decision of <i>SSAB Oxelosund AB v Xendral Trading Pte Ltd</i> <nobr>[1992] 1 SLR 600</nobr>); see also the classic survey by A G Davis, “Promises to Perform an Existing Duty” (1938) 6 CLJ 202). And, as Prof A L Goodhart put it (in “Performance of an Existing Duty as Consideration” (1956) 72 LQR 490 at 493):</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">On the other hand, the performance of a duty to a third person can be regarded as furnishing adequate consideration without running the risk that the promisee may bring improper pressure to bear in obtaining the promise. The promisor clearly obtains a benefit to which he was not previously entitled, so that there is every reason to hold that he should be bound to perform his own promise. On this point the English and the American cases are in accord.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">Indeed, the observation just quoted suggests that the sufficiency of consideration in such a situation is premised on the concept of <i>legal</i></span> <span lang="EN-GB">benefit or detriment (as opposed to a <i>factual</i> benefit or detriment), thus rendering reliance on <i>Williams</i> (in the context of the latter concept of benefit or detriment) redundant. On the other hand, however, there is nothing that prevents the Singapore courts from extending the reach of <i>Williams</i> to such a situation either (see generally the analysis in the Reactions article (at 267–269)).</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">109      When compared to the preceding situation (<i>viz</i>, that relating to a public duty imposed on the promisee by law), the question naturally arises as to why the courts are more liberal in locating sufficient consideration in <i>this</i> situation – whereas in the preceding situation, something <i>extra</i> must be done (see also above at [105]). It may well be the case that the courts are less strict in the present situation because the danger (or even the actual effecting) of extortion is <i>relatively less</i> compared to a situation where a public duty is imposed on the promisee by law. Again, however, if the same approach towards consideration is adopted as that in <i>Williams</i>, it would, in any event, be very easy to locate consideration as the inquiry is premised on a merely <i>factual</i> (and not legal) basis. Nevertheless, the danger of extortion <i>even in this situation</i> is possible and therefore cannot be ignored completely. In this regard, the doctrine of economic duress would <i>still</i> have a role to play in appropriate fact situations.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">110      It remains to be observed that if the principle in <i>Williams</i> is extended to cover <i>all</i> the three situations discussed above, the issue, <i>inter alia</i>, of the abolition of the doctrine of consideration (briefly alluded to above) would become an even more pronounced one.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><strong><em>Possible alternatives</em></strong></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><em>The alternatives stated</em></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">111      It is axiomatic, in our view, that if the doctrine of consideration is indeed abolished (whether judicially or legislatively), the function it has hitherto performed must be fulfilled by alternative doctrines (<i>cf</i> also Richard Hooley, “Consideration and the Existing Duty” <nobr>[1991] JBL 19</nobr>). There have been a number of suggestions (principally in the academic literature) which we cannot obviously canvass in any detail in the present judgment (see, for example, K C T Sutton, <i>Consideration Reconsidered: Studies on the Doctrine of Consideration of the Law of Contract</i> (University of Queensland Press, 1974) at Pt IV; and for an early American perspective, see Edwin W Patterson, “An Apology for Consideration” (1958) 58 Colum L Rev 929 at 956–963). These have been briefly alluded to in <i>Sunny Metal</i> ([97] <i>supra</i>) and include the doctrine of promissory estoppel (see, for example, Dan Halyk, “Consideration, Practical Benefits and Promissory Estoppel: Enforcement of Contract Modification Promises in Light of <i>Williams</i> v. <i>Roffey Brothers</i>” (1991) 55 Sask L Rev 393 and Norma J Hird &amp; Ann Blair, “Minding your own Business – <i>Williams v. Roffey</i> Re-visited: Consideration Re-considered” <nobr>[1996] JBL 254</nobr>; <i>cf</i> also <i>per</i> Glidewell LJ in <i>Williams</i> itself (at 13) as well as <i>Collier</i> ([103] <i>supra</i>)) and the doctrine of economic duress (see, for example, <i>per</i> Hobhouse J in <i>The Alev</i> [1989] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 138 at 147 as well as Lee Pey Woan, “Consideration” in <i>Basic Principles of Singapore Business Law</i> (Thomson, 2004) (Andrew Phang gen ed) ch 3 at paras 3.42–3.43; and <i>cf per</i> Glidewell LJ in <i>Williams</i> itself (at 16), but where the doctrine of economic duress (as well as fraud) were mentioned <i>in addition to</i> the doctrine of consideration (see also below at [114])).</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">112      Indeed, given the at least possible linkages between economic duress on the one hand and undue influence and unconscionability on the other (see <i>Cheshire, Fifoot and Furmston’s Law of Contract – Second Singapore and Malaysia Edition</i> (Butterworths Asia, 1998) (“<i>Cheshire, Fifoot and Furmston – Singapore and Malaysia Edition</i>”), especially at pp 558–559 and 566 (and the literature cited therein) as well as David Capper, “Undue Influence and Unconscionability: A Rationalisation” (1998) 114 LQR 479), there is no reason in principle why undue influence and unconscionability ought not also to be potential alternatives (although unconscionability is still a fledgling doctrine in the Commonwealth law of contract). This approach was in fact adopted by Santow J in the New South Wales decision of <i>Musumeci v Winadell Pty Ltd</i> (1994) 34 NSWLR 723 at 747.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">113      On a more general level, the doctrines of economic duress, undue influence and unconscionability appear to be more clearly suited not only to modern commercial circumstances but also (more importantly) to situations where there has been possible “extortion”. There is also the proposal of the UK Committee to the effect that consideration is merely evidence of a serious intention to contract, with the result that it should not be required where the promise itself is in writing.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><em>The difficulties</em></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">114      We pause to observe, if only in the briefest of fashions, that the possible alternatives to the doctrine of consideration set out so very cursorily in the preceding paragraphs are <i>themselves</i> subject to <i>their own specific difficulties</i>. For example, the fledgling nature of the doctrine of unconscionability was mentioned in [112] above. The doctrine of undue influence, however, has been relatively well established in the landscape of the common law of contract, although the doctrine of economic duress (being of very recent origin by common law standards (and see, in this regard, the English High Court decision of <i>The Siboen and the Sibotre</i> [1976] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 293)) stands somewhere in the “middle” (being not without difficulties of its own).</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">115      On the other hand, the doctrine of promissory estoppel still contains pockets of controversy. One issue that arises is whether it can be used as a “sword” (<i>ie</i>, as a cause of action in and of itself) or merely as a “shield” (<i>ie</i>, merely as a defence, which (it should be noted) applies (depending on the precise facts) equally to plaintiffs and defendants alike). Reference may be made, in the former regard, to the oft-cited Australian High Court decision of <i>Waltons Stores (Interstate) Limited v Maher</i> (1988) 164 CLR 387 (<i>cf</i> the present English position which now evinces the possibility, at least, of the more liberal Australian position (see the English Court of Appeal decision of <i>Baird Textiles Holdings Ltd v Marks &amp; Spencer plc</i> [2002] 1 All ER (Comm) 737), the strict (English) position (that the doctrine could only be used as a shield and not as a sword) being set out (most famously perhaps) in the (also) English Court of Appeal decision of <i>Combe</i> ([82] <i>supra</i>)). To take another example, the role of the concept of detriment may still need further elaboration (see <i>Cheshire, Fifoot and Furmston – Singapore and Malaysia Edition</i> ([112] <i>supra</i>) at pp 202–205). Finally, the issue as to whether or not the doctrine of promissory estoppel is only suspensory in operation may also require further consideration (see <i>id</i> at pp 199–201).</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">116      Indeed, even in the context of <i>proprietary</i> estoppel, the law has not been static (see, for example, the very recent House of Lords decision of <i>Cobbe v Yeoman’s Row Management Ltd</i> [2008] 1 WLR 1752). Finally, the UK Committee’s proposal to the effect that consideration should not be required where the promise concerned is in writing is also not free from difficulties (see Andrew Phang, “Consideration at the Crossroads” (1991) 107 LQR 21 at 23). All this having been said, it is almost inevitable that no doctrine is immune from its own specific difficulties although, from a <i>relative</i> perspective, the courts would be wise to utilise only those doctrines with relatively fewer difficulties.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><em>A pragmatic approach?</em></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">117      Because so much academic ink has been spilt on the doctrine of consideration over so very many decades (with no concrete action being taken) and because there is (as we have noted at [92] above) such a dearth of cases on the doctrine itself, it would appear that any proposed reform of the doctrine is much ado about nothing. Indeed, the doctrine of consideration is (notwithstanding the numerous critiques of it) nevertheless still (as also noted) an established part of not only the Singapore landscape in particular but also the common law landscape in general. Not surprisingly, it is a standard topic in all the contract textbooks. In short, it cannot be ignored. However, because the doctrine of consideration <i>does</i> contain certain basic weaknesses which have been pointed out, <i>in extenso</i>, in the relevant legal literature, it almost certainly needs to be reformed. The basic difficulties and alternatives have been set out briefly above but will need to be considered in much greater detail when the issue next comes squarely before this court. One major difficulty lies in the fact that a legal mechanism must be maintained that will enable the courts to effectively and practically ascertain which promises ought to be enforceable. Hence, even if the doctrine of consideration is abolished, an alternative (or alternatives) must take its place. There then arises the question as to whether or not the alternatives themselves are sufficiently well established in order that they might furnish the requisite legal guidance to the courts. In this regard, it is significant to note that the various alternatives briefly mentioned above <i>are (apart from the requirement of writing) already a part of Singapore law</i>.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">118      In the circumstances, maintenance of the status quo (<i>viz</i>, the availability of both (a somewhat dilute) doctrine of consideration <i>as well as</i> the alternative doctrines canvassed above) may well be the <i>most practical</i> solution inasmuch as it will afford the courts <i>a range of legal options</i> to achieve a just and fair result in the case concerned. However, problems of <i>theoretical</i> coherence may remain and are certainly intellectually challenging (as the many perceptive pieces and even books and monographs clearly demonstrate). Nevertheless, given the long pedigree of the doctrine, the fact that no single doctrine is wholly devoid of difficulties, and (more importantly) the need for a legal mechanism to ascertain which promises the courts will enforce, the “theoretical untidiness” may well be acceptable in the light of the existing practical advantages (though <i>cf</i> the Reactions article ([70] <i>supra</i> at 265)). However, this is obviously a provisional view only as the issue of reform was not before the court in the present appeal.</span></p>
