She could not enter the Studio Unit because the access code to the main door had been changed without her knowledge. She called Nicholas, who told her to go to the guardhouse of My Manhattan. The fourth defendant was waiting there with police officers and a security guard. The fourth defendant demanded the return of the keys to the Studio Unit. The plaintiff requested to return to the Studio Unit to take her cheque book to make payment of outstanding rent. The fourth defendant refused. The policemen who were there told the plaintiff that she had no right to go into the premises without permission. She “did not want to hand over” her keys but the police officer took the keys from her hand and handed them over to the fourth defendant.

The fourth defendant demanded payment of $4,600 as outstanding rent for the months of May and June 2019. The plaintiff told the fourth defendant that she would pay the sums demanded the next day to enable her to enter the premises to collect her belongings.

She feared for her safety when she tried to serve her Small Claims Tribunal (“SCT”) summons on the plaintiff. The fourth defendant called the police and waited at the guardhouse of My Manhattan. The fourth defendant requested one of the security guards to look for the plaintiff and to bring her to the guardhouse. At about 10.40pm, a security guard went to look for the plaintiff. The security guard returned and said he could not find her. The fourth defendant went to the lift lobby of Blk 29 of My Manhattan, where the Studio Unit was, and saw the plaintiff come out of the lift. At Blk 31 of My Manhattan, the fourth defendant served the plaintiff with the SCT summons. The security guard suggested that they move to the carpark. The police spoke to the plaintiff. The plaintiff made a phone call. The security guard tried to advise the plaintiff to leave to keep the peace. The plaintiff handed over her keys and access cards to the security guard. The security guard then handed them to the fourth defendant.

He also reminded her that she could use her access card to enter. She then hung up. He denies having told the plaintiff to go to the guardhouse. He was not around at the time of the confrontation between the plaintiff and the fourth defendant that night.

</div> Both contentions of the plaintiff conflict with each other. Nevertheless, I will address them both.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 With respect to the first contention, the plaintiff raises two points. First, the plaintiff questions why Nicholas and the fourth defendant slid the notices under the door instead of sending them to her <span class="font-italic">via</span> e-mail. However, there is evidence that Nicholas had previously slid the plaintiff’s mail under her door and that the plaintiff was agreeable to this.

</div>
</div> Second, the plaintiff points out that the amount sought in the Three Notices, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> $5,830, is the exact same amount as that the fourth defendant claimed against the plaintiff in her SCT summons. This shows that the Three Notices were drawn up only after the SCT summons. However, Nicholas testified in his AEIC and on the stand, that the amount in the Three Notices was calculated with the possibility of a SCT summons in mind. I accept Nicholas’ testimony.

</div> His evidence is supported by the fact that, although the 1st Notice stated that the landlord would exercise the right of repossession as of 18 May 2019 (see [9] above), this was not acted on. Instead, the plaintiff was served with the 2nd Notice on 18 May 2019, which reiterated that the landlord would exercise his right to repossession with immediate effect (see [10] above). Again, this was not acted on. When the plaintiff did not pay her rental on 18 May 2019, as required under her TA, the landlord did not take steps to exercise his right to repossession. Instead, the landlord gave the plaintiff the 3rd Notice on 21 May 2019 informing the plaintiff that she had three days to return the access cards and keys (see [11] above). The defendants did not take action to repossess the Studio Unit on the basis of the Three Notices. Instead, they applied for a SCT summons and served it on the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 I therefore find that the Three Notices were slid under the plaintiff’s door on 5, 18 and 21 May 2019 respectively. I also find that they were not prepared for the purpose of retaking possession of the studio unit, but were meant to warn the plaintiff to behave and to make payment of the rent on time.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 In any event, the defendants are not relying on the Three Notices for the termination of the TA. They instead rely on the plaintiff’s surrender of possession of the Studio Unit on the night of 22 May 2019. In this regard, it is also the plaintiff’s case that the wrongful termination occurred on 22 May 2019. It is to the events on the night of 22 May 2019 that I now turn.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the plaintiff was able to enter the Studio Unit on 22 May 2019</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 The first key difference between the plaintiff’s and the defendants’ case about the night of 22 May 2019, relates to whether the plaintiff was able to enter the Studio Unit that night.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 The plaintiff’s evidence is that she was not able to enter the main door on the night of 22 May 2019, as the defendants had changed the access code.

From the CCTV recordings, the plaintiff entered the lift at the ground floor lift lobby at 22:39:51 and came out of another lift at the ground floor lift lobby at 22:55:11.

And because, at that time, I was still trying to call him, I was not in the mood to talk, I was also trying to call him, but the signal was not very good, so the lady said, “Why don’t you come up with me on the seventh floor, it might be better?” So I exited onto the seventh floor. And I continued trying to call, and the lady saw that I was very anxious, and then she asked me what happened, so I told her briefly. And still, I kept trying to call.

Inspector Tan said that the police would not be in a position to and would not have forced the plaintiff to hand over the access cards and keys, which is what the plaintiff alleges they did.

I hence reject the plaintiff’s version of the events and find that the police did not forcefully take the access cards and keys from the plaintiff’s hands. While the defendants did not call the security guard to corroborate the fourth defendant’s evidence, it is for the plaintiff to prove her case on the balance of probabilities, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> that her access cards and keys were forcefully taken away from her by the police, rather than surrendered by her. In the premises, I find the fourth defendant’s version to be more likely, which is that the plaintiff handed over the access cards and keys to the security guard, who then passed them over to the fourth defendant.

Due to the absence of the original photographs on the phone where they were taken, Tan S W was not able to perform any comparison to determine the exact modifications that took place on 8 June 2019.

</div> Again, if the defendants had gone to the trouble and expense of hiring a vendor to do that for IMG_1030.jpg, there is little reason why this would not have also been done for the remaining 26 Photographs.

But that was not done. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Given the above, on balance, I find it more likely than not that the Photographs were created on the date indicated in the metadata of the Photographs. The Photographs however, are not conclusive of the issue, as they only show the state of the Studio Unit at the time they were taken, which was around mid-day of 23 May 2019.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 I find that the plaintiff’s payment and text message to Nicholas on 23 May 2019 do not help to prove that her belongings were indeed in the Studio Unit. First, they do not provide direct evidence that any of the belongings were in the Studio Unit at the material time. Second, the main component of value of the plaintiff’s belongings is the jewellery, and her evidence on the jewellery is contradictory, as highlighted above. Taking her own evidence as it stands, it is not likely that the jewellery was in the Studio Unit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Third, the plaintiff’s text message to Nicholas at 3.02pm only attaches the receipt of payment and does not say more. There was an ongoing dispute over whether the plaintiff could use the SD to offset the remaining two months of rental payment. The first defendant’s position there was that the use of SD for such purpose was a breach of the TA. Hence, the plaintiff’s payment of $4,600 equivalent to two months of rental, does not necessarily lead to the inference that the plaintiff’s belongings were in the Studio Unit. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Fourth, the plaintiff’s explanation of the 23 May E-mail raises more unanswered questions. The defendant’s case is that Nicholas never received the 23 May E-mail. The defendants point to the series of voice messages sent by the plaintiff to Nicholas on 27 May 2019,

</div>  Given that Nicholas helped the first defendant prepare the Three Notices and deliver them to the plaintiff, that the plaintiff had stopped her usual payment on 18 May 2019, and that Nicholas and the first defendant found the Studio Unit vacant on 23 May 2019, I find his explanation to be a fair one. Moreover, the plaintiff’s text to Nicholas on 23 May 2019 attaching her payment receipt for $4,600 came in midst of the ongoing dispute over whether the plaintiff could use the SD to pay for the remaining two months of rental. There is also doubt over whether the plaintiff did send the 23 May E-mail to Nicholas. In these circumstances, I accept Nicholas’ explanation that they did not think that the plaintiff’s belongings not being in the Studio Unit would be an issue.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The plaintiff’s heart condition</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 One of the plaintiff’s claims against the defendants, is for the sum of $1,049.67, which is the amount of her uninsured medical expenses incurred during her stay in Mt Elizabeth hospital from 24 to 27 May 2019.

The plaintiff stated that she was admitted to Mt Elizabeth hospital on 24 May 2019 to be treated for her heart condition.

</div> The key elements of the fourth defendant’s evidence that are in contention with that of the plaintiff relate to the handover of the access cards and keys on the night of 22 May 2019 and the vacant state of the Studio Unit on 23 May 2019.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 The plaintiff’s evidence on the first issue (in relation to the handover of the access cards and keys on 22 May 2019 night) is rebutted by the evidence of independent police officers whom I find no reason to doubt (see [52] above). The second issue (vacant state of the Studio Unit) is corroborated by Nicholas. The fourth defendant’s evidence is reinforced by contradictions in the plaintiff’s own evidence, for example in relation to whether the jewellery was brought to the Studio Unit. The fourth defendant’s evidence on these key elements of the plaintiff’s claim, is thus supported by independent third parties, by another witness whom I have found to be credible and whose evidence has not been controverted, and finally by the contradictions in the plaintiff’s evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 The bulk of the plaintiff’s submissions on the credibility of the fourth defendant involve earlier events which are not germane to establishing the plaintiff’s claims. These include the fourth defendant’s claims that the plaintiff had threatened to cause a gas explosion or to be violent towards the fourth defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 The plaintiff seeks to show that such threats were false by pointing out, in various degrees of detail, the absence of such threats from certain documents. These documents include the fourth defendant’s AEIC, police reports made by the fourth defendant or Nicholas, and the SCT case statement. However, these threats do not underpin the defendants’ case in this suit or the SCT claim. Thus, even if certain details relating to these threats were missing from the fourth defendant’s or Nicholas’ AEICs, or from the SCT case statement, it cannot be inferred that the threats were not made and that the fourth defendant lied in respect of them. Given that these alleged threats are not germane to the plaintiff’s claims or the defence, I do not consider it necessary to make findings of fact in respect of them.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 The plaintiff also asserts that the fourth defendant gave false evidence when she said that she had no control over the joint account held by the first defendant and her.

I will summarize my key findings in relation to this issue:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The plaintiff had, by way of her message to Nicholas on 1 May 2019, indicated to the first defendant that she intended to move out at the end of the tenancy and that she wished to use her SD to offset the remaining 2 months of rental payment.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) In response, the first defendant, through Nicholas, prepared the Three Notices, which state that the use of the SD for rental payment was regarded as a breach of the TA. Nicholas and the fourth defendant slid the notices under the door of the Studio Unit on 5 May 2019, 18 May 2019 and 21 May 2019.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The plaintiff stopped the usual GIRO payment for the rental, that was to take place on 18th of each month, as payment of rent for the following month. While the plaintiff’s intention was to offset the remainder of the rental payments from the SD, this was not provided for in the TA and she had not received any confirmation from the first defendant that he was agreeable, when she stopped the GIRO payment.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The plaintiff was able to open the main door leading to her Studio Unit on the night of 22 May 2019.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) The police did not remove the access cards and keys from the plaintiff on the night of 22 May 2019. I accept the fourth defendant’s evidence that the plaintiff handed them over to the security guard who then passed them to the fourth defendant.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) Other than her testimony, the plaintiff has not provided any evidence that her belongings were in the Studio Unit. Her evidence on her jewellery being in the Studio Unit was contradictory and strongly suggests that the jewellery was not in the Studio Unit at all. I accept the evidence of Nicholas and the fourth defendant that the first time they entered the Studio Unit after the plaintiff handed over her keys, was around mid-day of 23 May 2019, and that the Studio Unit was vacant, as evidenced by the Photographs.   </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) The fourth defendant sent an e-mail to the plaintiff on 23 May at 1:54pm informing that the Studio Unit would be repossessed.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 On the totality of the evidence before me, I find that the plaintiff willingly surrendered her keys and access cards to the Studio Unit to the defendants on 22 May 2019. Prior to this, she was not denied entry to the Studio Unit. The defendants only took possession of the Studio Unit on 23 May 2019, after possession had been delivered to them by the plaintiff the night before. This being the case, I dismiss the plaintiff’s claim for wrongful termination of the tenancy. For completeness, this means that the TA was not terminated by the defendants. It was terminated by the plaintiff when she surrendered her keys to the fourth defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100  Accordingly, the plaintiff is not entitled to be compensated for losses arising from her alleged eviction, such as her claim of $1,049.67 for medical expenses. In any case, the plaintiff adduced no evidence whatsoever of how such medical expenses were related to the alleged eviction or that she was indeed suffering from the heart condition claimed.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Claim for wrongful detention of belongings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 In view of the above findings, I also reject the plaintiff’s claims that she left her belongings in the Studio Unit as of 22 May 2019 and that they were wrongfully detained by the defendants. The plaintiff relied solely on her testimony to establish this claim. As I have found above, she was not a credible witness. Specifically with regard to the belongings, she was not truthful about her jewellery, which formed a large part of the total value of belongings allegedly detained. Thus, I dismiss the plaintiff’s claims for wrongful detention of her belongings and valuables.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Plaintiff’s other claims</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 The plaintiff also claims $4,229.05 (pro-rated rental for the period from 23 May to 17 July 2019) from the sum of $4,600 paid to the defendants on 23 May 2019, which was allegedly demanded by the fourth defendant in return for handing over the plaintiff’s belongings. Following my findings above, I hold that the plaintiff prematurely terminated the TA as of 22 May 2019. This amounted to a repudiatory breach of the TA. As per <span class="font-italic">Tan Soo </span><span class="font-italic">Leng David v Lim Thian Chai Charles and another </span>[1998] 1 SLR(R) 880 at [15], the defendants’ acceptance of the plaintiff’s keys and access cards and their subsequent retaking of possession of the Studio Unit on 23 May 2019 do not prejudice their right to seek damages for a repudiatory breach of the TA. The defendants are hence entitled to the pro-rated rent of $4,229.05 as damages arising from this repudiatory breach. They are thus entitled to retain the $4,600 that was transferred to them by the plaintiff on 23 May 2019. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 The plaintiff also claims for her security deposit of $4,600. As there is no evidence of damage caused to the Studio Unit, or other justification for the detention of the security deposit, the plaintiff will be entitled to the return of her security deposit of $4,600. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 In conclusion, I dismiss all of the plaintiff’s claims, except for the security deposit of $4,600, which is to be returned to the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 Parties informed the court that they have agreed to fix by consent the party and party costs at a lump sum of $140,000 excluding reasonable disbursements to be agreed or taxed.
