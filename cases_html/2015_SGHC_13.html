<p class="Judg-Author">
        Choo Han Teck J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiff/wife is a 50 year old Singapore
                    citizen. She says that she is “presently unemployed and just started a
                    consultancy business”. The defendant/husband is a 54 year old
                    Singapore citizen who works as a managing director of two private limited
                    companies. These two companies are in the information technology business,
                    selling hardware which protects the computer system from being hacked into. I
                    shall refer to these two companies in this judgment as Company A and Company B.
                    The parties are in agreement that his take-home monthly income is
                    $43,978.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The parties married on 30 March 1990. The
                    wife filed a writ for divorce on 29 April 2011 on the basis that the
                    husband behaved in a manner such that it is unreasonable for her to live with
                    him under s 95(3)(<em>b</em>) of the Women’s
                    Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) (“WC”). The husband filed his
                    defence on 25 May 2011. Interim judgment for divorce was granted by the
                    District Court on 10 October 2011. The length of the marriage is about
                    21½ years.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       There are two children in this marriage: (1) a
                    19 year old son who is currently serving national service; and (2)
                    18 year old daughter who is currently in Secondary 3. The wife moved out of
                    the matrimonial home. The parties do not agree on when she moved out. The
                    husband says she moved out on 19 February 2011 without his knowledge while
                    he was away on a business trip. The wife says she moved out in August
                    2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       I start with the first issue before me, namely
                    the issue of care, control and access of the two children. The parties are in
                    agreement that they should have joint custody over their children. But they
                    differ on control and access. The wife in [96] of her first affidavit dated
                    1 December 2011 says that she wants joint care and control of the children
                    as she is “looking after both the children”. She says that she
                    continued to do grocery shopping, ferry the children for their classes, cook for
                    them, take them to their medical appointments and pays for their tuition classes
                    as she lives less than 15 minutes from the matrimonial home. The wife avers
                    that the husband “hardly spends time with the
                children”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The husband disagrees and wants sole care and
                    control of the children with reasonable access to the wife. In [10] of their
                    written submissions, the husband’s lawyers argue that joint care and
                    control is not in the children’s best interests as “interactions
                    between the parties are rather acrimonious and that such a living arrangement
                    would be disruptive to the existing familial living arrangements that the
                    children are already accustomed to”. In this regard, the husband relies
                    on the following facts to substantiate why he should have care and control over
                    the children:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, the wife “unilaterally
                        chose to abandon the family and left the matrimonial
                    home”;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, the children have always been and continue to reside in the
                        matrimonial home with his mother and brother. The husband says that the
                        children have been living in that matrimonial home since it was purchased in
                        1999, and have been living in it for most of their lives;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_c"></a>(c)     Third, the wife has to travel
                        frequently for work. The husband says that the wife has since started her
                        own businesses and opened multiple companies in her name from September
                        2013;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_d"></a>(d)     Fourth,
                        the wife was not the primary caregiver for the children who is looked after
                        by his mother with the assistance of two maids during the day (presumably
                        while he is at work). The husband says that he had to employ two maids
                        instead of one because his mother suffers from Alzheimer’s disease and
                        needs extra help;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_e"></a>(e)     Fifth, the children have been hurt by his wife’s decision to
                        abandon the marriage and the family. The husband states in [40]-[41] of his
                        2nd affidavit dated 20 March 2013 that he has had to attend to the
                        children’s emotional needs and settle everything down after the wife
                        left so abruptly;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_f"></a>(f)     Sixth, the children are currently 19 and 18 years old and are able to
                        express their independent opinions; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_g"></a>(g)     Seventh, the husband says he has been the sole
                        caregiver and looking after the children’s needs since the wife left
                        the matrimonial home.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1-p2_g"></a>With regard to (<em>d</em>), I
                    doubt that the husband’s mother is able to care for the children if she
                    suffers from Alzheimer’s disease and needs help herself.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       In my view, joint care and control is neither
                    appropriate nor in the children’s best interests in this case. Shared care
                    and control would be extremely disruptive to the children as they have been
                    living in the matrimonial home since 1999. The husband will continue to care and
                    control over the children. More importantly, the children here are almost of
                    adult age.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       I also refrain from making an order for access
                    in favour of the wife as I am of the view that it is pointless to. The children
                    are already grown up and should be able to choose independently whether and when
                    they would like to meet their mother. Furthermore, the son is in national
                    service. Making an order for access may result in a conflict with his national
                    service duties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       I now deal with the children’s
                    maintenance. In this case, the husband is seeking maintenance for the children
                    from the wife (and not the other way round as is often the case). The husband
                    asserts that the children’s monthly expenses amount to $9,287.74 and says
                    that the amount should be increased $200 every month “due to their
                    increased expenses as the children grow up”. The husband goes on to say
                    that these expenses exclude the children’s current school fees which are
                    debited directly via GIRO from the wife’s bank account. The wife’s
                    lawyers made no submissions on the amount of maintenance she should provide for
                    the children. The family may, however, benefit from counselling with the view of
                    re-establishing the strained relationship between mother and
                children.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The $9,287.74 is the sum of two parts. First,
                    the children’s monthly personal expenses “excluding their share of
                    the household expenses and the maid’s expenses as of 28 November
                    2011” which he says amount to $5,610.66 (the husband says that the
                    daughter’s monthly maintenance is $3,630.83, whereas that for the son is
                    $1.979.83). The second part is “the children’s share of the
                    increased household expenses”. The husband says that this amounts to
                    $3,373.08. The husband arrives at the figure of $3,373.08 by taking two-sevenths
                    of the total household expense (which the husband says amounts to $11,805.80).
                    The $11,805.80 is the sum of $11,005.80, which are the expenses for two cars and
                    $800. It is not at all clear from the husband’s submissions what expense
                    this $800 is for. There are a total of seven members in living in the
                    matrimonial home: (1) the husband’s mother; (2) the husband’s
                    brother; (3) the two children; (4) two maids; and (5) the husband
                    himself.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The husband also asserts that the wife’s
                    contribution to the children’s expenses has been minimal and that she has
                    a “joint obligation” to contribute to the children’s
                    expenses. In this regard, the husband’s lawyers make these four
                    points:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, the wife does not pay for any
                        of the children’s enrichment and tuition expenses;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, the wife has not contributed
                        to the children’s expenses (save for their school fees) since February
                        2011;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_c"></a>(c)     Third,
                        the husband has always been paying for the family expenses and for most of
                        the children’s expenses throughout the marriage;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_d"></a>(d)     Fourth, the
                        wife is a “capable businesswoman who has set up a number of
                        companies, at least one of which is based overseas and is well able to
                        continue to contribute to the children’s
                    expenses”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1-p2_d"></a>The husband’s lawyers submit that it would be
                    “equitable” for the husband to bear 60% of the children’s
                    expenses and for the wife to bear the remaining 40%. This means that the wife
                    should pay a monthly sum of $3,700 for the children’s expenses (this is
                    40% of the $9,287.74). The husband’s lawyers propose that the
                    children’s school fees should be born equally by the parties, and that the
                    maintenance should be backdated to 10 October 2011, the date of the interim
                    judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Sections 68 and 69(2) of the WC provide that
                    parents have to maintain their children. Section 68 of the WC reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Duty of parents to maintain
                            children</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>68.</b> Except where an agreement or order of
                        court otherwise provides, it shall be the duty of a parent to maintain or
                        contribute to the maintenance of his or her children, whether they are in
                        his or her custody or the custody of any other person, and whether they are
                        legitimate or illegitimate, either by providing them with such
                        accommodation, clothing, food and education as may be reasonable having
                        regard to his or her means and station in life or by paying the cost
                        thereof.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11_1"></a>Section 69(2) of the WC reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Court may order maintenance of
                            wife and children</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) The court may, on due proof that a parent has neglected or refused to
                        provide reasonable maintenance for his child who is unable to maintain
                        himself, order that parent to pay a monthly allowance or a lump sum for the
                        maintenance of that child.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11_2"></a>Section 69(4) of the WC goes on to provide a list of
                    non-exhaustive considerations that a court should take into account when
                    ordering maintenance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     I find it hard to believe that the
                    children’s expenses amount to $9,287.74 monthly. I am of the view that the
                    children’s expenses have been inflated by the husband for the following
                    reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, a large part of the household
                        expenses of $11,805.80 is used for the loan instalments and the upkeep of
                        two cars (a Honda CRV and an Aston Martin). The monthly expenses for both
                        cars alone amount to $11,005.80. I find that it is not right to attribute
                        the cost of the upkeep of two cars as part of the monthly expenses for the
                        children. In particular, the Aston Martin, being a luxury car, is the more
                        expensive car to upkeep as its insurance, road tax, maintenance and monthly
                        loan instalments are more expensive. To illustrate, a monthly loan
                        instalment of $7,275 is payable for the Aston Martin, whereas the monthly
                        instalments for the Honda CRV amount to $1,186; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, the children’s monthly
                        personal expenses appear to be inflated too. This is because he includes
                        these one-off expenses: (1) a piano for the daughter ($9,000, amounting to
                        $750 monthly); (2) a computer tablet for the daughter ($2,000, amounting to
                        $166.67 monthly); and (3) computer for the son ($2,000, amounting to $166.67
                        monthly).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     I note that the husband asserts in his
                    affidavit of assets and means dated 25 November 2011 that he spends $200
                    per month for each of the two children for outings to places such as the Bird
                    Park and the Science Centre – which may have been many years ago when they
                    were younger. He appears to have miscalculated this figure as he states in that
                    same affidavit that the yearly expense for these outings for each child is
                    $1,200. This works out to $100 (and not $200) per month for each
                child.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     I also decline to increase the monthly
                    expenses by $200 per month for what the husband says are increased expenses for
                    the children as this would result in an exponential increase in the amount of
                    maintenance - the monthly maintenance payable would increase by $2,400 every
                    year. The husband’s lawyers did not explain (besides a bald assertion that
                    the increase is needed due to “increased expenses”) why such a
                    large increase is necessary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     I find that the monthly expenses of the two
                    children to be $5,252.94. This is the sum total of the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_a"></a>(a)     $925.62 (two-sevenths of the
                        household expenses which the husband states in his affidavit of assets and
                        means dated 25 November 2011);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_b"></a>(b)     $1,713.16 (son’s personal expenses, after deducting
                        $166.67 for the one-off expense of a computer (see above: [13(b)]) and $100
                        to account for the calculation error for weekend outings (see above: [14]))
                        from the $1,979.83 figure provided by the husband); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_c"></a>(c)     $2,614.16 (daughter’s personal
                        expenses, after deducting (1) $166.67 for the one-off expense of a
                        computer tablet (see above: [13(b)]); (2) $750 for the one-off expense of a
                        piano (see above: [13(b)]); and (3) $ 100 to account for the calculation
                        error for weekend outings (see above: [14]) from the $3,630.83 figure
                        provided by the husband).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1-p2_c"></a>The daughter’s personal expenses are much more
                    than those of the son’s as she attends more enrichment classes (for violin
                    and mathematics) than the son does.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In determining the amount of maintenance, the
                    court has to have regard to the list of non-exhaustive considerations provided
                    under s 69(4) of the WC That provision reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(4) The court, when ordering maintenance for a wife or child
                        under this section, shall have regard to all the circumstances of the case
                        including the following matters:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(a) the financial needs of the wife or child;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(b) the income, earning capacity (if any), property and other
                            financial resources of the wife or child;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(c) any physical or mental disability of the wife or child;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(d) the age of each party to the marriage and the duration of the
                            marriage;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(e) the contributions made by each of the parties to the marriage to
                            the welfare of the family, including any contribution made by looking
                            after the home or caring for the family;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(f) the standard of living enjoyed by the wife or child before the
                            husband or parent, as the case may be, neglected or refused to provide
                            reasonable maintenance for the wife or child;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(g) in the case of a child, the manner in which he was being, and in
                            which the parties to the marriage expected him to be, educated or
                            trained; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(h) the conduct of each of the parties to the marriage, if the conduct
                            is such that it would in the opinion of the court be inequitable to
                            disregard it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The wife’s lawyers say that the wife is
                    “presently unemployed, and just started a consultancy business”.
                    This suggests that she may not have the means to provide maintenance for the two
                    children (s 69(4)(<em>b</em>) of the WC). The
                    husband’s lawyers dispute this, and say that the wife “has not been
                    forthcoming with regards to her income and means”. In this regard, the
                    husband’s lawyers submit that the wife only disclosed at the eleventh hour
                    that she is a director of at least five companies. The husband’s lawyers
                    assert that the wife earns an income from these companies. Even though the wife
                    claims that these companies do not have any business activities, and she
                    therefore draws no income from them, the husband’s lawyers argue that this
                    is “inherently unbelievable” as she is a “savvy and
                    enterprising businesswoman with good business acumen”. Furthermore, there
                    is “objective evidence available on the public domain” that
                    “undermines the wife’s claim”:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, the wife is the CEO, chairman
                        and founder of a group of companies and is the “creator and

                        from 4 to 5 August 2014 at the Marina Bay Sands Expo and Convention

                        the wife’s profile on the website for “crowdfunding”
                        conference states that she is a capable businesswoman. It reads:</p>

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_c"></a>(c)     Third, the
                        wife’s group of companies has three office locations: (1) its
                        headquarters in Singapore; (2) a secretariat also in Singapore; and (3) a
                        branch office in Bangkok, Thailand.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     I accept the submissions made by the
                    husband’s lawyers that the wife has the means to provide maintenance for
                    the children. She is a woman of means and has income. In the absence of details
                    on her exact income, I fix monthly maintenance for the children payable by her
                    at $2,500. In my view, this is a reasonable amount of maintenance that she has
                    the means to pay.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     I now deal with the issue of whether the
                    maintenance for the children should be backdated to the date of the interim
                    judgment (10 October 2011). In <em>Lee Siew Choo v Ling Chin
                        Thor</em> [2014] SGHC 185, I held the following (at [15]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A backdated order for maintenance ensures that the parent in default pays
                        for the child’s needs right from the outset instead of from only the
                        time maintenance is sought. It is a practical and pragmatic tool that, if
                        used judiciously and as the circumstances warrant, can vindicate parental
                        responsibility for a child’s needs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19_3"></a>That case also enumerated other a list of
                    considerations that a court should have regard to, in deciding whether to grant
                    an order for backdated maintenance (at [16]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     In the present case, I am not prepared to
                    backdate maintenance. I do not accept the husband’s assertion that the
                    wife did not provide for the children even she moved out of the matrimonial
                    home. The wife has provided receipts showing the expenses she incurred in
                    respect of the children in her affidavit dated 1 December 2011. She cannot
                    be said to have been derelict in her parental responsibility to provide for the
                    children.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     I now deal with the division of matrimonial
                    assets. I start with the matrimonial home. The wife says that the property is
                    now worth $2.15m. The husband says that the property is worth $1.7m, but that
                    same figure was given in his 2011 affidavit of assets and means. It does not
                    take into account the increase in property value. There is a dispute over the
                    financial contributions made by the respective parties. The wife says that she
                    contributed $302,171.78 whereas the husband contributed $370,430. The husband
                    says that his financial contributions amount to $562,778 (the sum of his CPF
                    contribution amounting to $292,778, $180,000 down-payment and $90,000 renovation
                    costs) and the wife’s is just $236,066. The parties have not furnished
                    sufficient documentary proof to substantiate their respective claims. In any
                    event, it is clear that the husband contributed more financially towards the
                    matrimonial home. The monies in the parties’ UOB joint account is also
                    part of the pool of matrimonial assets. The husband says that there is just
                    $79,893.27 as at 31 January 2012. The wife however, attributes a value of
                    $608,047. This is because she alleges that there was dissipation in the monies
                    on the husband’s part.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The other assets in the matrimonial pool are
                    those in the parties’ own names. I start with the assets in the
                    husband’s names. They are:</p>

                        membership</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1-p2_i"></a>The husband says that the value of his assets is
                    $2,944,111.69 but the wife says that his assets are worth $4,885,858.42. I do
                    not accept the figure provided by the husband as I am of the view that he has
                    under-declared his assets. He failed to declare $200,682.03 in Standard
                    Chartered Bank account A. He also under-declared the value of his shares in
                    Company A. He says that they are worth just $1,259,759. However, the
                    wife’s accountant Mr Yin Kum Choy points out that they are worth
                    $2,713,469. The wife’s figure is not correct either. This is because she
                    has failed to take into account outstanding loans on both the Aston Martin and
                    Honda CRV. I determine the value of the husband’s assets at $4,474,457.42.

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_a"></a>(a)     Shares in Company
                    B;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_b"></a>(b)     CPF
                        monies;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_c"></a>(c)     Monies
                        in OCBC accounts (account D, E and F); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_d"></a>(d)     BMW car.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1-p2_d_4"></a>The wife says that the value of her assets is
                    $764,833.85 but the husband says that she has they are worth at least
                    $857,855.85. The husband accuses the wife of not being “less than
                    forthcoming” in declaring her assets. In this regard, his lawyers argue
                    the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1-p2_d-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, wife is dishonest. This is
                        because that the wife failed to disclose the existence of her Siam
                        Commercial Bank Public Company Limited Savings Account until she was
                        confronted by the husband with documentary evidence. The husband’s
                        lawyers argue that the wife could not be said to have forgotten about that
                        since she receives her monthly salary from Thailand in this bank account.
                        The husband’s lawyers say that there is still a significant balance of
                        $82,837.80 (after conversion into Singapore Dollars) in that account as of
                        November 2011;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1-p2_d-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, the wife was evasive in her replies to the husband’s
                        requests that she account for the various large withdrawals and deposits
                        from her bank accounts, in particular, OCBC bank account no F. There were
                        four withdrawals from that OCBC bank account that remain unaccounted for:
                        (1) a cashier’s order for $18,000 on 3 April 2011; (2) another
                        cashier’s order for $20,000 on 8 May 2011; (3) a purchase for
                        $45,048.13 on 30 November 2010 and (4) another purchase for $7,030 on
                        11 January 2011. With regard to (1) and (2), the husband says that the
                        wife conveniently forgets what the money is used for. With regard to (3) and
                        (4), the husband says that the wife merely repeated her “frivolous
                        claims” that the monies were used to pay her staff in
                        Thailand;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1-p2_d-p2_c"></a>(c)     Third, the wife failed, neglected and/or refused to comply with the orders
                        for discovery in Summons No 11126 of 2014. These include:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1-p2_d-p2_c-p3_i"></a>(i)       An order for the wife to
                            furnish monthly statements for OCBC account E from 1 January 2009 to 8
                            January 2011, 1 March 2011 to 10 August 2011 and January 2012. The
                            wife only provided the statements for three months (25 March 2011 to 20
                            May 2011);</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1-p2_d-p2_c-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       An order for the wife to furnish monthly
                            statements for OCBC account D for the period 1 January 2009 to
                            mid-September 2010, October 2010 and January 2012. The wife did not
                            provide any statements for this period; and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1-p2_d-p2_c-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       An order that the wife produce
                            bank statements for OCBC account F for the period 1 January 2009 to 12
                            December 2009;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1-p2_d-p2_d"></a>(d)     Fourth, the wife did not disclose the fact that she
                        held a job and was not unemployed; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1-p2_d-p2_e"></a>(e)     Fifth, the wife failed to disclose the cash value of
                        her insurance policies and her country club membership.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1-p2_e"></a>The husband’s lawyers urge me to draw an
                    adverse inference against the wife, by reducing the wife’s share of the
                    known matrimonial assets by 5% to 10%.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The wife’s lawyers say that large sums
                    of money were withdrawn from the UOB joint account close to when the writ for
                    divorce was filed (on 28 April 2011). Counsel for the wife thus urged me to
                    draw an adverse inference against the husband. To illustrate, counsel for the
                    wife point out the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_a"></a>(a)     The joint account had $646,627 on
                        12 February 2010, but by end December 2011, there was just $189,087
                        left. In particular, the wife’s lawyers singled out three withdrawals
                        made during this period where large sums of $141,000, $90,000 and $50,000
                        were withdrawn. There was no explanation by the husband as to how the
                        $141,000 was used. The explanations given for the $90,000 and $50,000
                        withdrawals were not satisfactory either. The husband says that the monies
                        were used for the operating expenses of one of his two companies, and has
                        provided copies of that company’s ledger as proof. However, there is
                        no corresponding deposit for those amounts on the dates when these monies
                        were withdrawn. There were instead deposits for much lesser amounts of
                        $39,603.96 and $7,118.15 on those dates; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_b"></a>(b)     $100,000 was withdrawn from that bank account on
                        27 January 2012 for alleged renovations and household expenses. The
                        wife says that there is “not a shred of documentary evidence to
                        support this”;</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1-p2_b"></a>The wife does not state a specific figure in her
                    counsel’s written submissions on how much has been dissipated by the
                    husband. I accept that that might not be possible for her, and so have taken
                    this factor into account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     It is not just the money in the joint account
                    that has been dissipated. The wife’s lawyers also say that the husband
                    dissipated his earnings and deliberately incurred a loss $183,000 by selling his
                    Lamborghini in just less than six months from purchasing it. In his affidavit
                    dated 20 February 2011, the husband state the following (at [18]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I purchased a Lamborghini Gallardo on 31 March 2011 for the sum of
                        S$798,000.00 which I subsequently sold on 19 May 2011 for the price of
                        S$615,000.00. I incurred a loss of S$183,000.00.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Having regard to the evidence, I accept the
                    arguments that there was dissipation on the husband’s part. It may be
                    speculative to say that the husband’s loss of $183,000 is borne out of a
                    desire to dissipate assets. Nonetheless, I am satisfied that there is
                    dissipation as the husband has withdrawn large sums of monies from bank accounts
                    with hardly any explanation or proper documentation to substantiate the reason
                    for withdrawing these monies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In my view, both husband and wife have failed
                    to provide full and frank disclosure of their respective assets. However, it
                    seems pointless to draw an adverse inference against both of them. An adverse
                    inference drawn against one party could be negated by one drawn against the
                    other party, especially in a situation such as this where it is difficult to
                    determine if one party has under-declared more than the other. It is difficult
                    to make such a determination because neither of the parties’ lawyers has
                    submitted on the amount under-declared.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     I am of the view that an equal division in
                    this case would be just and equitable. The parties have been married for more
                    than 20 years. Equality of division is neither ideal nor the norm
                        (<em>Lock Yeng Fun v Chua Hock Chye</em> [2007]
                    3 SLR(R) 520 at [55]), but for long marriages such as this, the courts tend
                    to lean towards equality of division. That is because there is no formula or
                    means to determine the differential between the financial and non-financial
                    contribution of the parties with precision. An equal division is also probably
                    the closest the court can effect the parties’ declaration in their
                    matrimonial vow of treating themselves as one. Thus in the absence of a better
                    formula, the court will consider equality as justice. The Court of Appeal in
                        <em>Koh Bee Choo v Choo Chai Huah</em> [2007] SGCA 21
                    approved the High Court order of equal division where the homemaker wife of
                    22 years who brought up the couple’s three sons. Similarly, the High
                    Court in <em>MZ v NA</em> [2006] SGHC 95 also refused to
                    interfere with the District Court order that the homemaker wife (of 20 years,
                    and who brought up the couple’s two children) should get just as much as
                    the husband of their matrimonial assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     I make no order for maintenance in this case.
                    Maintenance of an ex-wife supplements the division of matrimonial assets and is
                    awarded only to even out any financial inequities after division (<em>BG v BF</em> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 233 at [74]-[75]). In my
                    view, the financial inequities are evened out in the division of matrimonial
                    assets. Furthermore, the wife is also able to adequately provide for herself. As
                    mentioned, she is a woman of means. She is 50 years old and can continue to
                    work.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     This is not an exceptional case in which
                    maintenance for the wife is denied. I provide three instances to illustrate.
                    First, in <em>Chan Choy Ling v Chua Che Teck</em> [1994]
                    SGHC 194, the wife – who was earning $5,900 a month – sought spousal
                    maintenance from her husband – who was earning $4,082 (and imprisoned for
                    a period). The judge held “justice would not have been done by ordering
                    any maintenance for the wife”. Second, <em>AAE v
                        AAF</em> [2009] 3 SLR(R) 827, the wife’s application for
                    maintenance was rejected, in particular because the High Court found she
                    “deliberately misled” the District Judge in her application for
                    interim maintenance, by making herself out to be a housewife with no income. On
                    the contrary, the High Court found that she was financially independent (at
                    [22]-[24]). More recently, in <em>Anthony Guo Ninqun v Chan Wing
                        Sun</em> [2014] SGHC 56, the High Court denied maintenance to the wife
                    (who claimed $6,500 a month) holding that “she [was] an able and
                    enterprising individual with good business acumen”, and would have been
                    able to enjoy economic independence to support her lifestyle (at
                [124]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     My orders are therefore as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_a"></a>(a)     The husband will have care and
                        control over the children;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_b"></a>(b)     No order as to access with liberty to
                    apply;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_c"></a>(c)     The wife is
                        to pay $2,500 as monthly maintenance for the children;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_d"></a>(d)     The husband is to purchase the
                        wife’s share (50%) in the matrimonial home at current market value,
                        and with liberty to apply;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_e"></a>(e)     The rest of the other assets are to be divided equally;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_f"></a>(f)     No
                        maintenance for the wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     I will hear the parties on (1) costs; (2) the
                    mode of payment of the backdated maintenance for children; and (3) the manner of
                    dividing the matrimonial assets if they are unable to agree.</p>
