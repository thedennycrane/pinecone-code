<p class="Judg-Author">
        Lee Kim Shin JC:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       It
is a basic principle of company law that a company’s powers of management
are reserved to its board of directors, and not its shareholders. This
principle is encapsulated in s 157A(1) of the Companies Act (Cap
50, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the Companies Act”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Section
157A(2) of the Companies Act in turn provides that the directors
may exercise all of a company’s powers except any power that the Companies
Act or the memorandum and articles of association of the company
require the company to exercise in general meeting. I will sometimes
refer to a company’s memorandum and the articles as the company’s
“constitution”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The
division of powers between directors and shareholders has given rise
to frequent challenges in the courts. These challenges commonly
arise when shareholders exercise a management power in circumstances
where the directors are either unwilling or unable to act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       This
present case concerns a family holding company, TYC Investment Pte
Ltd (“TYC”), and a deadlocked board comprising just two directors
who are also ex-spouses. The two directors are Dr Henry Tay Yun Chwan
(“HT”) and Ms Jannie Chan Siew Lee (“JC”). HT and JC are also shareholders
of TYC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       In
2012, HT, JC and TYC entered into an agreement, under which the approval
of both HT and JC is required before payments can be made by TYC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       For
various reasons, JC refused to approve certain payments by TYC. Pursuant
to an ordinary resolution passed at a general meeting of TYC in September
2013, TYC commenced this action (“OS 895”) against JC on the basis
that her refusal to approve these payments constitutes a breach
of contract and/or her fiduciary duties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The
dispute involves an interesting conflation of contract terms as agreed
between ex-spouses in the context of ancillary matters to matrimonial
proceedings, and contract terms as agreed between a company and
its shareholders.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The
first plaintiff in this action is TYC, HT is the first defendant
and JC is the second defendant. The second, third and fourth plaintiffs
(“the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Plaintiffs”), all private companies limited
by shares, are wholly-owned subsidiaries of TYC. I shall refer to
the four plaintiffs collectively as “the Plaintiffs”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The
main legal issues arising from this action are as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_a"></a>(a)     Can
shareholders of a company pass a resolution in a general meeting,
held in accordance with the company’s articles of association, to
approve the commencement of court proceedings to enforce a claim
against a director, if such director is able to veto any proposed
board resolution to commence such proceedings?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_b"></a>(b)     Under
what circumstances can a director of a company who has a contractual
right to withhold approval of payments by the company, nevertheless
be compelled by the court to approve those payments?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The TYC Group Structure</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The
Hour Glass Limited (“THG”) is a home-grown but well-known company
that grew from a family business into a company listed on the Singapore
Stock Exchange. It is a luxury watch retailer with some 30 watch outlets
or boutiques across nine cities in the Asia Pacific region.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     HT
and JC are the founders of THG, and they are perhaps as well-known
as THG. As husband and wife, they established THG in 1979 and have
been responsible for the expansion of its business as described
above. Sadly, after 41 years of marriage, HT and JC were divorced
in May 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     HT
and JC also established TYC in 1979, as the family holding company
of THG and other family assets. These assets are substantial in worth.
As at the financial year ended 31 March 2014, TYC held 108,288,397 ordinary
shares representing approximately 46% of the issued share capital of
THG. TYC also owns two bungalows, at 40A Nassim Road and 40C Nassim
Road. The 2nd, 3rd and 4th Plaintiffs each own a condominium unit
in the prime Nassim Road location.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     As
mentioned earlier, HT and JC are the only two directors of TYC. In
fact, pursuant to Art 8 of TYC’s articles of association (“the TYC Articles”),
HT and JC are permanent “Governing Directors”. The ambit of Art
8 is pivotal to the issues in the present case and the relevant
portions of Art 8 are reproduced below:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Subject to Article 3, <b><em>the
said Dr Tay Yun Chwan and Mdm Chan Siew Lee shall be the permanent
Governing Directors of the Company until they resign from the office</em></b>,
that is they will not whilst they hold such office be taken into account
in determining the rotation of retirement of directors and the provision
of Section 153 of the Companies Act will not apply to them <b><em>and whilst they retain the said office, they will
have authority to exercise all the powers, authorities and discretion
by these Articles expressed to be vested in the directors generally</em></b> including
the power to convene a general meeting of the Company, and of all
the other directors, if any, for the time being of the Company,
shall be under their control and shall be bound to conform to their discretion
in regard to the Company’s business.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Subject to Article 3, <b><em>the
said Dr Tay Yun Chwan and Mdm Chan Siew Lee whilst they hold the
office of Governing Directors, may from time to time, and at any
time, appoint any other persons to be directors of the Company, and
may define, limit and restrict their powers and may fix and determine their
remuneration and duties and may at any time, remove any director howsoever
appointed</em></b>. Every such appointment or removal must be
in writing under the hands of Dr Tay Yun Chwan and Mdm Chan Siew
Lee.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Subject to Article 7, in the event of the
death of any of the two Governing Directors, the surviving person
shall be entitled to exercise all or any of the powers previously
held by the Governing Directors jointly.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Subject as aforesaid and to these Articles,
the rights of all the shareholders shall be the same in every respect.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     In
terms of shareholding, HT and JC each hold a founder share giving them
46% and 44% of the voting rights in TYC respectively. Pursuant to
Art 7 of the TYC Articles, all issued shares other than these two
founder shares are classified as ordinary shares, and no person
other than HT or JC may hold these two founder shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The
remaining ordinary shares in TYC are divided amongst HT and JC’s
three children. Of the three children, it is only necessary to highlight that
their son, Michael, holds 5% of the voting rights in TYC. Michael’s
role will be evident in due course (see [42]–[45] below).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Divorce Settlement Agreements</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The
ancillary matters in HT and JC’s divorce were settled amicably. As
part of the divorce settlement, three agreements were entered into:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_a"></a>(a)     a
Deed of Settlement (“the DOS”) between HT and JC dated 9 April 2010.
The DOS settled the issues relating to the division of matrimonial
assets and JC’s claim for maintenance;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_b"></a>(b)     an
Agreement for Amendment to the DOS and Settlement of Litigation
between HT and JC dated 15 May 2012 (“the SSD”). The SSD involved
amendments to the DOS and matters pertaining to the management of
TYC; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_c"></a>(c)     a
Deed among HT, JC and TYC dated 11 June 2012 in respect of certain
matters relating to TYC as agreed in the DOS and the SSD (“the TYC
Deed”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In
the divorce settlement, the TYC Deed was the only agreement to which
TYC was a party. I shall refer to all three agreements as the “Divorce Settlement
Agreements”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Although
divorced, HT and JC continued to be closely involved with TYC. They
remained permanent “Governing Directors” of TYC, and the TYC group
continued to hold a substantial part of the family assets. Accordingly,
HT and JC sought to bind TYC by way of the TYC Deed, to matters
relating to TYC as earlier agreed between HT and JC in the DOS and
the SSD.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Under
cl 15 of the SSD, the SSD would be “ineffective, null and void” if
any of the four conditions below were not satisfied:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_a"></a>(a)     TYC’s
shareholders unanimously approve all the matters in the SSD relating
to TYC;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_b"></a>(b)     TYC
enters into the TYC Deed;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_c"></a>(c)     the
TYC Articles are amended to give effect to the terms of the SSD;
and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_d"></a>(d)     HT
and JC obtain an order of court approving the SSD if the above three
conditions are satisfied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     It
is not disputed that the above four conditions were satisfied. Central
to the present dispute is cl 2 of the TYC Deed. Pursuant to cl 2,
TYC became entitled to the benefit of the terms and conditions of,
and became bound by the obligations in, the DOS and the SSD that
relate to TYC, as if it were a party to the SSD.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Article
16 of the TYC Articles provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[TYC] may not amend, vary or waive any
of its rights and/or obligations under or pursuant to the TYC Deed
unless such amendment, variation or waiver has been unanimously
consented to by all the shareholders of [TYC].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Article
16 itself expressly provides that it can only be amended, varied or
repealed with the unanimous consent of all TYC shareholders.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In
summary, the TYC shareholders had unanimously agreed to the provisions
of the SSD; TYC became bound by these provisions by virtue of the
TYC Deed; and no provision of the SSD can be amended unless all
TYC shareholders agree. The SSD is therefore indirectly entrenched
as part of TYC’s constitution.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Disputes relating to TYC</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">JC’s refusal to approve payments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Clause
10 of the SSD (“the Payment Clause”) provides that payments to be
made by TYC require the approval of both HT and JC. The exact mechanism
provided in the Payment Clause reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Payment voucher system for all future payments
for TYC. Neither HT nor JC will sign a cheque on TYC’s bank accounts
unless the other has signed a voucher approving.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Because
cheques could only be signed by either HT or JC if there is a corresponding
payment voucher approved by the other, HT and JC were in a position
whereby each could, by either refusing to sign a payment voucher (or
a cheque for a signed payment voucher), prevent the other from causing TYC
to make any payment. This arrangement was, perhaps with the full benefit
of hindsight (following the breakup of the marriage), a recipe for disaster.
TYC was bound by the Payment Clause because of the TYC Deed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In
July 2012, shortly after the TYC Deed was entered into, JC refused to
approve certain payments by TYC. Initially, only two payments were
in issue:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_a"></a>(a)     fees
(“the KPMG Fees”) payable to KPMG Services Pte Ltd (“KPMG”); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_b"></a>(b)     expenses
incurred in relation to the properties at 40A Nassim Road and 40C
Nassim Road (“the Nassim Road Expenses”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     By
the time TYC had commenced this action in September 2013, JC had
refused to approve the payment of numerous other expenses. Two lists of
creditors were appended to the Originating Summons filed in this
action. However, by the time I first heard OS 895, the dispute over
these expenses had been resolved, leaving only the KPMG Fees, the
Nassim Road Expenses, and the expenses incurred in connection with
the commencement of this action, which I will discuss at [28]–[36]
and [49]–[50] below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The KPMG Fees</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     KPMG
were engaged by HT and JC in late 2012 to identify, and advise TYC
and its shareholders on, accounting and tax issues arising from
the Divorce Settlement Agreements. The scope of KPMG’s work, contained
in a service proposal, was approved by HT and JC. The fee quoted
in the service proposal was $18,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Upon
issuance of its final report in April 2013, KPMG submitted an invoice
for $19,424.05 to TYC (which included GST and disbursements).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     A
payment voucher for the KPMG Fees was then prepared on HT’s instructions
and presented to JC for her approval and signature, as required by
the Payment Clause. JC refused to sign the voucher and payment could not
be made. Her view was that KPMG had not carried out its work properly
because KPMG had not sought her input or comments in the preparation
of their report.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     HT,
on the other hand, had no issue with the work done by KPMG or the
KPMG Fees. He gave three reasons why JC was wrong in refusing to pay.
First, he argued that JC had agreed (and had signed in her personal capacity,
and as a director of TYC) KPMG’s service proposal containing the scope
of work, and letter of engagement. Second, there is no requirement for
KPMG to meet with either HT or JC because any advice to be provided by
KPMG will be based entirely on the contents of the DOS and the SSD. Finally,
KPMG did in fact meet with JC to try and explain the contents of their
report to her.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     HT
asserted that “it [was] simply ridiculous” that JC refused to allow TYC
to make payment despite KPMG providing its services in accordance with
the terms of engagement and making the effort to meet with JC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The
KMPG Fees were eventually paid by HT’s own company, Amstay Pte Ltd,
on 6 August 2013. Amstay Pte Ltd then sought reimbursement from
TYC.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Nassim Road Expenses</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Pursuant
to cl 5(a) of Appendix B of the DOS, ownership of 40C Nassim Road
was transferred to TYC. Clause 5(a) expressly provides that TYC
would be responsible for all costs, taxes and outgoings on 40C Nassim Road
after such transfer. HT had sought reimbursement from TYC the sum of
$299,880.56 which he claimed were expenses incurred in respect of
40C Nassim Road for the period between late July 2011 and late July
2013.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     HT
had also sought reimbursement from TYC the sum of $60,988.02 which
he claimed were expenses incurred in respect of 40A Nassim Road. Pursuant
to cl 16 of Appendix B of the DOS, ownership of 40A Nassim Road
would remain with TYC. Although (unlike cl 5(a) in the case of 40C Nassim
Road) the Divorce Settlement Agreements did not expressly provide
that TYC should pay for the costs, taxes and outgoings of 40A Nassim
Road, HT claimed that TYC should ordinarily be responsible for all such
expenses because TYC is the owner of the property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     JC,
however, refused to approve the payment of HT’s reimbursement claims
for the Nassim Road Expenses. Why she refused to approve HT’s reimbursement
claims is now immaterial as this was resolved by way of a Consent
Order midway through these proceedings (see [62] below).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The THG share redemption</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     There
was a separate, but perhaps more significant (in monetary terms),
dispute involving JC’s failure to procure the redemption of TYC’s shares
in THG which were held by Overseas-Chinese Banking Corporation Limited
(“OCBC”). JC had previously pledged up to approximately 22m THG
shares held by TYC with OCBC in return for personal loans to her and
companies under her control.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Under
cl 11 of Appendix B of the DOS read with cl 8 of the SSD, she was
supposed to redeem those pledged THG shares by 9 April 2013. HT reminded
JC through a series of letters from his solicitors from April 2013 to
August 2013 that she was obliged under the DOS to fully redeem the pledged
THG shares by 9 April 2013.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     However,
as of 20 September 2013, there were still approximately 6.53m THG
pledged shares that had yet to be redeemed (“the Outstanding THG
Shares”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The
DOS contemplated the possibility that the THG pledged shares might
not be fully redeemed by 9 April 2013. Clause 11(d) of Appendix
B of the DOS provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the event that [JC] fails to procure
the redemption and return of all of TYC’s approximately 22 million
shares in THG… [by 9 April 2013]:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(i)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">……..</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(ii)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">
<b><em>TYC </em></b>
<em>shall be entitled (A) to apply any dividend payments
due to be paid to [JC] towards redemption of its THG shares and/</em>
<b><em>or (B) to immediately redeem its THG shares</em></b> whereupon
the redemption shall be a debt due from [JC] to TYC on demand and
TYC may, <em>inter alia</em>, set off any
future dividend payments due to be paid to [JC] against this debt.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     A
self-help remedy was therefore available – TYC could itself utilise its
own funds to redeem the Outstanding THG Shares, if JC failed to
do so by 9 April 2013. However, all payments by TYC required approval
from both HT and JC, as per the Payment Clause (see [25] above).
In short, TYC could avail itself of the self-help remedy only if
JC approved. According to HT, TYC was hamstrung because JC had consistently
ignored the issue of the Outstanding THG Shares; and JC had not,
despite the letters from HT’s solicitors, indicated how and when
she intended to procure redemption of the Outstanding THG Shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The EGM</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     HT
called an extraordinary general meeting of TYC (“the EGM”) because
of JC’s refusal to approve payment by TYC of various expenses and her
apparent indifference to fulfilling her obligation to redeem the Outstanding
THG Shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     In
HT’s words, the purpose of the EGM, which was held on 4 September
2013, was to pass resolutions to “deal with JC’s obstructive conduct”
which had created the “administrative deadlock”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The
other shareholders of TYC, being JC and the three children, were notified
of the EGM by post. However, only HT and Michael turned up. A total
of 18 resolutions were tabled and passed by HT and Michael who,
as indicated in [15] above, collectively hold 51% of the voting
rights in TYC. Only two shareholders are required under the TYC
Articles to form a quorum.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Of
the 18 resolutions passed, the ones most relevant to the dispute
are:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_a"></a>(a)     Resolutions
1(1), 1(2) and 3(6), approving that TYC, and HT, as director of
TYC, take such steps and actions, including appointing solicitors
to act for TYC and commencing court proceedings against JC, in connection
with procuring the redemption and return of the Outstanding THG
Shares;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_b"></a>(b)     Resolutions
4(1), 4(2), and 5(1), 5(2), approving the payment to HT of the Nassim
Road Expenses, and authorising HT to unilaterally sign the cheques
and vouchers to effect the reimbursement;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_c"></a>(c)     Resolutions
4(3) and 5(3), authorising HT, as director of TYC, to take all steps
and actions on TYC’s behalf as may be necessary or desirable in
relation to the payment of the Nassim Road Expenses;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_d"></a>(d)     Resolutions
6(1) and 6(2), approving the reimbursement to HT’s own company the
amount of the KPMG Fees (see [33] above), and authorising HT to
unilaterally sign the cheques and vouchers to effect the reimbursement;
and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_e"></a>(e)     Resolution
6(3), authorising HT, as director of TYC, to take all steps and
actions on TYC’s behalf as may be necessary or desirable in relation
to the payment of the KPMG Fees to HT’s own company.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Appointment of TSMP</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     On
9 September 2013, HT appointed TSMP Law Corporation (“TSMP”) as
solicitors for TYC. In his affidavit, HT claimed that TSMP was appointed
as solicitors for all four Plaintiffs but this is not borne out
by the letter of engagement; the letter was signed by HT “for and
on behalf of TYC Investment Pte Ltd”. As it turned out (see [57]–[58]
below), the issue of whether TSMP was acting for the 2nd, 3rd and
4th Plaintiffs in OS 895 became immaterial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     HT
informed TYC’s other shareholders of TSMP’s appointment by email
on 11 September 2013. Through her then solicitors, JC informed HT and
TSMP that she did not recognise TSMP as having any authority to
act on behalf of TYC. In particular, JC argued that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_47-p2_a"></a>(a)     the
management and administrative powers of TYC vest with its board
of directors, and therefore, HT’s unilateral appointment of TSMP
as TYC’s solicitors on the basis of “purported shareholders’ resolutions”
passed in the EGM was “wholly improper”; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_47-p2_b"></a>(b)     a
director’s meeting, not a shareholders’ meeting, ought to have been
convened to decide on TSMP’s appointment. JC proposed that Mr Michael
Hwang, SC, be appointed as TYC’s solicitor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     HT
rejected JC’s argument that the resolutions were improperly passed.
Through his own solicitors, Tan Rajah &amp; Cheah, HT stated that
JC had the requisite notice of the EGM. As for JC’s proposal to
appoint Mr Michael Hwang, SC, HT simply replied that TSMP had already
been appointed. TSMP, on behalf of TYC, also rejected JC’s argument
that TSMP’s appointment was improper. TSMP stated that the powers
of management rest with shareholders when there is a deadlock in
the board.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Expenses
were incurred in connection with the EGM, and the appointment of
TSMP. These included:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_49-p2_a"></a>(a)     legal
fees payable to TSMP; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_49-p2_b"></a>(b)     corporate
secretarial fees payable to Express Co Registration &amp; Management
Ltd (“Express Co”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     JC
refused to approve payment by TYC for TSMP’s legal fees (“the TSMP
Fees”) because these arose from TSMP’s appointment by HT on behalf
of TYC, and pursuant to the resolutions passed at the EGM. JC likewise
refused approval for Express Co’s corporate secretarial fees, which amounted
to $321 (“the Express Co Fees”), because these were for expenses incurred
for the EGM, which she argued had not been validly convened.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">OS 895: The proceedings</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The reliefs sought by the Plaintiffs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     On
24 September 2013, the Plaintiffs commenced OS 895 seeking two declarations:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_51-p2_a"></a>(a)     that
the cheques signed by HT on behalf of the Plaintiffs for payment
to the Plaintiffs’ immediate and long-term recurring creditors (two
lists of which were appended) and TSMP for legal services rendered
to the Plaintiffs (for the TSMP Fees) are valid, binding and are
to be honoured by the Plaintiffs’ banks (a list of which was appended),
notwithstanding that the cheques are not accompanied by a supporting
payment voucher signed by JC; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_51-p2_b"></a>(b)     that
TYC’s cheques to be signed by HT for payment of all such amounts
and to all such parties as necessary for TYC to procure the complete
redemption, return and/or recovery of the Outstanding THG Shares
are valid, binding and are to be honoured by TYC’s banks (a list
of which was appended), notwithstanding that the cheques are not
accompanied by a supporting payment voucher signed by JC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Two
further substantive prayers were added to OS 895 by way of orders
made in Summons 6201 of 2013 on 7 January 2014. They were:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_52-p2_a"></a>(a)     that
JC specifically perform her contractual obligations under the DOS,
the SSD and the TYC Deed, in that she:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_52-p2_a-p3_i"></a>(i)       sign all necessary payment vouchers and/or cheques for expenses
in relation to the Nassim Road Expenses;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_52-p2_a-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       sign all necessary payment vouchers and/or cheques such that
TYC can procure the complete redemption, return and/or recovery
of the Outstanding THG Shares;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_52-p2_a-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       sign all necessary payment vouchers and/or cheques such that
TYC can make payment of the KPMG Fees, the Express Co Fees, and
the TSMP Fees to the relevant parties; and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_52-p2_a-p3_iv"></a>(iv)       sign all necessary payment vouchers and/or cheques such that
TYC can make payment of all expenses owing to TYC’s long-term recurring
creditors (a list of which was appended); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_52-p2_b"></a>(b)     that
JC specifically perform her contractual obligations under the DOS,
the SSD and the TYC Deed within seven days of a court order to that
effect or within seven days of the presentation of the relevant
payment voucher and/or cheque, failing which TYC’s cheques signed
by HT for the relevant payments shall be valid, binding and are
to be honoured by TYC’s banks, notwithstanding that the cheques
are not accompanied by a supporting payment voucher signed by JC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Although
not expressly stated, the two new prayers added to OS 895, in so
far as they also covered payments by TYC for the TSMP Fees and the Outstanding
THG Shares, were clearly alternative prayers to the first two declarations
originally sought in OS 895 (see [51(a)] and [51(b)] above). This
is because specific performance would only be necessary if I dismissed TYC’s
request that HT could unilaterally sign cheques to effect such payments.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The hearings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     There
were three rounds of oral arguments before me. The Plaintiffs were
represented by Mr Thio Shen-Yi, SC (“Mr Thio”). HT was represented by
Mr Chelva Rajah, SC. Mr Eugene Thuraisingam (“Mr Thuraisingam”) represented
JC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     The
first round of oral arguments took place on 24 Feb 2014. I made two
observations at this first hearing. First, I thought that it was
rather clear, even on the basis of the affidavit evidence adduced
thus far, that JC was in breach of her obligation to redeem the
Outstanding THG Shares. Secondly, I pointed out to Mr Thio that
the affidavit evidence does not actually disclose that JC was not
prepared to <em>allow TYC to exercise the self-help remedy,
and to itself redeem</em> the Outstanding THG Shares (as opposed
to JC refusing to redeem these shares herself). I therefore adjourned
this hearing to give the Plaintiffs time to adduce evidence that
JC was obstructing TYC from exercising its self-help remedy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     At
this first hearing, I also ordered that there be cross-examination
of HT and JC on the issue of the KPMG Fees and the Nassim Road Expenses at
the next hearing because these items were the subject of factual
disputes raised in the affidavit evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     There
was an important clarification in the first hearing that I ought to
mention. I queried Mr Thio on his role in relation to the 2nd, 3rd
and 4th Plaintiffs respectively in the proceedings given that he
was, on his own case, formally appointed to represent TYC only.
Mr Thio clarified that as a result of events subsequent to the filing
of OS 895, the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Plaintiffs no longer had any interest
in the proceedings. I understood that to mean that there were no
payment issues for which an order against JC was required by the
2nd, 3rd or 4th Plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     The
net effect of Mr Thio’s clarification was that the prayers sought
in OS 895 now had to be narrowed down even further. References to
the Plaintiffs (see for example, [51(a)] above) would now be read
as referring only to TYC. Indeed, for all intents and purposes,
and notwithstanding six parties are formally named on the record,
the proceedings were really just between TYC and HT on the one side,
and JC on the other.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     The
second hearing took place on 27 March 2014. At this hearing, Mr Thio
informed me that JC had indicated that she would comply with her obligation
to procure full redemption of the Outstanding THG Shares by 15 April
2014, failing which TYC could itself redeem the Outstanding THG Shares.
However, Mr Thio sought an order from the court that JC procure OCBC
to disclose the exact amount needed to redeem the Outstanding THG
Shares before 15 April 2014 – this order would enable TYC to effect redemption
should JC fail to do so by that date.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     As
agreed between Mr Thio and Mr Thuraisingam, I granted the following
by way of a consent order (“Consent Order No 1”):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_60-p2_a"></a>(a)     JC
shall procure OCBC to inform TYC on or before 10 April 2014 the
costs and expenses necessary for TYC to procure the complete redemption,
return and/or recovery of the Outstanding THG Shares; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_60-p2_b"></a>(b)     in
the event that JC fails to procure redemption of the Outstanding
THG Shares by 15 April 2014, she shall specifically perform her
contractual obligations under the DOS, the SSD and the TYC Deed
by signing all necessary payment vouchers and/or cheques such that
TYC can procure the complete redemption, return and/or recovery
of the Outstanding THG Shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     The
hearing was then adjourned until after 15 April 2014. I would note
here that the most significant claim (in monetary terms) was disposed of
with Consent Order No 1.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     The
third hearing took place on 21 April 2014. The main purpose of this
hearing was to take oral evidence in relation to the Nassim Road Expenses
and the KPMG Fees. However, before the cross-examination began,
Mr Thio informed me that all the parties had come to an agreement in
relation to the Nassim Road Expenses. JC would sign the relevant cheques
or payment vouchers to enable TYC to reimburse HT. A draft consent
order to that effect was then presented to be recorded as an Order of
Court (“Consent Order No 2”). I approved Consent Order No 2 in terms.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     Therefore,
at the cross-examination, the only outstanding issues that had yet
to be resolved at that point were:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_63-p2_a"></a>(a)     the
validity of the resolutions passed at the EGM authorising HT to
appoint TSMP as TYC’s solicitors;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_63-p2_b"></a>(b)     flowing
from that, which party was liable to pay the TSMP Fees and the Express
Co Fees; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_63-p2_c"></a>(c)     payment
of the KPMG Fees.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     At
the end of this third hearing, I asked counsel for all parties to provide
further submissions on the above issues.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">My decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The validity of the resolutions
passed at the EGM</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The EGM’s power to appoint solicitors
to commence legal action</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     The
case before me was argued on the footing that the validity of TSMP’s
appointment, and therefore, TYC’s liability to pay the TSMP Fees, would
depend on whether the EGM had the power to authorise HT to appoint
solicitors to commence the present proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     It
would seem intuitively logical, and practically sensible, that shareholders
with majority control over a company should be able to authorise
the commencement of legal proceedings against an errant director,
if the board of directors of that company cannot act by virtue of that
director having the ability to veto any board resolution authorising such
proceedings. However, as will become evident, the simplicity of
this proposition is more apparent than real.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     A
convenient starting point is the rule in <em>Foss
v Harbottle</em> (1843) 2 Hare 461 (“<em>Foss
v Harbottle</em>”). The rule states that the proper plaintiff
in a suit for the enforcement of a corporate right is the company
itself. Therefore, minority shareholders are generally not entitled
to sue to enforce a company’s rights. This aspect of the rule in <em>Foss v Harbottle</em> is clear.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     The
more contentious question relates to which organ of the company
(that is, the board of directors or the members in general meeting),
constitutes the “company” for the purpose of commencing litigation
in the company’s name.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Interestingly, <em>Foss v Harbottle</em> suggests that the power
to commence litigation lies with the members in general meeting
where the action is brought against errant directors to enforce
duties owed to the company. The court there noted (at 493):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">On the first point it is only necessary
to refer to the clauses of the Act to shew that, whilst <b><em>the supreme governing body</em></b>, the <b><em>proprietors at a special general meeting</em></b> assembled,
retain the power of exercising the functions conferred upon them
by the Act of Incorporation, <b><em>it cannot be
competent to individual corporators to sue</em></b> in the manner
proposed by the Plaintiffs on the present record. [emphasis added
in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     However, <em>Foss v Harbottle</em> was decided at a time
where a company was regarded as an association of its shareholders.
In other words, the shareholders in general meeting were equated
with the company. Directors, on the other hand, were regarded as
agents of the members in general meeting and therefore, subject
to shareholders’ control: see Pearlie Koh, <em>Company
Law</em> (LexisNexis, 2nd Ed, 2009) (“<em>Company
Law</em>”) at p 71; and R P Austin and I M Ramsay, <em>Ford’s Principles of Corporations Law</em> (LexisNexis,
15th Ed, 2013) (“<em>Ford</em>”) at p 232–233.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     This
paradigm was substantially altered by the seminal decision of the House
of Lords in <em>Saloman v A Saloman &amp; Co Ltd</em> [1897]
AC 22 (“<em>Saloman</em>”) which recognised
that a company was a separate legal entity from its members, and
subsequently by <em>Automatic Self-Cleansing Filter Syndicate
Co Ltd v Cunninghame</em> [1906] 2 Ch 34 (“<em>Cunninghame</em>”). <em>Cunninghame</em> rejected the notion that directors
were agents of the members in general meeting. Instead, the House
of Lords held that directors owed their duties to the company as
a separate entity (see <em>Company Law</em> at
pp 71–2; and <em>Ford</em> at pp 233–234).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     Importantly,
for present purposes, <em>Cunninghame</em> established
that the division of powers between the directors and shareholders
in any case would depend on the construction of a company’s constitution,
which has the effect of a contract between the members and the company,
and the members among themselves.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     In
Singapore, the division of powers between directors and shareholders
is also statutorily enshrined in s 157A of the Companies Act which
provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Powers
of directors</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>157A.</b>—(1) <em>The
business of a company </em><b><em>shall </em></b><em>be managed by or under the direction of the directors</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    The
directors may exercise all the powers of a company except any power
that this Act or the memorandum and articles of the company require the
company to exercise in general meeting.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     Companies
which adopt the Table A articles of association (“Table A Articles”)
contained in the Fourth Schedule to the Companies Act will have Art
73, which is identical to s 157A(1) and (2). Article 73 was incorporated as
part of TYC’s Articles.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     In
this regard, s 157A is best understood in the light of its legislative history.
Prior to its enactment in 2003, there was no statutory statement
as to the distribution of powers between the board of directors
and the general meeting. Rather, this was determined solely by a
company’s constitution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     For
companies that had adopted the Table A Articles under the Fourth
Schedule to the <em>old</em> Companies Act
(Cap 50, 1967 Rev Ed), the Art 73 then in force (“the old Art 73”)
provided as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>The business of the
company shall be managed by the directors</em> who may pay all
expenses incurred in promoting and registering the company, and
may exercise all such powers of the company as are not, by the Act
or by these Regulations, required to be exercised by the company
in general meeting, <b><em>subject, nevertheless</em></b><em>, to any of these Regulations, to the provisions
of the Act</em>,<b><em>and to such regulations,
being not inconsistent with the aforesaid Regulations or provisions,
as may be prescribed by the company in general meeting</em></b>;
but no regulation made by the company in general meeting shall invalidate
any prior act of the directors which would have been valid if that regulation
had not been made. [emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It should be noted that the old Art 73 is in <em>pari </em><em>materia</em> with reg 55 of Table A under the
Companies Act 1862 (UK).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     The
cases have not spoken in a single voice as to the meaning of the limiting
words in the old Art 73 (which are in bold italics in the extract above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     There
are basically two lines of authority.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     The
first states that the old Art 73 vests management powers exclusively
in the board of directors and the members in general meeting cannot
override board decisions or direct the board to act in a certain
way: see <em>Cunninghame</em>; <em>Quin &amp; Axtens Ltd v Salmon</em> [1909]
AC 442; <em>John Shaw &amp; Sons (Salford) Ltd
v Peter Shaw and John Shaw</em> [1935] 2 KB 112 (“<em>John Shaw</em>”); and <em>Breckland
Group Holdings v London and Suffolk Properties Ltd</em> [1989]
BCLC 100.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     Under
the first line of authority, the shareholders’ control over the exercise
of management powers by the directors is limited to two options: amending
the articles, or removing the board and electing a new one in its place.
The shareholders cannot usurp the powers which are vested in the directors
by the company’s articles: <em>John Shaw</em> at
134.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     The
second line of authority states that the members in general meeting
can control the board of directors by passing an ordinary resolution,
provided the resolution is not inconsistent with the Companies Act
or the articles of the company: see for example <em>Marshall’s
Valve Gear Co Ltd v Manning Wardle &amp; Co Ltd</em> [1909]
1 Ch 267; and <em>Credit Development Pte Ltd </em><em>v IMO Pte Ltd</em> [1993] 1 SLR(R) 68 (“<em>Credit Development</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     In <em>Credit Development</em>, the issue was whether
the shareholders had the power to pass resolutions to appoint accountants
and solicitors to investigate the affairs of the company (in this
case, the company’s articles contained a provision that was identical
to the old Art 73). Lim Tiong Qwee JC held that this was a matter
of interpreting the company’s articles. On this basis he found that
the shareholders did have such a power. He observed (at [22]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">When such resolutions are passed, what
the company in general meeting is saying to the directors is “Appoint
accountants and solicitors for these specific purposes. <b><em>Subject to that </em></b><em>you
manage the company’s business and exercise all the company’s powers</em>”.[emphasis
added in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     In
December 1999, the Company Legislation and Regulatory Framework
Committee (“the CLRFC”), chaired by Dr Phillip Pillai, was appointed
and tasked with undertaking a comprehensive review of the company
law and regulatory framework in Singapore. The CLRFC’s findings
and recommendations were published in the <em>Report
of the Company Legislation and Regulatory Framework Committee </em><em>(October 2002)</em> (“<em>the </em><em>CLRFC Report</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     The
CLRFC recommended that the Companies Act then in force be amended
to include a statutory restatement of the division of powers between
the directors and the general meeting along the lines of s 198A
of the Australian Corporations Act 2001 (No 50 of 2001) (Aust) (“the Australian
Corporations Act”). The CLRFC’s recommendation was as follows (see
the <em>CLRFC Report</em> at para 4.7):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4.7.1 <em>We recommend
the adoption of the statutory restatement of the distribution of
powers between directors and general meeting in the following model
used in s. 198A of the Australian Corporations Act 2001: “(1) The business
of a company is to be managed by or under the direction of the directors.
(2) The directors may exercise all the powers of the company except any
powers that this Act or the company’s constitution (if any) requires
the company to exercise in general meeting.” </em><b><em>This will override article 73 of Table A, Fourth
Schedule, CA which provides that management powers are also subject
to “such regulations, being not inconsistent with the aforesaid Regulations
or provisions, as may be prescribed by the company in general meeting.”</em></b></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4.7.2 In the Singapore decision of <em>Credit Development v IMO</em> [1993] 2 SLR 370,
on a construction of article 73 of Table A, Fourth Schedule, CA,
it was held that an ordinary resolution of shareholders in a general
meeting may exercise some of the powers given to the directors.
The holding in Credit Development takes a different approach from
UK and Australian cases (now clearly backed by the slightly different
articles they have and also provisions like s. 198A, Australian
Corporations Act 2001) which give management more autonomy. While
the decision in <em>Credit Development</em> is
useful in those exceptional cases where the majority shareholder
does not control the board, it may not be necessary with the re-statement
of directors’ duties that has been recommended, and in particular,
the re-emphasis on the duty of directors to exercise their powers
for proper purposes.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     Section
157A was introduced by way of the Companies (Amendment) Act (Act
8 of 2003) because of the CLRFC’s recommendation. In my view, this
provision, as well as Art 73 (where adopted), settles the position
that where powers of management are vested in the board of directors,
then <em>ordinarily</em>, the board alone
can exercise those powers. The shareholders cannot control the board
in the exercise of these powers by passing a resolution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     There
is a further (open) question as to whether it was also Parliament’s
intention that <em>only</em> the board of
directors should ever make management decisions: see <em>Company Law</em> at p 74. To put this differently, should
an express term in a company’s articles conferring management powers
upon the shareholders be deemed invalid as a matter of law? Or does
s 157A establish a default rule which may be varied by the company’s articles?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     Although
this issue did not arise in the present case and parties did not
make submissions on it, I would parenthetically observe that the
latter interpretation is preferable because:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_87-p2_a"></a>(a)     as
a matter of practicality and commercial reality, corporate structures
are so varied that it would be impossible to prescribe a set form
of corporate governance. For example, there may be good commercial
justifications for certain management powers to be reserved to the
members in the case of a closely held joint venture company;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_87-p2_b"></a>(b)     under
s 157A(2), the directors may exercise all the powers of the company,
apart from what the Companies Act or the company’s constitution
reserves for the general meeting;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_87-p2_c"></a>(c)     section
198A of the Australian Corporations Act, upon which s 157A is based,
is modelled as a “replaceable rule” and therefore can be overridden
by express provision in a company’s constitution;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_87-p2_d"></a>(d)     the
fact that the language of s 157A is replicated in Art 73 of the Table
A Articles suggests that a company may choose to depart from the
statutorily prescribed division of powers in its constitution;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_87-p2_e"></a>(e)     there
is nothing in the relevant secondary material which suggests that
Parliament had intended s 157A to have the effect of invalidating
any attempt to depart from the division of powers under s 157A;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_87-p2_f"></a>(f)     conversely,
it would appear that s 157A was intended to prevent shareholders
from interfering with the exercise of management powers where these
are vested in the board of directors by the constitution; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_87-p2_g"></a>(g)     the
leading textbook on company law in Singapore supports the view that
s 157A establishes a default rule which may be varied by the company’s
articles: see <em>Walter Woon on Company Law</em> (Tan
Cheng Han gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, Revised 3rd Ed, 2009) (“<em>Walter Woon</em>”) at p 150.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     It
is therefore my view that the division of powers between the board of
directors and the shareholders is a <em>matter
of contract</em> under current Singapore law, subject to any
provision in the Companies Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     The
constitution of the company is therefore paramount, and it is not possible
to generalise in any given case. If, however, s 157A and Art 73
of the Table A Articles apply, as they did in the present case,
then the compact between the shareholders and the directors is that
while the former own the company, the latter manage it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     The
reason for this compact may be somewhat obvious – directors are fiduciaries
of the company whereas shareholders are not. Directors are therefore
required, always, to act in the best interests of the company. Shareholders
are not fiduciaries of the company – shareholders are entitled to
vote in their own personal interests on any shareholders’ resolution.
This is so even if their personal interests conflict with the company’s
best interests.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     Mr
Thio was therefore correct in conceding that ordinarily, the board of
TYC alone may exercise powers of management because TYC’s constitution
vested such powers in the board. Mr Thio submitted, however, that
TYC’s board was deadlocked in relation to the numerous issues raised at
the EGM. In that case, he said that there was an exception to the
general rule that shareholders could not exercise management powers.
He argued that a general meeting had “reserve powers” of management,
which, in this case, included the power to appoint solicitors to
commence OS 895.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     Mr
Thuraisingam accepted that the TYC board was deadlocked in relation
to the issues raised at the EGM. He also accepted that the shareholders
did have some form of reserve powers if TYC’s board was unable or
unwilling to act. He argued, however, that this was limited to appointing
new directors and that reserve powers did not give the shareholders
powers of management. According to Mr Thuraisingam, this meant that
the EGM did not have the power to appoint solicitors to commence
OS 895.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     Both
parties cited several authorities where the courts had considered both
the existence and scope of the general meeting’s reserve powers.
I will now consider the most relevant of these authorities, starting
with three English cases.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     In <em>Barron v Potter</em> [1914] Ch 895 (“<em>Barron</em>”), the company’s constitution gave
the directors the power to appoint additional directors. There were
only two directors. One of the directors refused to attend meetings
and the business of the company came to a standstill. An extraordinary
general meeting of the company was convened and resolutions passed
to remove the recalcitrant director and to appoint new directors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     The
issue then was whether the appointment of the new directors was valid.
In holding that it was, Warrington J stated (at 903):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>If directors having
certain powers are unable or unwilling to exercise them – are in
fact a non-existent body for the purpose</em> – there must
be some power in the company to do itself that which under other
circumstances be otherwise done. The directors in the present case
being unwilling to appoint additional directors under the power
conferred on them by the articles, in my opinion, the company in
general meeting has power to make the appointment. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     In <em>Foster v Foster</em> [1916] 1 Ch 532 (“<em>Foster</em>”), the articles gave the directors
the power to appoint one of their own as managing director. In circumstances
where the directors were unable to appoint a managing director because
of internal friction, the court held that the general meeting had
the power to do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     In <em>Alexander Ward &amp; Co v Samyang Co</em> [1975]
1 WLR 673 <em>(“Alexander Ward</em>”), two
members of the company instituted proceedings on the company’s behalf.
At the time the proceedings were commenced, the company had no directors.
The company later went into liquidation and the liquidator ratified
the proceedings. Before the House of Lords, it was argued that the
liquidator could not ratify the proceedings because there was no
competent principal at the time the proceedings were commenced. The
House of Lords rejected this argument. Lord Hailsham stated (at 678–679):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[A]t the relevant time the company was
fully competent either to lay arrestments or to raise proceedings
in the Scottish courts. <em>The company could have
done so either by appointing directors, or, as I think</em>,<em>by authorising proceedings in general meeting, which
in the absence of an effective board, has a residual authority to
use the company’s power</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     More
recently, the New South Wales Court of Appeal in <em>Massey
&amp; Anor v Wales &amp; Ors</em> [2003] NSWCA 212 (“<em>Massey</em>”) considered the question of shareholder
reserve powers. <em>Massey</em> concerned
a company which had two directors. One director, Yaqob Rajwan, wanted
to appoint Baruch Rajwan to the board of the company but a quorum
for a board meeting could not be reached as the board was deadlocked.
Yaqob Rajwan nonetheless held a board meeting in the absence of
the other director and Baruch Rajwan was appointed as a director.
This appointment was invalid. The Rajwans then gave instructions
to solicitors to commence legal proceedings on the company’s behalf.
Thereafter, a shareholders resolution was passed to ratify the appointment
of the solicitors. The issue before the court therefore was whether
the shareholders had the power to do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     Hogdson
JA (with whom Meagher and Beazley JJA agreed) held that on the facts
of the case, the general meeting did not have the power to ratify the
appointment of solicitors. His reasons were as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_99-p2_a"></a>(a)     If
the articles provide that the business of the company is to be managed
by the directors, there is generally no power in the general meeting
to control or direct the directors in the exercise of these powers: <em>Massey</em> at [45].</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_99-p2_b"></a>(b)     This
is because of the contract between the members as contained in the
constitution of the company. Under this contract, the management
of the company should be by persons who each should have a fiduciary
duty to act in the interest of the company as a whole: <em>Massey</em> at [46].</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_99-p2_c"></a>(c)     The
general position is subject to the qualification that where the
board is unwilling or unable to act, the general meeting has some kind
of reserve power. The source of this reserve power is a matter of implication
on the basis of business efficacy or necessity: <em>Massey</em> at [47].</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_99-p2_d"></a>(d)     Where,
as in the present case, the articles contained an express power
for the general meeting to appoint new directors or to remove directors
and replace them with other directors, it would be unreasonable
to regard a deadlock in the board as giving shareholders general
powers of management: <em>Massey</em> at
[47].</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_99-p2_e"></a>(e)     The
earlier cases, including <em>Barron</em> and <em>Foster</em>, did not support a wide doctrine
of reserve powers: <em>Massey</em> at [50]–[71].</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_99-p2_f"></a>(f)     Insofar
as <em>Alexander Ward</em> stood for the
contrary proposition, it should not be followed: <em>Massey</em> at
[59].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    I
pause here to note that the juridical basis of the general meeting’s reserve
powers is not clear.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    In <em>Walter Woon</em>, the position is stated broadly,
and as follows (at para 5.13):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If there is no competent board or where
the board cannot act (e.g. where there is a deadlock in the board),
the power of management reverts to the members.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">
<em>Walter Woon</em> cites <em>Barron</em> as authority for this proposition.
Lord Hailsham’s <em>dicta</em> in <em>Alexander Ward</em> (see [97] above) also supports
this broad proposition.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    The
obvious difficulty with a wide doctrine of reserve powers is that
it is not readily reconcilable with the division of powers between
the directors and shareholders under s 157A of the Companies Act
(and Art 73 of the Table A Articles): see <em>Company
Law</em> at p 76; Paul Davies and Sarah Worthington, <em>Gower &amp; Davies Principles of Modern Company Law</em> (Sweet &amp;
Maxwell,<sup></sup>9th Ed, 2012) (“<em>Gower
&amp; Davies</em>”) at p 391.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    In
fact, one prominent academic has gone as far as to suggest that reserve
powers can <em>never</em> exist under the
modern view of the division of powers between directors and shareholders:
see Ross Grantham, “The reserve powers of company shareholders”
(2004) 63(1) CLJ 36 at p 37. Professor Grantham suggests that the
existence of reserve powers rests on the (outdated) notion that
directors are agents of the shareholders in general meeting.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    Another
view is that reserve powers are a matter of implication under a
company’s constitution on the basis of necessity or business efficacy:
see for example <em>Ford’s Principles of Corporations
Law</em> vol 1 (Butterworths, Loose-Leaf Service, 1995) at
para 7.130.6. As noted earlier, <em>Massey</em> accepted this
as the basis for the qualification to the general rule that powers
of management reside in the board alone. In my view, this analysis
is persuasive.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    As
a matter of principle, the predicate of the compact between the shareholders
and the company under s 157A of the Companies Act (and Art 73 of
the Table A Articles) is the subsistence of a board of directors
that is both competent and willing to manage the affairs of the
company. If this predicate is absent or otherwise incapable of fulfilling
its purpose, it does not make sense that the company should be powerless
to act simply because of the general rule that powers of management
are ordinarily exercisable by the directors alone.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    Further,
the rationale for implying reserve powers is most evident from the
viewpoint of policy. Professor Grantham himself concedes that if legal
proceedings are contemplated against a director who is able to prevent the
company from suing, it would be undesirable on the ground of accountability
if the shareholders were powerless to act. However, Professor Grantham’s
objection to shareholder reserve powers is that they cannot be explained
in a principled way. Based on what I have said at [104] and [105] above,
I would respectfully disagree.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    Yet,
it must be emphasised that insofar as shareholder reserve powers are
a matter of implication, their scope is narrow and the express terms
of the contract between the shareholders and directors should be
respected as far as possible. In this regard, I agree with Hodgson
JA’s view in <em>Massey</em> that there is
no wide doctrine of reserve powers. A wide doctrine of reserve powers
can only rest on the proposition that the board is generally subject to
the control and direction of the shareholders. As I have already
noted, this would be untenable in view of s 157A (and Art 73 of
the Table A Articles).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    In
my judgment, the cases on reserve powers can be distilled into the following
set of principles:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_108-p2_a"></a>(a)     Reserve
powers do not devolve to the shareholders unless the board is unable
or unwilling to act.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_108-p2_a-p3_i"></a>(i)       In relation to unwillingness, the fact that shareholders disagree
with a <em>bona fide</em> board decision
will not in itself be sufficient.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_108-p2_a-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       However, if the directors who are preventing the company from
suing are the wrongdoers themselves, this requirement is more often
than not satisfied.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_108-p2_b"></a>(b)     If
the deadlock in management may be broken in some other way under
the company’s constitution (as was the case in <em>Massey</em>), then
the court should refuse to recognise that shareholders have reserve
powers of management.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_108-p2_b-p3_i"></a>(i)       The reason for this proposition is that reserve powers are implied
under a company’s constitution on the basis of necessity. The corollary
to this proposition is that mere convenience will not justify the
exercise of management powers by shareholders.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_108-p2_b-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       In this regard, I note that in <em>Massey</em>,
the deadlock in management could have, as a matter of contract,
been broken by appointing additional directors.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_108-p2_c"></a>(c)     The
scope of the reserve powers which the shareholders may exercise
would depend on the facts of each case.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_108-p2_c-p3_i"></a>(i)       The cases have not established any general proposition governing
the issue of scope. In my view, it is clear that reserve powers
may not be exercised to contravene an express term in a company’s
articles.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_108-p2_c-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       A convenient test, in my view, can be stated as what is reasonably
necessary in the circumstances of the case. The reference to necessity
recognises that reserve powers arise because of a deadlock in management
and hence their scope should ordinarily go no further than what
is necessary to break that deadlock. It reinforces the point that
reserve powers are narrow in scope.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_108-p2_c-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       The reference to reasonableness, on the
other hand, recognises the practical difficulties and uncertainties
which shareholders face in the purported exercise of reserve powers. Necessity
must therefore be judged with a degree of latitude.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_108-p2_d"></a>(d)     Keeping
in mind that it is all a matter of contract, the resolution in general
meeting to commence proceedings must be passed in accordance with
the requisite majority as prescribed by the company’s constitution.
Absent any super majority requirement contained in the company’s
constitution, the power to commence proceedings may be authorised
by an ordinary resolution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    I
will now apply these principles to the case before me.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    In
relation to the first issue of whether TYC’s board was unable or unwilling
to act, it is not disputed by the parties that TYC’s board was deadlocked
in relation to the matters raised at the EGM.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    The
source of the deadlock was twofold. First, the Payment Clause required
both HT and JC to approve payments by TYC (see [25] above) and JC
had refused to approve payment of many expenses (at the commencement
of OS 895, these expenses were not limited to the KPMG Expenses
and the Nassim Road Expenses (see [27] and [51] above), including
the amounts required to redeem the Outstanding THG Shares. Second,
HT and JT were the only two directors of TYC, and both had to agree
when making management (and payment) decisions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    In
relation to the second issue of whether the deadlock in management
could be broken in some other way under TYC’s Articles, there were
arguments before me as to whether TYC’s Articles even allowed for
additional directors to be appointed. In my view, however, these arguments
had no bearing for two reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    The
first relates to a point alluded to earlier, that is, the source
of the deadlock in the present case was the Payment Clause, which
required both HT and JC to approve payments by TYC. The appointment
of additional directors would not have broken the deadlock in this
respect.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    The
second relates to the fact that the parties did not dispute that
Art 8 of TYC’s Articles (see [13] above) meant that any additional
directors appointed would have been bound by HT’s or JC’s discretion
in respect of the management of TYC. This included the commencement
of OS 895.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    I
was therefore satisfied that TYC did not have a contractual remedy under
the TYC Articles to break the deadlock in relation to the matters raised
at the EGM.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    In
relation to the third issue of scope, Mr Thuraisingam submitted that
the reserve powers of the EGM were limited to appointing new directors.
He submitted that the doctrine of reserve powers did not permit shareholders
to exercise management powers, including the power to appoint solicitors
to commence proceedings. Mr Thuraisingam cited <em>Massey</em> as
authority for this proposition.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    I
was unable to agree with Mr Thuraisingam’s submission. For a start, it
conflates the second and third issues identified at [108(b)] and
[108(c)] above. In <em>Massey</em>, Hodgson
JA found that <em>no</em> reserve powers
devolved to the shareholders because the deadlock in management
could be broken by appointing additional directors. Hodgson JA therefore
did not go on to consider the issue of scope as it was moot. Hence, <em>Massey</em> does not stand for the proposition
that shareholders’ reserve powers are limited to appointing additional
directors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    Keeping
with the discussion at [108(c)] above, I was of the view that the
scope of shareholder reserve powers are fact-sensitive issues. In
this regard, I agreed with Mr Thio’s submission that <em>Massey</em> could be distinguished because
the appointment of additional directors would not have broken the
deadlock in the present case (see [112]–[115] above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    Mr
Thuraisingam further submitted that it would be contrary to Art 76
of TYC’s Articles for the EGM to exercise the power to appoint solicitors to
commence proceedings. The exact wording of Art 76 is as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The directors may from time to time by
power of attorney appoint any corporation, firm, limited liability
partnership or person or body of persons, whether nominated directly
or indirectly by the directors, to be the attorney or attorneys
of the company for such purposes and with such powers, authorities,
and discretion (not exceeding those vested in or exercisable by the
directors under these Regulations) and for such period and subject
to such conditions as they may think fit, and any such powers of
attorney may contain such provisions for the protection and convenience
of persons dealing with any such attorney as the directors may think
fit and may also authorise any such attorney to delegate all or
any of the powers, authorities and discretions vested in him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    With
respect, I disagreed with Mr Thuraisingam’s argument. “Attorneys”
may mean lawyers under American usage but that was not its meaning
under Art 76. In my view, Art 76 relates to the appointment of delegates
under a power of attorney and not to the appointment of solicitors
to commence proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    Finally,
and in relation to the requirement in [108(d)] above, I noted that
TYC’s Articles do not prescribe any super majority requirement for
a general meeting to authorise legal proceedings. I was therefore
satisfied that the ordinary resolution passed at the EGM constituted
valid approval for the commencement of OS 895 against JC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    On
the facts of this case, I was satisfied that it was reasonably necessary
for the EGM to have the limited power to appoint solicitors to commence
proceedings to determine the rights and obligations of the relevant
parties under the Divorce Settlement Agreements, so as to break the
deadlock in management.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    In
coming to this conclusion, I was mindful of the nature of the litigation
decision in the present case; the proceedings were commenced against
a director who herself could prevent the company from suing. In circumstances
where the board itself was incapable of making a disinterested decision,
I was fortified in my view that it was reasonable for the EGM to
exercise the power to do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">
<em>Section 216A of the Companies Act</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    I
will now consider whether (and if so how) s 216A of the Companies Act
affects the issue of whether the EGM had the power to appoint solicitors
to commence OS 895 and therefore, my decision that the EGM did have
such power. Section 216A permits a “complainant” to commence action
in the name of a company, subject to satisfying certain requirements. Section
216A(1) defines a “complainant” and for present purposes, it suffices
to say that the definition includes a shareholder of a company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    The
parties did not address the s 216A issue squarely in submissions. Mr
Thuraisingam submitted that if JC had breached her fiduciary duties, HT
ought to have commenced a derivative action against her for damages under
s 216A. However, Mr Thuraisingam’s argument seemed to be directed
at whether the prayers for specific performance as a remedy should be
granted and not the EGM’s power to commence proceedings against
JC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    Mr
Thio, on the other hand, merely argued that HT did not need to commence
a derivative action under s 216A because he had the support of the
majority at the EGM.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    In <em>Massey</em>, Hodgson JA appeared to suggest
that the general meeting lacked the power to commence legal proceedings
because individual shareholders could commence derivative proceedings
in the company’s name in some cases. Hodgson JA stated (at [70]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… I would have thought that the inability
of a general meeting to authorise the commencement of proceedings
is a reason why, in some circumstances, an individual shareholder
should be permitted to do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    It
is not clear precisely what Hodgson JA meant. If he was suggesting that
a general meeting does not have <em>wide</em> powers
to commence proceedings in the company’s name when powers of management
are vested in the board, this view would be uncontroversial. If,
however, Hodgson JA was stating a broader proposition that the general
meeting could never possess reserve powers to commence legal proceedings,
then I must respectfully disagree.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    I
do not doubt that it would be more conducive to certainty in cases such
as the present if a derivative action is commenced. It may also
be argued that if the general meeting is permitted to exercise reserve
powers (in appropriate cases) to commence legal proceedings in the
company’s name, then the requirements (and safeguards) prescribed
by s 216A would be circumvented. There are three requirements. The
complainant must:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_129-p2_a"></a>(a)     give
14 days’ notice to the board of his intention to apply for leave
to commence a derivative action;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_129-p2_b"></a>(b)     be
acting in good faith; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_129-p2_c"></a>(c)     show
that it is <em>prima facie</em> in the interest
of the company that the action be brought.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    In
my judgment, such an argument, although attractive at first blush, was
untenable on the facts of the present case for the following reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    To
begin with, s 216A is a facilitative provision and it clearly does
not mandate that a derivative action is commenced in every case
where proceedings are authorised by shareholders as opposed to the
board. A clear example in which a derivative action need not be
commenced is where the power to commence litigation is expressly
conferred on the general meeting by the company’s articles.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132    It
should be noted that there are important conceptual differences between
a derivative action and an action brought by the general meeting
in the exercise of its reserve powers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a>133    At
common law, a derivative action is one where a member sues in his own
name, on behalf of all the other members, to enforce the company’s rights.
In this sense, he “derives” his right to sue from the company: <em>Walter Woon</em> at para 9.30. The position
under s 216A is somewhat different. Strictly speaking, an action
brought under that section is a corporate (as opposed to a personal)
action brought in the company’s name: <em>Walter Woon</em> at
para 9.69. In substance however, the action is controlled by the individual
complainant and not the board of directors. To this extent, a derivative
action is a “true” exception to the proper plaintiff rule in <em>Foss v Harbottle</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a>134    In
contrast, reserve powers are a matter of implication under a company’s
constitution and they relate to the internal division of power between
the two organs of the company. If it is shown that the general meeting
did have reserve powers to commence proceedings, then the proper
plaintiff would be before the court and it would be moot to consider whether
an exception to the rule in the sense of a derivative action should apply.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_135"></a>135    In
this regard, the following observations in <em>Company
Law</em> (at pp 142–143) are instructive:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The rule in <em>Foss v
Harbottle</em> is of course not so much concerned about the question
of how corporate powers are divided between the organs of the company,
but is concerned with the question whether individual shareholders
may commence suit [sic] on behalf of the company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_136"></a>136    I
agree. It would be putting the cart before the horse to regard the ability
to bring a derivative action as foreclosing the possibility of the general
meeting exercising reserve powers to commence legal proceedings in
the company’s name.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137"></a>137    I
also noted that the requirements under s 216A are generally directed at
proceedings commenced by minority shareholders and not by the majority
in general meeting. At the second reading of the Companies (Amendment)
Bill 1993, it was stated by the then Minister of Finance, Dr Richard
Hu Tsu Tau that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As Members would recall, the proposed new
sections 216A and 216B provide for statutory derivative actions
by minority shareholders on behalf of their companies. Only one
representor has questioned the need for such a provision. The representor
was concerned that the new statutory right might be open to abuse
by minority shareholders.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a>138    Section
216B of the Companies Act is also relevant. Section 216B permits
the court to consider the fact that a breach of duty has been approved
by the members of the company when granting leave under s 216A (even
though such approval is not conclusive of whether leave should be
granted).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a>139    The
above observations are in turn consonant with the principle of “majority
rule” enunciated in <em>Foss v Harbottle</em>.
This principle states that if the alleged wrong is capable of being
ratified by a majority of shareholders in general meeting, then
no individual shareholder should be permitted to maintain an action
in respect of the matter: see <em>Edwards v Halliwell</em> [1950]
2 All ER 1064 at 1066.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_140"></a>140    It
may therefore be said that the policy of the law has been to treat proceedings
authorised by the majority of shareholders in general meeting differently
from those commenced by minority shareholders. To this end, majority
rule makes contractual sense in most (but clearly not all) cases because
minority shareholders typically freely chose to become members of a
company. I note also that majority rule is the norm under the Companies Act
in the exercise of certain corporate powers. To mention just two examples,
an ordinary resolution in general meeting suffices to authorise the
issue of shares by a company, or for a company to dispose of all,
or substantially all, of its assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_141"></a>141    Majority
rule also makes economic sense because the majority has the greater
incentive to maximise corporate value. In the context of corporate litigation,
it prevents unnecessary, multiplicitous or vexatious actions being commenced
in the company name by placing the litigation decision with the
majority. This, however, is subject to the caveat that in most cases,
the majority’s control over litigation is indirect and exercised
by removing a board which refuses to act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_142"></a>142    Further,
if a minority shareholder feels that proceedings commenced by the
majority (whether through the board or in exercise of reserve powers)
is not in the company’s best interest, that minority shareholder may
apply for leave to discontinue the proceedings under s 216A(2) of
the Companies Act. From the viewpoint of policy, this would serve
as a check against the majority’s power to commence proceedings
in the company’s name.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_143"></a>143    Finally,
it bears reiteration that the doctrine of reserve powers does not
give a general meeting <em>carte blanche</em> powers
to commence litigation in the company’s name. Rather, as will be
obvious from the discussion above (see [93] to [123]), reserve powers
only arise in exceptional cases and they are narrow in scope.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_144"></a>144    For
the reasons stated above, I was satisfied that s 216A of the Companies
Act does not affect my decision that the EGM had the power to appoint
solicitors to commence OS 895. It followed that TSMP’s appointment
was valid.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_145"></a>145    My
decision (at [144] above) made it unnecessary to consider Mr Thio’s
other submissions regarding the EGM’s power to appoint solicitors to
commence legal proceedings. However, I will do so for completeness.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_146"></a>146    Mr
Thio submitted that leaving aside the issue of reserve powers, the EGM
nevertheless had the power to appoint solicitors to commence OS 895.
He provided two reasons for this. First, he said that the decision
to commence legal proceedings was not a management decision if it concerned
the breach of fiduciary duties by existing directors. Secondly,
he said that the general meeting had the power to commence legal
proceedings where the directors had refused to do so for improper
motives.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_147"></a>147    I
do not accept Mr Thio’s submission that the decision to commence proceedings
against a recalcitrant director is not a management decision. I do
not see how the defendant’s identity alters the nature of the decision
to be taken. In my view, the real issue in such cases is that the
directors are unable or unwilling to make the relevant litigation
decision as fiduciaries: see <em>Walter Woon</em> at
para 9.12.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_148"></a>148    Mr
Thio was unable to cite any authority in support of this proposition,
apart from a footnote in <em>Halsbury’s Laws of
Singapore</em> vol 6 (Butterworths Asia, 2006 Issue) at para
70.272, which in turn referred to the English Court of Appeal decision
in <em>Bamford v Bamford</em> [1969] 2 WLR 1107
(“<em>Bamford</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_149"></a>149    While <em>Bamford</em> does suggest (at 1115) that the
decision to commence legal proceedings against errant directors
could be made by the shareholders passing an ordinary resolution,
this proposition is stated too broadly and it is inconsistent with
the division of powers under s 157A (and Art 73 of TYC’s Articles).
I note that <em>Bamford</em> referred to <em>Foss v Harbottle</em> in coming to this conclusion.
As mentioned at [70]–[73] above, that case was decided on a basis
that does not hold currency today.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_150"></a>150    It
is also clear that Mr Thio’s submissions on this point were premised on
shareholders having wide powers of management if the board was unable
or unwilling to act. In my view, this submission was framed too broadly.
Any question concerning the general meeting’s power to commence
proceedings against a recalcitrant director should be approached
in accordance with the principles set out at [108] above.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The EGM’s power to authorise
HT to unilaterally sign cheques</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_151"></a>151    This
leaves me to address Mr Thio’s further submission that the EGM’s
reserve powers include the power to authorise HT to unilaterally sign
cheques on TYC’s behalf.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_152"></a>152    I
disagreed with Mr Thio’s submission for two reasons. First, such
a power would have been inconsistent with the Payment Clause which requires
both JC and HT to approve payments by TYC. TYC’s shareholders had
unanimously agreed to the Payment Clause, TYC is bound by it, and the
Payment Clause cannot be varied unless all TYC shareholders agree
(see [23]-[25] above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_153"></a>153    Second,
TYC’s main complaint in these proceedings was that JC had breached
either her fiduciary duties as a director of TYC, or an implied term
of the SSD, by refusing to sign cheques or payment vouchers on TYC’s behalf.
In my judgment, it may be reasonable to imply a reserve power which
allowed the EGM to commence OS 895 - OS 895 would enable the court
to determine the parties’ rights and obligations under the Divorce Settlement
Agreements or at general law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_154"></a>154    However,
the same could not be said about a reserve power which would, in
effect, allow the EGM to determine payment matters for itself, or worse,
to re-write the rights and obligations of the parties under the
SSD.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_155"></a>155    It
follows that the EGM could not authorise HT to unilaterally sign cheques
and make payments on TYC’s behalf.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Specific Performance</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_156"></a>156    I
turn, then, to Mr Thio’s alternative submission that the court should specifically
order JC to sign cheques or payment vouchers for TYC to make payment
of the KPMG Fees, the TSMP Fees and the Express Co Fees. He based
this submission on two grounds:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_156-p2_a"></a>(a)     First,
there is an implied term in the TYC Deed that HT and JC’s power
to approve any payment by TYC under the Payment Clause cannot be
exercised dishonestly, for an improper purpose, capriciously or
arbitrarily (“the Implied Term”). By refusing to approve payment
of these fees, JC had breached the Implied Term.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_156-p2_a_1"></a>(a)     I shall refer to this as the “Implied Term Argument”.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_156-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second,
by refusing to approve payment of these fees, JC has breached her
fiduciary duties as a director of TYC. The court is therefore able
to remedy such breach by way of an order for specific performance
pursuant to s 409A of the Companies Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_156-p2_b_2"></a>(b)     I shall refer to this as the “Fiduciary Duty Argument”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Implied Term Argument</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_157"></a>157    Mr
Thio submitted that the Implied Term formed part of the SSD (and
by extension, the TYC Deed) because the Implied Term satisfied the three-step
framework described by the Court of Appeal in <em>Sembcorp Marine
Ltd v PPL Holdings Pte Ltd and another and another appeal</em> [2013]
4 SLR 193 (“<em>Sembcorp Marine</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_158"></a>158    Under
this three-step framework, a term would be implied <em>in
fact</em> in an agreement if:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_158-p2_a"></a>(a)     there
is a gap in the contract which was not contemplated by the parties;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_158-p2_b"></a>(b)     it
is necessary to imply in a term, typically in the business or commercial
sense, to give the contract efficacy; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_158-p2_c"></a>(c)     the
specific term to be implied must be one which the parties, having
regard to the need for (typically) business efficacy, would have responded
“Oh, of course!” had they been asked at the time of the contract
whether the term should form part of the contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Application of the <em>Sembcorp Marine</em> framework</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(A)   The first step</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_159"></a>159    The
first step begins with the question of whether there was a gap in the
SSD.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_160"></a>160    To
me, this was straightforward: the party coming to court merely has to
tell the court what it perceives the gap to be, and why the gap
is a “true” gap, that is, the parties did not at all contemplate
the issue which is now sought to be addressed by way of an implied
term (see <em>Sembcorp Marine</em> at [94]–[96]).
Vinodh Coomaraswamy J’s approach in <em>Tan Chin
Yew Joseph </em><em>v </em><em>Saxo Capital Markets Pte Ltd</em> [2013] SGHC
274 at [51] demonstrates correctly how the first step ought to be
applied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_161"></a>161    Mr
Thio argued that the gap in the SSD is that neither the Payment Clause
nor any other term in the SSD provides what should happen if either HT
or JC paralysed TYC by withholding approval to the making of payments
by TYC. To fully appreciate this argument, it is necessary to explain
the background leading up to agreement on the Payment Clause.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_162"></a>162    After
the divorce but prior to the implementation of the payment system
under the Payment Clause, HT alleged that JC had unilaterally made unauthorised
payments out of TYC’s bank accounts. HT then commenced court proceedings
in 2011 to obtain an injunction to restrain JC from making unilateral
payment decisions (“OS 1080”). However, OS 1080 was discontinued
in June 2012 without HT obtaining the reliefs that he had sought.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_163"></a>163    Mr
Thio submitted that the discontinuation of OS 1080 and the Payment
Clause were connected – the Payment Clause was inserted in the SSD
to ensure that future payments made by TYC would not be improper, capricious
or arbitrary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_164"></a>164    I
accepted that there was such a connection between OS 1080 and the Payment
Clause. Clause 18 of the SSD expressly provided that the parties agreed
to discontinue OS 1080 despite HT not receiving any of the reliefs that
he had sought. Given that HT and JC remained the only two directors of
TYC even after their divorce, it must have occurred to them – or
in any event it was reasonable to infer – that their status post-divorce
may cause problems in their joint-management of TYC (especially
in relation to the control of TYC’s purse strings).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_165"></a>165    To
that end, the Payment Clause was an understandable check and balance
to the problem of unilateral payment decisions by either HT and JC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_166"></a>166    The
parties probably did not foresee that the Payment Clause could give
rise to a different problem. To some extent it was ironic, but not
totally unexpected. When the Payment Clause was conceived, HT and
JC were trying to solve a very narrow issue, that is, how to prevent
either of them from unilaterally causing TYC to <em>make</em> payments
without the consent of the other.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_167"></a>167    HT
and JC had not addressed their minds to the converse potentiality, that
is, whether there was a need by either party to prevent the other
from unilaterally causing TYC to <em>withhold</em> payments
despite the other having given approval. In other words, they had
not contemplated that the very power that they had given to themselves
to prevent improper, capricious and arbitrary payments by the other
might be turned on its head to cause, in Mr Thio’s words, improper,
capricious or arbitrary withholding of payment of legitimate expenses
incurred by TYC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_168"></a>168    Therefore,
I agreed with Mr Thio that there was a gap in the SSD and by extension,
the TYD Deed (because TYC’s rights and obligations flow from the
TYC Deed, not the SSD).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_169"></a>169    The
first of the <em>Sembcorp Marine</em> framework
was therefore satisfied. I turn then to the second step.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(B)   The second step</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_170"></a>170    The
purpose of the second step is again quite straightforward, that
is, to determine whether the transaction is efficacious despite
the gap.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_171"></a>171    If
the transaction is efficacious despite the gap, it would not be necessary
to imply in any term, and the argument for the implication of a term
comes to an end. The second step, understood in this sense, is not applied
to determine whether a gap exists. It is not the same as the business efficacy
test understood in the normal sense when applied as a self-standing test
(see [90] to [98] of <em>Sembcorp Marine</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_172"></a>172    English
law appears to have adopted a more relaxed standard. In <em>Marks and Spencer PLC v BNP Paribas Securities Services
Trust Company (Jersey) Limited &amp; Air</em> [2014] EWCA
Civ 603 at [28], the English Court of Appeal held that “a party
does not show that a term is unnecessary simply by showing that
the parties’ agreement could work without the implied term.” On
the face of this proposition, it would appear that a term is less likely
to be implied under Singapore law as compared to English law. The difference,
in my view, is perhaps more apparent than substantive.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_173"></a>173    One
way to justify this “conservatism” under Singapore law (<em>Sembcorp Marine</em> at [88]) is to think of
the court’s role as being limited to giving the “minimum of efficacy”
to the contract (<em>The Moorcock</em> (1889)
4 PD 64 at 69). The court’s role is not to ameliorate the parties’
bargain. As Lord Pearson said in <em>Trollope &amp;
Colls Ltd v North West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board</em> [1973]
1 WLR 601 at 609, the court will not <em>improve</em> a
contract which the parties have made, however desirable the improvement
may be (see <em>Sembcorp Marine</em> at [88]).
There is also no rule of contract law (either generally or specifically)
in relation to implied terms that if a term can be implied to prevent
loss to one party, that term is necessary for the efficacy of the
transaction and ought to be implied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_174"></a>174    The
power to imply terms into a contract should not be considered as routine.
It is so intrusive that Sir Thomas Bingham MR called it an “extraordinary
power” in <em>Philips Electronique Grand Public
SA and Another v British Sky Broadcasting Limited</em> [1995]
EMLR 472 at 481. This is why the threshold for implied terms in
fact is consistently expressed as being high (see <em>Sembcorp
Marine</em> at [100]; see also Lord Grabiner, “The Iterative Process
of Contractual Interpretation (2012) 128 LQR 41 at p 59).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_175"></a>175    Leaving
aside specific policy considerations that vary from case to case,
a principal reason for the restrained approach of the law towards
the implication of terms into a contract is that every term implied
is ultimately an exercise in guesswork by the court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_176"></a>176    The
danger with the introduction of guesswork – albeit informed and principled
– into a contract after the bargain has been concluded between the
parties was aptly summarised by Sundaresh Menon CJ (extra-judicially) in
“The Somewhat Uncommon Law of Commerce” (2014) 26 SAcLJ 23 at [18]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b><em>The obvious danger </em></b>
<em>with implication, being by its nature an exercise
in filling in what parties had not addressed their minds to</em>,<b><em>is that the court might too easily rewrite the contract
to its own preference</em></b><em>.</em> Lawyers
are not generally noted for an awareness of their own limitations;
and there is therefore an <b><em>inevitable temptation </em></b><em>to try to supplement or improve the contract, or
to recast it in accordance with the court’s sense of the justice
of the case, and in the process</em>,<b><em>lose
sight of the actual bargain </em></b><em>that
was struck between the parties. This is </em><b><em>especially
dangerous </em></b><em>because that bargain would
have been struck at a time when the parties would have been looking
ahead and pricing the inherent uncertainties that this must entail</em>. <b><em>It is impossible for a court to factor this in meaningfully
at the time it comes to examine the issue with the clarity of perfect
hindsight.</em></b> The uncertainty and unpredictability generated
by this mismatch is wont to constitute a grave disservice to people
of commerce if judges fail to keep such realities firmly in mind.

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_177"></a>177    People
looking on from the outside without being involved in the process
of negotiation and bargaining which led to final agreement are seldom
in a position to predict with any degree of accuracy what the parties were
truly thinking had a particular issue been put squarely to them.
It is one thing to say that objectively, this is what the parties
must have intended or assumed; it is another thing altogether to
say that the objective perspective reflected, in <em>truth</em>,
the parties’ positions at that time. It is therefore important that
the courts adopt a conservative approach in the implication of terms
into a contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_178"></a>178    Against
this canvass of conservatism, Mr Thio had to satisfy the court that
the gap caused by the Payment Clause was one which needed to be plugged
in order for the SSD to be efficacious. The question was whether “for
the sake of efficacy of [the SSD] something more needs to be added
to [the SSD]” (see <em>Sembcorp Marine</em> at
[91]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_179"></a>179    For
the reasons that follow, I was not persuaded that the gap caused by
the Payment Clause was one which needed to be plugged in order for
the SSD to be efficacious.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_180"></a>180    At
the outset, I accepted that the management of TYC was an integral aspect
of the SSD. Although the Divorce Settlement Agreements were a private
matter between HT and JC, the bulk of their combined and individual
wealth was represented by their respective founder shares in TYC
and the consequent control and voting rights conferred on these founder
shares (see [14] above). It was therefore inevitable that TYC had
to be part of, and party to, the Divorce Settlement Agreements.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_181"></a>181    With
the introduction of TYC (with its significant stake in THG, a listed
entity), the implementation of the Divorce Settlement Agreements was
never going to be simple or straightforward. Contractual rights
were conferred, and obligations imposed, on TYC. The settlement
also reflected the parties’ agreement on how TYC should be managed.
A wide spectrum of management issues were covered, including a TYC
dividend policy, TYC’s responsibility to pay a host of expenses
– medical fees and insurance for the family, as well as the costs,
taxes and outgoings of various properties. TYC’s liability for the
expenses of 40C Nassim Road was just one example.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_182"></a>182    In
addition, these new rights and obligations placed TYC in an unenviable
position because there was the theoretical possibility that TYC may
have to enforce those rights against either HT or JC; or conversely, TYC
may be sued by HT or JC if TYC defaulted on its obligations to either. Perhaps
this would not be an issue if TYC had directors on its board other than
HT and JC, but that was not the case. It was also not the case that
HT and JC were mere strangers who happened to be the only two directors
of TYC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_183"></a>183    Given
the extensive role that TYC was made to play in the divorce settlement,
the issue of how TYC would be managed post-divorce would undoubtedly
affect the efficacy of the execution and implementation of the Divorce
Settlement Agreements. Thus, whether and when TYC would meet its
payment obligations was undoubtedly an issue which went towards
the efficacy of the SSD.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_184"></a>184    That,
however, was not conclusive because even if the SSD had a gap that
undermined the workability of the SSD, it did not follow as a matter
of course that it was necessary, for the minimum of business efficacy,
that a term needs to be implied into the SSD. If there were other
means by which this gap could be ameliorated, the consequences of
the gap on the efficacy of the SSD would be similarly limited.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_185"></a>185    On
this critical issue, it was my view that the gap caused by the Payment
Clause was adequately ameliorated by the existing duties imposed as
a matter of law on HT and JC, namely, the duties imposed on directors pursuant
to s 157(1) of the Companies Act and at general law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_186"></a>186    Section
157(1) states that “[a] director shall at all times act honestly and
use reasonable diligence in the discharge of the duties of his office.” This
is a broad and wide-ranging duty which encompasses the following obligations:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_186-p2_a"></a>(a)     A
director shall “act <em>bona fide</em> to
promote or advance the interests of the company”: <em>Ho
Kang Peng v Scintronix Corp Ltd (formerly known as TTL Holdings
Ltd)</em> [2014] 3 SLR 329 (“<em>Scintronix</em>”)
at [35]. A corollary of this obligation is that the director must
be “genuinely acting to promote the company’s interest”; whether
or not this is objectively the case is a matter within the court’s purview
(<em>Scintronix</em> at [38]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_186-p2_b"></a>(b)     A
director shall not be <em>dishonest</em>,
even if he subjectively thought that being dishonest – by bribing
to win business contracts, to take the most extreme example – was
in the interest of the company. The Court of Appeal in <em>Scintronix</em> flatly rejected (at [40]) the
suggestion that a director who created a sham contract and made
unauthorised and irregular payments out of the company’s funds for
the purpose of securing business for the company can be said to
be acting genuinely in the interests of the company. The rationale,
the court explained, was that profit maximisation “by any means”
can never be in the interests of the company.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_186-p2_c"></a>(c)     A
director shall not exercise his office and the powers that the office
confers for an <em>improper purpose</em>.
Again, this rule applies even if the director had considered himself
as genuinely acting in the interests of the company: <em>Walter Woon</em> at paras 8.76 to 8.82.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_186-p2_d"></a>(d)     A
director shall not make a decision <em>capriciously</em> and <em>arbitrarily</em> as such manner of decision-making
can never be, by definition, one that was genuinely taken in the
interests of the company. At best, a decision made capriciously
or arbitrarily is one which pays no regard to the company’s interest;
at worst, it fully contradicts the duty of directors to exercise
reasonable diligence, which has been read into the scope of s 157(1)
of the Companies Act: <em>Walter Woon</em> at
para 8.118.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_187"></a>187    To
recapitulate, the Implied Term imposes a fetter on the power HT and
JC each enjoyed under the Payment Clause. Neither can exercise such power
dishonestly, for an improper purpose, capriciously or arbitrarily. Given
the broad obligations that come within the ambit of s 157(1) of
the Companies Act, including those fleshed out at [186] above, I
would think that if either HT or JC had exercised the power to withhold
approval of payments in a manner that was dishonest, capricious,
arbitrary or for an improper purpose, such exercise of power would
likely constitute a breach of director’s duties. The scope of the
Implied Term was, in my view, a subset of the existing obligations
that HT and JC <em>already owe to TYC</em> in their
capacity as directors of TYC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_188"></a>188    In
these circumstances, and bearing in mind the conservatism that overhangs
the entire process of implication of terms, I could not see how
it was necessary, for the efficacy of the SSD, that the Implied
Term was required. Any withholding of approval of payment by JC
for clearly legitimate TYC expenses was and can be controlled by
her duties owed to TYC as a director.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_189"></a>189    I
was assisted in my conclusion at [188] above by the arguments that were
made on the Nassim Road Expenses (although that claim has since been
settled (see [62] above)). Under cl 5(a) of Appendix B of the DOS, TYC
is liable to pay all “costs, taxes and outgoings” in connection
with 40C Nassim Road. The arguments between the parties concerned
the ambit of these words. Mr Thuraisingam argued that “renovation”
expenses were not covered by these words; Mr Thio argued that no
words of limitation should apply to cl 5(a), and all expenditure
on 40C Nassim Road is included.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_190"></a>190    In
response to Mr Thio’s argument, I had asked Mr Thio whether TYC
would be liable to pay if HT were to spend $10 million on extravagant renovations
– say, gold-plating the swimming pool. Mr Thio submitted this would
not happen as expenditure on the Nassim Road bungalows would be controlled
by HT’s fiduciary duties. The underlying principle in Mr Thio’s answer
accorded with my view, which is that the check against any abuse
is the fact that HT is a director of TYC. Just as a term need not
be implied in cl 5(a), I did not think that the Implied Term needed
to be implied in the Payment Clause.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_191"></a>191    It
could have been argued – though it was not – that the Implied Term governed
HT and JC’s contractual duty to each other (and TYC) in their personal
capacities, and that this was a duty that was wholly different from a
director’s duty which is owed to the company (and not to other shareholders
or directors). The difficulty, perhaps, was that TYC was the party
seeking to enforce the obligation under the Implied Term, not HT.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_192"></a>192    Be
that as it may, even if this submission had been made, it would
not have made a difference to my analysis – in my view, the Payment
Clause was a contractual promise by HT and JC to each other (and
subsequently, TYC) in their capacities as directors of TYC. Although
the SSD was entered into between HT and JC as a private settlement
pursuant to a divorce, this did not alter their status as directors
which, to me, is the only capacity that they could have contemplated
was their bargain in relation to the Payment Clause. And this is
because the Payment Clause deals solely with expenses of TYC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_193"></a>193    The
scope of the Implied Term was perhaps fashioned by reference to <em>Paragon Finance plc v Nash and another</em> [2002]
1 WLR 685 (“<em>Paragon Finance</em>”) which
Mr Thio cited. In that case, two mortgages over residential property
contained a provision which permitted the lender discretion to vary
the interest rate. The borrowers submitted that the lender’s discretion to
set rates ought to be fettered by an implied term that the rates
would not be set “dishonestly, for an improper purpose, capriciously
or arbitrarily”. This found currency with the English Court of Appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_194"></a>194    Dyson
LJ (as he then was) explained that the court accepted the implied
term because the court found the situation without the implied term
to be unpalatable. He noted (at [30]–[31]) that without the implied term,
the lender would be completely free, in theory at least, to specify
an interest rate at the most exorbitant level; raise the interest
rate because it found the borrower to be a nuisance (an improper
purpose); or raise the interest rate because its manager did not
like the colour of the borrower’s hair (a capricious reason). Notwithstanding,
the court concluded (at [47]) that there was no breach of the implied
term on the facts as the lender’s raising of the interest rate was
a commercial judgment and not for dishonest or capricious purposes
or otherwise arbitrary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_195"></a>195    
          <em>Paragon Finance</em> is materially different
from the present case in a number of aspects, first of which is
the parties’ relationship. Unlike the borrowers in <em>Paragon
Finance</em>, who had little bargaining leverage against the
lender, neither HT nor JC here entered into the SSD on an unequal footing.
Dyson LJ’s tone illuminates the main concern that the court had, namely,
the inequality of the parties’ relative positions should there be
no implied fetter on the lender’s discretion. This was sufficient
for the court to infer that at the time the borrowers and lender
entered into the mortgage, the expectation was that the lender’s
right to vary its interest rate was necessarily fettered to the
extent that it could not raise the interest rate dishonestly, for
an improper purpose, capriciously or arbitrarily.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_196"></a>196    The
second and more important difference is that there was no other control
against the lender, unlike the existence of overarching director’s duties
imposed at law in the present case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_197"></a>197    Mr
Thio also referred me to <em>Equitable Life Assurance
Society v Hyman</em> [2002] 1 AC 408 (“<em>Equitable
Life</em>”). The main issue in that case before the House
of Lords was whether the discretion conferred on directors by the articles
of association of a mutual life assurance society was restricted
by an implied term that the directors could not adopt a course of
action that had the effect of overriding or undermining the guaranteed
annuity rate (which was a critical feature of the policy). Article
65 of the society’s articles of association conferred on the directors
absolute discretion in declaring the amount of bonus to be paid
out to policyholders. The directors of the society had adopted a
policy of declaring a lower final bonus to policyholders of a certain
category. The society sought a declaration from the court that it
was entitled to adopt such a course.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_198"></a>198    Lord
Steyn, delivering the leading judgment of the court, held (at 459) that
the discretion conferred by Art 65 was restricted by an implied
term under which the directors were precluded from depriving the
guaranteed bonus to the policyholders. He explained that the provision
for guaranteed annuity rates was a selling point in the marketing
by the society of its policies, and was obviously a significant
attraction for purchasers of those policies. Thus, “the supposition
of the parties must be presumed to have been that the directors
would not exercise their discretion in conflict with the parties’
contractual rights.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_199"></a>199    Plainly,
the facts and holding in <em>Equitable Life</em> are
very different from the present case. Factually, the term sought
to be implied in <em>Equitable Life</em> was
nothing like that in the present case. The implied term there restricted the
director’s power under the articles of association to undermine
the fundamental purpose of the contract entered into between the policyholders
and the society. There was no such concern in the present case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_200"></a>200    Legally,
the decision in <em>Equitable Life</em> has
no bearing on the present case because all that was established
in that case was that the discretion of the directors of a society
to affect a policy, which discretion was conferred contractually
by the articles of association (and not a statutory or fiduciary duty
imposed by law), was subject to an implied term that the discretion
is not exercised in a manner that conflicts with the rights of the
policyholders. Existing director’s duties would have been insufficient
because the directors could be genuinely acting in the interests
of the society in exercising the power in the articles of association
in a way that defeats the purpose that the policyholders had in
mind when they contracted with the society.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_201"></a>201    To
his credit, Mr Thio did not overstate <em>Equitable
Life</em>. His strongest point in relation to that case was
a reference to Lord Cooke’s judgment that no legal discretion, however
widely worded, could be exercised for purposes contrary to those
of the instrument by which it is conferred. Again, that is simply
another way of saying that the scope of the discretion under the articles
of association must be read in the light of the purpose of the contract
between the society and policyholders. I found nothing wrong with that
statement of principle but I did not see how it was materially relevant to
the principal submission that the Implied Term ought to be recognised
as forming part of the SSD.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_202"></a>202    I
shall address a couple of other authorities that I found apposite.
The first is <em>Brogden v Investec Bank Plc</em> [2014]
EWHC 2785 (Comm) (“<em>Investec</em>”). In
that case, the plaintiffs were former employees of the defendant
bank. They were seeking damages from the defendant for breach of
contract in failing to pay them bonuses which they claimed were
a matter of right and not discretionary. The defendant’s main argument
was that the plaintiffs were simply not entitled to any bonus under
the contractual formula for calculating bonus entitlement. The plaintiffs
contended that the defendant bank had acted in bad faith or irrationally
in manipulating or adjusting the inputs into the formula that resulted
in the conclusion that no bonus was payable. This was a breach of
the defendant’s implied duty to exercise its discretion in good
faith, and not in an arbitrary, capricious or irrational manner.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_203"></a>203    Leggatt
J, after surveying the authorities dealing with clauses granting discretion
to one of the contracting parties to the contract, agreed that there was
such a general implied duty in principle (at [100]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Both on the authorities and as a matter
of principle, it seems to me that where a contract gives responsibility
to one party for making an assessment or exercising a judgement
on a matter which materially affects the other party’s interests
and about which there is ample scope for reasonable differences
of view, <em>the decision is properly regarded
as a discretion which is subject to the implied constraints that
it must be taken in good faith, for proper purposes and not in an
arbitrary, capricious or irrational manner</em>. … The concern,
as Rix LJ observed in <em>Socimer</em> at
para 66, is that the decision-maker’s power should not be abused.
The implication is justified as a matter of construction to give effect
to the presumed intention of the parties. … [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_204"></a>204    The
decision of Rix LJ referred to by Leggatt J is <em>Socimer
International Bank Ltd v Standard Bank London Ltd</em> [2008]
1 Lloyd’s Rep 558 (“<em>Socimer</em>”). That
case concerned the right of the defendant under a contract to either
liquidate or retain a portfolio of assets belonging to the plaintiff
upon a defaulting event. The value of the assets to be liquidated
or retained was to be determined by the defendant at the date of
termination of the contract. However, the defendant did not carry
out any valuation of the assets (which the defendant sold in dribs
and drabs). The plaintiff, through its liquidator, then brought
proceedings claiming that it was entitled to a larger sum than had
been credited by the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_205"></a>205    The
issue in <em>Socimer</em> (that was relevant
to the present case) was whether the defendant was under an implied
obligation to take reasonable care to ascertain the true market
value of the plaintiff’s assets, notwithstanding that the valuation
clause provided the defendant with the discretion to determine the
value of those assets. The court disagreed (at [116]) with the plaintiff’s
submission that the implied term was necessary to prevent abuse
caused by the defendant’s self-interest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_206"></a>206    In
the court’s view, there were other general implied controls guarding
against such abuse. Rix LJ, who delivered the leading judgment of the
English Court of Appeal, explained that clauses giving one party
a power to make decisions under the contract which may have an effect
on both parties are (at [66]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… limited, as a matter of necessary implication,
by concepts of honesty, good faith, and genuineness, and the need
for the absence of arbitrariness, capriciousness, perversity and
irrationality. The concern is that the discretion should not be
abused. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_207"></a>207    This
general limitation was considered by the court to be less extensive
than the implied term sought by the plaintiff (see [67] of <em>Socimer</em>) because whilst the implied duty
to take reasonable care to ascertain the true market value effectively
imposes on the defendant what the court considers to be a reasonable
market value, the general implied limitation does not take away
from the defendant its discretion to decide what, in its subjective view,
amounted to a reasonable valuation. The general implied limitation (see
the excerpt reproduced at [206] above) only required the defendant
to exercise its subjective judgment rationally and in good faith
(see [112] of <em>Socimer</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_208"></a>208    These
authorities seemed to suggest that a party which is given an exclusive
right under a contract to make a decision that may adversely affect another
party to the contract is under an obligation to exercise that discretion,
at minimum, in a manner that is not arbitrary, capricious, perverse
or irrational. In my judgment, I did not think that this proposition was
a principle that applies in all circumstances and in relation to
all contracts where such clauses are concerned. I say this for a
number of reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_209"></a>209    First,
these are situations concerning implication of terms in fact, not law.
Given that whether a term is implied in fact depends on the circumstances
of each case, there cannot be a general principle that applies to
all contracts conferring such discretions. To put it another way,
if a party has freely agreed to give another party an unfettered
discretion to make decisions that may adversely affect both parties
to the contract, the two parties ought to be permitted to contract
as such. I know of no general principle or policy that restricts
the parties’ freedom to enter into such agreements. In ascertaining
the parties’ presumed intentions, the court is precisely trying
to determine whether the parties could have agreed on such a course
of plan. This is why presumed intention has to be assessed on a case-by-case
basis and cannot be subject to an overarching general proposition.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_210"></a>210    Second,
in all of the authorities that I have been referred to or otherwise
came across, the relationship between the contracting parties were
different from that between HT, JC and TYC. The cases which have recognised
an implied term similar to the Implied Term concerned a society
and policyholders (<em>Equitable Life</em>),
an ordinary retail borrower and a commercial lender (<em>Paragon Finance</em>), employees and an employer
bank (<em>Investec</em>), and a commercial
borrower and a commercial lender (<em>Socimer</em>). None
of these were remotely close to the situation of a contract entered
into between owners of a company who were also its only directors
and in the midst of divorce proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_211"></a>211    Third,
given HT and JC’s position as entrenched directors of TYC (see [13]
above), the need for a general limitation, as was necessary in <em>Socimer</em> and <em>Investec</em>,
for example, was at least questionable if not entirely obviated
by the directors’ duties imposed on HT and JC by s 157(1) of the Companies
Act and more broadly at general law. Just as the court in <em>Socimer</em> held that the duty to take reasonable
care in obtaining a valuation was unnecessary because any abuse
of self-interest was taken care of by the generally implied limitation
inherent in clauses conferring discretion (see [207] above), it
would also be unnecessary to recognise the Implied Term in the SSD.
The duties imposed on HT and JC, as directors, have the same content
and prophylactic effect as the Implied Term.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_212"></a>212    Given
that there was a pre-existing set of obligations owed by HT and JC
to TYC that served the same purpose as the Implied Term, I concluded that
the SSD was not inefficacious despite the gap caused by the Payment Clause.
Consequently, it was not necessary for something additional to be implied
to the SSD.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_213"></a>213    TYC’s
case for the implication of terms therefore ended here.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(C)   The third step</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_214"></a>214    For
completeness, and on the assumption that I was wrong on the second
step, I shall give my views on the third step.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_215"></a>215    The
application of the third step of the framework posits the hypothetical
question: what would the parties’ response be if an officious bystander
had suggested that a <em>specific</em> term
should form part of the parties’ agreement? The court will only
imply the term suggested by the officious bystander if the court
is persuaded that the parties’ response to the officious bystander
would be “Oh, of course!”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_216"></a>216    There
are two ways I could be wrong with respect to the second step. Consequently,
there would be two different outcomes depending on how I was wrong.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_217"></a>217    First,
I could be wrong in that the existing directors’ duties did not mirror,
or at least capture the scope of, the Implied Term, such that a director’s
exercise of a power dishonestly, for an improper purpose, capriciously
or arbitrarily is of a different nature from, and not subsumed by,
the duties imposed by s 157(1) of the Companies Act or at general
law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_218"></a>218    If
I were wrong on this point, I would agree with Mr Thio that the Implied
Term ought to be implied as it would have passed muster under the third
step of the <em>Sembcorp Marine</em> framework.
HT and JC would have approved the Implied Term to supplement the
insufficiency left notwithstanding their existing directors’ duties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_219"></a>219    Second,
I could be wrong on a separate point in that although the director
duties mirrored, or at least captured the scope of the Implied Term, the
SSD was nonetheless inefficacious notwithstanding such existing directors’
duties. Here, I did not think that the third step would have been satisfied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_220"></a>220    If
the existing directors’ duties mirrored or captured the scope of
the Implied Term, but for some reason the Payment Clause was still
insufficient for the efficacy of the SSD, HT and JC would, I think,
have questioned the relevance of the Implied Term. They would not
have responded with “Oh, of course!” when asked if the Implied Term
formed part of the SSD. To put it another way, if the Implied Term
is in any event a subset of the directors’ duties incumbent on HT
and JC, and the existence of those same directors’ duties is considered
inadequate in remedying the gap, HT and JC would not have seen any
additional benefit that the Implied Term would provide.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Whether JC breached
the Implied Term by refusing to pay the KPMG Fees</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_221"></a>221    For
completeness, I shall explain why I did not think that JC had breached
the Implied Term in respect of her refusal to approve payment of KPMG
Fees. Here, I proceed on the basis that I was wrong, and that the Implied
Term should be implied in the Payment Clause.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_222"></a>222    No
submission was pressed on JC’s refusal to approve payment of the TSMP
Fees and the Express Co Fees, and rightly so, because it was manifestly
clear that her refusal to approve the two payments stemmed from
her honest belief that the EGM had not been validly convened and consequently,
TSMP was not properly appointed (see [50] above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_223"></a>223    The
courts have been slow in interfering with commercial decisions of directors
which have been made honestly even if they turn out, on hindsight,
to be financially detrimental (<em>Intraco Ltd
v Multi-Pak Singapore Pte Ltd</em> [1994] 3 SLR(R) 1064 at
[30]). Part of the reason for this wide margin of deference is that
“it is theoretically possible for a board of directors to make a
decision which is commercially ludicrous and yet act perfectly honestly”
(see <em>Walter Woon</em> at para 8.36).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_224"></a>224    As
Lord Greene MR said in <em>In re </em><em>Smith and Fawcett Ltd</em> [1942] Ch 304 at
306 (which was cited with approval by the Court of Appeal in <em>Scintronix</em> at [37]), directors “must exercise
their discretion <em>bona fide</em> in what
they consider – not what a court may consider – is in the interests
of the company”. What matters, therefore, is the directors’ intention,
not the consequences of the directors’ decision, however detrimental.
The consequences may, however, sometimes be a useful indicator of
intention.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_225"></a>225    JC’s
main complaint against KPMG was that they never contacted her in
the course of carrying out their work, even though the scope of
their work involved evaluating, followed by advising, HT and JC
on their respective individual income tax position. There were other
aspects relating to TYC’s corporate tax but that was not disputed
by JC. Mr Thio rejected this argument, submitting that JC’s refusal
to authorise payment of the KPMG Fees had no basis because she had
not even read the report or sought advice on whether the report
was accurate. He also referred to a term of the engagement which
provided that the KPMG Fees are not contingent “upon the results
of [their] engagement”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_226"></a>226    In
my view, the fact that there is such a term was, at best, neutral. Otherwise,
a director would be compelled to authorise payment under contracts
which contains such a term even if the director were genuinely of the
view that the counterparty had breached the contract in a way which made
it commercially sensible, from a business perspective, to withhold payment
or to secure a reduction in the amount payable. Or to set-off any counterclaim
for breach. It may also be commercially sensible for a company seeking
to cure a breach to withhold payment so that the cure would be more
forthcoming. Whether the contractual obligation to pay was absolute
under the law is irrelevant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_227"></a>227    JC
admitted in cross-examination that she had not read the report by KPMG.
Mr Thio submitted that JC could not have adopted an honest view that
KPMG had not discharged its obligations fully or properly because
she had not read the report. I disagreed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_228"></a>228    JC
knew – and it was not disputed by HT or Mr Thio – that KPMG did
not consult her. It was also undisputed that KPMG’s role included
an assessment of the parties’ individual income tax position. In
fact, as Mr Thuraisingam submitted, HT conceded during cross-examination
that it was not unreasonable for JC to take issue with the report
by KPMG because it affected her personal income tax.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_229"></a>229    In
fact, when JC initially refused to approve payment, a meeting was scheduled
with KPMG on 5 April 2013. It was at this meeting that JC tore up
the KMPG report, a fact that Mr Thio stressed during cross-examination and
in his submissions to highlight JC’s attitude towards the matter. Leaving
that aside, what JC had said in that meeting was helpful to understanding
the crux of her issue with KPMG. This was what she said during her
cross-examination:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I said [to the KPMG team leader]: “Mun
Chuan, you can’t be doing my income tax.” I then qualified with
him: “How could you have done it?” He says: “I was given the DOS
and all those report.” I said: “Surely, you then should have asked
me am I staying in 15 Nassim Road because you are indicating just
because it’s in DOS that I’m staying there. … I’m staying in Reflection
[the name of a condominium] and everywhere else has got nothing
to do with the DOS. I was physically not staying there. I have got
to be honest and truthful and therefore I cannot accept it without
you coming to discuss with me and I have been trying to [tell] Grace
Wong telling her at all times I want to see the KPMG people. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_230"></a>230    Her
point was simple, and in my view, fair. KPMG had premised its assessment
of JC’s income tax on the assumption, having regard to the DOS,
that JC was staying in a condominium unit at 15 Nassim Road. JC
felt that KPMG should not have made that assumption without clarifying
with her because she was not staying at 15 Nassim Road, but somewhere
else (or so she claimed). JC’s point was that if KPMG had consulted
her and sought the necessary information, they would have discovered
the discrepancy, and their assessment would have been different.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_231"></a>231    I
note, at this juncture, that this issue of the impact of the Divorce Settlement
Agreements on JC’s income tax was not entirely trivial. On this part
of KPMG’s assessment, JC’s occupation of the condominium unit at
15 Nassim Road was likely to be treated as a taxable employment
benefit. Both sides appeared to have accepted that the value of
this taxable employment benefit is in the region of $200,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_232"></a>232    It
must be remembered that KPMG were contracted to perform services
which were in their nature qualitative. It was not as if KPMG were only
engaged to undertake a simple mathematical exercise which involved inputs
that were free of any judgment or analytical assessment. KPMG had to
make judgment calls which may vary depending on the parameters that they
used. JC’s point was that KPMG ought to have checked with her on
the accuracy of the parameters before they rendered their opinion
on the effect of the Divorce Settlement Agreements on her personal
income tax. The force of her contention, framed this way, was difficult
to ignore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_233"></a>233    I
would make a final observation. The dispute over payment here did not
relate to a supply of basic consumables, but to the provision of professional
services. A dispute over the quality of professional services rendered
generally involves a greater measure of subjective judgment; and the
client receiving such services should be given some latitude if
it genuinely believes that there was a deficiency in the quality
of services for which payment should be withheld.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_234"></a>234    In
these circumstances, I did not think that JC’s stance was one which “no
director could honestly believe to be taken in the interests of
the company” (see <em>Cheam Tat Pang and another
v Public Prosecutor</em> [1996] 1 SLR(R) 161 at [80]). I considered
this margin of deference that should be afforded to directors. I
also considered the fact that she had reached out to KPMG to lodge
her dissatisfaction (see [229] above). While I thought that JC was
perhaps not the easiest of clients (<em>qua</em> director
of TYC) to deal with, I found that she did approach the issue of
payment of the KPMG Fees with an honest, <em>bona
fide</em> belief that KPMG ought not to be paid (then or perhaps
at all) because it had not discharged fully or properly its obligations under
the terms of the engagement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Fiduciary Duty Argument</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_235"></a>235    The
Fiduciary Duty Argument was based on JC’s refusal to authorise payment
of the KPMG Fees. This is said to be concurrently a breach of JC’s fiduciary
duties which she owed as a director of TYC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_236"></a>236    For
the same reasons that I gave at [223] to [234], I did not accept
that JC had breached her fiduciary duties.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_237"></a>237    Although
I held that TSMP was validly appointed by the resolutions passed
at the EGM, and that TYC is therefore liable to pay TSMP and Express
Co for the services respectively rendered, I was not in a position
to make a determination on whether the TSMP Fees and the Express
Co Fees, in terms of quantum, were reasonable and ought to be paid
by TYC. These were matters for TYC and its directors to decide,
and not the court, at least not in these present proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_238"></a>238    In
sum, save for Consent Order No 1 and Consent Order No 2 which remained
valid and binding on the parties, and prayers relating to costs
and liberty to apply, I dismissed OS 895 in its entirety.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Costs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_239"></a>239    Mr
Thuraisingam submitted that JC was prepared to pay costs of $20,000
in relation to the two Consent Orders that were made only after proceedings
had commenced. He however sought costs of $50,000 for the dismissal
of OS 895. Mr Thio sought costs of approximately $112,000 (factoring
in reasonable disbursements) on a global basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_240"></a>240    Although
I dismissed most of the prayers sought by TYC, I recognised that
the majority of the claims by TYC had been settled by way of the
two Consent Orders that were entered into only after proceedings
had commenced, and only after quite a few hearings. Therefore, it
seemed fair that TYC should get some of its costs from JC. For that
reason, on a global basis and after factoring in the costs that
Mr Thuraisingam claimed should be awarded to JC for the dismissal
of OS 895, I awarded TYC $20,000 in costs payable by JC. I ordered
HT to bear his own costs.</p>
