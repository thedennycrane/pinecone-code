In particular on 15 August 2017 she informed the Respondent that ST’s insurance policy was in favour of himself (and thus the pay-out would come to the Estate). The Complainant did this because she was under the misapprehension that the Respondent was aligned to the interests of the Estate. In fact, at least from 8 August 2017, the Respondent was acting for JYGL … On 13 October 2017, the Respondent, still without disclosing that he was acting for JYGL, sought actively to dissuade the Complainant from fighting JYGL’s claims against the Estate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The DT made a further two critical findings of fact. First, in relation to the credibility of witnesses, the DT found that the Complainant’s testimony was “consistent and credible” (at [67]). By contrast, the Respondent’s evidence was “often strained, at odds with the context of events as they unfolded and on the question of whether he made the disclosures, made up” (at [67]).

</div> In addition, the DT accepted JYGL’s evidence that she had learned about the “confidential information”, which was the subject of the First and Alternative First Charges, from ST during ST’s lifetime. The DT considered JYGL’s evidence to be “consistent and credible” (at [85]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 The DT also found, categorically, that “the Respondent had made no disclosure that he was acting or intending to act for JYGL” (at [85]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Parties’ Arguments</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 For its part, the LSS affirmed and adopted the reasoning of the DT. By contrast, the Respondent argued that none of the charges he faced was made out. In relation to the First and Alternative First Charges, the Respondent largely repeated his argument before the DT, that no breach of r 21(2) of the PCR arose on the facts because the information that the Respondent possessed was “not ‘<span class="font-italic">confidential information</span>’ vis-à-vis the current client (JYGL) since JYGL already possessed that same information” (emphasis in original).

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> The <span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">only</span> ground upon which the Respondent sought to contest the First Charge pertained to (b) and the question of what “confidential information” for the purpose of r 21(2) of the PCR entailed. This continued to be the Respondent’s sole defence, even before us. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 At [23] of the Respondent’s written submissions, the crux of his sole defence to the First Charge was as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… As JYGL had acquired knowledge of the [Confidential Information] from ST during his lifetime, this information was not confidential to the Estate vis-à-vis JYGL, who was the Respondent’s client in this matter. JYGL was entitled to rely on and use this information in any dispute she may have against ST or his Estate. In the circumstances, the Respondent submits that there is no breach of Rule 21(2) of the PCR as the [Confidential Information] is not confidential vis-à-vis his client, JYGL, who is the “current client” referred to in Rule 21(2). Accordingly, there was no requirement for him to decline to represent or withdraw from representing JYGL in her dispute with the Estate relating to the Alphard motor-car and her loans to ST. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">We were unpersuaded. There were three reasons for this conclusion.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 First, the plain wording of rr 6 and 21(2) of the PCR militated against the Respondent’s reasoning. Rule 21(2) of the PCR refers to the legal practitioner or law practice “hold[ing]” confidential information relating to a former client that is protected by r 6 of the PCR. There was no reference to what the current/new client knows – the emphasis was simply on the legal practitioner or law practice’s <span class="font-italic">possession</span> of the information. This was mirrored in r 6 of the PCR. Rule 6 refers to information which is “confidential to [the practitioner’s] client”. Again, nothing is said about what the current/new client might be aware of, and there was nothing to suggest that the current/new client’s knowledge is in any way relevant. The very framing of r 6, referring to information “confidential to [the practitioner’s] client”, as opposed to information “confidential <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> a certain party or parties”, suggested that the focus of the statute lies on the former client and the confidential quality of the information itself – <span class="font-italic">not</span> the current/new client. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Reading rr 6 and 21(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the PCR together, all that was required was for the information to be confidential to the former client, and for such information to be held by the legal practitioner or law practice. Rules 6 and 21(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the PCR served as a filter in the sense that where the information in question was <span class="font-italic">not</span> confidential to the client, in that it was known to the world at large and had therefore lost its quality of confidentiality, such information would not fall within r 21(2) of the PCR. As Prof Jeffrey Pinsler <span class="font-italic">SC</span> pointed out in <span class="font-italic">Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules 2015: A Commentary</span> (Academy Publishing, 2016) at [21.004],  “Confidential information is information which is <span class="font-italic">confidential to the client</span> and is acquired by the legal practitioner … in the course of the legal practitioner’s engagement” (emphasis added). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 <span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">Nothing</span> is said in rr 6 and 21(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the PCR about the state of the <span class="font-italic">current/new </span>client’s knowledge. For the Respondent’s approach to the First and Alternative First Charges to be at all tenable, a carve-out pertaining to the state of the current/new client’s knowledge would have to be <span class="font-italic">read into</span> the statute. However, there was no basis to foist such a carve-out on the statute. This was partly because the requirements in r 21 of the PCR which are relevant to the current/new client are specifically set out in rr 21(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and (<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the PCR in relation to whether the current/new client’s interests are adverse to those of the former client, and whether the information in question is material to the representation of the current/new client. Again, it is telling that <span class="font-italic">none</span> of rr 21(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and (<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the PCR ascribes any relevance to the current/new client in determining whether the information in question is confidential for the purposes of r 21(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The second reason as to why the Respondent’s argument should not be accepted arises from the purpose of r 21 of the PCR. The Respondent asserted, at [24] of his written submissions, that “[t]he mischief that Rule 21(2) of the PCR seeks to address is to protect the lawyer’s (“L”) ‘former client’ from being prejudiced by L acting for the ‘current client’ against the ‘former client’ and using [confidential information gained by L from the ‘former client’] against the ‘former client’”. This was then said to tie into the Respondent’s argument that the “current client” already knowing the confidential information in question would obviate the need for r 21(2) of the PCR to operate. This was, with respect, an overly narrow construction of the purpose behind r 21. As was made clear by Andrew Phang Boon Leong JA (as he then was) in <span class="font-italic">Law Society of Singapore v </span><span class="font-italic">Seah Li Ming Edwin</span> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 401 (“<span class="font-italic">Edwin </span><span class="font-italic">Seah</span>”) at [24] in relation to r 31 of the former PCR:

It was therefore incorrect for the Respondent to suggest that r 21(2) of the PCR operated <span class="font-italic">solely</span> to address the mischief the Respondent describes. There was no justification for a narrow construction of r 21.

The Minister stated that the amendments introduced in the bill “seek to <span class="font-italic">maintain </span>high professional standards in the legal industry” (emphasis added).

</div></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… To sum up, Sir, these amendments are the result of periodic reviews of the Act. <span class="font-weight-bold">Their main thrust is to further safeguard the public interest</span> <span class="font-weight-bold">and raise the quality of the legal services and the standard of professional conduct of our solicitors</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[…]</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Emphasis added in bold]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">It was clear from the Parliamentary records that a strong thread of <span class="font-italic">public</span> interest and protection of former clients through high professional standards ran throughout both the former and present PCR. By contrast, the Respondent’s submission that the current/new client’s awareness of the former client’s information obviates the need for r 21(2)’s protection was without <span class="font-italic">any</span> support whatsoever in the Parliamentary Debates. It also ignored the need to visibly “maintain high professional standards” and safeguard the “public interest”, while artificially narrowing the mischief which r 21(2) of the PCR addresses. There was no basis for such an interpretation of r 21 of the PCR. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Third, and perhaps even more significantly, insofar as the PCR was meant to provide guidance to lawyers considering whether or not to accept an engagement against a former client, and to shed light on what <span class="font-italic">prospective</span> course of action to take, the Respondent’s approach would be at odds with those objectives. On the Respondent’s approach, a solicitor would be entitled to make his own <span class="font-italic">assumptions</span> or <span class="font-italic">enquiries</span> as to whether a prospective client may already be aware of information which would otherwise be “confidential information” within the meaning of r 21(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the PCR. This was highly problematic, because in many situations, the mere fact of the solicitor making enquiries as to the prospective client’s state of knowledge might already entail some disclosure of elements or aspects of the confidential information in the first place. The Respondent’s approach thus <span class="font-italic">necessarily</span> assumed symmetry of information – the solicitor had to <span class="font-italic">somehow</span> know, with some degree of certainty, that what the prospective client <span class="font-italic">already kn</span><span class="font-italic">ew</span> matched precisely with the otherwise confidential information, such that he could act for the prospective client. This was, with respect, an absurdity. If the Respondent were correct and the state of the current/new client’s knowledge were relevant in determining whether or not information was “confidential information” for the purposes of r 21(2) of the PCR, that would place a solicitor in the invidious position of having to somehow discern the state of the prospective client’s knowledge <span class="font-italic">without</span> disclosing what he already knew. The obvious difficulty of this, along with the two arguments raised from [45] to [49] above, militated towards a finding that the knowledge of the current/new client was irrelevant to whether or not the information was “confidential information” within the meaning of r 21(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the PCR or at all. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 We add that if ST were alive and if his relationship with JYGL had soured, ST would have been entitled to object to the Respondent acting for JYGL in a claim against ST. It would be no defence for the Respondent to say that JYGL already had the same information that had been disclosed by ST to the Respondent. Underlying r 21(2) of the PCR and also the acquisition of confidential information was the basic principle of conflict of interest. The trust and confidence which ST had reposed in the Respondent was not to be undermined. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 For the reasons above, the Respondent’s defence in relation to the First and Alternative First Charges was rejected. To the extent that the Respondent knew or had sound basis to believe that JYGL already knew about the confidential information, this might be relevant to the question of sanction.   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Second Charge</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 In comparison to the First and Alternative First Charges, the Second Charge was markedly more fact-centric. It entailed consideration of whether (a) the Respondent had failed to make a timely disclosure to the Complainant of the fact that he was acting/intended to act for JYGL, and (b) whether the Complainant was thereby misled into disclosing information which was confidential to the Estate to the Respondent. The Respondent’s account of what had transpired was that he had, through the First Disclosure of 24 July 2017, and the Second Disclosure of 23 August 2017, disclosed the fact that he was acting for JYGL to the Complainant. He also asserted that the Complainant had never provided him with any information confidential to the Estate. By contrast, the Complainant’s account was that the First and Second Disclosures had not occurred, and that she had, on 15 and 28 August 2017, conveyed information confidential to the Estate to the Respondent.

Even setting aside Shyller Tan’s claim that the Respondent had answered “yah yah sure Shyller” when she had asked him orally on 15 August 2017 to act for him, there was a clear representation from the Respondent on 19 August 2017, “Dfntly can” in relation to her follow-up on WhatsApp that day (see [16] above). The absolute and unqualified nature of the Respondent’s reply here was remarkable. Given that the Respondent had specifically already agreed to act for JYGL in her claims against the Estate, his representation that he <span class="font-italic">definitely could</span> help Shyller Tan with the Estate was egregious. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 As against the reasons undermining the alleged First Disclosure set out above, the Respondent made a number of arguments in support of his position. First, the Respondent highlighted how the Complainant’s account (which was corroborated by ACBP) of there having been one meeting on 24 July 2017 including JEKY and LLSH at the LegalStandard office was contradicted by JEKY and LLSH, who claimed that they did not attend the meeting at LegalStandard’s office, but only the subsequent meeting at the ground floor of 1 Raffles Place.

</div> None of these arguments was at all convincing, and there was no basis to disturb the DT’s findings in this regard:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the precise location of exactly <span class="font-italic">where</span> the First Disclosure had allegedly been made – whether at LegalStandard’s office, or downstairs from LegalStandard’s office – was of only tangential relevance. Even assuming that the Complainant had erred in identifying the location of the meeting, that did not necessarily impugn her account of whether the First Disclosure had in fact been made. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, as we have explained, the Respondent had not mentioned that the First Disclosure had been made by him in his letter of 12 July 2019. Even later, when asked about what was discussed at the meetings, he did not raise the First or Second Disclosures. The Respondent sought to argue, in his written submissions, that he had “referenced Paragraph 10 of his initial response [of 12 July 2019]”, and that his answers in his letter of 25 October 2019 were merely “supplementary”.

</div> This attempt to explain away his omission was, with respect, disingenuous. As was evident, there was <span class="font-italic">nothing</span> which suggested that the material in the 25 October 2019 letter merely supplemented what had been stated in the letter of 12 July 2019. The 25 October 2019 letter had been precipitated by the LSS’ email of 10 October 2019. That email had asked, <span class="font-italic">directly</span>, what was discussed at the meetings in question. The Respondent’s answer in his 25 October 2019 went over and repeated several details <span class="font-italic">already covered</span> in his letter of 12 July 2019, and any suggestion that the later letter was merely supplementary was untenable. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, and quite simply, the Respondent’s explanation for why he did not record the First Disclosure in his attendance note of 24 July 2017 was contrived. The only explanation provided was that making such a record was not his “style”, though the Respondent was forced to concede that the disclosure was in fact an important thing to record down:

</div> The limitations with the evidence were exacerbated by the fact that a substantial portion of the Respondent’s Written Submissions dealt with the date of the alleged Second Disclosure, and in particular showing that there must have been a meeting on 23 August 2017, where the Second Disclosure was allegedly made. Ultimately, however, the existence of a meeting on 23 August 2017 was not decisive – what mattered was whether <span class="font-italic">disclosure</span> had been made then.

The individuals referred to in the note were “Tenant Stanley” (the tenant of the Wala Property), “Jason” (JEKY), “Lawrence” (LLSH), and “Shyller”. The Respondent sought to rely on the reference to “cldnt as Joan asked me” as being evidence of his having disclosed that he had agreed to act for Joan. This connection was somewhat tenuous – it was not at all clear what the Respondent could not do, nor was it apparent what Joan had asked him for. Similarly, the reference to “Estate?” did not shed any light on the precise context. The Respondent’s claim that he had disclosed that he would act for JYGL also did not sit easily with the rest of the attendance note, that “if settle with her – ok?”. It was not clear what was to be settled, nor is the reference to permission (“ok?”) readily comprehensible in the context the Respondent purports. There was thus sound basis for the DT to find that the attendance note dated 24 August 2017, which even on the Respondent’s own case was erroneous as to the date, was at best equivocal and unclear. It did not evidence the alleged Second Disclosure. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 The Respondent attempted, at [121] of his written submissions, to persuade the Court that the Complainant’s evidence was unreliable as she had allegedly said that there had been “no meeting” between her and the Respondent on 23 August 2017.

The Respondent’s attempt to read the words at the tail-end of the extract as indicating that Shyller Tan denied the existence of a meeting on 23 August 2017 altogether was unconvincing. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 We turn to the evidence militating against both the First and Second Disclosures. First, the WhatsApp messages exchanged between ACBP and the Respondent on 24 August 2017 (see above at [18]), where ACBP indicated that he “may have some work” for the Respondent, were at odds with the notion that the Respondent had already disclosed that he was acting for JYGL.

</div> If the Respondent <span class="font-italic">had</span> in fact disclosed that he was acting for JYGL to Shyller Tan at their 23 August 2017 meeting, and assuming that Shyller had not informed ACBP of it, the Respondent would have informed ACBP of his acting for JYGL in their call on 24 August 2017. Likewise, if the First Disclosure had been made, the Respondent would have reminded ACBP of it. Yet, the WhatsApp exchange between ACBP and the Respondent on 24 August 2017 revealed no such disclosure. Significantly, it would have been very odd for ACBP to be seeking to give the Respondent work – particularly work on a matter potentially adverse to JYGL’s interests – if he knew that the Respondent was in fact acting for JYGL. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Second, the letter sent by ACBP’s firm, MKP, to the Respondent’s firm (see [19] above) was also telling. The salient portions of the letter were as follows:

</div>
</div> Second, and significantly, the “information and documents relevant to the assets of the deceased” the Complainant wanted the Respondent to look into would no doubt have included assets held by JYGL, and it was unthinkable that the Complainant would instruct the Respondent, if she knew he was acting for JYGL, to look into matters that were pertinent to the <span class="font-italic">very dispute she was engaged in with JYGL</span>. Put another way, ACBP would have in effect been asking the Respondent to place himself in a position of conflict (<span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis JYGL</span>) had he (ACBP) asked the Respondent to look into “information and documents relevant to the assets of the deceased” while aware that the Respondent was acting for JYGL. This letter, the veracity of which the Respondent does not challenge, was simply incongruous with the alleged Second Disclosure – and was in fact at tension with there having been <span class="font-italic">any</span> alleged disclosure at all. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Third, the messages sent by the Complainant to ACBP on 14 October 2017 (see above at [20(b)]) following her meeting with the Respondent on 13 October 2017 were significant. In particular, the Complainant’s messages showed that she did not appear to have had any indication from the Respondent, even by the meeting on 13 October 2017, that the Respondent was acting for JYGL. The Complainant’s near-contemporaneous record of the meeting on 13 October 2017 recorded the Respondent telling the Complainant that she might wish to reconsider legal proceedings against JYGL as JYGL was rich and could afford fees. The Complainant indicated that she was surprised by what the Respondent was saying at the meeting on 13 October 2017, and her surprise was evidenced by her recounting what had been discussed at that meeting to ACBP the next day, on 14 October 2017. Had the Complainant <span class="font-italic">already</span> been informed by the Respondent that he was acting for JYGL, there would have been no reason for such surprise, nor would there have been any need for the Complainant to specifically outline what had transpired at the 13 October 2017 meeting to ACBP.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Fourth, the Respondent’s own account was that he was behaving as a “friendly intermediary” – but this position was at odds with his having told the Complainant that he would be, in effect, acting against her (in her capacity as co-administratrix of the Estate) for JYGL. We have referred to the interaction between the Respondent on the one hand, and the Complainant and/or ACBP on the other hand, up to 13 October 2017. Thereafter, such interaction ceased abruptly. On 3 November 2017, ACBP’s firm sent a letter of demand to JYGL. A marked change in the interaction between the Respondent and Complainant arose following the Respondent’s holding letter of 24 November 2017, which was when the Respondent first revealed, categorically, that he was acting for JYGL. It was telling that after that date, there was no evidence <span class="font-italic">whatsoever</span> of messages seeking his assistance or appointing him to act for the Estate. Insofar as the Respondent referred to an email dated 2 January 2018 from the Complainant to suggest that the Complainant was still communicating with his firm, this appeared to be a perfunctory message from the Complainant addressed to a conveyancer (and only copying the Respondent) at the Respondent’s firm. It was different from the previous kind of enquiry seeking the Respondent’s assistance for information about the Estate’s assets. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Fifth, and significantly, there would have been no justification for ACBP’s firm to send the letter of demand dated 3 November 2017 <span class="font-italic">directly</span> to JYGL if the Respondent had disclosed that he was acting for JYGL.

</div> As was ACBP’s unchallenged evidence, he would have written to the Respondent directly had he known that the Respondent was acting for JYGL. Two points in particular bore note – (a) ACBP writing to an individual he <span class="font-italic">knew</span> was represented by a lawyer directly would have potentially placed ACBP in breach of r 7(3) of the PCR; and (b) the Respondent’s attempt to suggest that <span class="font-italic">he</span> had been the one to suggest to ACBP that ACBP write to JYGL directly was unbelievable.

</div> The Respondent made no reference <span class="font-italic">whatsoever</span> in his AEIC to allegedly having suggested that ACBP write to JYGL directly. Had the Respondent given ACBP some indication that he (the Respondent) was acting for JYGL, there would have been no reason for ACBP to write to JYGL directly instead of the Respondent. The obvious inference that followed (particularly since the Respondent’s case was <span class="font-italic">not</span> that ACBP had erred or misdirected his letter) is that the Respondent had failed to disclose that he was acting for JYGL. This conclusion is buttressed further by the WhatsApp messages exchanged between ACBP and the Respondent set out above at [21], where ACBP clearly indicated that he would be sending a legal letter to JYGL (and not to the Respondent), but the Respondent <span class="font-italic">still</span> gave no indication that <span class="font-italic">he</span> was already acting for JYGL.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Furthermore, the Respondent provided strikingly inconsistent accounts of the First and Second Disclosures.

There is hence no basis for the Complainant to now state that she was surprised that the firm was representing JY[GL] in respect of her claims against the Estate.

The Complainant attended this meeting with him. Mr Andy Chiok sought confirmation that Spencer had not made a will. I informed him that to my knowledge, he did not. He also asked if I was aware whether [JYGL] was in possession of any watches or other assets belonging to Spencer. I conveyed to both of them that I had no knowledge of any but that JY[GL] had informed me that Spencer had borrowed substantial sums from her and she wished to recover those monies. Further, I relayed to them that according to JY, the Alphard car she was driving, although in Spencer’s name, had been paid for by her. As I recall, Andy Chiok enquired if I could arrange a meeting between JY[GL] and them. I believe that they wished to meet with JY[GL] so as to learn of whether she knew of Spencer’s assets and also other personal matters.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">Given the detail with which the Respondent set out the events at the meeting of 24 July 2017, his complete omission to make even the <span class="font-italic">slightest</span> reference to the First or Second Disclosures was, at the very least, <span class="font-italic">puzzling</span>. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) On 12 June 2020, the Respondent filed his Defence, which referred to the First Disclosure, as well as to the Second Disclosure.

</div> the remaining element of the Second Charge was that the Complainant had been misled into disclosing information confidential to the Estate to the Respondent as a result of the Respondent’s non-disclosure. The Respondent’s defence in this regard centred on a claim that the Complainant had not in fact disclosed <span class="font-italic">any</span> information confidential to the Estate to him. By contrast, the Complainant averred that she had, on instances such as 15 and 28 August 2017, conveyed, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the Joey Confidential Information to the Respondent.

</div>
</div> In this regard, the question of whether the Joey Confidential Information was conveyed to the Respondent turned in large part on an assessment of the Complainant and Respondent’s relative credibilities. Given that the DT was amply justified in finding that the Respondent had, in effect, made up his claims as to the First and Second Disclosures, his credibility as to whether the Complainant had disclosed the Joey Confidential Information was, at the very least, diminished. The Respondent claimed that there was no evidence that (i) the Complainant had received the Joey Confidential Information from Joey, (ii) the Complainant had conveyed the Joey Confidential Information to the Respondent, and (iii) the assets referred to in the Joey Confidential Information existed at all. However, the following points bore particular note:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, it was never put to the Complainant that she had not received the Joey Confidential Information from Joey at their meetings on 15 and 28 August 2017. It was also not contested that the Respondent did in fact meet the Complainant on 15 and 28 August 2017. Therefore, it was not open to the Respondent to argue that Joey was not called as a witness before the DT insofar as that point had not been raised below.  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, it was logical to expect that the Complainant would tell the Respondent about the Joey Confidential Information. This would be in line with the Complainant’s objectives at the time, namely the identification and ascertainment of ST’s assets belonging to the Estate. Given that the Complainant had sought the Respondent’s help in identifying those assets, and that the Respondent himself acknowledged that the Complainant had sought such help, it would have followed that the Complainant would have told the Respondent about information she received in relation to those assets.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 With respect, none of these arguments was persuasive: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the fact that the WhatsApp exchanges between the Complainant and Respondent did not specifically refer to the assets referenced in the Joey Confidential Information was neither here nor there. After all, the Complainant did not appear to have had much success in tracking down ST’s wine collection, artwork, watch collection, and purchased jewellery. It would be unsurprising that, in the absence of any updates in relation to those assets, there was little exchanged about them over WhatsApp. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, the Respondent’s attempt to rely on the Complainant’s email to the LSS dated 29 October 2019 was again unpersuasive. While the Complainant’s email did not specifically name and enumerate assets such as the “wine collection”, “watch collection”, or “jewellery”, the Complainant did refer to ST’s “assets” generally. Her answer in this regard was instructive:

Even the Respondent’s Counsel accepted that this was a reason for why items might be omitted from the Schedules of Assets (“And I presume that’s because [the asset] was never found.”)

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Tying the above points together, the Respondent’s argument in relation to the conveyance of the Joey Confidential Information centred primarily on pointing out that the Complainant had, in various documents and correspondence, not precisely and specifically outlined the assets referred to. This could not be said to be decisive. Broad references to the “assets” ST had accumulated did not preclude the specific items making up those assets. By contrast, the Complainant’s account to the DT clearly outlined her conveying the Joey Confidential Information to the Respondent. This cohered with her objectives at the time and was consistent even with the Respondent’s own case. The DT thus did not err in finding that the Joey Confidential Information – and in particular information pertaining to ST’s insurance policy (see above at [53(a)(vi)]) – had been conveyed by the Complainant to the Respondent as a result of her having been misled by his failure to disclose his retainer for JYGL. There was no basis to disturb the DT’s findings in this regard. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 Before we move away from the issue of whether the charges are made out, it may be appropriate to provide clarification on two matters:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the parties joined issue over the question of the burden of proof in this case, particularly in relation to the First and Second Disclosures. The DT also made a number of observations on the burden of proof at [69] of the Report. It may thus be useful to restate the law on this point at this juncture: As the LSS rightly acknowledged, it bears the burden of proof to prove the elements of the charges beyond a reasonable doubt (<span class="font-italic">Law Society of Singapore v Ahmad </span><span class="font-italic">Khalis bin Abdul Ghani</span> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 308 at [6]). This refers to what has been described as the “legal burden”, which remains on the LSS throughout. However, where the LSS has discharged a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case that the Respondent had failed to make any disclosures to the Complainant, the “evidential burden” then shifts onto the Respondent to show otherwise. Where the Respondent makes specific claims that he had carried out the First Disclosure and the Second Disclosure, it is <span class="font-italic">he</span> who bears the evidential burden of showing that those instances of disclosure did in fact take place. After all, to hold otherwise would risk requiring the LSS to prove a negative. This approach is entirely in line with existing authority distinguishing between legal and evidential burdens: see <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v GCK and another matter</span> [2020] 1 SLR 486 at [132], and <span class="font-italic">Beh</span><span class="font-italic"> Chew Boo v Public Prosecutor</span> [2020] 2 SLR 1375 at [63]. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, the Respondent sought to mount an attack on the <span class="font-italic">entirety </span>of the case of the LSS by relying on the fact that the Complainant had not raised any issue about his alleged conflict all throughout 2018, and had only complained to the LSS in 2019, following the commencement of Suit 217. This was not, however, decisive. Rather, the Complainant’s delay was merely one of several factors to be considered in ascertaining the weight to be placed on the parties’ evidence, and there did not appear to be any basis for disturbing the DT’s acceptance of the reasons Shyller Tan had provided for not having made any complaint in 2018 (as set out at [24] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Ultimately, the DT had carefully considered the evidence placed before it and could not be faulted for having drawn together the entirety of the evidence in making its conclusions. While one or two discrepancies might have been explicable by the Respondent, the overwhelming weight of the evidence was against his account. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Appropriate Sanction</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 Given the conclusions on the charges as outlined above, we turn to the appropriate sanction. All three charges pertained to a conflict of interest. While the First and First Alternative Charges did not expressly make reference to “conflict of interest” like the Second Charge did, the First Charge expressly asserted a breach of r 21 of the PCR, which pertains to conflict or potential conflict between the interests of a current and former client. The First Alternative Charge also made similar reference to the Respondent’s “former engagement as ST’s lawyer”, placing the issue of conflict front and centre in this case. In <span class="font-italic">Latimer</span> at [49], the Court of Three Judges specifically observed that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In our judgment, in all disciplinary proceedings involving a conflict of interest, the sanction to be imposed should reflect both the culpability of the errant solicitor and the harm caused by his misconduct. As we observed in <span class="font-italic">Law Society of Singapore v </span><span class="font-italic">Uthayasurian Sidambaram</span> [2009] 4 SLR(R) 674 (at [74]–[75]), the appropriate sanction varies depending on the factual matrix of the case; all things considered,</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the sanction must be <span class="font-italic">commensurate</span> with the degree of culpability of the solicitor, the breaches committed and the extent and effect to which public confidence in the administration of justice has been shaken (and consequently, must be restored through punishing the errant ways of the solicitor) … [emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The Court went on to outline three broad categories of conflict of interests (at [58]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Where the errant solicitor had preferred his own interests over those of a client (“Category 1”);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Where the errant solicitor preferred the interests of one client over the other (“Category 2A”); and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Where the errant solicitor failed to advise a client of a potential conflict of interest arising out of concurrent representation (“Category 2B”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Category 1 cases of conflict were said at [60] to be “presumptively more serious and deserving of more severe sanction”. As between Category 2A and 2B, misconduct belonging in the former category was said at [70] to “typically attract a higher sanction than misconduct in the latter category”, primarily on the basis that the latter category gave rise to a <span class="font-italic">potential</span> conflict, but the interests of either client would not <span class="font-italic">in fact</span> have been subordinated to those of the other. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 On the instant facts, the LSS sought the imposition of a sentence of 12 months’ suspension. It argued that the instant facts fell only within Category 2B, acknowledging that the DT had not found any actual harm to have materialised to the interests of the Estate or the Complainant. Given the generally heightened seriousness of Category 2A instances of conflict as compared to those falling within Category 2B, the LSS suggested that a sentence of 12 months’ suspension was appropriate. The Respondent made no written submissions on sentence, though his counsel submitted at the oral hearing before us that a fine would be appropriate if the charges were found to be made out.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 With respect to the position advanced by the LSS, we were unable to agree that this case fell only within Category 2B. Were the First Charge the only charge before us, the Respondent’s breach might arguably be construed as being less serious, particularly given the actual state of JYGL’s knowledge. However, the facts relating to the Second Charge were certainly egregious and brought the present case into Category 2A, with an overall sentence of 24 months’ suspension condign on the instant facts given the following aggravating factors which are material for the assessment of culpability:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the Respondent was a solicitor of 27 years’ standing, and the Court had held in <span class="font-italic">Latimer</span> at [54] that a solicitor’s abundant experience might increase his culpability to the extent that it reveals an inexcusable lack of competence in failing to take necessary steps to address a conflict of interest. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, it was well within the Respondent’s ability to avoid placing himself in a position of conflict, particularly by making full and frank disclosure. There was no defensible justification for why the Respondent might have decided to not disclose his dealings with JYGL if he was intent on acting for her. The Respondent also had, at all times, direct control over the circumstances giving rise to the misconduct, as it was within his power to disclose his acting for JYGL: <span class="font-italic">Latimer</span> at [51(d)]. Moreover, the misconduct appeared to have been sustained over a period of time and did not appear to be a one-off or spontaneous instance of non-disclosure: <span class="font-italic">Latimer</span> at [51(b)].</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, not only did the Respondent fail to ensure that the Complainant was not labouring under the misapprehension that he was willing and able to act for the Estate, he made <span class="font-italic">positive</span> representations (“dfntly can”, “yah yah sure Shyller”) suggesting that he would in fact act for the Estate. This was all the more egregious having regard to the particular characteristics of the Complainant – who clearly reposed a great degree of trust and confidence in the Respondent as a solicitor who could help her following the killing of her husband, her father’s arrest, and the threat of legal action from JYGL.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Fourth, on 13 October 2017, the Respondent had sought to persuade the Complainant to settle or compromise in relation to JYGL’s claims. This was specifically evidenced by the Complainant’s messages to ACBP on 14 October 2017, where she recounted the Respondent having questioned the wisdom of contesting JYGL’s claims, warning that JYGL was rich and could afford fees, and that resisting her claims would be a “waste” of money.

While individuals should be fully entitled to mount their defence, or put the prosecuting authority to strict proof, that does not extend to wilfully falsifying material before the Court or tribunal. That the Respondent did so in relation to the alleged First and Second Disclosures, notwithstanding his position as an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme Court of Singapore, is regrettable.

He was called to the bar in 1993, and, at all material times, practised as a partner in the firm known as LegalStandard LLP (“LegalStandard”). The Complainant, Shyller Tan, was the wife of Spencer Sanjay s/o Shamlal Tuppani (“ST”), who passed away intestate on 10 July 2017. ST was a former client of the Respondent. The Complainant was the co-administratrix of ST’s estate (the “Estate”).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">2 ST had been cohabiting with Joan Yeo Gek Lin (“JYGL”) at the time of his death. After ST’s demise, the Respondent acted for JYGL on certain matters relating to her claims against the Estate pertaining to a Toyota Alphard (the “Alphard”) that was in ST’s name but had allegedly been purchased with JYGL’s funds, as well as approximately S$3 million in loans (the “Loans”) JYGL claimed to have made to ST.  </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">3 Two other persons were significant to this application:</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">a. First, Andy Chiok Beng Piow (“ACBP”) was, at the material time, a solicitor with Michael Khoo &amp; Partners (“MKP”). He had been representing the Complainant with respect to her intended divorce proceedings against ST.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">b. Second, Joey Lee (“Joey”), ST’s former secretary, was alleged to have shared information concerning ST’s assets with Shyller Tan. Shyller Tan subsequently claimed to have conveyed this information to the Respondent as she did not know that he was acting for JYGL.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">4 It was not contested that prior to ST’s death, he had instructed the Respondent on several matters, including on matters pertaining to his assets. The Complainant and Respondent met from July to October 2017. The Complainant’s account was that, at two of these meetings, she had conveyed information about the Estate – including information she had received from Joey Lee, ST’s former secretary – to the Respondent.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">5 On 8 August 2017, the Respondent was formally appointed as JYGL’s lawyer at a meeting where JYGL signed a letter of engagement and warrant to act prepared by LegalStandard. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">6 On 25 August 2017, ACBP’s firm wrote to LegalStandard with a view towards formally engaging the Respondent to act for the Estate in the retrieval of information and documents relevant to the assets of the deceased. There was no reply. On 3 November 2017, after Shyller Tan and her sister had been granted Letters of Administration for the Estate  on 21 October 2017, MKP sent a letter of demand directly to JYGL making claims for, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, ST’s personal effects that were in JYGL’s possession, as well as the Alphard. Following the 3 November 2017 letter of demand addressed to JYGL, LegalStandard responded with a holding letter. LegalStandard’s holding letter of 24 November 2017 was the first instance that the Respondent’s firm had unequivocally represented in writing that it was acting for JYGL. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">7 In 2019, the issue of the Alphard and Loans arose again when JYGL commenced HC/S 217/2019 on 25 February 2019 against the Estate. JYGL was represented by LegalStandard in that Suit. The Estate filed a Defence and Counterclaim on 18 March 2019 which, among other things, complained that the Respondent was acting in conflict of interest by representing JYGL. The Respondent replied by letter on 26 March 2019 to deny any conflict of interest, though he eventually discharged himself from acting for JYGL in the Suit. On 3 April 2019, the Defence and Counterclaim was amended to remove the allegation of conflict. Shortly thereafter, the Complainant formally lodged the instant complaint against the Respondent.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">8 The Applicant’s Statement of Case dated 22 April 2020 set out the charges against the Respondent:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">First Charge</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 justify-content-center">That you, Mahtani Bhagwandas, are charged that, whilst you had acted for ST when he was alive and in the course of your former engagement as ST’s lawyer acquired information relating to the assets of ST and/or [the Estate] which were confidential to ST and/or the Estate, you failed to decline to represent and/or withdraw from representing JYGL in her claim against the Estate thereby breaching Rule 21(2) of the PCR, such breach amounting to improper conduct and practice as an advocate and solicitor within the meaning of section 83(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the [LPA].</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 justify-content-center"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">Alternative First Charge</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 justify-content-center">That you, Mahtani Bhagwandas, are charged with misconduct unbefitting of an advocate and solicitor as an officer of the Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable profession under section 83(2)(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) of the [LPA] in that whilst you had acquired information confidential to ST and/or the Estate in the course of your former engagement as ST’s lawyer, you failed to decline to represent and/or withdraw from representing JYGL in her claim against the Estate.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 justify-content-center"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">Second Charge</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 justify-content-center">That you, Mahtani Bhagwandas, are charged with misconduct unbefitting of an advocate and solicitor as an officer of the Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable profession under section 83(2)(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) of the [LPA] in that you failed to make a timely disclosure to the Complainant of your conflict of interest between the Complainant, JYGL and the Estate, and as a result the Complainant was misled into disclosing information which was confidential to the Estate to you. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"></div><div class="txt-body text-left">The DT found that the Applicant had proved the charges beyond a reasonable doubt, and accordingly determined pursuant to s 93(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the LPA that cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action existed under s 83 of the LPA.

JYGL was entitled to rely on and use this information in any dispute she may have against ST or his Estate. The Court rejected this argument, for three reasons. First, the plain wording of rr 6 and 21(2) of the PCR militated against the Respondent’s reasoning. Second, the purpose of r 21 of the PCR was to protect former clients and the public interest through high professional standards. Third, and critically, insofar as the PCR was meant to provide guidance to lawyers considering whether or not to accept an engagement against a former client, the Respondent’s argument would be at odds with those objectives. On the Respondent’s approach, a solicitor would be entitled to make his own <span class="font-italic">assumptions</span> or <span class="font-italic">enquiries</span> as to whether a prospective client may already be aware of information which would otherwise be “confidential information” within the meaning of r 21(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the PCR. This was highly problematic, because in many situations, the mere fact of the solicitor making enquiries as to the prospective client’s state of knowledge might already entail some disclosure of elements or aspects of the confidential information in the first place. Accordingly, the Respondent’s defence to the First and Alternative First Charges failed: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">45], [48], and [50]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">12 To the extent that the Respondent knew or had sound basis to believe that JYGL already knew about the confidential information, this might be relevant to the question of sanction: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">52]</span>. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">13 The Second Charge was highly fact-centric and entailed consideration of whether (a) the Respondent had failed to make a timely disclosure to the Complainant of the fact that he was acting/intended to act for JYGL, and (b) whether the Complainant was thereby misled into disclosing information which was confidential to the Estate to the Respondent. The Respondent’s account of what had transpired was that he had, through the First Disclosure of 24 July 2017, and the Second Disclosure of 23 August 2017, disclosed the fact that he was acting for JYGL to the Complainant. He also asserted that the Complainant had never provided him with any information confidential to the Estate: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[53]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">14 There did not appear to be any basis for suggesting that the First Disclosure had in fact taken place. There were reasons for this which were specific to the First Disclosure, and <span class="font-italic">further</span> reasons which applied to cast doubt on the Second Disclosure or <span class="font-italic">both</span> the First <span class="font-italic">and</span> Second Disclosure. Collectively, the weight of the evidence was that the alleged disclosures had not been made. Specific to the First Disclosure, the first point indicating that the First Disclosure had not in fact taken place was the clear and unequivocal evidence of both Shyller Tan <span class="font-italic">and</span> ACBP to the contrary. The second reason for disbelieving the Respondent’s version of events stemmed from the fact that the Respondent’s <span class="font-italic">own</span> attendance note for the 24 July 2017 meeting, when the First Disclosure allegedly occurred, made no mention <span class="font-italic">whatsoever</span> about the alleged disclosure. In addition, the Respondent’s representations to Shyller Tan were at odds with his having disclosed that he was otherwise acting for JYGL: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">56]–[59]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">15 Turning to the evidence which pertains to the Second Disclosure or both the First and Second Disclosures, a number of factors indicated that the disclosure(s) did not in fact occur:</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">a. First, the WhatsApp messages exchanged between ACBP and the Respondent on 24 August 2017, where ACBP indicated that he “may have some work” for the Respondent, were at odds with the notion that the Respondent had already disclosed that he was acting for JYGL.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">b. Second, the letter sent by ACBP’s firm, MKP, to the Respondent’s firm seeking to retain the Respondent’s firm was also telling. As the DT rightly pointed out, there was no convincing explanation as to why the Complainant (and ACBP) would want to “formally retain” the Respondent’s firm, even if just for the limited purpose of seeking “information and documents relevant to the assets of the deceased”, if the Respondent had disclosed that he was acting for JYGL. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">c. Third, the messages sent by the Complainant to ACBP on 14 October 2017  following her meeting with the Respondent on 13 October 2017 showed that she did not appear to have had any indication from the Respondent, even by the meeting on 13 October 2017, that the Respondent was acting for JYGL. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">d. Fourth, the Respondent’s own account was that he was behaving as a “friendly intermediary” – but this position was at odds with his having told Shyller Tan that he would be, in effect, acting against her (in her capacity as co-administratrix of the Estate) for JYGL. The interaction between the Respondent on the one hand, and the Complainant and/or ACBP on the other hand, ceased abruptly after 24 November 2017 – which was when the Respondent first revealed, categorically, that he was acting for JYGL. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">e. Fifth, and significantly, there would have been no justification for ACBP’s firm to send the letter of demand dated 3 November 2017 <span class="font-italic">directly</span> to JYGL if the Respondent had disclosed that he was acting for JYGL. ACBP writing to an individual he <span class="font-italic">knew</span> was represented by a lawyer directly would have potentially placed ACBP in breach of r 7(3) of the PCR.</div><div class="txt-body text-left">The DT was thus right to conclude that the First and Second Disclosures had not in fact occurred: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">67]–[73]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">16 The DT also did not err in finding that information conveyed by Joey to the Complainant – and in particular information pertaining to ST’s insurance policy – had been conveyed by the Complainant to the Respondent as a result of her having been misled by his failure to disclose his retainer for JYGL. Seen cumulatively with the Court’s other findings, there was ample basis for the DT having found that the Second Charge was made out: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">78]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">17 All three charges against the Respondent pertained to a conflict of interest. Were the First Charge the only charge before the Court, the Respondent’s breach might arguably be construed as being less serious, particularly given the actual state of JYGL’s knowledge. However, the facts relating to the Second Charge were certainly egregious and brought the present case into Category 2A of the framework set out in<span class="font-italic"> Latimer</span>, with an overall sentence of 24 months’ suspension condign on the instant facts given the applicable aggravating factors: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">53]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">18 The relevant aggravating factors included the following: (a) the Respondent was of 27 years’ standing, (b) it was well within the Respondent’s ability to avoid placing himself in a position of conflict, particularly by making full and frank disclosure, (c) not only did the Respondent fail to ensure that the Complainant was not labouring under the misapprehension that he was willing and able to act for the Estate, he made <span class="font-italic">positive</span> representations that he would in fact act for the Estate, (d) the Respondent had sought to persuade the Complainant to settle or compromise in relation to JYGL’s claims, and (e) the Respondent carried out his defence by essentially fabricating the First and Second Disclosures: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">82]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-italic">This summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the Court’s judgment.
