Mr Chia is the second plaintiff in this action, while Mr Lim and Mr Srinivasan are the first and second defendants respectively. All three men were directors in the third defendant, Rotating Offshore Solutions Pte Ltd (“ROS”), a Singapore-incorporated company carrying on the business of manufacturing and repairing oil rigs and ocean-going vessels. Individually, they also indirectly held (and continue to hold, in the cases of Mr Lim and Mr Srinivasan) shares in ROS through companies incorporated in the British Virgin Islands (“BVI”). Mr Chia’s company, 3N Investments Group Limited (“3N”) (of which Mr Chia is the sole shareholder and director) is the first plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 Through their respective BVI companies, Mr Chia, Mr Lim and Mr Srinivasan were equal shareholders in ROS. From 2015 until November 2019, there was a fourth shareholder in ROS – Ezion Holdings Ltd (“Ezion”), a Singapore-incorporated company listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange.

</div> Owing to the breakdown in relations between Mr Chia on the one hand and Mr Lim and Mr Srinivasan on the other, Mr Wong became the primary point of contact representing the latter two during the relevant period. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 In or around September 2019, tensions arose between the three directors in relation to the management of ROS. They attempted to resolve their dispute by entering into a settlement agreement on 12 September 2019 (the “12 September Agreement”). This agreement generally delineated the terms of Mr Chia’s exit from ROS as a director, employee and shareholder.

</div> Although I do not place much weight on this, I note also that Mr Cheah was never called by the defendants as a witness at the trial, and consequently the veracity (and meaning) of his assertions in this email could not be tested. Moreover, the email itself does not make much sense because it refers to a proposed transfer from ROS “directly to you” (<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>to Mr Chia directly). This seems to be at odds with the defendants’ alleged original proposal, which was for ROS to transfer the Uzma Shares to <span class="font-italic">3N</span>.

</div> There was no evidence adduced by the defendants of any other emails in this period that would shed light on the reason for this revision. In his testimony, Mr Wong sought to explain away this gap, on the ground that the three directors’ relationship was fractured to the extent that communications about the structure had to be done through phone calls with himself and employees of Ezion.

</div> I do not find this to be a sufficient explanation. If relationships were indeed so broken and fractured that parties were no longer on talking terms, then one would expect, to the contrary, that they would want to put their communications down in writing for the record, especially given the fact that the parties were at this point in active litigation against each other in the Minority Oppression Suit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 In this regard, Mr Chia has also offered a separate explanation for why the Uzma Shares should have been transferred to him and not 3N, which is that 3N was a company incorporated merely to hold Mr Chia’s ROS Shares, and it bears emphasis here that ROS was itself a privately held company. Further, 3N did not have a bank account or a securities trading account.

</div> I find this to be a plausible explanation for the structure eventually agreed upon.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Therefore, I find that the evidence does not support the defendants’ case that the structure eventually agreed was one insisted upon by the plaintiffs.

</div> However, this “straightforward” original structure was subsequently described (at para 31 of their Defence) as having been a direct transfer from ROS <span class="font-italic">to Mr Chia</span> (not 3N) as a settlement under his Employment Agreement

</div> This again is contradictory, because the “straightforward” structure the defendants had earlier described (at para 31 of their Defence) also involved this same direct transfer without financial consideration. Thus, on their pleadings alone, it appears to me that the defendants have been playing somewhat fast and loose with what they consider complicated, picking and choosing the parts they wish to rely on to make up their case on this allegedly complicated structure.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Furthermore, in my view, the available evidence does not support the defendants’ case that this element of a share transfer without financial consideration rendered the transaction significantly more complicated than their alleged original proposed structure. Bursa clearly had experience in dealing with such transactions: the presence of established application routes such as the B5 transfer and DBT transfer speaks to this, as do the parties’ Malaysian law experts’ testimonies of their own individual experience in dealing with such transactions in their respective practices.

</div> this uncertainty in outcome does not of itself mean that the transaction was complicated. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Ultimately, however, this argument is, in my view, a red herring and a distraction from the real issue at hand – <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, did the defendants breach the SPAs? Even if I accept that the eventual agreed structure of the transaction was something insisted upon by the plaintiffs, and that it was unduly complicated, that does not change the fact that the defendants had <span class="font-italic">voluntarily</span> agreed to this structure, with their eyes wide open. It affords no defence at all for the defendants, in the wake of their failure to transfer the shares by 31 December 2019, to point fingers at the plaintiffs and <span class="font-italic">in effect</span> complain that they should never have agreed to the structure in the SPAs in the first place. Unfortunately, that ship has sailed for the defendants.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Having disposed of the defendants’ arguments on this ultimately inconsequential issue, I move on to address the core questions relating to breach. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The defendants had an absolute obligation to transfer the Uzma Shares by 31 Dec 2019</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 The first question to be answered is the nature of the defendants’ obligations under cl 4.4(b) and cl 7 of the SPAs. The defendants submit that the SPAs did not impose on them an absolute duty to effect the transfer of the Uzma Shares by 31 December 2019. Instead, they say that their duty was one of reasonable endeavours: to take all reasonable steps in good faith to procure the transfer.

</div> If the defendants seek to rely on this interpretation of cl 4.4(b) and argue that they were only required to undertake reasonable endeavours to transfer the Uzma Shares by 31 December 2019, then they should have made this case clearly and unambiguously in their pleadings.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 In any case, I find the defendants’ interpretation of cl 4.4(b) as encompassing a duty of reasonable endeavours to be without merit.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 In my view, the defendants have taken both cases out of context. In <span class="font-italic">Lim Sze </span><span class="font-italic">Eng</span>, both parties had pleaded that the settlement agreement in that case contained an implied term that the parties “shall take reasonable endeavours and/or do all that may be necessary to give effect to the spirit and intent of the [settlement agreement] and to implement the terms of the [settlement agreement]” (<span class="font-italic">Lim Sze </span><span class="font-italic">Eng </span>at [23]). It was in that context that the court made the remarks which the defendants now rely on. <span class="font-italic">Travista</span>, on the other hand, concerned the interpretation of a clause which expressly provided that the purchaser of property was to use his best endeavours to obtain regulatory approval for the transaction (<span class="font-italic">Travista</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [3] and [12]).<span class="font-italic"> </span>However, the case at hand is different because cl 4.4(b) stipulates that parties were to “take all necessary steps and do all such acts and things” to effect the transfer of the Uzma Shares – <span class="font-italic">time being of the essence</span> – by 31 December 2019 (see [9] above). The wording of the clause points clearly towards the defendants’ obligation being absolute.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Furthermore, the background context to the conclusion of the SPAs in this case cannot be ignored. The SPAs were entered into on the back of a fractured relationship, between parties who were already engaged in litigation. The transfer of the ROS Shares from Mr Chia to Mr Lim and Mr Srinivasan and the corresponding payment of the price (including the transfer of the Uzma Shares) would achieve closure for the parties and draw a line under their fractious relationship. The steps were to be taken quickly, hence the emphasis on time being of the essence in cl 4.4(b) itself. Furthermore, the SPAs were drafted with the benefit of legal advice.

</div> If the parties intended the obligation to be only one of reasonable or best endeavours, then one would have, in these circumstances, expected express language to that effect in the SPAs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 In my judgment, all of these indicia and the express language of cl 4.4(b) point irresistibly to the conclusion that the defendants were under an absolute obligation to effect the transfer of the Uzma Shares by 31 December 2019, and I so find. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Accordingly, the defendants were, in my judgment, in breach of their obligations under cl 4.4(b) of the SPAs in failing to effect the transfer of the Uzma Shares to Mr Chia by 31 December 2019.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Even if the defendants only had an obligation of reasonable endeavours, they have breached that obligation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 As I have found that the defendants were in breach of their absolute obligation under the SPAs as of 31 December 2019, it is strictly unnecessary for me to go further into subsequent events for the purposes of this issue. However, as the defendants have based their arguments substantially on their conduct during this entire period, I shall nonetheless give my views on them. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 The defendants’ arguments in the main can be reduced to two key propositions: first, that it was reasonable for them to follow the advice of Maybank IB throughout the entire transaction process, and second, that the plaintiffs had on multiple occasions caused delay by their own obstructive behaviour. I will address these propositions in relation to each phase of the transaction process.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The starting point is the appointment of Maybank IB itself. As mentioned above (at [14]), the defendants first engaged Maybank IB to advise on and assist with the transaction. The defendants argue that Mr Chia never objected to this appointment, and that the plaintiffs never pleaded that Maybank IB was unreliable or incapable. They contend that this was in fact a <span class="font-italic">joint</span> appointment of Maybank IB to act on behalf of all parties.

</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 On this last contention, I find that the defendants have not proven on the balance of probabilities that Maybank IB was acting jointly for the plaintiffs as well. Looking at the structure of the transaction as agreed in the SPAs, the plaintiffs had already completed their obligations by 18 November 2019, when the ROS Shares were transferred to Mr Lim and Mr Srinivasan. The remaining obligations requiring active steps (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, making the cash payments and transferring the Uzma Shares) were solely the defendants’. As such, the plaintiffs would have nothing to gain from or any reason to agree to a joint appointment of Maybank IB. Furthermore, no representative of Maybank IB was called to give evidence at trial, nor were any documents tendered by the defendants to show that Maybank IB had been appointed by and acted for both the defendants and plaintiffs. I therefore disagree with the defendants’ contention that Maybank IB had been appointed jointly by and acted for all parties, as the evidence does not bear this out.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 I move on to examine the key question – was it reasonable for the defendants to follow the advice of Maybank IB throughout the entire process? In answering this question, I bear in mind the context behind this transaction. Both sides wanted to close the deal by 31 December 2019, draw a line under their disputes and move on with their lives. It was Mr Chia’s evidence that he wanted to sell the Uzma Shares as soon as possible to raise cash to compete with ROS after his exit.

</div> The parties further agreed in cl 4.4(b) that time was of the essence.

</div> and (b) the B5 transfer application under the “Other corporate activities” category could possibly have succeeded had Bursa not taken a “very plain view” that the recipient of the Uzma Shares (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Mr Chia), was not at the time of the application a shareholder of ROS anymore.

</div> This alone suggests that either Maybank IB or the particular officers acting for the defendants were either inexperienced in such off-market transactions or had in this instance given the wrong advice on a fairly fundamental point. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Whatever the case may be, when the B5 transfer application was rejected on 30 December 2019 (the very same day it was submitted to Bursa for approval), this should have raised alarm bells for the defendants, especially given that time was of the essence. If that was not enough, alarm bells should undoubtedly have rung on 3 January 2020, when the plaintiffs, through their lawyers, sent a letter of demand to the defendants – it would have been clear to the defendants then that Mr Chia was taking the deadline seriously and there was every danger of the dispute escalating again.

</div>
</div> At that point, it should have dawned on the defendants that they might have needed further help – and by this, I mean help beyond Maybank IB’s capabilities – in order to complete the transaction quickly. For example, they should have taken steps to get a second opinion on Maybank IB’s advice or instruct Malaysian lawyers to advise them on the next steps and the options to get the Uzma Shares transferred to Mr Chia. The value of such advice is clear enough – on the evidence of the plaintiffs’ Malaysian law expert, Mr Adrian Koh, a DBT transfer was the appropriate method to effect the transfer.

Thus, even on a reasonable endeavours basis, the defendants have not satisfied me, on the balance of probabilities, that they fulfilled their obligations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Separately, I note the defendants’ argument that the B5 transfer application process was delayed by Mr Chia’s obstructive conduct. The defendants contend that on or around 11 December 2019, they sent Mr Chia a “revised Sale and Purchase Agreement” to execute for purposes of the transfer. This was apparently done on the advice of Maybank IB that the signed SPAs which formed part of the 15 November Agreements might have been inadequate.

</div> Naturally, one would expect some amount of discussion back and forth between the parties on the purpose and content of such documents for the purpose of protecting their legal and commercial interests. It was therefore not unreasonable or obstructive for Mr Chia and/or his Malaysian lawyer to make queries and/or to comment on the documents sent by the defendants and Maybank IB. The defendants, for their part, had on some, albeit not all, occasions either refused to address those queries directly or simply deflected them to Maybank IB instead.

</div> In my view, the bickering and hostilities that ensued in this process could have been mitigated at least partially, if not substantially, had the defendants engaged lawyers in Malaysia to advise them on the transaction and handle it on their behalf.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 As for the defendants’ complaint about the letters of demand sent by the plaintiffs, any delay occasioned by the defendants having to respond to them would, in my view, be inconsequential in the overall scheme, especially in  comparison to the almost seven months of delay which ultimately occurred. In any case, it was well within Mr Chia’s legal rights to instruct his lawyers to send letters of demand to state his position for the record or simply to preserve his rights – I will come back to this again when I address the issue of waiver.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Turning back to the DBT application, the more significant delay to this process arose from the decision taken by the defendants – in accordance with Maybank IB’s advice – to delay the application to Bursa in light of the imposition of MCOs in Malaysia. On the defendants’ case, Maybank IB had advised them that in view of the complicated structure of the transaction, it was necessary to have a physical face-to-face meeting with Bursa's representatives to explain the circumstances of the transaction. The defendants contend that because of the MCOs imposed by the Malaysian Government, Maybank IB was unable to meet with Bursa on their behalf. Accordingly, the defendants decided to postpone making the DBT application until such a physical meeting could be conducted.

First, the Maybank IB officer who authored the email quoted above was not called to give evidence, nor was any other representative of Maybank IB. Thus, the assertions in this email could not be tested at trial to determine the basis on which they were made. On the face of this email, it appears to me that Maybank IB’s insistence on a physical meeting was borne out of an abundance of caution, especially since the B5 transfer application that they had recommended in December 2019 had already been rejected by Bursa. However, Maybank IB did not appear to have even considered or advised the defendants on the possibility of arranging virtual meetings or tele-conferencing with Bursa representatives.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 It is certainly not the case that such remote meetings with Bursa were not possible during the currency of the MCOs.

It is more likely than not that the insistence on a physical meeting with Bursa was a matter of preference on the part of Maybank IB’s representatives.

That is, the plaintiffs, in granting multiple extensions of time, had in effect represented that they would not be insisting upon their legal right to timely delivery of the Uzma Shares against the defendants, and the defendants had relied upon these representations such that it would be inequitable for the plaintiffs to resile on them. However, the law is clear that an <span class="font-italic">unequivocal</span> representation is required: <span class="font-italic">Audi Construction Pte Ltd v Kian </span><span class="font-italic">Hiap Construction Pte Ltd </span>[2018] 1 SLR 317 at [57].

The defendants rely on the fact that the value ascribed to the Uzma Shares in cl 4.4(b) was the book value of the shares as recorded in ROS’ audited accounts as at 31 March 2019, as opposed to the market value of the shares as at the date of the SPAs.

</div> However, Mr Chia’s evidence was that the combined value of the Uzma Shares at book value and the agreed cash components would be roughly equivalent to the total compensation package he had claimed under the settlement – including the divesting of his ROS shares. The use of the book value would obviate the need to account for market fluctuations in the price of the shares. Thus, Mr Chia was prepared to go with this payment structure.

</div> While the defendants utilise this payment structure as a point to make their second assertion as to Mr Chia’s interest in the value of the shares (which I discuss below), they do not dispute Mr Chia’s evidence in so far as it relates to the use of the book value of the ROS Shares to arrive at the sale price. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Mr Chia’s explanation of the payment being partly in cash and partly in kind also accords with the commercial sensibilities of the transaction. It was Mr Chia’s evidence that Mr Lim and Mr Srinivasan did not have sufficient cash to purchase the ROS Shares at his valuation.

</div> This was not disputed by the defendants at trial. It would likely also have impacted ROS’ cashflow if Mr Lim and Mr Srinivasan used ROS’ cash assets to make up for the shortfall. This would also explain the final agreed transaction structure, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, for ROS to transfer the Uzma Shares to Mr Lim and Mr Srinivasan <span class="font-italic">in specie</span>, followed by a transfer from them to Mr Chia. All of this undermines the defendants’ assertion that the value ascribed to the Uzma Shares was merely notional or nominal. Instead, it represented the closest monetary equivalent to the payment of the balance of the sale price under the SPAs, after accounting for the cash components.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 Thus, I disagree with the defendants to the extent that they seek to assert that the valuation of the shares in the SPAs was nothing more than a notional or nominal figure. I am satisfied that Mr Chia has provided a logical explanation for the use of the book value of the ROS Shares, and this explanation was not undermined by the defendants at trial. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 As for the defendants’ second assertion that Mr Chia was only interested in the Uzma Shares themselves and not their value, I find this difficult to understand. First, Mr Chia may have wanted the Uzma Shares, but that did not mean he could not convert them to cash as and when required. Again, the defendants do not contend that the shares had no value. Second, the defendants’ assertion is also contradicted by the evidence. Mr Chia gave evidence at trial that he had intended to sell the Uzma Shares for cash as soon as possible.

</div> If Mr Chia was only interested in possessing the Uzma Shares in themselves, then he would not have sold them at all.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Having dealt with the assertions at [71], I come back to consider the question of whether the plaintiffs are entitled to claim for a diminution in the value of the shares.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The plaintiffs are entitled to claim for diminution in share value</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The defendants’ arguments </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 The basic principle for recovery of damages for a breach of contract is compensation.

</div> Consequently, the plaintiffs are entitled only to damages for any dividends declared by Uzma between the agreed and actual date of delivery. In support of this argument, the defendants rely on the following passage from <span class="font-italic">Chitty </span>at para 29–202:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In an action for a seller’s failure to transfer shares, the buyer may recover the market price of shares on the day fixed for completion, less the contract price, since <span class="font-italic">the principles of law governing damages in the sale of goods are applied by analogy.</span> A buyer who obtains a <span class="font-italic">decree of specific performance</span> for the delivery of shares may also recover damages equal to the dividends declared by the company between the agreed date of delivery and the actual date (and interest thereon). </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">They further rely on the following paragraph from the older 19th edition of <span class="font-italic">McGregor</span>, as well as the case of <span class="font-italic">Sri Lanka Omnibus Co v </span><span class="font-italic">Perera </span>[1952] 1 AC 76 cited therein (at para 27–007):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The nearest approach to delayed delivery comes in the cases <span class="font-weight-bold">where the buyer forces delivery on an unwilling seller by successfully suing for specific performance</span>. <span class="font-weight-bold">If the market value has fallen he would be wise not to pursue this remedy, and if the market value has risen or remained unaltered</span> <span class="font-weight-bold">the normal measure of market price at due delivery less market price at actual delivery will yield only nominal damages</span>. However the buyer who has been awarded a decree of specific performance can recover as damages the equivalent of the dividends at the rates declared by the company between the date when the shares should have been delivered or allotted and the date of actual delivery or allotment together with interest on the dividends during non-payment.

The respondent obtained an order for specific performance which was complied with. The only question remaining was the measure of damages the respondent was additionally entitled to. The Privy Council held (at p 81) that the respondent could only claim for a sum equivalent to the dividends he would have received had the contract been duly performed, along with interest:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The party complaining of a breach of contract is not entitled to be put in a better position than he would have enjoyed if the contract had been performed according to its terms.

The starting point is that the principles governing damages in the law of sale of goods are applied by analogy where a case involves a sale of shares. It follows that a buyer of shares can, as a matter of law, recover market damages in the event of a non-delivery or late delivery of shares. By “market damages”, I refer to damages assessed by the reference to the market value of the shares.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 This general approach was applied by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">City Securities Pte Ltd (in liquidation) v Associated Management Services Pte Ltd </span>[1996] 1 SLR(R) 410, albeit in the context of non-acceptance of shares by a buyer. In that case, the appellant stockbroker had purchased 880,000 shares in a company, by order and for the account of the respondent, at S$3.75 per share on 24 January 1986. The respondent was to pay the total sum of S$3,336,400 (inclusive of brokerage and stamp fees) on the date of fulfilment, which was 31 January 1986. It was found by the assistant registrar at first instance that the contract was essentially a contract of sale between the appellant, as seller, and the respondent, as buyer, at the stipulated price of S$3.75 per share. The respondent failed to pay the sum due on 31 January 1986. The open market price of the shares at that time was S$2.60 per share. The Court of Appeal held that the appellant could recover the difference between the contract price and the market price of the shares at the date of breach (at [18]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">18 In a contract for the sale of shares the measure of damages upon a breach by the purchaser is the difference between the contract price and the market price at the date of  the breach, with an obligation on the part of the seller to mitigate the damages by getting the best price he can upon that date: <span class="font-italic">A K A S Jamal v </span><span class="font-italic">Moolla Dawood, Sons &amp; Co </span>[1916] 1 AC 175 at 179. At the date of breach, <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>31 January 1986, the market price of MTP shares was $2.60 per share. In the premises, the damages should be awarded on the basis of the difference between the contract price of $3.75 per share and the market price of $2.60 per share, amounting in total to $1,012,000 for 880,000 MTP shares.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 However, in so far as the defendants seek to rely on these authorities to argue that the plaintiffs have obtained specific performance and are therefore no longer entitled to claim for diminution in the value of the shares, I find that the authorities do not assist them. The extracts cited by the defendants envisage a situation where the innocent party has sought and obtained <span class="font-italic">an order</span> for specific performance. That was not the case here. The present facts arise not out of any court order, but by the defendants’ own actions, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, transferring the Uzma Shares to Mr Chia more than seven months after the contractual date of delivery, even after he had refused consent for the transfer. I note that the plaintiffs did initially seek an order for specific performance when this suit was first commenced, but subsequently amended their claim to one for damages only because of the defendants’ actions.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> The plaintiffs were right to do so, given that the situation had changed from one of non-delivery to one of late delivery. Nonetheless, it does not amount to the plaintiffs having obtained an order for specific performance. If that can be characterised as specific performance, there would be nothing to stop any seller in a late delivery scenario from seeking to escape liability to pay damages on the ground that the buyer had obtained the goods (or shares) anyway. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 <span class="font-italic">Sri Lanka Omnibus </span>is also distinguishable from the present case. In that case, there was no allegation or evidence that the value of the shares in the company had dropped after the breach date. Hence, it does not appear that the respondent in that case would have been able to mount any claim for diminution in share value anyway, since applying the normal measure in such a claim would result in only nominal damages being awarded. As much as the defendants urge me to, I do not read <span class="font-italic">Sri Lanka Omnibus</span> as standing for any general proposition that a buyer of shares who receives the shares contracted for late is entitled <span class="font-italic">only </span>to damages representing any dividends declared by the company in the interim period and nothing else. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 For the reasons above, I disagree that the plaintiffs have obtained an order for specific performance and are thereby limited to a claim for dividends declared in the interim period. I see no reason why the general rule on the measure of damages should not apply in this case. As the plaintiffs submit, on 31 December 2019, when the contract was to be fulfilled, they were entitled to the Uzma Shares and the value those shares held on that date – or in this case, the value the parties had agreed upon in the SPAs. Since the value of the Uzma Shares had dropped by the time the plaintiffs actually received the Uzma Shares, they are entitled to claim damages for the diminution in value from the defendants. In my view, this is a fair and principled approach to adopt in order to determine the damages to be awarded. If the situation were otherwise and the share price had in fact appreciated by the time of actual delivery on 29 July 2020, then there would be no loss that the plaintiffs could claim to have suffered by reason of the breach, and they would then only be entitled to nominal damages at best. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 I turn now to address another point which the defendants pleaded in their Defence. The defendants contend that the plaintiffs are not entitled to claim for the diminution of share value because it was not a term of the SPAs that the defendants would have to compensate the plaintiffs for a reduction in value of the Uzma Shares prior to the transfer.

</div>
</div> I respectfully disagree. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 A right to claim for damages for diminution in share value arises from the general law of contract, and not from the terms of any particular contract. The absence of a provision in the SPAs stating that a party can claim damages for diminution in share value in the event of delayed performance does not mean that such a claim is excluded. Furthermore, there is nothing in the SPAs in the nature of an exclusion clause which excludes such a claim being made. In contrast, cl 7 of the SPAs, pursuant to which each defendant warranted the performance by the other defendants and agreed to indemnify the plaintiffs for, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, “damages” and “losses” <span class="font-italic">directly or indirectly</span> caused to Mr Chia, suggests that the parties did contemplate that any loss by reason of late delivery could be recovered:

It is to these issues that I now turn.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 3: Was the plaintiffs’ loss caused by the defendants’ breach?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 I start with the issue of causation. It is trite that there must be a causal connection between the defendants’ breach of contract and the plaintiffs’ loss. The breach of contract must amount to an effective cause of the loss, and this inquiry is divided into two questions – causation in fact and causation in law (see <span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract in Singapore </span>(Andrew Phang Boon Leong gen ed) (Academy Publishing, 2nd ed, 2022) at para 22.024). Causation in fact is concerned with establishing the <span class="font-italic">physical connection</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>between the defendant’s wrong and the plaintiffs’ loss, and the starting point is whether “but-for” causation can be proved: <span class="font-italic">Sunny Metal &amp; Engineering Pte Ltd v Ng </span><span class="font-italic">Khim Ming Eric</span> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 782 (“<span class="font-italic">Sunny Metal</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [52]. Causation in law, on the other hand, is concerned with the question of whether there are any intervening events which are so significant as to have broken the chain of causation: <span class="font-italic">Sunny Metal </span>at [54]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 The defendants’ contentions relate to causation in fact. They argue that there is no causal link between their breach, in failing to transfer the Uzma Shares by 31 December 2019, and the diminution in value of the shares. This is because the Uzma Shares, which are publicly traded, would have declined in value even if the shares were delivered on time.

</div> In support of their arguments on causation, as well as remoteness (which I discuss below), the defendants rely on Sir Bernard Eder IJ’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Judah Value Activist Fund v Open Faith Investment Ltd </span>[2021] SGHC(I) 7 (<span class="font-italic">“Judah Value Activist</span>”). The defendants submit that in <span class="font-italic">Judah Value Activist</span>, the Singapore International Commercial Court found no causal link between the defendants’ “failure to transfer the [company’s] shares by the contractually stipulated deadline and the decline in the [company’s] share value”.

</div>
</div>
</div> However, a close look at the facts and the court’s reasoning reveals that the defendants’ reliance on this case is misplaced. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Judah Value Activist</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 <span class="font-italic">Judah Value Activist</span> involved a subscription agreement under which the defendant would subscribe for shares in the plaintiff hedge fund, providing consideration by way of a transfer of shares in Agritrade Resources Limited (a Hong Kong-listed company) (“Agritrade”) into the plaintiff’s fund. The defendant, in breach of the contract, failed to transfer the shares by the contractually stipulated deadline. At this point in time, the plaintiff had entered into a margin loan facility with its stockbroker, under which the plaintiff was required to maintain a Loan-to-Value Ratio below 70%, failing which there would be a margin call which, if unsatisfied, would entitle the broker to sell <span class="font-italic">any</span> securities held in the plaintiff’s account. This included Agritrade shares which the plaintiff already owned as part of its portfolio. The plaintiff claimed that, as a result of the defendant’s failure to transfer its Agritrade shares by the contractual deadline, the plaintiff’s Loan-to-Value Ratio exceeded 70%, triggering a margin call which led to the broker forcing the sale of the plaintiff’s <span class="font-italic">entire </span>portfolio of Agritrade shares in three tranches over a period of four days. This resulted in a loss of more than S$5 million to the plaintiffs’ fund.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 The defendant disputed causation and argued that the declining share price of Agritrade over the four-day period would have resulted in the plaintiff’s Loan-to-Value Ratio exceeding the limit anyway, thus leading to the same outcome (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, a forced sale of its portfolio by the broker). In other words, the defendant contended that the loss would have occurred <span class="font-italic">even if</span> the shares were transferred on time. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 The court divided its analysis between the initial forced sale of shares by the broker and the subsequent two tranches of forced sales. The court agreed with the plaintiff that the initial forced sale of Agritrade shares had been caused by the defendant’s breach (<span class="font-italic">Judah Value </span><span class="font-italic">Activist </span>at [164]). However, the court found that the plaintiff could not prove any loss in respect of this first forced sale because it <span class="font-italic">had</span> obtained the market price for the shares at the time of sale (<span class="font-italic">Judah Value </span><span class="font-italic">Activist </span>at [165]). The court further found that the subsequent two tranches of forced sales by the broker were justified in view of falling Agritrade share prices. The question then was whether this drop in share price was caused by the initial forced sale and, by extension, the defendant’s breach. In answer to this question, the court found that, on the evidence, the plaintiff could not establish on a balance of probabilities that the first forced sale had caused the drop in Agritrade share prices (<span class="font-italic">Judah Value Activist </span>at [174]–[176]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Analysis and Decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 While <span class="font-italic">Judah Value Activist</span>, like the present case, did involve a breach of a contractual obligation to transfer shares and a drop in the market value of the target shares, it is clear that the claim for loss there was made in a very different factual context. In substance, the claim there was that the defendant’s breach in failing to transfer Agritrade shares by the contractually stipulated deadline caused the plaintiff’s broker (a third party) to sell <span class="font-italic">other </span>Agritrade<span class="font-italic"> </span>shares owned by the plaintiff, which in turn created downward pressure on the Agritrade share price and which triggered two further forced sales of the plaintiff’s own shares. It was in that context that the court found that the plaintiff could not establish “but-for” causation on the evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 In fact, Eder IJ explicitly stated that the plaintiff there was not to be regarded as a buyer who had lost the market value of the shares (<span class="font-italic">Judah Value Activist </span>at [136]). <span class="font-italic">Judah Value Activist</span> is thus distinguishable from the present case, which <span class="font-italic">does</span> concern a buyer who lost the market value of shares. The causal link here is a much more direct one. Here, the defendants’ failure to transfer a particular lot of Uzma Shares by the contractual deadline resulted in the plaintiffs coming into ownership of those shares only at a much later time, when they were worth significantly less. On this basis, I find that “but-for” causation has been established by the plaintiffs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 Returning to the overall question of whether the defendants’ breach is an effective cause, which requires the establishment of both causation in fact and causation in law, I note that the defendants do not contest causation in law – there was no averment that any intervening cause or event capable of breaking the chain of causation did so break that chain. Therefore, I am satisfied that the plaintiffs have established causation both in fact and in law <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that the defendants’ breach was an effective cause of the plaintiffs’ loss.   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 4: Is the plaintiffs’ loss too remote?  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 I turn next to the question of whether the plaintiffs’ loss is too remote. The governing principles here, which the parties do not dispute, are the two limbs of the rule in <span class="font-italic">Hadley v Baxendale </span>(1854) 9 Exch 341, which was accepted by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Out of the Box Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Wanin Industries Pte Ltd </span>[2013] 2 SLR 363 (“<span class="font-italic">Out of the Box</span>”). Damages may be recovered under the first limb of the rule for “consequences that arise naturally according to the usual course of things or flowing from what may reasonably be supposed to be in the contemplation of both parties when they contracted”: <span class="font-italic">Out of the Box </span>at [17]. Under the second limb, damages may also be recovered for consequences that are foreseeable as not unlikely, given the defendant’s knowledge of special facts and circumstances (which a reasonable person would not be taken to know): <span class="font-italic">Out of the Box </span>at [18]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 The defendants contend that neither limb of the rule in <span class="font-italic">Hadley v Baxendale</span> has been made out. I discuss each limb in turn. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 Addressing the first limb, the defendants contend that the plaintiffs’ loss does not flow naturally from the defendants’ breach because there was a common understanding between the parties that Mr Chia only sought to possess the Uzma Shares and was not interested in their market value. I have summarised my findings at [71]–[77] above on why I disagree with this assertion and take the view that the monetary value attached to the Uzma Shares in the SPAs was not a notional or nominal figure. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 I therefore find that the plaintiffs’ loss in this case falls within the first limb of <span class="font-italic">Hadley v Baxendale</span>. The SPAs required the defendants to effect transfer of the Uzma Shares by 31 December 2019, with time being of the essence. The Uzma Shares were publicly traded, and ROS itself held shares in Uzma and could thus be presumed to have been aware of the share price on any given day. Mr Chia, Mr Lim and Mr Srinivasan, as directors of ROS, could also be presumed to have been aware of the same. Thus, on the date the SPAs were concluded<span class="font-italic">, </span><span class="font-italic">ie</span> 15 November 2019, both parties (and the defendants in particular) would have reasonably been aware that any delay in the transfer of the Uzma Shares <span class="font-italic">could</span> result in loss to the plaintiffs if the share price dropped during the period of delay. The fact that this very sort of loss is recognised in the textbook commentaries (see [79] above) to be the normal measure of loss is also a factor in the plaintiffs’ favour. Plainly, the damages sought here are not something out of the ordinary or unusual. I also repeat my finding above (at [89]) that nothing in the SPAs excludes recovery for such a loss such that this could be regarded as falling outside of the parties’ reasonable contemplation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 The reasoning in <span class="font-italic">Judah Value Activist </span>in relation to remoteness is also distinguishable. In that case, the court found that, absent special knowledge, it would not be within the reasonable contemplation of an ordinary investor, such as the defendant, that a breach of the subscription agreement would trigger a margin call on the investee fund, resulting in the fund’s broker forcing a sale of other shares in the fund. Thus, damages were not recoverable there under the first limb of <span class="font-italic">Hadley v Baxendale</span>. Those are not the facts here. In fact, it is difficult to imagine that the loss suffered here would be anything other than the usual sort of loss flowing naturally from the defendants’ breach.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 As for the second limb of <span class="font-italic">Hadley v Baxendale</span>, I agree with the defendants that this limb would not apply in this case. Such a claim would need to be specifically pleaded, and the plaintiffs have not done so.

The basic principles here are well-established. A party must take all reasonable steps to mitigate its losses consequent on the defaulting party’s breach. If it fails to take such steps, then it cannot recover for any loss which could have been avoided but for its own unreasonable action or inaction. It is for the defaulting party to prove that the innocent party claiming damages has failed to mitigate (<span class="font-italic">The “Asia Star” </span>[2010] 2 SLR 1154 at [24]). Lastly, the inquiry as to whether the actions or omissions of the innocent party were reasonable is necessarily fact-sensitive. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 The duty to mitigate may in certain cases require an innocent party to accept an offer by the breaching party. Thus, it has been observed by the authors of <span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract in Singapore </span>(at para 22.147) that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… a refusal to entertain an offer by the promisor-in-breach to render substitute performance which would actually have a mitigatory effect could constitute an <span class="font-italic">unreasonable </span>course of conduct as amounting to a failure to mitigate.<span class="font-italic"> </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 The defendants contend that the plaintiffs failed to mitigate because they unreasonably refused to accept the defendants’ offers to sell the Uzma Shares in the open market and transfer the sale proceeds to the plaintiffs.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 In brief, I disagree with the defendants that the plaintiffs acted unreasonably in refusing to accept these offers. I come to this conclusion for several reasons. Firstly, there is an element of inconsistency in the defendants’ arguments here. The defendants contend vigorously that Mr Chia only wanted to possess the Uzma Shares for his own commercial reasons and was never interested in their monetary value (see [71(b)] above). Despite that, they now seek to blame Mr Chia for refusing an offer to take what was effectively the monetary value of those shares.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 Secondly, while innocent parties may in certain circumstances be required to mitigate by accepting offers by defaulting parties, it cannot be the case that they must do so for any and every offer made. The content of the offer matters, particularly in relation to whether it amounts to a significant variation of the contract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113  Two cases illustrate this point. In <span class="font-italic">Payzu</span><span class="font-italic"> v Saunders </span>[1918–19] All ER Rep 219 (“<span class="font-italic">Payzu</span>”), the defendant seller had agreed to sell silk to the buyer on credit, with the silk to be delivered in multiple instalments and corresponding payments for each instalment to be paid within one month. The buyer was late in paying the first instalment, leading the seller to refuse to deliver the goods on the agreed credit terms. The seller was held to be in breach of the contract. However, the English Court of Appeal held that it was unreasonable for the buyer to refuse the seller’s offer to supply the silk on cash on delivery terms, as opposed to credit terms. The offer, which was adjudged to be reasonable, was one for delivery of the exact goods bargained for, and at the same price, the only difference being the mode of payment. This is to be contrasted against <span class="font-italic">Strutt v </span><span class="font-italic">Whitnell</span> [1975] 1 WLR 870 (“<span class="font-italic">Strutt</span>”). That case involved a contract for the sale of a house with vacant possession. The vendor, in breach of contract, was unable to deliver the house with vacant possession because it was occupied by a protected tenant. The vendor offered instead to repurchase the house. It was held that the buyer did not act unreasonably in refusing this offer. Clearly, the buyer was not expected to give up his claim to the property bargained for in the name of mitigation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 In the case before me, what the parties had agreed to was that “on the Completion Date, or as soon as practicable thereafter”, the defendants were to take steps to “effect the transfer of the Uzma Shares…to the securities account of [Mr Chia] <span class="font-italic">by way of an off-market transfer or by such other methods as reasonably practicable</span>” [emphasis added].

</div>
</div>
</div> The mode of performance envisaged in the defendants’ offers was clearly significantly different from that which was originally bargained for by the plaintiffs. It did not involve any “such other method” of <span class="font-italic">transferring</span> the shares. Indeed, it did not contemplate <span class="font-italic">any </span>transfer at all. This amounted, in substance, not just to a different mode of performance but a significant variation of the SPAs, which would have changed the fundamental obligation of the defendants completely. Had Mr Chia accepted the offers, he would have received a completely different asset (<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>cash) from what he was promised under the contract (<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> the Uzma Shares). In my view, this was more akin to the offer made in <span class="font-italic">Strutt </span>rather than <span class="font-italic">Payzu</span>. In the circumstances, I find that it was not unreasonable for Mr Chia to reject the second and third offers. Innocent parties are only expected to take reasonable steps to mitigate their loss. In my judgment, it is quite unreasonable for the defendants, whose breach had caused the loss in the first place, to then require the plaintiffs to accept a variation of the contract that would effectively have transformed the transaction into a completely different bargain. I do not agree that the principles on mitigation of loss would place such a burden on the plaintiffs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 Thirdly, on the facts, I do not find that these offers could realistically have been carried out by the defendants, even if the plaintiffs had accepted them. A course of action cannot be reasonable if it is not even realistic. It falls on the defendants to show that the offers, if accepted by the plaintiffs, could have been carried out by them, and carried out promptly, bearing in mind that time was of the essence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 The undisputed facts are that (a) the Uzma Shares were held in ROS’ securities account with its broker, Maybank Kim Eng; and (b) the parties were informed on 25 November 2019 that Maybank Kim Eng was unwilling to assist with the transfer of the Uzma Shares directly to Mr Chia due to ROS’ involvement in ongoing litigation. Thus, any transfer of the Uzma Shares would not have been possible until ROS opened an account with Maybank IB. It appears, on the evidence, that this account was only opened on 13 February 2020, well after the purported offers in mitigation made by the defendants.

This was put to Mr Chia in the following exchange:

However, I find the evidence to be inconclusive on this point. Firstly, as mentioned above, ROS’ account with Maybank IB was only opened on 13 February 2020, <span class="font-italic">after </span>the offers were made by the defendants.
                   <sup><button class="btn btn-link superscript-btn" data-target="#fn-1d877e12-9be3-49e4-a5ab-cd00266b9d87" data-toggle="modal" type="button">119</button></sup>

</div>
</div>
</div> Secondly, even if I assume that the defendants could have opened this account sooner, I must also be satisfied that Maybank IB was in fact willing to facilitate this open market sale. The evidence on this point is quite unsatisfactory and I bear in mind that the burden lies on the defendants to prove their case on the plaintiffs’ failure to mitigate loss ([106] above). The exchanges relied upon by the defendants only show <span class="font-italic">Mr Chia</span><span class="font-italic">’s </span>understanding or assumption that the Maybank IB representative suggested that the shares could be sold on the open market through the Maybank IB platform. However, Mr Chia’s assumptions as to what the Maybank IB representative might have meant or had in mind are hardly probative of whether Maybank IB was <span class="font-italic">in fact</span> willing to facilitate a sale of the Uzma Shares on the open market using its platform. Nor is it sufficient for the defendants to rely on what appears to be a single line from an extended telephone conference call, especially when the Maybank IB representative who made that statement did not give evidence at the trial. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 Further, Mr Chia’s evidence was that any negotiations following from his acceptance of the defendants’ offers would have required new agreements to be executed by the parties, which would result in further delays.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> I find that this explanation is not illogical and is in fact quite believable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 Given the state of the evidence adduced at the trial, I return again to the premise that the burden of proof falls on the defendants, as the defaulting parties, to demonstrate that the plaintiffs failed to mitigate their loss (see [106]). In relation to the second and third offers specifically, it is also for the defendants to prove that their offers could realistically have been carried out. However, the defendants did not adduce any evidence of any confirmation from Maybank IB that it would have permitted, and would be able to promptly facilitate, an open market sale of the Uzma Shares on its platform once an account had been opened with it by ROS. Thus, I find that the defendants have not established on a balance of probabilities that the Uzma Shares could have been sold on the open market (whether by Maybank IB or Maybank Kim Eng), such that their second and third offers were indeed reasonable offers that the plaintiffs should have accepted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 Before dealing with the defendants’ last argument on mitigation, I make one observation on the pleaded defence. The defendants had pleaded (at para 63 of their Defence) that the plaintiffs would not have suffered any losses if they had accepted the defendants’ proposals, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, for a direct share transfer to Mr Chia.

</div>
</div> This is yet another contradiction in the defendants’ case, given their earlier pleading that such a direct transfer was what necessitated the “complicated structure” leading to the delays in the first place (see [23]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 Lastly, the defendants suggest that the plaintiffs should have mitigated their loss by waiting until February–March 2021 to sell the Uzma Shares (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, when the price of shares in Uzma was on an upward trajectory).

</div>
</div> The defendants cite no authorities to support their somewhat bold proposition that a buyer of shares who received late delivery is under an obligation to mitigate by holding on to the shares until a time when the share prices increase in value. In my view, this is not a reasonable burden to place on the plaintiffs, who had in the first place been put in this position by the defendants’ breach. The defendants’ submission reeks of opportunism. With the benefit of hindsight and historical information (which was available at trial) on how the shares in Uzma performed on Bursa after 29 July 2020 through 2021, the defendants have, in my view, cherry-picked a point in time when the share price of Uzma had risen and now seek to persuade me that the Uzma Shares should have been sold at that point. Taken to its logical conclusion, if the share price in Uzma had instead dropped steadily for years following the defendants’ breach, the defendants would be able to argue that Mr Chia was obliged by law to hold on to the Uzma Shares in the hope that the share price might increase at some indeterminate point in time in the future. In fact, in such a scenario, the defendants might perhaps argue the converse – that Mr Chia failed to sell the shares soon enough. The absurdity that would result in the scenarios described above demonstrates the fallacy in the defendants’ submission, which, as I mentioned above, is also not supported by any authority. I have little hesitation rejecting it. I reiterate that all that the law requires of an innocent party is to take <span class="font-italic">reasonable</span> steps in mitigation. It is not reasonable to require the innocent party to speculate on the market for an indefinite period, at the whim and fancy of the defendant, who then takes all the benefits of the upside and none of the consequences of the downside. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 For the foregoing reasons, I do not find Mr Chia’s conduct subsequent to the receipt of the Uzma Shares on 29 July 2020 to be unreasonable. His evidence was that he sold the Uzma Shares in several batches as and when he needed the money.

</div> In my judgment, he was entitled to do so. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 For the reasons detailed in this judgment, I find and hold that the plaintiffs succeed in their claim against the defendants. The plaintiffs are awarded damages on the basis of the value of the Uzma Shares on 31 December 2019 (the original due date for transfer) and their market value on 29 July 2020 (the actual date of transfer). Whilst the normal measure is to use the market value of the shares on the original due date for performance, the parties have in this case ascribed a specific monetary value to the Uzma Shares in the SPAs. Consequently, I find that it is fair to use that valuation as a starting point to be assessed against the market value of the Uzma Shares on 29 July 2020 – this method of assessment is in line with the plaintiffs’ alternative damages pleading in their Statement of Claim (see [19]). Thus, the plaintiffs are entitled to damages in the sum of S$1,167,204.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 Pursuant to cl 7 of the SPAs, the defendants’ liability is joint and several and each is liable for the performance of the others. Accordingly, judgment is granted for the plaintiffs against the defendants jointly and severally in the sum of S$1,167,204, together with interest thereon at 5.33% per annum from the date of the writ of summons to the date of this judgment. </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 I will hear the parties on costs separately, including on the questions of (a) whether the plaintiffs are entitled to costs from the defendants on a full indemnity basis under cl 8 of the SPAs, and (b) the quantum of costs. </div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">S Mohan<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Loong Tse Chuan, Ong Chin Kiat and Wee Su-Ann (Allen &amp; Gledhill LLP) for the first and second plaintiffs;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Ramachandran Doraisamy Raghunath, Mato Kotwani and Chua Ze Xuan (PDLegal LLC) for the first, second and third defendants.</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right"> </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
