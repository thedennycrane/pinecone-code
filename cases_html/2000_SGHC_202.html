<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Facts</font></p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">On 12 March 1998, the plaintiff was riding

his motor-cycle along Sims Avenue. There was a collision between the motor-cycle and a

motor van driven by the defendant. The plaintiff suffered injuries. He then issued a writ

seeking damages. The defendant did not deny liability. Interlocutory judgment was entered

by consent. Damages were then assessed by in the aggregate amount of $329,788. Out of that

amount, the court below awarded $16,500.42 for pre-trial loss of earnings, $183,600 for

loss of future earnings and $20,000 for loss of earning capacity. The defendant appealed.</font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Held</font></p></b>, varied the amount of damages for

pre-trial and future loss of earnings to a global sum of $120,000 and no award for loss of

earning capacity: 

<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(1) In this case, the loss of earnings was

  in respect of past and prospective earnings and there can be no additional claim for loss

  of earning capacity. The plaintiff in this case was working before the accident and

  returned to work after the accident and the loss of earnings was known and assessable.

  Accordingly, he was not entitled to additional general damages for handicap in the future

  as loss of earning capacity (see  9).</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(2) In view of the medical evidence, there

  was sufficient objective basis to conclude that the plaintiff’s earning capacity, as

  in loss of future earnings, was indeed diminished. The evidence adduced, however, did not

  support a drastic loss of 60% as asserted by the plaintiff. He magnified it to maximize

  his claim for damages. The defendant’s counsel conceded that while the plaintiff

  suffered "a mild disability", it was not, however, so minimal to apply the <i>de

  minimus </i>doctine. The fair and reasonable loss was about 25% (see  11).</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(3) As the plaintiff was only 28 years

  old, the court determined a multiplier of 18 years. This accorded with the current trend

  in relation to a healthy young man (see  12).</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(4) It was contended that as the plaintiff

  was a Malaysian he could not work in Singapore indefinitely. In this regard, the court

  noted that the plaintiff was not an unskilled labourer confined to work at a construction

  site. He had acquired a specialised skill for which there would always be a need in

  Singapore. Additionally, his employer could not find an equally skilled replacement during

  his absence. The probabilities were that Singapore would hold out a job for him (see 

  13).</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(5) Based on the objective income tax

  returns of the plaintiff, the court accepted the plaintiff's income as $2,100 per month.

  In keeping with an estimate of 25% loss of ability, the court decided on an estimated

  monthly loss of $500. That was the amount the court used in calculating his past and

  future loss of earnings after he returned to work. The court was of the view that that was

  the most reasonable basis in the special circumstances of this case. Based on 22 months of

  pre-assessment loss of earnings at $500 per month amounting to $11,000 and prospective

  loss of earnings at $500 per month x 18 years x 12 months amounting to $108,000, the court

  arrived at a total of $119,000. This figure was then rounded off to $120,000 (see 

  14-15).</font></p>

<u xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The law</font></p></i></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">6.

        First, the legal principles. A finding on

damages differs from an ordinary finding of fact in that it is generally much more a

matter of speculation and estimate. This statement is true in respect of some cases than

of others. Assessment of general damages, in cases like breach of contract for the sale of

goods, for instance, is largely an objective exercise. Findings in such cases differ

little from any other finding of fact. Assessment of damages for pain and suffering or

wrongs such as slander are almost entirely matter of impression and of common sense. See <i><b>Davis

v Powell Duffryn Associated Collieries Ltd</b></i> [1942] AC 601 at 624.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">7.

        An appellate court is not justified in

substituting a figure of its own for that awarded below because it would have awarded

something different if it had tried the case. An appellate court will intervene only when

the Judge, in assessing the damages, applied a wrong principle of law; or, short of this,

the amount awarded is either so inordinately low or so inordinately high that it must be a

wholly erroneous estimate of the damage. <i><b>See Flint v Lovell</b></i>, [1935] 1 KB

354, <i><b>Davis v Powell</b></i>. This rule, however, does not apply to an appeal from

the Registrar to the Judge-in-Chambers. See <i><b>Chang</b></i> <i><b>Ah Lek v Lim Ah Koon</b></i>
<a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=47217&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1999] 1 SLR 82</a>. It settled the law that an assessment of damages which comes on appeal to

a Judge-in-Chambers is quite unlike an appeal from a trial judge to the Court of Appeal.

The restrictions that bind the Court of Appeal do not limit function of the Judge. The

Judge addresses the issues before him and assesses the damages <i>de novo</i>. He makes

his own findings based, however, on the evidential material written and collected by the

Registrar and the findings made by him. This is why the Court below is not required to

give reasons for its decision; and the appellant is not required to state the grounds of

appeal enumerating the errors of the Court below. Additionally points not canvassed before

the Registrar may be presented before the Judge. Nonetheless, his decision must be

judicial. Unlike the Registrar, the Judge must write his reasons if his decision is

appealed. Even so, the Judge-in-Chambers ought not unnecessarily embark on an exercise of

tinkering with the decision of the Court below with the view of fine tuning the decision.

That would demolish the important function of the Court below. </font></p>
<u xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Loss of earnings</font></p></i></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">8.

        In the case of non-fatal injury cases the

injured is entitled to recover both past and prospective earnings. The date of trial or

assessment provide the dividing line. This bifurcation is important because the multiplier

is determined from the date of trial or assessment without any deduction for the time

before the trial long though it might be. See <i><b>Pritchard v Cobden</b></i> [1987] 2 WLR 627. In that case Pritchard suffered brain damage in 1976. He became unable to work

because of the injury. The assessment of damages was done at the trial in 1986. Swinton

Thomas J took a multiplier of 14 from the date of trial and applied a multiplicand of

9,000 per annum. The total loss of earnings, past and prospective, amounted to

126,000. He rejected a submission that the multiplier should be reduced by the time

elapsed since the accident. The Court of Appeal affirmed his decision. That decision

settled the law that : damages for loss of earnings of a living plaintiff should continue

to be assessed as special damages for the earnings lost between the date of the accident

and the date of assessment. Calculation of the future loss of earnings is computed from

the date of assessment by selecting an adequate multiplier for the multiplicand to

compensate for the likely loss of earnings for the remainder of his working life.</font></p>
<u xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Discriminating loss of earnings and loss

of earning capacity</font></p></i></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">9.(i)

        The expressions "loss of earnings"

and "loss of earning capacity" are often confused. Sometimes they are user

tautologically. In this sense they encompass past and future loss of ascertainable

earnings. The loss may be total or partial. In either case the loss is attributable to

loss or reduction in earning ability. A claim for damages under this head are relatively

easy to assess because the numbers that work the established formula are readily

available.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">(ii)

        There is another sense to the expression

"loss of earning capacity". This arises when the claimant returns to work

without any immediate loss of earning. There is, however, the risk that in the future he

may be at a disadvantage due to a lingering disability by reason of the injury in getting

another job if he loses the present job. Alternatively he may suffer a pay-cut in the

future on account of the disability. This is sometimes referred to as handicap in the

labour market. In this sense the expression is a term of art. To justify an award under

this head there must be a substantial or real risk that the plaintiff would lose his

present employment during his working life. If there was such a risk the assessment of

damages would depend on the degree of the risk, the time when the loss of employment might

occur and the factors affecting the plaintiff’s chances of obtaining other

employment. See <i><b>Moeliker v Reyrolle &amp; Co Ltd</b></i> [1977] 1 WLR 132. <i><b>Low

Swee Tong v Liew Machinery (Pte) Ltd</b></i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=7375&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1993] 3 SLR 89</a> and <i><b>Teo Sing Keng v Sim

Ban Kiat</b></i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=8085&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1994] 1 SLR 634</a>. A claim under this head is hugely speculative and

difficult to assess. Except when clear evidence is adduced a large amount will not be

given under this category. In any event, a claim under this head cannot arise where the

injured was working before the accident and suffered a permanent total or partial loss of

earnings. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">(iii)

        The two heads are alternative and not

cumulative. In the case before me, as the loss of earnings was in respect of past and

prospective earnings there can be no additional claim for loss of earning capacity in the

second sense of the term. The plaintiff in this case was working before the accident and

returned to work after the accident and the loss of earnings was known and assessable.

Accordingly he was not entitled to additional general damages for handicap in the future

as loss of earning capacity in the second sense of the expression.</font></p>
<u xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The facts</font></p></i></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">10.(i)

        The claim for loss of earnings due to reduction

in earning capacity was based on the following evidential material.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">(ii)

        Dr Karen Chua of Tan Tock Seng Hospital in a

medical report dated 21 May 1999 said that : It is likely that subsequent improvement will

be slow and the likely estimated percentage awarded for permanent disability is 20%

(twenty) percent for his residual high level cognitive impairment. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">(iii)

        Dr Kanwaljit Soin, Orthopaedic Surgeon, an

acknowledged expert in her field, said in a report dated 16 July 1999 on the plaintiff :

The patient is a mechanic but as a result of the injuries sustained from the accident,

especially the fracture of the clavicle, <i>he is unable to carry heavy objects</i>. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">(iv)

        The plaintiff’s own assertion on the

matter was : "After the accident, I could no longer carry or handle heavy objections.

The scope of my work is thus restricted. I also take more time to plan and figure out how

to produce more complicated items. Due to the weakness in my limbs, my speed of work also

slowed down. I became less productive and my employer reduced by pay to $850 with effect

from November 1998. Further, after the accident, I could not work the long hours I used

to. I have been advised by Dr Karen Chua to take more rest and not to strain myself. I

feel very tired after usual working hours and o longer have the stamina to work long

hours. I therefore go home after working hours and rest on Sunday."</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">(v)

        The plaintiff’s employer’s evidence

on the loss of earnings aspect of the case was this :</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">However, after the road accident on

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Since the accident, the plaintiff could

  not lift nor handle heavy objects any more. His scope of work is therefore also restricted

  as compared to the scope of work he could do before the said accident happened. Further,

  since the accident, his speed of work also slowed down thus becoming less productive. As

  Cheong Hup Engineering Services is making slim profits and profits are dependant on the

  number of items produced, I have no choice but to reduce his basic pay to commensurate his

  scope of work and productivity. Thus, from November 1998, his pay was reduced to

  $850.000."</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The findings : Loss of earning capacity</font></p></i></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">11.

        Tan Wen Shan AR who saw the witnesses being

cross-examined appears to have accepted the evidence of the plaintiff and his employer. In

my view the evidence given by them was subjective and should be subjected to scrutiny. In

view of the medical evidence and particularly that of Dr Kanwaljit Soin there was

sufficient objective basis to conclude that the plaintiff’s earning capacity in the

first sense was indeed diminished. The evidence adduced, however, did not support a

drastic loss of 60% ($850 over $2100) as asserted by the plaintiff. He magnified it to

maximize his claim for damages. It was a case of a plaintiff psychologically opting out of

hard work in the hope of recovering his perceived loss of earnings from the defendant who

in fact was an insurance company . The defendant’s counsel conceded that what the

plaintiff suffered "a mild disability". It was not, however, so minimal to apply

the <i>de minimus </i>doctine. The fair and reasonable loss was about 25%.</font></p>
<u xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The multiplier</font></p></i></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">12.

        I now turn to the multiplier. As I have already

stated this is ascertained from the date of the trial. In this case it was the date of

assessment. As I heard the matter <i>de novo</i> the starting point for future loss was

the date of my decision. It is to be borne in mind that the time that elapsed from the

date of accident to the date of my decision was not too long for the defendant to grouse

about. As the plaintiff was only 28 years old I determined a multiplier of 18 years. This

accorded with the current trend in relation to a healthy young man.</font></p>
<u xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The Malaysian factor</font></p></i></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">13.

        It was contended that as the plaintiff was a

Malaysian he could not work in Singapore indefinitely. When considering this matter I

noted that the plaintiff was not an unskilled labourer confined to work at a construction

site. He had acquired a specialised skill for which there would always be a need in

Singapore. Additionally, his employer could not find an equally skilled replacement during

his absence. The probabilities were that Singapore would hold out a job for him. In this

regard I shared the view of Judith Prakash J in <i><b>Wee Sia Tian v Long Thik Boon</b></i>
<a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=10412&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1996] 3 SLR 513</a> where she took judicial notice of the fact that a Malaysian construction

worker in Singapore would continue to work here for a good length of time. A skilled

worker has a better future than a construction worker in Singapore.</font></p>
<u xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The multiplicand</font></p></i></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">14.

        Finally, the multiplicand. The plaintiff’s

case was that before the accident he earned an average of $2,100 per month. This was

supported by Inland Revenue Authority document for the Year of Assessment 1998. His

earnings for the whole year 1997 was $21,629.65. This amount had two components : First

half : $8,988.40. Second half : $12,640.60. The average monthly income for the period July

to December, therefore, was $2,106.77 ($12,640.60  6). This was independent and

uncontroverted evidence. In view of this it was very probable and reasonable that his

monthly earning at the time of accident was $2,100. This was number applied to calculate

the earnings before the plaintiff returned to work on 7 August 1998. The plaintiff’s

employer was not a large organisation with an accounting staff. It was not surprising that

there was not much documentation evidencing all the moneys his employer paid him. For this

reason, the tax return was adequate proof of the plaintiff’s earning before the

accident. For the future the plaintiff’s earnings, if anything, would only go up in

the ordinary nature of things. The plaintiff contended for a loss of $1,250 per month. For

reasons already stated this could not be sustained on an objective basis. In keeping with

an estimate of 25% loss of ability I decided on an estimated monthly loss of $500. That

was the amount I used in calculating his past and future loss of earnings after he

returned to work. That was the most reasonable basis in the special circumstances of this

case.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">15.

        Those numbers gave these amounts :</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Pre-assessment loss of <br/>

  Earnings from 7.8.98 to<br/>

  26.5.2000 (22 months)        $ 11,500.00</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Prospective loss of<br/>

  earnings 18 x 12 x $500      <u>$108,000.00</u><br/>

  Total :

                                  

  <u>$119,000.00 </u></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">16.

        As the assessment of past and future earnings

or loss of earning capacity in the first sense of that expression involved estimates I

rounded the aggregate amount to $120,000. It was a global approach to derive a just

result.</font></p>
