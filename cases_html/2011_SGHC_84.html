<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is a dispute over the balance sum of money
                    that should be paid by Loo Look Yin (m.w.) (the “petitioner”) to
                    Kok Kum Yue @ Koh Kum Yue (the “respondent”) for the purchase of
                    the respondent’s half-share interest in the matrimonial property at No 6
                    Lucky Crescent Singapore (the “property”) under the terms of an
                    “Irrevocable Deed of Understanding” (the “Deed”)
                    entered into some 25 years ago on 30 May 1986 between the petitioner and
                    the respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The petitioner and the respondent were married
                    on 21 August 1979. However, in April 1981, the respondent left Singapore to
                    reside in Hong Kong and the parties started living apart ever since. On
                    12 April 1989, the divorce petition was filed. The decree nisi was granted
                    on 15 November 1990 on the basis that the marriage had irretrievably broken
                    down in that the parties had lived apart for a continuous period of at least
                    four years immediately preceding the presentation of the petition. On
                    10 April 1995, the decree nisi was ordered to be made absolute. The
                    ancillary matters were adjourned to be heard in chambers on a subsequent date to
                    be fixed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       According to the petitioner, she had consented
                    to the respondent’s solicitors’ application for the decree nisi to
                    be made absolute prior to the resolution of the ancillary matters because she
                    and the respondent had already signed the Deed to transfer the property to her,
                    upon her undertaking to pay the respondent $200,000 in the following
                    manner:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">$100,000 immediately upon execution of the legal
                            transfer document by the respondent; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">$100,000 when she sold the property, provided
                            that the sale price was not below $400,000. If it was, then she would
                            have to pay the respondent $50,000 instead.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       On 29 May 1986, she transferred $100,000 to
                    the respondent’s bank account. At the request of the respondent, she
                    transferred a further sum of $20,000 to the respondent on 6 August 1987 by
                    way of a telegraphic transfer to the respondent’s bank account in Hong
                    Kong. The net sum received by the respondent was $19,960 as $40 was deducted on
                    account of the bank’s charges. The respondent acknowledged receipt of the
                    two payments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       In view of the duly executed Deed and the
                    respondent’s acceptance of her monies, the petitioner did not pursue other
                    ancillary matters such as maintenance, save and except for the final disposal of
                    the property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The petitioner wants to sell the property now
                    and pay the respondent his balance share of $80,000. Accordingly, the petitioner
                    applied to restore the petition for hearing on the ancillary matters and for an
                    order, <em>inter alia</em>, that the property be sold in
                    the open market with the proceeds apportioned as follows:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">To pay all expenses arising from the sale,
                            including the payment of agent’s commission, stamp duties and
                            other costs and expenses of the sale;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">To refund the respondent the sum of $80,000 being
                            his balance share to the property as agreed by both parties;
                        and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The net proceeds, less (a) and (b) above, be
                            given to the petitioner.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       I ordered the petitioner to pay the balance sum
                    of $80,040 to the respondent, and further ordered the sale to be completed
                    within four months of the date of my order. The petitioner would be entitled to
                    all the net proceeds of the sale of the property. It would be up to the
                    petitioner whether or not to pay the $80,040 to the respondent from the net
                    proceeds of the sale. I made no order as to costs. As the respondent has
                    appealed, I now set out my reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The respondent’s position</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Sometime in May 1986, the respondent requested
                    for the property to be sold so that he could get his half-share of the property.
                    As the petitioner did not want to sell the property, she offered to pay for his
                    half-share of the property in two staggered payments. The Deed was to reflect
                    that arrangement. At the time the Deed was signed, the value of the property was
                    about $400,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The respondent’s understanding was that
                    the property would be sold soon after the Deed was signed. Basically, he never
                    agreed to have the sale proceeds apportioned in accordance to the value of the
                    property in 1986 as that was not fair. The sale proceeds should now be divided
                    equally between the parties based on the present market value. The amount that
                    he should receive would then be half the actual sale proceeds of the property
                    less the total amount ($119,960) that he had received from the
                    petitioner.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     According to the respondent, the petitioner
                    had not contributed any monies towards the purchase or upkeep of the property.
                    However, he was prepared to abide by what was agreed in the Deed, <em>ie</em>, to have equal division but that the apportionment of
                    the sale proceeds must be based on the present market value.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Counsel for the respondent contended that even
                    though the Deed was silent on when the property was to be sold, it was implied
                    in the Deed that the property should be sold within a reasonable
                time.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The petitioner’s position</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The petitioner stated that there was no
                    deadline for her to sell the matrimonial property. She denied that there was any
                    understanding that the property would be sold soon after the Deed was
                    signed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     She said that the respondent was a person of
                    means. She alleged that at the time of divorce, he had seven units in the same
                    condominium in Taiwan which were each worth more than $1m then, and a piece of
                    land in Gold Coast, Australia. He also purchased a flat in Hong Kong for $1
                    million. These were the only assets disclosed to her during the marriage. There
                    could be more.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     As a result of the Deed that was signed, she
                    had, at the time of the divorce, waived all her rights to maintenance. She had
                    not asked for any maintenance from the respondent for the past 20 years since
                    the divorce. She had also not laid any claim to a share of the
                    respondent’s Central Provident Fund balances, monies in his saving
                    accounts, insurance policies and “properties, movable or immovable
                    whether in Singapore, Malaysia or elsewhere” in reliance on the belief
                    that the Deed would be irrevocable and binding on both parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     She was a homemaker and had been residing in
                    the property for the last 29 years, maintaining it and holding on to it until
                    she is now 62 years old. She has no other property to her name in Singapore and
                    has minimal savings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     She maintained that she had directly
                    contributed to the purchase of the property in question, having made payments
                    towards its purchase price amounting to $66,000. Supporting copies of receipts
                    from Messrs Lim Kiap Khee &amp; Co reflecting her payments were exhibited in her
                    affidavit.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The respondent’s response</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The respondent responded that she was already
                    financially provided for. Her brother and the Respondent took all the monies,
                    jewelleries and gold bars which were in the property, worth at least $1 million
                    then, and brought them to Malaysia. He said that the petitioner owned properties
                    in Ipoh, namely a terrace house at 26 Jalan Tukuko Ipoh Gardens, Ipoh, Malaysia
                    and a bungalow at either 10 or 12 Bintang Park Sunrise Garden, Ipoh,
                    Malaysia.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     He maintained that the monies that she
                    allegedly paid for the property came from him although the receipts were under
                    her name, as she had no source of income at that time. He denied owning any of
                    the overseas properties mentioned by the petitioner.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">My decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     I have set out the respective positions of the
                    parties above to show (a) that each party had his or her own reasons for
                    entering into the Deed with the terms as stated below; and (b) how and why the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Based on the background facts, I concluded
                    that the parties had signed the Deed in contemplation of divorce and the ensuing
                    division of matrimonial assets that would naturally follow as a matter of course
                    once the divorce was granted by the court. As could be seen, the parties were
                    separated and living apart well before the date the Deed was entered into. As at
                    the date of the Deed, the respondent had left the petitioner and migrated to
                    Hong Kong whilst she remained in Singapore, staying in the property which was
                    the only place available for her to stay in. She needed a permanent roof over
                    her head. That was the reason why there was no deadline set in the Deed for the
                    petitioner to sell the property and for the respondent to be paid the second
                    tranche of $100,000 (which was to be within ten days of the receipt of the sale
                    proceeds by the petitioner, and only in the event of a sale). In fact, the Deed
                    made it explicit at paragraph (2)(b) that she had the absolute discretion to
                    decide if and when the property was to be sold. This was repeated twice at
                    another paragraph (2) in the Deed (as italicised in the Deed for emphasis).
                    Therefore, there could be no understanding as alleged by the respondent
                    “that the property would be sold soon after the deed was
                    signed.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     It would have been obvious to the respondent
                    at the time the Deed was executed that the respondent was not going to sell the
                    property soon after signing the Deed as she had nowhere else to stay. In my
                    view, the property must have been intended for her long-term use, and the second
                    payment of $100,000 was to be made (as spelt out in the Deed) only at the time
                    she no longer needed to stay in the property and was prepared to sell it, though
                    it may be years later. I could see no other way of interpreting the terms of the
                    Deed. She had performed her part of the Deed by first paying $100,000 at the
                    time of execution of the Deed in 1986 and then at his request, a second sum of
                    $20,000 in 1987, which were very substantial sums of money in those days. The
                    fact that the respondent had never taken any action for the past 25 years to
                    compel the petitioner to sell the property showed that even he himself could not
                    have honestly believed that under the terms of the Deed, the property must be
                    sold soon after (or reasonably soon after) the Deed was signed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     To show that the respondent did not deserve
                    any sympathy, the petitioner’s counsel submitted that the respondent could
                    have used the money paid to him in 1986/1987 (amounting to $119,960) to buy
                    another property in 1987 in Singapore if he so wished. In those days, property
                    prices were much lower. If the respondent failed to invest the money he received
                    as part-payment by the petitioner to purchase his half-share in the property, it
                    would be inequitable for him now to ask essentially for a hefty upwards revision
                    of the consideration for his half-share, when at the time the respondent
                    disposed of his interest in the property (in 1986), the valuation of the
                    property was about $400,000 (as acknowledged by the respondent himself), and his
                    half-share was therefore not incorrectly priced at $200,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In my view, the terms of the Deed could not
                    have been clearer and I could understand why the terms were structured in that
                    way having regard to the state of affairs between the parties at that time. I
                    had to give effect to the Deed, which undoubtedly reflected the way in which
                    they had agreed to divide their matrimonial assets (taking into consideration
                    the need to provide for maintenance) in order to avoid difficulties with the
                    ancillary matters later on.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     However, the respondent is now trying to vary
                    the terms of the Deed unilaterally by substituting the purchase consideration of
                    $200,000 in 1986 for his half-share in the property (based on a 1986 valuation
                    of $400,000 for the property) with a new price based on 50% of the present
                    market value of the property. In principle, I do not think I should allow him to
                    do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Not only were the terms of the Deed
                    unambiguous, the respondent had also made clear his own understanding of the
                    Deed in his acknowledgment of receipt (set out below) that the first payment of
                    $100,000 to him was part consideration towards the purchase price of $200,000 in
                    respect of his sale to her of his half-share interest in the property:</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Witness: (Sgd: PREM SINGH, Advocate &amp; Solicitor)</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Sometime on 31 July 1987, the respondent
                    requested the petitioner in writing to remit $20,000 to his bank account in Hong
                    Kong on or before 4 August 1987. In this request, the respondent reaffirmed his
                    understanding of the Deed by stating unambiguously that the amount of $20,000
                    was “<em>part payment of the balance of S$100,000 due on
                        the property</em>” and that this amount was to be deducted at
                    the time of “<em>sale of the said
                    property</em>”. Again his understanding was consistent with the
                    terms of the Deed. There was no mistake as to the meaning of paragraph (2)(b) of
                    the Deed. Out of goodwill, the petitioner promptly complied with the
                    respondent’s request and made a telegraphic transfer of the money on 6
                    August 1987 (although strictly under the terms of the Deed she need not do so as
                    she had not sold the property and the balance of $100,000 was not due and
                    payable).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     As I see it, with property prices in Singapore
                    having risen drastically since the date of the Deed, the respondent obviously
                    felt short-changed after having the benefit of hindsight. He wanted the court to
                    rescue him from a bad bargain of having earlier disposed of his half-share in
                    the property to his then-wife at a fixed sum of $200,000 in 1986 for which he
                    had already received part payment of $119,960 in 1986/1987 amounting to some 60%
                    of the agreed sum, with the balance of 40% to be paid only if and when she
                    decided to sell the said property, which in my view could only have meant that
                    the petitioner was given an absolute discretion under the Deed to decide when
                    the property was to be sold. To allow any apportionment of the sale proceeds
                    that would give a different result from that stipulated in the Deed would be to
