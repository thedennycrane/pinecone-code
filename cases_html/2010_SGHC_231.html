<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an application by the plaintiff to
                    revoke Subpoena No. 600018 of 2010 dated 16 July 2010(“the
                    Subpoena”) issued against the plaintiff’s employee, Mr [XY].
                    As there does not appear to be any locally reported authorities dealing with the
                    law of subpoenas issued in support of arbitration proceedings, I was of the view
                    that it would be useful if I released my grounds on this matter. The application
                    was heard before me on 6 August 2010 but as the first tranche of the
                    arbitration hearing has been scheduled to begin on 16 August 2010, these
                    grounds were written and made available to parties on an urgent basis. This case
                    raises interesting issues on the interplay between competing evidentiary
                    considerations and the role of the court in arbitration
                proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The factual matrix can be stated within a
                    reasonably brief compass.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The plaintiff is a statutory body while the
                    defendant is a Singapore company carrying on the business of <em>inter alia</em>, mixed construction activities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       On or about 1 October 2004, the parties
                    entered into a contract under which the plaintiff engaged the defendant as the
                    main contractor for a particular project (“the Contract”).
                    Disputes arose subsequently between the parties under the
                Contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Clause 71 of the Conditions of Contract
                    provides for the resolution of disputes to be determined by an arbitrator in
                    accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the Singapore International Arbitration
                    Centre. On or around 19 March 2009, the defendant commenced arbitration
                    proceedings (“the Arbitration”) against the plaintiff by issuing a
                    Notice of Arbitration. A sole arbitrator (“the Arbitrator”) was
                    appointed in the case. On or around 19 June 2009, the defendant submitted
                    its Statement of Case and on or around 29 July 2009, the plaintiff
                    submitted its Statement of Defence and Counterclaim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Following two procedural hearings on
                    18 August 2009 and 20 April 2010, the procedure for the Arbitration
                    was decided on with directions made by the Arbitrator, with the consent of both
                    parties. These directions were set out in Procedural Order
                        No. 1<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>. Paragraph 4.1(a) of Procedural Order
                    No. 1 further states that the parties and the Arbitrator shall use
                        <em>inter alia</em>, the International Bar Association
                    (“IBA”) Rules on the Taking of Evidence in International
                    Commercial Arbitration (1 June 1999 Edition)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>(“IBA
                    Rules”) as a guideline on procedural matters. The Procedural Order
                    provides that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    The parties were to provide to the other all
                            documents on which they rely to support their respective cases by
                            16 December 2009,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    If either party was not satisfied with the
                            discovery provided by the other party, the dissatisfied party could
                            submit to the Arbitrator, by 18 February 2010, a Request to Produce
                            Documents to obtain additional discovery from the other
                        party.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       On 16 December 2009, the parties exchanged
                    discovery. Both parties subsequently submitted Requests to Produce Documents to
                    the other. After a contested hearing before the Arbitrator on 20 April
                    2010, the Arbitrator ordered both the plaintiff and the defendant to provide
                    further discovery (“the Discovery Order”)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       On 21 May 2010, 4 June 2010 and
                    6 July 2010, the plaintiff complied with the Discovery Order and submitted
                    the Third, Fourth and Fifth Supplemental List of Documents respectively.
                    However, the defendant was dissatisfied with the disclosure produced by the
                    plaintiff and wrote to the Arbitrator in a lengthy 82-page letter on 7 June
                        2010<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>, questioning the adequacy of the
                    plaintiff’s disclosure in compliance with the Discovery Order. The
                    defendant implored the Arbitrator to direct the plaintiff to procure sworn
                    statements from <em>inter alia</em>, Mr [[XY]]. On
                    10 June 2010, the plaintiff’s solicitors responded to the
                    defendant’s request, declining to do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On 11 June 2010, the Arbitrator rejected
                    the defendant’s request stating in plain terms:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I do not consider it appropriate to require sworn testimony regarding
                        these issues. Should it later emerge that the [plaintiff] has failed to
                        comply with my order, I will entertain submissions regarding the
                        consequences of such non compliance, including submissions that it would be
                        appropriate to draw adverse inferences in the circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     No further application was made by the
                    defendant to the Arbitrator in respect of the adequacy of the plaintiff’s
                    disclosure.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Subpoena</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     More than a month after the Arbitrator’s
                    ruling on the defendant’s request for sworn testimony in relation to the
                    adequacy of the plaintiff’s disclosure, the defendant submitted a request
                    to this Court for the issuance of the Subpoena against Mr [XY] on
                    16 July 2010. The Subpoena requires Mr [XY] to attend the arbitration
                    hearing from 16 to 27 August 2010 to give evidence on matters relating to
                    the <em>adequacy</em> of the plaintiff’s disclosure.
                    The basis of the Subpoena is that Mr [XY] was named in an order for
                    specific discovery made against the plaintiff. I should point out at this
                    juncture that first, no evidence has been sought by the defendant from
                    Mr [XY] in respect of the substantive issues in dispute between the
                    parties; and second, the evidence sought from Mr [XY] was the subject of
                    the defendant’s request to the Arbitrator in their letter of 7 June
                    2010, which the Arbitrator has responded to and flatly denied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     On 22 July 2010, the plaintiff filed an
                    urgent application, <em>viz</em>, Originating Summons
                    No 747 of 2010 to set aside the Subpoena.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Law on Subpoenas </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Order 38, rule 14 of the Rules of
                    Court (Cap 332, r 5, 2006 Rev Ed) states that:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(1)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">A subpoena must be in Form 67, 68 or 69,
                            whichever is appropriate.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(2)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Issue of a subpoena takes place upon its being
                            sealed by an officer of the Registry.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(3)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Before a subpoena is issued, a Request in Form 70
                            for the issue of the subpoena must be filed in the Registry; and the
                            Request must contain the name and address of the party issuing the
                            subpoena, if he is acting in person, or the name of the firm and
                            business address of that party’s solicitor.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(4)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The Registrar may, in any case, revoke a subpoena
                            upon application by any person or on his own motion.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(5)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Any party who is dissatisfied with any decision
                            of the Registrar made under this Rule may apply to a Judge of the High
                            Court or a District Judge, as the case may be, for a review of that
                            decision.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(6)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">An application under this Rule shall be made by
                            summons supported by an affidavit, within 14 days of that
                            decision.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     A few preliminary comments on the issuance of
                    a subpoena bear mention. The issuance of a subpoena takes place upon the
                        <em>administrative</em> act of the subpoena being
                    sealed by an officer of the Registry (O 38 r 14(2)). Personal service
                    of the subpoena is necessary (O 38 r 18(1)) though substituted service
                    may be ordered. The subpoena must be served within 12 weeks of its issue and
                    within a reasonable time before the attendance of the witness is
                    required.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Two separate legal regimes govern the conduct
                    of arbitration in Singapore. Where the <em>situs</em> of
                    arbitration is Singapore, the Arbitration Act (Cap 10, 2002 Rev Ed)
                    (“the Arbitration Act”) or the International Arbitration Act
                    (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed) will regulate the conduct of the arbitral
                    proceedings. It was undisputed between both parties that this was a domestic
                    arbitration for which they had agreed under Clause 72 of the Conditions of
                    Contract that the provisions of the Arbitration Act would apply. Pursuant to
                    Section 30 of the Arbitration Act, subpoenas may be issued to compel the
                    attendance of a witness before an arbitral tribunal:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(1)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Any party to an arbitration agreement may take
                            out a subpoena to testify or a subpoena to produce
                        documents.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(2)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The Court may order that a subpoena to testify or
                            a subpoena to produce documents shall be issued to compel the attendance
                            before an arbitral tribunal of a witness wherever he may be within
                            Singapore.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(3)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The Court may also issue an order under section
                            38 of the Prisons Act (Cap 247) to bring up a prisoner for
                            examination before an arbitral tribunal.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(4)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">No person shall be compelled under any such
                            subpoena to produce any document which he could not be compelled to
                            produce on the trial of an action.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     This provides the arbitral tribunal with the
                    High Court’s supportive powers so as to facilitate the arbitral
                    proceedings. Order 69 rule 12 of the Rules of Court further makes it
                    clear that the procedure for issuance of a subpoena in support of arbitration
                    proceedings is governed by Order 38, rules 14 to 23 of the Rules of
                    Court:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Order 38, Rules 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 and 23 shall
                        apply, with the necessary modifications, in relation to the issue of a
                        subpoena under section 30 of the [Arbitration] Act as they apply in
                        relation to proceedings in the Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Parenthetically, the term
                    ‘subpoena’ is derived from the Middle English <em>suppena</em> and the Latin phrase <em>sub
                        poena</em> meaning “under penalty”. Though the issuance
                    of a subpoena may appear to be administrative in nature, the subpoena process
                        <em>per se</em> is not to be regarded lightly as it is
                    the mechanism by which witnesses are made to attend a trial for the purposes of
                    giving evidence (<em>subpoena ad testificandum</em>) and/or
                    producing documents (<em>subpoena duces tecum</em>), which
                    could inevitably lend a very different complexion to either party’s case.
                    The coercive force of its power derives from the very consequences of
                    non-compliance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Since the advent of the Rules of Court in
                    1996, the rules have expressly empowered the court to revoke a subpoena on its
                    own motion or on the application of any other person. It should be pointed out
                    that while there may conceivably be numerous objections to the subpoena of a
                    witness, the cases in this area can be broadly subsumed under two categories:
                        <em>width</em> and <em>improper
                        purpose</em>. Turning to the first category of <em>width</em>, a possible objection to a subpoena is that it is too wide
                    if it imposes an unduly onerous obligation upon a person to collect and produce
                    documents which have little or no relevance to the proceedings at hand:
                        <em>Commissioner for Railways v Small</em> (1938)
                    38 SR NSW) 564(“<em>Commissioner for Railways v
                        Small</em>”). A subpoena may be regarded as too wide if
                    compliance with its wording would be oppressive: <em>Senior v
                        Holdsworth</em> [1976] QB 23. Where a subpoena is directed to a
                    non-party, it can be set aside if it is insufficiently precise and requires the
                    non-party to make a judgment as to which documents relate to the issues between
                    the parties: <em>National Employers Mutual General Association
                        Ltd v Waind &amp; Hill</em> [1978] 1 NSWLR 377.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     On the other hand, the more common form of
                    objection to a subpoena is that it constitutes an <em>abuse of
                        process</em> or where the subpoena has been issued for a collateral
                    purpose such as where it seeks to obtain discovery or further discovery against
                    a party: <em>Finnie v Dalglish</em> [1982] 1 NSWLR
                    400. Other categories of improper purposes include the following: where a
                    subpoena seeks to obtain discovery against a non-party or is used for the
                    purposes of a fishing expedition<em>: Commissioner for Railways v
                        Small;</em> where to require the attendance of a witness would be
                    oppressive: <em>Raymond v Tapson</em> (1882) LR 22
                    ChD 430 and <em>Senior v Holdsworth</em>, <em>ex parte Independent Television News</em> [1976] QB 23;
                    where it is not issued for the purpose of obtaining relevant evidence and the
                    person to whom it was addressed is unable to give relevant evidence: <em>R v Baines</em> [1909] 1 KB 258 or where there is an
                    alternative statutory procedure for the production of documents: <em>R v Hurle-Hobbs, ex parte Simmons</em> [1945] 1 KB 165.
                    As Professor Jeffrey Pinsler, SC observes in <em>Singapore Court
                        Practice 2009</em>(LexisNexis, 2009) at para 38/14-16/8:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As a matter of general practice, the courts have only questioned
                            the propriety of a subpoena on the basis of abuse of process. Although
                            the court has always had the inherent power to set aside a subpoena in
                            these circumstances, the exercise of this jurisdiction, which often
                            depended on whether the opposing party challenged the subpoena, has been
                            rare. As the court has an unfettered discretion in the matter, it is
                            likely to exercise greater scrutiny over the use    of the
                            subpoena process. <em>It may take a broader view of what
                                constitutes misuse of the subpoena process so that the power of
                                revocation will not only be exercised where the process has been
                                used for an ulterior purpose, but where the proposed witness is not
                                in a position to offer any, or any significant, evidence in the
                                case</em>…The improper use of the subpoena
                            process…would incur unnecessary costs, unjustifiably involve the
                            use of additional trial time, and require of the witness an unwarranted
                            sacrifice of his time and commitment to the case. In this respect, there
                            is authority to the effect that the court may set aside a subpoena if a
                            witness would be oppressed as a result of giving the evidence
                            required.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The threshold for satisfying the court that
                    its discretion should be invoked in favour of setting aside a subpoena is
                    therefore, not an easily surmountable one. In <em>Ong Jane
                        Rebecca v Lim Lie Hoa and Ors</em> [2003] 1 SLR
                        457(“<em>Ong Jane Rebecca</em>”), the
                    High Court considered an application to set aside a <em>subpoena
                        ad testifcandum</em> and a <em>subpoena duces
                        tecum</em> which had been served on a partner of an accounting firm in
                    charge of the firm’s work in compiling an account of all the assets in an
                    estate. The subpoenas were issued in the context of an inquiry into the estate.
                    The partner applied to set aside the subpoenas on the basis that it was not
                    necessary for disposing of the cause or matter or for saving costs and asserted
                    that he was no longer in charge of the manner and the file had been transferred
                    to another accounting firm. As a result, he did not have any relevant documents.
                    Declining to set aside the subpoenas, Choo Han Teck JC (as his Honour then
                    was) opined that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The subpoena should obviously not be used frivolously or in a scandalous
                        manner, that is to say, to cause to be issued indiscriminately without any
                        basis or reason so as to embarrass or inconvenience the person subpoenaed.
                        Such occasions have been extremely rare, in my experience…The
                        ultimate value of the witness is not the gauge to determine whether he ought
                        to be subpoenaed...the subpoenas were not unreasonably issued. It is open to
                        [the applicant] to testify when called, that he has no further or other
                        documents in his possession, and be cross-examined on his testimony. These
                        are all matters rightfully in the domain of the judge at the substantive
                        hearing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Moving swiftly to consider a more recent case
                    in this area, in <em>Basil Anthony Herman v Premier Security
                        Co-operative Ltd and Ors</em> [2010] SGCA 15(“<em>Basil</em>”), five witnesses refused to produce
                    relevant documents and/or swear or affirm affidavits. The appellant subpoenaed
                    all five witnesses but on the first day of trial, the respondents sought to set
                    aside the subpoenas on the basis that they were irrelevant, oppressive and/or an
                    abuse of process. The trial judge found that no satisfactory reason could be
                    given to justify the issuance of subpoenas and ordered that it be set aside. On
                    appeal, the Court of Appeal held that the subpoenas ought not to have been set
                    aside and ordered a new trial on the basis that the evidence of the five
                    witnesses had been improperly rejected and the improperly rejected evidence
                    would, if admitted, have a substantial and realistic prospect of making a
                    meaningful difference to the outcome of the case. Delivering the judgment of the
                    Court of Appeal, V K Rajah JA emphatically stated (at [24] to
                    [26]):</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-Heading1">The right of a litigant to bring relevant
                        evidence before the court</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">24    At
                            this juncture, we would emphasise that every litigant has a general
                            right to bring all evidence <em>relevant</em> to
                            his or her case to the attention of the court. This general right is so
                            fundamental that it requires no authority to be cited in support of it;
                            in fact, to say that the right derives from some positive decision or
                            rule is to understate its constitutive importance to the adversarial
                            approach to fact-finding. The importance of the right is reflected in
                            the fact that a litigant may pray in aid the machinery of the court to
                            compel, on the pain of contempt, all persons who are in a position to
                            give relevant evidence, to come forward and give
                            it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">25    The general right is, of
                            course, subject to specific limits. For present purposes, the following
                            limits are germane. A litigant only has the right to adduce <em>relevant</em> evidence, as defined by the Evidence
                            Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) and other applicable rules;
                            irrelevant evidence is inadmissible and will not be considered by the
                            court. The adduction of relevant evidence must, as far as practicable,
                            take place in accordance with the rules of procedure whose purpose is to
                            ensure the <em>fair</em>, economical, swift and
                            orderly resolution of a dispute. Finally, a litigant is prohibited from
                            manipulating the court’s machinery to further his ulterior or
                            collateral motives in an abusive or oppressive
                            manner.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">26    In striking the proper
                            balance between the general right and the specific limits, a trial judge
                            must not only be guided by the applicable rules and decisions, but must
                            look beyond the mechanical application of these rules and decisions, and
                            carefully assess the interests at stake in every case to ensure that a
                                <em>fair</em> outcome is reached through the
                            application of <em>fair</em> processes. It should
                            always be borne in mind that grave consequences might flow from the
                            wrongful exclusion of evidence (such as by shutting out a witness from
                            testifying or preventing cross-examination). In cases where the
                            relevance of evidence sought to be adduced is unclear, or even doubtful,
                            we are of the view that it is usually both prudent and just to err in
                            favour of admission rather than exclusion. With specific regard to the
                            calling of witnesses, we would reiterate what was said in <em>Auto Clean ‘N’ Shine Services (a firm) v
                                Eastern Publishing Associates Pte Ltd</em><u>[1997] 2 SLR(R) 427</u> (at [17]), where
                            this court allowed an appeal to introduce eleven new witnesses of fact
                            after the summons for directions stage:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[A] balance should be struck between the need to comply with the rules
                            and the parties’ right to call witnesses whom they deem necessary
                            to establish their case. It may well be that the additional evidence to
                            be adduced by the parties may assist in illuminating the issues before
                            the court or result in the expeditious disposal of the proceedings. If,
                            however, it really turns out at the trial that the evidence adduced is
                            unnecessary, irrelevant or vexatious, the trial judge is in full control
                            and is in a position to deal with the party adducing such evidence in an
                            appropriate way, such as by disallowing the evidence which is being
                            elicited from the witness and/or by an order as to costs. <em>It must always be borne in mind that the duty of the court
                                is to examine all the evidence put forward by the parties which is
                                material and relevant to the dispute between the parties and not to
                                shut out potentially material and relevant evidence by a strict
                                adherence to the rules of civil procedure</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     These observations in <em>Basil</em> and <em>Ong Jane Rebecca</em>
                    highlight the proposition that in considering whether to set aside a subpoena,
                    the court looks at a whole host of competing considerations in each case, such
                    as the evidentiary and procedural consequences of excluding a witness from
                    providing his evidence <em>vis-à-vis</em> the relevance
                    and/or materiality of such evidence and the difference it could make to the
                    eventual outcome of a case. In my view, however, the question in the present
                    case turns on whether these considerations operate differently in the context of
                    the present case, where the subpoena is issued for a witness to attend before an
                        <em>arbitral tribunal</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The plaintiff’s submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Counsel for the plaintiff argued vigorously
                    that the Subpoena should be set aside as it was an abuse of process having
                    regard to <em>first</em>, the defendant’s alleged
                    failure to comply with the agreed procedure for the conduct of the
                        Arbitration<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>. Instead of seeking a
                    remedy from the Arbitrator, the defendant applied to the court for orders
                    relating to such evidence. <em>Second</em>, counsel for the
                    plaintiff further averred that the Arbitrator had already declined to make any
                    order to have the plaintiff’s employees, including Mr [XY], to give
                    sworn testimony regarding the adequacy of the plaintiff’s disclosure. As
                    such, by obtaining the Subpoena from court, the defendant had intruded on the
                    jurisdiction of the Arbitrator<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>. <em>Third</em>, the
                    Subpoena sought evidence on matters <em>outside</em> the
                    substantive issues in dispute between the parties as it sought testimony
                    regarding the adequacy of disclosure from Mr [XY], who was not even a
                    member of the project team for the Contract. <em>Fourth</em>, the materiality of the evidence sought from Mr [XY]
                    was unclear<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The defendant’s submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Counsel for the defendant submitted that
                    Mr [XY] was being called as a witness “to give evidence in support
                    of, and to establish its case for adverse inferences to be drawn against the
                    plaintiff in arbitral proceedings<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>”. In response to the plaintiff’s
                    four-pronged attack, he contended that <em>first</em>, this
                    was not the proper forum to determine the materiality and/or relevance of the
                    evidence of Mr [XY] and was a matter for the Arbitrator to determine at the
                    arbitral proceedings<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span>. In the absence of any
                    contrary evidence, counsel for the defendant argued that one could conclude that
                    Mr [XY] had no issues appearing as a witness to give evidence on behalf of
                    the defendant in the arbitral proceedings. <em>Second</em>,
                    counsel for the defendant further averred that there was no basis to the
                    plaintiff’s allegation that the Subpoena was improper and that the
                    Arbitrator was not prepared to receive and hear evidence, including sworn
                    testimony, on issues relating to the plaintiff’s compliance with the
                    discovery order<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">My decision </p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Terms of Procedural Order No. 1, IBA Rules and Correspondence
                between the parties and the Arbitrator</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Counsel for the plaintiff drew my attention to
                    the terms of Procedural Order No. 1 dated 19 August 2009, agreed on
                    between the parties with the Arbitrator as well as the IBA Rules which both
                    parties agreed to use as a guideline on procedural matters (Part 4.1(a) of
                    Procedural Order No. 1). Casting an eye over the terms of Procedural Order
                    No 1, it became immediately apparent that parties had in fact, applied their
                    minds to the calling of factual witnesses and the presentation of such evidence.
                    It is worth setting out Parts 12.4, 12.5 and 13.4 of the Procedural Order
                    No 1 in full:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">12.4  Any person may present evidence as a witness,
                            including a party or a party’s officer, employee or other
                            representative.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">12.5  The Arbitrator may, at any time before the
                            arbitration is concluded, order any party to provide or to use its best
                            efforts to provide, the appearance for testimony at a Hearing of any
                            person, including one whose testimony has not been
                        offered.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">13.4  Witnesses or experts may only appear at the
                            Hearing if the respective procedures contained in Parts…12 have
                            been complied with, unless the consent of the Arbitrator is
                            obtained.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Further, the parameters of the questions that
                    could be put to a witness were also within the purview of the Arbitrator, as
                    provided for under Part 13.10 of the Procedural Order No. 1:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">13.10 The Arbitrator may limit or exclude any
                            questions to, answers by or appearance of an expert or witness, if it
                            considers such question, answer or appearance to be irrelevant,
                            immaterial, burdensome or duplicative.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Both parties were further at liberty to apply
                    to the Arbitrator at any time, giving proper notice to the opposing party, to
                    vary or supplement the orders (Part 23.4). Turning next to the IBA Rules,
                    these are guidelines promulgated to assist parties and arbitrators and provide
                    for some form of uniformity amongst international arbitral tribunals<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">in order to enable them to conduct the evidence phase of international
                        arbitration proceedings in an efficient and economical manner. The Rules
                        provide mechanisms for the presentation of documents, witnesses of fact,
                        expert witnesses and inspections, as well as for the conduct of evidentiary
                        hearings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     
          <em>Prima facie</em>, it
                    is clear that several of the terms of the Procedural Order are imported from the
                    tenor of the IBA Rules. Article 2 of the IBA Rules provides that where
                    parties or the Arbitral Tribunal agreed to apply the IBA Rules (such as in the
                    present case), the Rules shall govern the taking of evidence. This would extend
                    to the Arbitral Tribunal’s determination of the “admissibility,
                    relevance, materiality and weight of evidence” (Article 9.1). Much
                    in the same vein as Part 13.10 of the Procedural Order No. 1, the IBA
                    Rules also reserves complete control over the hearing in the hands of the
                    Arbitral Tribunal who may limit or exclude <em>inter
                        alia</em>, the appearance of a witness if it considers such appearance
                    to be irrelevant, immaterial, burdensome or duplicative. What happens in a
                    situation when one party wishes to adduce live evidence from a witness who is
                    not prepared to attend voluntarily at a hearing? In such a situation,
                    Articles 4.10 and 4.11 of the IBA Rules contemplate the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4.10  If a Party wishes to present evidence from a
                            person who will not appear voluntarily at its request, the Party may,
                            within the time ordered by the Arbitral Tribunal, <b><em>ask it to take whatever steps are legally available to obtain the
                                testimony of that person</em></b>. The Party shall <b><em>identify the intended witness, shall describe the subjects

                                The Arbitral Tribunal shall decide on this request and shall take
                                the necessary steps if in its discretion it determines that the
                                testimony of that witness would be relevant and
                            material</em></b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4.11  The Arbitral Tribunal may, at any time before the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Two observations are pertinent in this
                    respect: first, both the terms of Procedural Order No. 1 and the IBA Rules
                    expressly reserve the decision as to what <em>legal</em>
                    steps a party should take in the event it wishes to adduce evidence from a
                    person who will not appear voluntarily at its request <em>to the
                        Arbitrator</em>; and second, the party should write <em>first</em> to the Arbitrator, enclosing the grounds on which they
                    seek such a witness’s testimony and explain its relevance to the
                    substantive case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     As mentioned previously (see <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a>),while the defendant had written to the

                    82-page letter does the defendant mention that they intend to call Mr [XY]
                    as a witness. On the contrary, the specific content of their request to the
                    Arbitrator bears quoting <em>in extenso</em>:</p>

                            Commercial Arbitration. The grounds relied upon by the [defendant] are
                            wholly inadequate for such an extraordinary request. In this letter, we

                            submissions regarding the consequences of such non compliance, including
                            submissions that it would be appropriate to draw adverse inferences in
                            the circumstances</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>[</b>emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Counsel for the plaintiff opined that the
                    Arbitrator declined the defendant’s request for sworn statements while
                    counsel for the defendant asserted that the Arbitrator’s comments should
                    be viewed in the proper context and that he had clearly indicated his
                    willingness to receive and hear evidence, including sworn testimony, on issues
                    relating to the plaintiff’s compliance with the Discovery Order. At the
                    risk of stating the obvious, it is clear that the Arbitrator’s reply can
                    only be construed in the following manner: <em>first</em>,
                    the defendant did not write to the Arbitrator informing him of their intention
                    to subpoena Mr [XY] as a witness – they only wrote to him asking him
                    to decide on whether it would be appropriate to order Mr [XY] to provide
                    sworn statements as to the <em>adequacy</em> of disclosure.
                        <em>Second</em>, the Arbitrator in his reply, expressly
                    reserved his right to decide at a later juncture of the proceedings, whether he
                    would require sworn testimony regarding the adequacy of disclosure by
                    Mr [XY].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In my view, from the aforementioned express
                    provisions under Procedural Order No. 1, IBA Rules and the correspondence
                    between both parties and the Arbitrator, it was clear that parties had <em>contractually</em> agreed on the procedure to be adopted with
                    regard to the calling of witnesses. The defendant could have applied directly to
                    the Arbitrator, indicating their intention to subpoena Mr [XY] as a witness
                    at the Arbitration and obtain his instructions as to how to proceed. These were
                    the agreed procedural terms by which both parties entered into in good faith and
                    to circumvent and sidestep these directions seemed to obviate the very purpose
                    of entering into such detailed directions with the Arbitrator in the first
                    place.</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The arbitrator is, subject to any procedure otherwise agreed

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Respect for party autonomy </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The judicial policy of minimal interference in
                    arbitration is well rooted in Singapore jurisprudence, spurred on in part, by
                    the recognition of arbitration as an efficient and useful alternative dispute
                    resolution mechanism to settle commercial disputes: <em>Singapore

                    vol 73 at col 2213; and the need to respect party autonomy in deciding
                    both the procedural rules as well as substantive law to govern a contract. In
                        <em>Navigator Investment Services Ltd v Acclaim Insurance
                        Brokers Pte Ltd</em> [2010] 1 SLR 25(“<em>Navigator Investment</em>”), the Court of Appeal reaffirmed
                    its commitment that the courts will “endeavour to do their level best to
                    facilitate and promote arbitration between commercial parties whenever
                    possible” (at [61]). Moreover, as the Court of Appeal noted in <em>Soh Beng Tee</em> at [65]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[H]aving opted for arbitration, parties must be taken to have acknowledged
                        and accepted the attendant risks of having only a very limited right of

                            nor consonant for a dissatisfied party to seek the assistance of the

                            appellate function, save in the very limited circumstances that have
                            been statutorily condoned</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     As Mr Leslie Chew, SC remarks in
                        <em>Introduction to the Law and Practice of Arbitration in
                        Singapore</em> (LexisNexis, 2010) at p 37:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">First and foremost, the agreement by the parties to adopt arbitration as
                        the means of resolving their dispute is <em>the ultimate in
                            the exercise of party autonomy</em>. By choosing arbitration as
                        the mode for the resolution of their dispute, parties who have opted for
                        arbitration take the dispute out of the primary control of the national
                        court. To be sure, the national courts retain supervisory control. However,
                            <em>the choice in favour of arbitration means that the
                            matter is to be resolved outside the precincts of the courthouse as it
                            were</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Next, and just as important, is the fact and reality that by adopting
                        arbitration, parties to a dispute will then have the right to choose their

<em>[P]arties to an arbitration pursuant to an arbitration

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     In my view, this respect for party autonomy
                    extends to matters that could be dealt with by the arbitrator as master of the
                    procedure <em>prior</em> to commencement of the arbitral
                    hearing where parties had <em>contractually</em> agreed on
                    procedural directions. In <em>Woh Hup Pte Ltd v Lian Teck
                        Construction Pte Ltd</em> [2005] SGCA 26, the Court of Appeal
                    considered an application for pre-arbitral discovery and observed that
                    “any matter submitted to arbitration, should, in general, and certainly
                    wherever possible, be dealt with by the arbitral tribunal”(at [36]). To
                    invoke the assistance of the courts would run “contrary to the spirit and
                    scheme of arbitration” (at [36]). Counsel for the defendant pointed
                    repeatedly to the Arbitrator’s response of 11 June 2010 which stated
                    that “should it later emerge that the [plaintiff] has failed to comply
                    with [his] order, [he] will entertain submissions regarding the consequences of
                    such non-compliance, including submissions that it would be appropriate to draw
                    adverse inferences in the circumstances”(see [9]). He averred that this
                    suggested that the Arbitrator was prepared to receive and hear evidence,
                    including sworn testimony, on issues relating to the plaintiff’s
                    compliance with the Discovery Order. With respect, I must disagree with counsel
                    on this point. As I have indicated (see <a href="#p1_33">[33]</a>), the Arbitrator has stated in no less than plain terms that
                        <em>he</em> will entertain submissions on whether the
                    plaintiff has failed to comply with the Discovery Order, including whether it
                    would be appropriate to draw adverse inferences but at a later stage. He did not
                    go on to make directions that the defendant applies for a subpoena in court,
                    prior to commencement of the Arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     In my view therefore, the defendant ought to
                    have sought directions from the Arbitrator on calling Mr [XY] as a witness
                    in the Arbitration prior to making the application to the court, given that the
                    terms of Procedural Order No. 1 provided that this was one of the live
                    issues well within the purview of the Arbitrator’s control. By
                    sidestepping this arrangement, this seemed to strike at the very heart of the
                    powers of the arbitral tribunal, as agreed upon by the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether there has been an abuse of process in the present case </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Counsel for the plaintiff argued that by
                    obtaining the subpoena from the court instead of applying to the Arbitrator for
                    an order, the defendant abused the court’s processes by circumventing the
                    jurisdiction of the Arbitrator. To buttress his point, counsel for the plaintiff
                    pointed out that the defendant’s act had contravened the express agreed
                    procedural directions entered into by the parties with the Arbitrator and that
                    in all likelihood, the real reason for the defendant turning to the courts
                    rather than the Arbitrator was because their request would likely be turned down
                    by the latter. When I pressed counsel for the defendant on the reason for
                    seeking an order from this court rather than approaching the Arbitrator, his
                    cautious response was that Section 30 of the Arbitration Act permitted a
                    party to <em>elect</em> between the two options of either
                    applying to the court or seeking the Arbitrator’s opinion. He averred that
                    it was not necessary for one party to exhaust the option of applying to the
                    Arbitrator first before knocking on the doors of the court and there was nothing
                    in the Arbitration Act or Procedural Order No. 1 to suggest that the
                    defendant had to exhaust his remedies before applying to court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Observations on Section 30 of the Arbitration Act</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     At first blush, Section 30 of the
                    Arbitration Act provides that any party to an arbitration agreement may apply
                    for a subpoena in this court. The power of the High Court to issue subpoenas to
                    compel the attendance of witnesses in arbitration proceedings to give oral
                    evidence or produce documents has been retained from the former Arbitration Act
                    (Cap 10, 1985 Rev Ed). A preliminary observation to make is that
                    Section 30 stops short of carving out specifically <em>when</em> a party should seek the intervention of the courts. To ask
                    a rhetorical question of the plaintiff– does it mean that in every
                    situation, parties could apply to court for a subpoena to compel the attendance
                    of witnesses at an arbitration hearing <em>only</em> after
                    they approached the arbitrator first? I queried counsel for the plaintiff for
                    circumstances under which Section 30 of the Arbitration Act may be invoked.
                    He submitted that the first situation would be where parties had <em>not</em> provided for express procedural directions relating
                    to the calling of witnesses; and second, where there were third parties involved
                    over whom the arbitral tribunal had no jurisdiction. I agreed with counsel for
                    the plaintiff on both fronts; a party to an arbitration agreement could apply
                    for a writ of subpoena in court first where parties did not provide <em>expressly</em> and <em>contractually</em> for procedural directions to be finalised by the
                    Arbitrator; and second, where a party was seeking to adduce the evidence of
                    non-parties who were not privy to the arbitration agreement. In such instances,
                    the court can assist the arbitral process. To buttress this point, I should
                    point out that section 28 of the Arbitration Act (a provision which both
                    parties did not cite in their submissions) recognizes that parties can agree on
                    the scope of powers to be exercised by the arbitral tribunal and the arbitral
                    tribunal has the power to <em>make orders</em> or <em>give directions</em> to any party for a witness to be
                    examined.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     In the presence of an express and contractual
                    arrangement, I disagreed with counsel for the defendant that he could pick and
                    choose his options. Parties had set out the procedural directions at length with
                    the Arbitrator during the course of the procedural hearings and it seemed to me
                    that the proper course of action would be to apply to the Arbitrator in the
                    first instance, before knocking on the doors of the court. The defendant could
                    not have his cake and eat it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">An abuse of process?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Having made the aforementioned observations, I
                    proceeded to consider whether the issuance of the subpoena constituted an abuse
                    of process. As the courts have held, the categories qualifying as an
                    ‘abuse of process’ are not closed and depend on the circumstances of
                    each case (<em>Gabriel Peter &amp; Partners v Wee Chong
                        Jin</em> [1997] 3 SLR(R) 649 at [22]; <em>NCC

                        International</em>”)). However, four categories of proceedings
                    which may constitute an abuse of process were helpfully distilled in <em>Chee Siok Chin v Minister for Home Affairs</em> [2006]
                    1 SLR(R) 582(“<em>Chee Siok

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Counsel for the plaintiff relied predominantly
                    on the second ground in <em>Chee Siok Chin</em> to argue
                    that the defendant tried to use the court processes improperly to obtain a
                    subpoena behind the back of the Arbitrator. They referred me to <em>NCC International</em> where the appellant and the respondent
                    had agreed to refer any disputes to arbitration but the appellant applied for an
                    interim mandatory injunction pending arbitration. The Court of Appeal held that
                    the appellant used the court’s process in an improper way as interim
                    relief should rightly have been sought from an arbitral tribunal as provided in
                    the contract between the parties(at [73]). The Court’s observations in
                    this regard are particularly apposite (at [53]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[R]egardless of whether the court’s jurisdiction is exercised under
                        the [Arbitration Act] or the [International Arbitration Act], the same
                        general principle of limited and cautious curial assistance applies. The
                        court will intervene only sparingly and in very narrow circumstances, such
                        as where the arbitral tribunal cannot be constituted expediently enough,
                        where the court’s coercive enforcement powers are required or
                            <em>where the arbitral tribunal has no jurisdiction to
                            grant the relief sought in the manner at hand</em>. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Instead of seeking recourse via arbitration,
                    the appellant’s first port of call was to apply to court for <em>ex parte</em> interlocutory relief in the form of an interim
                    injunction. Counsel for the plaintiff argued that the facts of the present case
                    were analogous. First, in my view, the facts of <em>NCC
                        International</em> were distinguishable from the present case in one
                    important aspect – in <em>NCC International</em>, the
                    conduct of the appellant amounted to an abuse of the process of the court
                    because the Court was of the view <em>inter alia</em>, that
                    the appellant <em>lacked any genuine intention to commence
                        arbitration</em> and took no steps to commence arbitration even after
                    the lapse of more than seven months from the date of the dispute. In the present
                    case, there was no such lack of genuine intention to commence arbitration on the
                    part of the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Having said that, what was strikingly similar
                    in both cases was that the defendant and the appellant in <em>NCC
                        International</em> were essentially “using the curial process
                    to resolve its dispute with the [plaintiff] contrary to the [agreed procedural
                    course of conduct]” (at [70]) and on a procedural matter for which the
                    arbitral tribunal had jurisdiction to grant the relief sought. As Rajah JA
                    astutely observed in <em>NCC International</em> (at
                    [74]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As this particular issue of whether specific performance of that contract
                        should be ordered fell squarely within the province of the arbitral
                        tribunal, the appellant was in essence requesting the court to nakedly usurp
                        the functions of the arbitral tribunal rather than to assist in or support
                        the intended arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     In this connection, parties had conferred on
                    the Arbitrator, <em>inter alia</em>, the power to order any
                    party to provide or to use its best efforts to provide, the appearance for
                    testimony at the arbitration of any person, including one whose testimony has
                    not been offered (Clause 12.5 of Procedural Order No 1). I was of the
                    view that the issuance of the subpoena fell squarely within the second category
                    as stated in <em>Chee Siok Chin</em> and was reminded of
                    Andrew Phang JA’s observation in <em>Navigator
                        Investment</em> (at [67]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The key general point to note is that the courts will constantly bear in
                        mind the need to both facilitate and promote arbitration wherever possible
                        between commercial parties<b>…</b><em>Any attempt to circumvent this ideal via court procedures
                            will</em>, ex hypothesi, <em>be an abuse of process

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     By compelling the attendance of Mr [XY]
                    without seeking prior directions of the Arbitrator for an order that the
                    plaintiff procure his attendance at the arbitration hearing or for the approval
                    to issue a subpoena against him was, in my view, a direct circumvention and
                    usurpation of the Arbitrator’s control of the procedure of the
                    Arbitration. The Arbitrator’s discretion encompassed the ability to
                    determine the relevance, admissibility, materiality of evidence and the
                    appearance of witnesses. The application to issue a subpoena against
                    Mr [XY] was, to my mind, premature and improperly obtained and in my view,
                    constituted an abuse of the court’s process.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the evidence is relevant and/or material</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Admission of evidence is best left to the Arbitrator to
                decide</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     As I have found that the issuance of a
                    subpoena was improperly done, it is not necessary for me to consider this
                    secondary ground. For the sake of completeness, I considered counsel for the
                    defendant’s arguments on the relevance and/or materiality of
                    Mr [XY]’s evidence. He cited the cases of <em>Basil</em> and <em>One Jane Rebecca</em> to
                    argue that the admission of evidence was a matter best left to the Arbitrator to
                    decide and drew particular attention to the Court of Appeal’s observation
                    at [26] of <em>Basil</em> that<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…the trial judge is in full control and is in a position to deal
                        with the party adducing such evidence in an appropriate way, such as by
                        disallowing the evidence which is being elicited from the witness and/or by
                        an order as to costs. It must always be borne in mind that the duty of the
                        court is to examine all the evidence put forward by the parties which is
                        material and relevant to the dispute between the parties and not to shut out
                        potentially material and relevant evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The sacred right of a litigant to bring all
                    evidence relevant to his case before the court is immutable. The admission of
                    all <em>relevant</em> evidence in each case is of critical
                    importance as this may well impact on the eventual outcome of a case. Both
                        <em>Basil</em> and <em>One Jane
                        Rebecca</em> reiterate these hallowed principles and I fully endorse
                    the views expressed there. In my view, however, the considerations at play in
                    the present case are different given that this is a subpoena issued in support
                    of arbitration proceedings. In arbitration, the arbitral tribunal possesses the
                    power to decide both the <em>procedure</em> and <em>substance</em> of the arbitration. The arbitrator is in
                    effect, the ‘trial judge’ and best apprised to deal with the
                    submissions of the party seeking to adduce evidence. I agreed with the defendant
                    that the Arbitrator is the proper tribunal to decide on the admission of Mr [XY]
                    as a witness but this is a decision he could only make <em>if the
                        defendant had applied to him first</em>. On this point, counsel for
                    the plaintiff helpfully drew my attention to two authorities; first, Mustill and
                    Boyd’s <em>The Law and Practice of Commercial Arbitration
                        in England</em> (Butterworths, 2<sup>nd</sup> Ed,
                    1989 Ed) (cited with approval in <em>NCC
                        International</em> at [55]), where the learned authors opined (it
                    should be added, in the context of s 12(6) of the Arbitration Act 1950 in
                    the UK) at p 296, that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In certain respects, namely the ordering of discovery and interrogatories,
                        the powers of the Court duplicate those of the arbitrator. <em>When a party wishes to avail himself of these over-lapping
                            powers, he should first have recourse to the arbitrator, and should not
                            invoke the Court’s power unless the arbitrator’s order
                            proves ineffectual</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Second, counsel for the plaintiff pointed me
                    in the direction of the position in Hong Kong, where Mr Neil Kaplan
                    observed on the concurrent powers of the arbitral tribunal and the court, in
                        <em>Arbitration in Hong Kong: a Practical Guide</em>
                    (Sweet &amp; Maxwell Asia, 2003) at p 387(cited with approval in <em>NCC International</em> at [66]) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This concurrent power of the court is not inconsistent with the philosophy
                        of the Arbitration Ordinance and the Model Law that the <em>parties should be held to an agreement to arbitrate, and that the
                            arbitral tribunal should have control of the proceedings</em>
                            (<em>subject to anything agreed to the contrary by the
                            parties, and specific statutory powers of the courts</em>)
                            <em>so long as the court’s power is used as a
                            fallback position only</em>. Accordingly, it is <em>appropriate for parties seeking an order which the tribunal has the
                            power to give, to approach the tribunal before the
                        court</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     In the context of the present case, this leans
                    in favour of upholding the contractual and procedural arrangements that parties
                    entered into with the Arbitrator. Such evidentiary considerations, while
                    admittedly important, must be balanced and weighed against the court’s
                    recognition of the powers of the arbitral tribunal and the parties’
                    pre-ordained contractual agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Moreover, an important point I should add is
                    that even though I am of the view that the subpoena should be set aside, there
                    is in effect little prejudice caused to the defendant who is not shut out from
                    applying to the Arbitrator to call Mr [XY] as a witness at the Arbitration
                    and presenting such evidence to bolster their case. The defendant could well
                    make a case for this before the Arbitrator and afford him the opportunity to
                    decide. This would remain faithful to the arrangements parties had made at the
                    outset, prior to commencement of the Arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Moving forward, a possible practical solution
                    to avoid similar applications in the future is for parties to agree expressly at
                    the outset (whether as part of the terms of a procedural order or separately),
                    to have subpoenas made returnable before the arbitrator. It would also be
                    desirable to obtain the consent of the parties for the arbitrator to rule on any
                    objections which may arise in relation to subpoenas.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Taking into account all the aforementioned
                    considerations, I reached the view that the issuance of a subpoena in the
                    present case was done improperly and ought to be set aside. To recapitulate, my
                    reasons were that <em>first</em>, arbitration is the
                        <em>contractually</em> chosen method of dispute
                    resolution between commercial parties. As such, the issue of whether the
                    subpoena should have been issued must be viewed from the perspective of the
                    other contracting party. <em>Second</em>, though
                    evidentiary considerations are important, where commercial parties have
                        <em>contractually</em> chosen to utilize arbitration as
                    their means of dispute resolution, recourse should be had to the contractual
                    arrangement <em>first</em> before knocking on the doors of
                    the court and seeking curial intervention. <em>Third</em>,
                    the observations of the court in <em>Basil</em> and
                        <em>One Jane Rebecca</em> are to be borne in mind in
                    all cases involving the setting aside of subpoenas but as this case involved
                    arbitration proceedings, the interplay of considerations varied and the issue of
                    whether the evidence of Mr [XY] ought to be adduced should be a matter
                    reserved for the discretion of the arbitral tribunal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     I therefore allowed the plaintiff’s
                    application. I remain grateful to both counsel for their submissions and will
                    hear the parties on the issue of costs.</p>
