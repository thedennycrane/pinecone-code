Since the Fourth, Fifth and Seventh Representations were dependent on PixelTrade having been approved for investment by UOB in the first place, the First Representation was of prime importance (the Judgment at [18] to [20]). However, there was a sea change in Poh’s case between what was pleaded (and as stated in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief) and what was advanced in Poh’s opening statement and at trial concerning the First Representation.

</div> at [62]). The findings of a trial judge should be taken as <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>correct and should not be disturbed in the absence of sound reasons. An appellate court will be slow to overturn the trial judge’s findings of fact unless it can be shown that those findings were plainly wrong or were against the weight of the evidence before the court. If the trial judge’s findings of fact are based on his assessment of the witnesses’ veracity and credibility, the appellate court should exercise even more restraint in overturning such findings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 In the present case, Poh, as the plaintiff, bears the burden of proving that the First Representation was made. As the Judge noted, there is no direct documentary or material evidence to prove or disprove whether Wong had made the First Representation (and other representations) to Poh. The question rests on Poh’s word against Wong’s word, as well as inferences which can be drawn from the correspondence, documents, and other circumstances. In such a situation, the court should refrain from overruling the Judge unless the inferences he drew were plainly wrong or against the weight of the evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 In our view, there is no basis for us to disturb the Judge’s main conclusion that the First Representation was not made. We agree with the Judge that Poh’s inexplicable delay in complaining about the First Representation suggests that it was not made. Poh raises various arguments and points which he claims the Judge had failed to consider. However, they do not assist him because his arguments or points are either not borne out by the evidence or are contradicted by the evidence; or are equivocal, as they merely suggest, at their highest, that the Judge had relied on evidence which he should not have in reaching his decision. Although we think that the Judge may have erred in finding that the Fifth and Sixth Representations were not made, this is inconsequential as Poh has not proved that these representations were false.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The “sea change” in Poh’s case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 We first address the Judge’s view that Poh had shifted his case on the First Representation.

</div> It therefore appears to us that Poh, even at the appeal stage, is unable to make up his mind as to whether he was alleging that Wong had actually represented to him, before the investments were made, that PixelTrade was low-risk, or that Wong had recommended the product to him because Wong had thought (to himself) that it was low-risk.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 We accept that Wong had recommended PixelTrade to Poh. However, that is not enough for Poh to succeed. Even if Wong had negligently thought that PixelTrade was low-risk, that would not assist Poh because Poh is no longer pursuing a negligence claim on appeal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 As regards the question of whether Wong had represented to Poh that PixelTrade was a low-risk product before the investments were made, we do not need to consider it as this was not one of the Representations which Poh had pleaded.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 In so far as the transcript of the audio recording shows that Wong had admitted that he had recommended PixelTrade to Poh because many others in UOB were also investing in it, that too does not assist Poh because it was not clear from the transcripts whether Wong was saying that he had made this representation to Poh <span class="font-italic">before </span>Poh invested in PixelTrade, or whether Wong was saying that he had himself believed this but had not made such a representation. In any case, even if Wong had made that representation, which is the Sixth Representation, Poh did not prove that it was false and he thus did not prove deceit on this basis. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 In relation to the First Representation, which is the focus of Poh’s appeal, the audio recording does not suggest that the representation was made.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 In so far as Poh relies on the WhatsApp messages between himself and Wong on 23 October 2018 to suggest that Wong had not disagreed with his accusation of deceit, Poh has only selectively quoted the portions which serve his case, but these do not reflect the full picture. We set out the full context of the relevant WhatsApp messages here:

Thereafter, Wong sent Poh a picture of Poh’s handwritten note which suggested that PixelTrade was discussed alongside other products which were approved for investment by UOB. Taking Poh’s argument at its highest and assuming this alleged fact to be true, it still would not amount to the First Representation which Poh was relying on. At most, the discussion may have caused Poh to assume that PixelTrade was approved by UOB, but this was not Poh’s pleaded case.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Second, Poh relies on evidence suggesting that Wong was an introducer and a conduit between PixelTrade and Poh, and that Wong was allegedly intimately involved with PixelTrade. He argues that this proves that Wong had made the First Representation. We are of the view that while the evidence that Poh relies on may suggest that Wong recommended the investment and knew someone in PixelTrade, such evidence does not go the further step of showing that any misrepresentation was made by Wong. Wong had explained that he had gotten involved as PixelTrade was not very responsive to Poh and Poh kept asking Wong for help. Hence, Wong helped Poh out as a friend,

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 However, these pieces of evidence, even if taken as true, do not aid Poh’s case. They do not necessarily mean that Wong had made the First Representation. Furthermore, the fact that Wong undertook to pay Poh back is in itself equivocal. Wong could have felt responsible for recommending PixelTrade to Poh, and such conduct was not necessarily because Wong had made any misrepresentation to Poh. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Judge’s alleged errors </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 We now turn to discuss some points on which Poh claims the Judge had erred by placing weight on. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 First, Poh argues that the Judge erred in relying on the MWP forms as Poh had not read the forms, and there is an apparent contradiction in Wong’s testimony relating to the forms (see [28(a)] and [28(b)] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 However, even if Poh had not read these forms, it only means that the Judge should not have concluded from the terms in the forms that Poh had a risk profile which was moderate to high or that Poh should have appreciated that investments made through UOB were not risk-free. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Second, Poh argues that the Judge erred in giving weight to the fact that Poh had approached PixelTrade first to recover his investments instead of UOB. Poh submits that this was not contrary to the allegation that the First Representation was made, and he had only approached PixelTrade first in order to mitigate his loss, and even then, only on Wong’s advice. We disagree and are of the view that this was an inference which the Judge was entitled to draw. Furthermore, even if the Judge was wrong to do so, it was only one of the multifarious pieces of evidence he relied upon in deciding against Poh.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Third, Poh argues that the Judge erred in finding that Wong was unlikely to have encouraged Poh to make a police report if Wong had made misrepresentations, because the WhatsApp communications show that it was Poh who first threatened to make a police report.

</div> However, even if Poh was the one who first threatened to make a police report, this was equivocal. The fact is that Wong did agree that Poh should make a police report and correspondingly, the Judge was entitled to draw the inference which he did.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Fourth, Poh argues that the Judge was wrong in finding that as the PixelTrade investment did not feature in Poh’s monthly statements from UOB, Poh would have known that it was not purchased through UOB, since there were also other UOB investments which did not feature in such monthly statements. We note that one of UOB’s witnesses admitted that a certain “AIA Platinum Legacy Policy” was a UOB-approved product which did not feature in Poh’s monthly statements from UOB,

</div> which showed that not all UOB-approved products would feature therein. Therefore, it may be that the Judge should not have relied on this in his finding. However, again, this was only one among various pieces of evidence which he relied on. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 We are of the view that the above alleged errors made by the Judge, even if we take Poh’s case at its highest and consider them collectively, would not materially change the outcome of Poh’s claim. Even if the Judge was wrong to rely on such evidence to find <span class="font-italic">against </span>Poh, the burden of proof lies on Poh to <span class="font-italic">positively</span> prove his case on the First Representation, and we find that he has not done so.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Poh’s conduct</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 In particular, Poh’s conduct did not support his case that the First Representation was made. The evidence suggests that Poh did not explicitly complain about the First Representation and that his allegation was a mere afterthought.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 First, as mentioned above at [43], Poh’s counsel was not consistent as to what Poh’s main allegation was. He had conflated the allegation that the First Representation was made with the allegation that Wong had omitted to warn Poh that PixelTrade was not approved by UOB.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Second, also as mentioned above at [51], the recording of the meeting on 28 August 2018 did not establish that the First Representation was made. This is significant because according to Poh, he had found out from Goh only the day before that PixelTrade was not UOB-approved. If this had been the case and Wong had indeed made the First Representation, Poh would almost certainly have confronted Wong on this very matter when they met on 28 August 2018, but he did not.

Furthermore, Poh did not mention the First Representation explicitly.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Fourth, the police report made by Poh on 26 October 2018 made no mention that Wong had deceived Poh, nor did it contain anything about the First Representation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Fifth, Poh finally raised the issue of the loss of his PixelTrade investment to UOB on 3 November 2018 when he wrote to UOB’s deputy chairman and chief executive officer (“3 November 2018 letter”).

This is a reference to the Fifth Representation. However, the letter did not mention the First Representation. On the contrary, the letter suggested that Poh had assumed that PixelTrade had been approved by UOB for investment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 On 15 November 2018, one Mr Yong, who was Goh’s team leader, replied on behalf of UOB. Mr Yong requested Poh to inform UOB when the police had concluded their investigation and asked for a copy of the police report and related documents for UOB to investigate internally.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Subsequently, Poh emailed Mr Yong on 3 April 2019. The salient points of the email are listed in the Judgment at [77]. Poh stressed that he would only invest in capital-guaranteed investments but again, he did not mention the First Representation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 On 15 April 2019, Poh met with Mr Yong and Mr Yong’s colleagues, one Mr Beh and one Mr Tham. These UOB representatives gave evidence that at the meeting, Poh had admitted that he was aware that PixelTrade was not approved by UOB. Poh disputes this. He alleges that he did tell them about the Representations. The UOB representatives deny that he told them this.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 On 23 May 2019, Poh sent an email to Mr Yong. The contents of the email are set out at [85] of the Judgment. We will set out the first sentence only:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">My decision to invest in the Pixel Trade was solely based on the fact that [Wong] was the RM who UOB Privilage [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] Banking assigned to me.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 As the Judge observed, this cited sentence is telling. Poh was saying that his investment in PixelTrade was “solely” based on the fact that Wong was the relationship manager assigned to him by UOB. There was no mention of any of the Representations. This is telling because if Poh had indeed told the UOB representatives about the Representations at the meeting on 15 April 2019, he would have followed up on the Representations in his email to Mr Yong. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 On 10 June 2019, UOB wrote to Poh to say that it was unable to accede to Poh’s request for compensation (as stated in his earlier letter dated 3 November 2018).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 On 12 June 2019, Poh’s lawyers sent a letter of demand to UOB. The Judge referred to this letter at [88] and [89] of the Judgment where he noted:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">88 On 12 June 2019, [Poh’s] lawyers sent UOB a letter of demand. In it, they said that [Poh] had been induced to invest in PixelTrade by three representations made by [Wong]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">a. a UOB approved investment product was a product called PixelTrade (the ‘PixelTrade Product’);</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">b. the PixelTrade Product had, over the preceding 7 years, garnered handsome yields and/or returns on investment for UOB’s customers; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">c. UOB was then actively recommending the PixelTrade Product to UOB’s privilege banking customers.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">89 Representation (a) was referred to in [Poh’s] WhatsApp chat with [Wong] in October 2018 (and denied by [Wong]), but representations (b) and (c) appear for the first time in this letter of demand. The other four Representations in the statement of claim were still conspicuously missing. In particular, the 4th Representation that UOB was guaranteeing investments in PixelTrade was not in the letter of demand. If, as [Poh] claims, he had mentioned all seven Representations at the meeting with the UOB officers on 15 April 2019, why were only three of the seven Representations mentioned in the letter of demand sent approximately two months later?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 On 24 June 2019, UOB’s lawyers replied to deny liability on UOB’s part. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 On 26 July 2019, Poh’s new lawyers wrote to say that he would be commencing action against UOB. However, this letter did not mention any representation in addition to the three previously mentioned in the letter of demand.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 On 29 July 2019, Poh commenced the present action against UOB.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 We elaborate on the first written communication from Poh to UOB dated 3 November 2018 and Poh’s three arguments in respect of that letter. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 First, the Appellant’s Case at para 36 argues that the Judge was wrong to rely on the fact that the 3 November 2018 letter did not contain allegations of misrepresentation, because Poh had already made these allegations in his earlier contemporaneous exchanges with Wong (“first argument”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 Second, the Appellant’s Case at para 37 argues, in response to the Judge’s finding that Poh had not mentioned the Representations in the meeting of 15 April 2019, that Poh had already made his position “abundantly clear” in his 3 November 2018 letter (“second argument”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 Third, para 29 of Poh’s skeletal arguments argues that Poh is a lay person and not legally trained. He had already mentioned in the 3 November 2018 letter that Wong had approached him to invest in PixelTrade and his decision to invest was on the basis that this was with UOB and through an assigned UOB relationship manager. Poh was unsure how much clearer he was required to be in the letter (“third argument”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 In our view, it is insufficient for Poh to argue that Wong had recommended the investment to him or that he had acted on the basis or assumption that PixelTrade was an investment approved by UOB. It is one thing to assume that it was approved by UOB and another to allege that Wong had told him so. The 3 November 2018 letter made no mention of the First Representation. Poh’s second and third arguments that the letter was “abundantly clear” or that he was unsure how much clearer he was required to be is a straw man’s argument. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 If the 3 November 2018 letter was already “abundantly clear”, then it would have been unnecessary for Poh to rely on the first or the third arguments. The fact that he raises them is telling.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 As regards the first argument, Poh had only alleged once that Wong had deceived him, and Wong had denied it on that occasion. We have already elaborated on that above. More importantly, if Poh was able to blame Wong for deceiving him that PixelTrade was approved by UOB, then surely, he could have raised this allegation and specifically the First Representation to the police or to Wong’s superiors. Poh’s act of accusing Wong of deceit contradicts his third argument which suggests that Poh did not know how to be more explicit because he was only a lay person. The fact is that Poh did not explicitly mention the First Representation despite having had various opportunities to do so. It bears repeating that in his email of 23 May 2019, he said that the <span class="font-italic">sole</span> reason for the investment was the fact that Wong was the relationship manager assigned to him by UOB.      </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 In these circumstances, the Judge was entitled to take into account Poh’s omission to explicitly mention the First Representation in deciding to believe Wong and not Poh in relation to the First Representation. While there is some evidence from the recording of the meeting on 28 August 2018 that Wong might have made the Sixth Representation and the 3 November 2018 letter suggested that Wong may have also made the Fifth Representation, this was not adequate for Poh’s claim to succeed since Poh did not prove that these representations were false. In any event, the Appellant’s Case focused on the First Representation.       </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the Judge erred in finding that vicarious liability was not made out</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 In the light of the above, the question of vicarious liability on the part of UOB is academic.

From early 2017 to August 2018, one Mr Ashley Wong Xianwei (“Wong”) served as Poh’s relationship manager with UOB. In late 2017, with Wong’s involvement, Poh invested a total of US$500,000 into PixelTrade (UK) Limited (“PixelTrade”). From January 2018, Poh tried to recover his investment in PixelTrade but was unable to get any of his money back.  </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">2 Poh therefore sued UOB, claiming that Wong had made seven representations to him which induced him to invest in PixelTrade. The first of these representations was the main one which Poh pursued in the High Court proceedings. This was that Wong had told him that PixelTrade was approved by UOB. Poh claimed that Wong had made the representations with no honest belief, no reasonable grounds for belief, and/or no <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> intention that they were true. Alternatively, Wong made them fraudulently or recklessly. Poh claimed that UOB was vicariously liable for Wong’s misrepresentations. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">3 The High Court judge (“the Judge”) found that Wong did not make the alleged misrepresentations. He alternatively found that even if Wong had made the misrepresentations, it would not be fair, just and reasonable to hold UOB vicariously liable since Wong’s representations were thoroughly contradicted by the documents which Poh received from UOB. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">4 Poh appealed. On appeal, Poh’s case focused on the first representation.</div><div class="txt-body text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The decision of the Appellate Division of the High Court</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">5 As parties agreed to dispense with an oral hearing and that the matter be heard by a <span class="font-italic">coram</span> of two judges, the court decided to do so to save judicial resources and reduce costs for both parties: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[1]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body text-left">6 The court dismissed the appeal. </div><div class="txt-body text-left">7 Poh’s Statement of Claim and affidavit of evidence-in-chief took the position that Wong had misrepresented to him that PixelTrade was UOB approved. However, in Poh’s opening statement and in his counsel’s cross-examination of Wong, he took the position that Wong had <span class="font-italic">failed </span>to inform him that PixelTrade had not been approved by UOB. The Judge had referred to this as a “sea change”. The court found that while the opening statement and transcript of the cross-examination did not show that Poh was abandoning his case on the first representation, it showed that Poh’s counsel had conflated the two positions, and this did not assist Poh: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[36]</span> to <span class="font-weight-bold">[44]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">8 There was no basis for the court to disturb the Judge’s finding that the first representation was not made. There was an inexplicable delay before Poh first complained about the alleged misrepresentation. Poh did not mention the first representation in the many meetings and correspondence that he had with Wong, UOB representatives, and PixelTrade representatives. This suggested that it was a mere afterthought: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[35]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[66]</span> to <span class="font-weight-bold">[90]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">9 While Poh relied on various evidence to support his case, these were equivocal and did not support his case. Further, while the evidence seemed to show that Wong had recommended PixelTrade to Poh, this did not mean that Wong had told Poh that PixelTrade was UOB approved: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[53]</span> to <span class="font-weight-bold">[58]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">10 Poh argued that the Judge erred in placing weight on various points which he should not have. The court disagreed with some of Poh’s arguments, finding that the Judge was entitled to draw the inferences which he did. Further, while the Judge may have erred in relying on certain points which he should not have, these would not have materially changed the outcome of Poh’s claim because the burden of proof lay on Poh to positively prove his case and he had not done so: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[59]</span> to <span class="font-weight-bold">[65]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">11 In the light of the above, it was not necessary for the court to deal with the question of vicarious liability: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[91]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">12 The court awarded costs of $40,000 to the respondent, inclusive of disbursements: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[92]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-italic">This summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the Court’s judgment.
