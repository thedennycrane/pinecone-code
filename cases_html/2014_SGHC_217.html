<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The
plaintiff was a candidate for the degree of Master of Arts in Architecture
in the School of Design and Environment of the defendant. The plaintiff
filed the present action against the defendant for wrongful termination
of her candidature.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The
plaintiff applied to amend her statement of claim (“SOC”). Extensive
amendments were proposed. The defendant objected only to three sub-paragraphs
in the proposed amended SOC, <em>ie</em>,
sub-paras 9.2.36 to 9.2.38, as they referred specifically to two
emails from the Ministry of Education (“MOE”) to the plaintiff dated
26 August 2011 and 13 September 2011 (“the MOE Emails”). The defendant
objected on the basis that the MOE Emails were sent on a without
prejudice basis and were therefore privileged from disclosure. The
defendant also submitted that a court had previously ruled that
the MOE Emails were privileged and therefore the principle of <em>res judicata</em> precluded the plaintiff from
referring to the MOE Emails. Alternatively, if there was no previous
ruling on the without prejudice issue, the defendant submitted that
the MOE Emails do enjoy such a privilege because they were sent
on a without prejudice basis and hence the disputed sub-paragraphs
should not be allowed. The plaintiff disputed that there was a previous
ruling on the issue. She also disputed that the MOE Emails were
sent on a without prejudice basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       An
assistant registrar (“AR”) rejected the defendant’s objection. The defendant
appealed. After hearing arguments, I allowed the appeal as I concluded
that the MOE Emails were sent on a without prejudice basis. Therefore
the disputed sub-paragraphs were not to be included in the amended
SOC. I set out below my reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The
first issue was whether there was a previous ruling that the MOE Emails
were sent on a without prejudice basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       If
not, the second issue was whether the MOE Emails were sent on a without
prejudice basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       On
28 June 2013, the plaintiff applied for further discovery of documents
in various categories. For Category 7, she requested production of
all documents and/or correspondence between the officers and agents
of the defendant and MOE for the period 9 May 2011- 15 August 2011,
which was later changed to 13 September 2011 (“the Category 7 Documents”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       On
12 September 2013, AR Shaun Leong dismissed the plaintiff’s entire
application for discovery including her application for the Category
7 Documents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The
plaintiff appealed against that decision in Registrar’s Appeal No 320
of 2013 (“the Discovery Appeal”). The Discovery Appeal was heard
and dismissed by Tan Siong Thye JC (as he then was) on 5 November
2013.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Thereafter,
the plaintiff sought leave to appeal against Tan JC’s decision.
The application for leave was dismissed by Tan JC on 15 January 2014.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On
29 May 2014, the plaintiff applied to amend her SOC by way of Summons
No 2671 of 2014. The proposed amendments included the disputed sub-paragraphs
which referred specifically to the MOE Emails.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     As
mentioned above, the defendant objected only to those sub-paragraphs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The arguments of the parties
on the first issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The
application to amend the SOC was heard by the same AR who heard
the plaintiff’s previous application for further discovery of documents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The
defendant argued that the two earlier decisions of AR Leong and Tan
JC in respect of the application for further discovery had decided
that the MOE Emails were sent on a without prejudice basis. Therefore, <em>res judicata</em> applied and it was not open
to the plaintiff to argue otherwise.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The
defendant referred to AR Leong’s brief grounds of decision in his earlier
decision where he said at [8]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">With regard to the documents in category
7, the supporting affidavit (at [62] and [63]) states that “the
[d]efendant has glaringly not disclosed any communications between
themselves and MOE for the period subsequent to their official response
to MOE, i.e. after 9 May 2011… It was not explained however, how
“all documents and/or correspondence” between the officers and agents
of the defendant and MOE for the period 9 May 2011 to 15 August
2011 (which was subsequently amended to 13 September 2011), as sought
for in the application, were relevant to the pleaded issues. There
was also no such explanation in the plaintiff’s written submissions.
I am also unsure of the basis in which the plaintiff could make
such a wide demand for “all documents and/or correspondence” between
the defendant and MOE during the stated period without specifying
the precise documents in which it seeks, and the reasons for doing
so. <em>If the plaintiff is seeking the disclosure
of any admissions made by the defendant in its correspondence with
MOE in relation to the pleaded disputes, which I must clarify here,
is not stated by the plaintiff, I am of the view that such admissions
and correspondence would in fact be of a “without prejudice” nature
and hence not subject to discovery, as the facts show that MOE was
acting in a mediatory capacity in a genuine attempt to assist the
plaintiff and the defendant to reconcile their differences.</em> [emphasis
added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     However,
notwithstanding his earlier observation, AR Leong rejected the defendant’s
objection to the disputed sub-paragraphs when he heard the plaintiff’s
application to amend her SOC on 23 July 2014. This is what AR Leong
said in respect of the disputed sub-paragraphs:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<u>Court’s
Brief Grounds of decision</u>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The defendant’s basis for its objection
to the disputed paragraphs is that these paragraphs contain references
to documents and/or communications that have already been determined
by the Court to be without prejudice and privileged. The defendant
submits that the plaintiff is seeking to re-litigate issues which
have already been determined by the court, and that the doctrine
of res judicata forbids the plaintiff from raising this issue again.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I disagree with the defendant. First, it
is very important to determine what the precise issues in question
are. In the discovery application before me, the question and threshold
which I had to determine was whether the documents sought to be
discovered were relevant and necessary to the pleaded issues in question.
I face a different question in the present amendment application before
me, which is, whether the proposed amendments would enable the real
questions or issues in controversy between the parties be determined
(see <em>Review Publishing Co Ltd and another v
Lee Hsien Loong and another appeal</em> [2010] 1 SLR 52).
Seen in this view, the defendant’s argument that the plaintiff is
seeking to <em>re-litigate issues</em> which
have been determined has no basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Second, I have to point out in any event
that the question of whether MOE was acting in a mediatory capacity
was <em>not an issue of dispute placed before me for
decision</em> during the discovery application; neither was
there substantive arguments made or heard on that point. This court
had merely attempted to reason in <em>obiter dicta</em> that
there is a good chance that the documents may be without prejudice
or privileged, as an additional reason to corroborate what would
be the court’s <em>ratio</em> in dismissing
the request for documents, which is that the request was made too
wide and that the basis of the request was not clear.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     As
mentioned above, the defendant then appealed against AR Leong’s decision
to allow the disputed sub-paragraphs to be included in the amended
SOC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Before
me, the defendant submitted that notwithstanding AR Leong’s latest
observation, Tan JC had in any event ruled on the issue whether
the MOE Emails were sent on a without prejudice basis. The defendant
argued that before AR Leong in the earlier application for further
discovery, they did rely on the argument about lack of relevance
of the Category 7 Documents in addition to the without prejudice
argument. However, the defendant stressed that before Tan JC, its
only argument in respect of the disclosure of the Category 7 Documents
was that they were sent on a without prejudice basis. Hence, when
Tan JC dismissed the plaintiff’s appeal for further discovery, he
must have decided that the Category 7 Documents were sent on that
basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Indeed,
the defendant pointed out that when the plaintiff applied for leave
to appeal to the Court of Appeal against Tan JC’s decision, the
written skeletal submissions of her then solicitors stated, at para
6:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is submitted that the above is particularly
true in the present instance, in which several important points
of law arise for consideration, which will benefit from the Court
of Appeal’s explication:-</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    Whether
or not “without prejudice” privilege can attach to a party’s communications
with a third party where the opposing party disagrees that the third
party is mediating the dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Therefore,
the plaintiff’s own solicitors had accepted that Tan JC had decided
that the Category 7 Documents were sent on a without prejudice basis.
The issue that her solicitors were raising to obtain leave to appeal
to the Court of Appeal was whether such a privilege could attach
to a party’s communication with a third party, <em>ie</em>,
MOE (where the plaintiff was disputing that MOE was a mediator).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The
plaintiff’s argument was that because no grounds of decision were
delivered by Tan JC, the reason for his decision to dismiss the plaintiff’s
appeal and, in particular, her appeal on the Category 7 Documents
was not clear. He could have dismissed her appeal on another ground,
for example, for lack of relevance or because her application was too
wide. As for the skeletal submissions for her application for leave
to appeal, those submissions were made by her previous solicitors.
While they did indicate that her previous solicitors themselves
did believe that Tan JC had ruled that the Category 7 Documents
were made on a without prejudice basis, it was still open to the
plaintiff to argue that Tan JC did not in fact rule on that basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The court’s reasons on the first
issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Before
I elaborate on the reasons for my decision on the first issue stated
above, I have a preliminary observation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Tan
JC would have been in the best position to say whether he had ruled
that the Category 7 Documents were sent on a without prejudice basis.
Indeed, the defendant’s appeal was fixed for hearing before Tan
JC and Tan JC had not refused to hear that appeal. However, in the
light of an objection by the plaintiff, it was fixed before me instead.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The
plaintiff had two main reasons for her objection to Tan JC which she
stated in her email dated 28 August 2014 to the Supreme Court Registry.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Her
first reason was that because Tan JC did not give reasons for his earlier
decisions in respect of the Discovery Appeal and her application
for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal, her counsel would have
to guess his reasons and prepare his arguments “based on quicksand”.
This was unfair to her and potentially unfair to the defendant.
She was concerned that her counsel might be surprised if Tan JC
revealed reasons which he himself only knew.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     I
did not think that the first objection was meritorious. If Tan JC
had heard the defendant’s appeal and had said that he had ruled
that the Category 7 Documents were sent on a without prejudice basis,
he would then decide whether that would give rise to an issue estoppel.
If so, that would be the end of the matter. If he had said he had
not ruled on that basis or that there was no issue estoppel in any
event, parties would proceed to argue before him whether the MOE
Emails were sent on a without prejudice basis. Solicitors for each
side would prepare their submissions accordingly.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     I
did not see how the parties’ solicitors would be in a better position
to prepare arguments if the defendant’s appeal was heard by another
judge. They would also not know what the other judge would say or
decide or his reasons before the hearing of the defendant’s appeal.
Secondly, the other judge would be in a less advantageous position
than Tan JC to decide what he did or did not decide and his reasons.
Thirdly, more time would be spent to persuade the other judge as
to what Tan JC did or did not decide or his reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     However,
the plaintiff had a second reason. She had filed an originating
summons (“OS”) to seek an order for JC Tan’s reasons to be given.
She said that her OS was, in effect, a complaint about Tan JC’s
refusal to give written reasons and therefore it was “plainly inappropriate”
for him to hear the defendant’s appeal. She stressed that she was
not accusing Tan JC of actually being biased but that in the light
of her OS, there would be a reasonable suspicion of bias and an
appearance of bias.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     As
mentioned above, the defendant’s appeal was then fixed for hearing
before me.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     I
was of the view that there was some merit in the defendant’s arguments
that Tan JC had ruled that the Category 7 Documents were made on
a without prejudice basis. First, that was the only reason the defendant
had raised before him when it objected to disclosure of that category.
Thus when he dismissed the plaintiff’s appeal, it was logical to conclude
that he did so on that basis for the Category 7 Documents. Secondly,
even the plaintiff’s own solicitors thought so as evidenced by their written
submissions for leave to appeal against his decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     On
the other hand, I was mindful that even though AR Leong had earlier
said in his brief grounds of decision for the discovery application that
the Category 7 Documents would in fact be on a without prejudice basis,
AR Leong subsequently said, for the plaintiff’s application to amend the
SOC, that his earlier comments were made <em>obiter</em>,
that is, he did not in fact make a ruling on the issue. Therefore,
it might be that Tan JC had not ruled on the without prejudice issue
too.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Secondly,
the Discovery Appeal before Tan JC involved not just one category
of documents. The Category 7 Documents were just one category in
question. It was possible that Tan JC might have dismissed that
appeal for this category on a different ground which was not in
fact argued for this category but which applied to the other categories
as well, <em>eg</em>, on the ground that
the category was too widely framed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     More
importantly, I noted that the Category 7 Documents pertained to
communication between the defendant and MOE.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Therefore,
even if Tan JC had ruled that communication between the defendant
and MOE was made on a without prejudice basis, that ruling would
not, strictly speaking, apply to the MOE Emails which were from MOE
to the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     I
should mention that aside from the argument about <em>res
judicata</em>, the defendant also argued that the plaintiff’s
attempt to include the MOE Emails in her SOC was an abuse of process
even if <em>res judicata</em> did not apply as
this attempt was a collateral attack on the previous decision of
Tan JC. In my view, this argument about an abuse of process was
based on the same premise, that is, that Tan JC had in fact already
ruled that communication between the defendant and MOE was made
on a without prejudice basis and that that ruling would extend to
the MOE Emails. Therefore, this argument did not add anything to
the <em>res judicata</em> argument on the
facts before me and I need not say anything more about it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     I
therefore considered the without prejudice issue afresh for the
MOE Emails.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The arguments of the parties
on the second issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The
plaintiff’s arguments were as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_a"></a>(a)     MOE
was not a mediator. She had never asked MOE to act as a mediator
in her complaint to MOE.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
MOE Emails were not marked “without prejudice”.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_c"></a>(c)     MOE
was a third party and the defendant could not invoke the without
prejudice privilege for emails emanating from a third party.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The
defendant’s arguments were as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_a"></a>(a)     MOE
was acting as a mediator.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_b"></a>(b)     Even
if it was not, this did not mean that communication from it was
necessarily outside the scope of the without prejudice privilege.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_c"></a>(c)     The
absence of an express marking of “without prejudice” on the MOE
Emails was not determinative.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_d"></a>(d)     The
substance of the MOE Emails showed that the defendant was making
an offer to settle the plaintiff’s complaint against the defendant.
Thus, in substance it was a genuine attempt to resolve the dispute
and enjoyed the without prejudice privilege.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_e"></a>(e)     The
defendant was entitled to enjoy that privilege as MOE was communicating
the defendant’s offer to the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The court’s reasons on the second
issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     I
noted that much of the plaintiff’s consternation was in respect
of the defendant’s argument that MOE was acting as a mediator. The
plaintiff stressed that she had never asked MOE to mediate in her
complaint.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The
plaintiff was right but only to a certain extent. MOE was not acting
as a mediator in that the plaintiff and the defendant did not agree
to appoint MOE as a mediator.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     However,
that did not mean that MOE could not act in a mediatory capacity.
A third party may try to mediate in a dispute without being formally
appointed as a mediator.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     In
the circumstances, it was the substance of MOE’s Emails that was important.
Were the emails part of a genuine attempt to resolve a dispute or not?
It was not disputed that if they were, then they would be considered
as having been sent on a without prejudice basis. I need not elaborate
as to why without prejudice communication is privileged from disclosure.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Before
I elaborate on the substance, I add that I agree that the absence of
the words “without prejudice” is not determinative in favour of
the plaintiff’s position, see <em>Sin Lian Heng
Construction Pte Ltd v Singapore </em><em>Telecommunications
Ltd</em> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 433 at [10] (“<em>Sin
Lian Heng</em>”). Indeed, the plaintiff’s counsel did not
seriously question this principle although he did make the argument
that those words were not used.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Conversely,
the use of such words does not always mean that the communication
enjoys the privilege if in fact there was no genuine attempt to
resolve a dispute. However, in the present context, it seems to
me that if such words had been used expressly, it might have dissuaded
the plaintiff from asserting that the MOE Emails did not enjoy the
without prejudice privilege.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     I
also think that there is some merit in the plaintiff’s criticism (through
counsel) that MOE and/or the defendant should have been more careful
to ensure that such words were expressly used in the MOE Emails
if the privilege was being claimed. However, again, the absence
of such words is not determinative.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     I
come back to the substance of the MOE Emails. The material part
of the MOE email dated 26 August 2011 to the plaintiff stated that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“To recap, your email of 30 June 2011 stated
two issues:-</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    Confirmation
of acceptance (in writing) of the University’s decisions regarding

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    The RO.85/2003 form duly completed

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.    To
address these, NUS has <b>proposed</b> that
you will not be required to accept in writing the University’s decision
on your complaints (a); or be required to sign Form RO.85/2003 (b),
provided that you accept that:-</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    NUS
will look to you to indemnify the University against all claims
or losses arising from any infringement in your thesis of any third
party intellectual property rights; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    NUS owns the copyright to your thesis
(as provided for in your Offer of Admission dated 15 Nov 2001, and
accepted 22 Nov 2001) and has the right to reproduce or publish
your thesis.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.    
              <b>If these conditions are acceptable to you</b>,
you should write in to the Registrar’s Office (Attn: Ms Jennifer
Yee, regymsj@nus.edu.sg) requesting to re-instate your candidature.
Upon reinstatement, you should then upload the electronic version
of your thesis to the NUS Digital Thesis repository. This will activate
the process for the conferment of the MA degree.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The
plaintiff’s email reply dated 31 August 2011 rejected these conditions
with her comments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Consequently,
MOE sent an email to the plaintiff dated 13 September 2011. The
material part of this email stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.    On
your remark that NUS has no right to impose additional requirements
given that it has dropped its previous ones, we wish to clarify that
NUS has re-considered your appeal through MOE thoroughly, and decided
to offer a concession to help expedite the re-instatement of your candidature
and the subsequent award of your degree. There are no new conditions
imposed and you would only need to acknowledge the position stated
in paragraph 2 of our earlier email dated 26 Aug 11 for a <b>full and final settlement of this </b><b>matter</b>. If you prefer, you may indicate
your wish to have your candidature re-instated through the acknowledgment
in your email reply to us for conveyance to NUS, after which you
will need to upload your thesis to NUS’s repository as NUS does
not have any record of your softcopy thesis in their file.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.    …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4.    We seek your understanding that while
we have assisted in highlighting your case to NUS, the Ministry
does not interfere in the decisions made by the autonomous universities
on its graduates. We hope that you would seriously consider accepting
the latest <b>offer made by NUS</b>. Should
you have further concerns, we recommend that you meet with NUS directly,
whose personnel will be happy to discuss and resolve the matter
with you, in order for you to graduate successfully.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     It
was clear to me that in the MOE Emails, MOE was making an offer on
behalf of the defendant to the plaintiff in a genuine attempt to
resolve the dispute between the parties. Therefore, the emails enjoyed
the without prejudice privilege.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     As
for the last argument by the plaintiff that the defendant could
not enjoy the privilege as the emails emanated from MOE and not
from the defendant, this argument was a non-starter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     If
a third party had made an offer on the plaintiff’s behalf to the defendant
to resolve the dispute, the plaintiff would be able to enjoy the same
privilege. It would not matter whether the offer came from her directly
or not. The point was that MOE was communicating the defendant’s
offer to the plaintiff for the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     I
add that even an unsolicited offer, which is sometimes referred
to as the first shot, may enjoy the same privilege, see <em>Sin Lian Heng</em> at [30]–[32].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     In
the circumstances, I concluded that the two MOE Emails were sent on
a without prejudice basis and were privileged from disclosure. Therefore,
the plaintiff was to remove the disputed sub-paragraphs from her
proposed amendments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     I
add that it is a pity that some time and money have been spent on this
issue. The plaintiff appeared to think that the MOE Emails could
be used as an admission by the defendant that it knew that the imposition
of certain conditions was unlawful and in excess of its obligations
and authority. It is questionable how much probative value the MOE
Emails would have had in the overall dispute, even if they were
admissible in evidence. However, I say no more on this.</p>
