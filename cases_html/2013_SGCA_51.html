<p class="Judg-Author">
        Andrew Phang Boon Leong JA (delivering the grounds of
                decision of the court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       As the late Lord Denning MR aptly put
                    it, “[w]ords are the lawyer’s tools of trade” (see
                    Lord Denning, <em>The Discipline of Law</em>
                    (Butterworths, London, 1979) (“<em>The Discipline of
                        Law</em>”) at p 5). The reason for this is clear; as the
                    learned Master of the Rolls proceeded to observe (<em>ibid</em>):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The reason why words are so important is because words are the vehicle of
                        thought. When you are working out a problem on your own – at your desk
                        or walking home – you think in words, not in symbols or numbers. When
                        you are advising your client – in writing or by word of mouth –
                        you must use words. There is no other means available.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       However, words – or in the context of the
                    present appeal, <em>a</em> word – might not always be
                    clear. There are various reasons for this. The same word might – without
                    even beginning to consider the context in which the word itself is used –
                    have completely different meanings (take, for example, the word
                    “toast” which may mean “bread in slices browned on both
                    sides by radiant heat”
                    <em>or</em> “a person … or thing in whose
                    honour a company is requested to drink”
                    <em>or</em> “a call to drink or an instance of
                    drinking in this way” (see <em>The Concise Oxford
                        Dictionary of Current English</em> (Clarendon Press, Oxford,
                    8th Ed, 1990) at p 1281)). In addition, a word with a certain specific
                    meaning might nevertheless mean different things in different contexts. Again,
                    Lord Denning put it well when he referred to difficulties stemming from
                    what he termed “the infirmity of the words themselves” (<em>The Discipline of Law</em> at p 5). But courts must
                    nevertheless arrive at considered (and definite as well as clear) decisions in
                    accordance with logic, principle and context in the case at hand. They must, in
                    this regard, utilise all relevant legal materials. And they must, of course,
                    assiduously avoid the approach of Humpty Dumpty in Lewis Carroll’s
                        <em>Through the Looking-Glass</em>
                    (Macmillan &amp; Co, London, 1871) (a sequel to the same
                    author’s equally famous book, <em>Alice’s Adventures
                        in Wonderland</em> (Macmillan &amp; Co, London, 1865)); in
                    particular, the court cannot make the word mean what <em>it</em> chooses it to mean. Again, to cite Lord Denning (albeit
                    from another book, <em>The Closing Chapter</em>
                    (Butterworths, London,1983) at p 58):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">So in the allegory Humpty Dumpty makes the word mean just what <em>he</em> chooses it to mean. When he does that, he is
                        riding for a fall. He does fall and is broken in pieces. We all know the
                        nursery rhyme … [emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       However, as just mentioned, ascertaining the
                    meaning of words is not always an easy task in practice. Indeed, the late
                    Prof Glanville Williams wrote a famous article almost seven decades ago,
                    which has stood the test of time and whose title is self-explanatory –
                    “Language and the Law”. It is a veritable <em>tour
                        de force</em> from both theoretical as well as practical points of
                    view, exploring virtually every aspect of language and the law (including even
                    the emotive function of words). However, the quantity as well as quality of the
                    various difficulties resulted in an unprecedented <em>five
                        part</em> article comprising a total of 87 pages and spanning two
                    volumes of <em>The Law Quarterly Review</em> (see (1945)
                    61 LQR 71, 179, 293 and 384, as well as (1946) 62 LQR 387) –
                    merely underscoring the immense difficulties concerned.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The present appeal was another (albeit more
                    specific as well as modest) instance of the difficulties encountered with the
                    meaning of words (or rather, as already mentioned, <em>a</em> word). As we shall see, the sole issue in this appeal against
                    the decision of the judge (“the Judge”) in <em>Global Distressed Alpha Fund I Ltd Partnership v PT Bakrie
                        Investindo</em> [2013] 2 SLR 429 (“the GD”) centred
                    on the meaning of the word “execution” in O 67 r 10(2)
                    of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the
                    Rules”). In particular, do examination of judgment debtor proceedings
                    (“EJD”) come within the meaning of the word
                    “execution” for the purposes of O 67 r 10(2) of the
                    Rules (“O 67 r 10(2)”)? Order 67 r 10 itself
                    reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1) Execution shall not issue on a judgment registered under the
                        [Reciprocal Enforcement of Commonwealth Judgments Act (Cap 264)] or
                        [Reciprocal Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act (Cap 265)] until after
                        the expiration of the period which, in accordance with Rule 5(2), is
                        specified in the order for registration as the period within which an
                        application may be made to set aside the registration or, if that period has
                        been extended by the Court, until after the expiration of that period as so
                        extended.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b><em>(2) </em></b>
<em>If an application is
                            made to set aside the registration of a judgment</em>, <b><em>execution </em></b><em>on the judgment shall
                            not issue until after such application is finally
                        determined.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3) Any party wishing to issue execution on a judgment registered under
                        the [Reciprocal Enforcement of Commonwealth Judgments Act (Cap 264)] or

                        produce to the Sheriff an affidavit of service of the notice of registration
                        of the judgment and any order made by the Court in relation to the
                        judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The Judge answered in the negative and an appeal
                    was brought against this decision. We dismissed the appeal and now give the
                    detailed grounds for our decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The proceedings below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The Appellant is an investment holding company
                    incorporated in the Republic of Indonesia. In 1996, it underwrote US$50m worth
                    of guaranteed notes issued by one of its subsidiaries. When the subsidiary was
                    unable to make good on those notes at maturity, the Appellant entered into a
                    composition plan with the creditors which was ratified by the courts in Jakarta.
                    On 16 November 2009, the Respondent purchased US$2m of the distressed notes
                    from a prior holder and commenced proceedings on the Appellant’s guarantee
                    on 14 December 2009 in the Commercial Court of England and Wales. Judgment
                    was entered in the Respondent’s favour on 17 February 2011 for the
                    sum of US$2m with interest to be assessed. Default costs totalling
                    £205,327.98 were also awarded on 10 June 2011. These two orders are
                    collectively referred to herein as “the UK
                Judgment”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The UK Judgment was registered as a judgment of
                    the High Court of Singapore pursuant to s 3 of the Reciprocal Enforcement
                    of Commonwealth Judgments Act (Cap 264, 1985 Rev Ed)
                    (“RECJA”) on 18 July 2011 (“the Registration
                    Order”). Following from this, the Respondent obtained an order to examine
                    one Robertus Bismarka Kurniawan (“Mr Kurniawan”), the former
                    Chairman of the Appellant’s Supervisory Board, as to the Appellant’s
                    assets (“the EJD Order”). On 31 August 2012, the Appellant
                    applied to set aside both the Registration Order and the EJD Order (“the
                    Setting Aside proceedings”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The present appeal arose from the
                    Appellant’s request for the examination of Mr Kurniawan to be
                    adjourned until the Setting Aside proceedings were finally disposed of by the
                    Court of Appeal. On 21 November 2012, the assistant registrar
                    (“AR”) dismissed the Appellant’s application for the
                    examination to be adjourned. On 17 December 2012, the Appellant’s
                    appeal against the AR’s decision was dismissed by the Judge below. The GD
                    was issued on 20 January 2013.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The Appellant appealed against the GD which
                    dealt with the following issues:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_a"></a>(a)     Whether an EJD comes within the
                        meaning of the word “execution” for the purposes of O 67
                        r 10(2) (“Issue 1”)?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_b"></a>(b)     Whether an application to set aside a
                        registration of a foreign judgment registered under the RECJA is considered
                        “finally determined” for the purposes of O 67
                        r 10(2) if the application is pending hearing before the Court of
                        Appeal (“Issue 2”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The main issue was Issue 1. Indeed, in
                    the court below, as the Judge had resolved that particular issue in the
                    Respondent’s favour, his decision on Issue 2 (as he acknowledged in
                    the GD at [33]) was, strictly speaking, <em>obiter
                        dicta</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Before proceeding to consider each of the
                    issues <em>seriatim</em>, it is important – for
                    reasons which will become apparent in a moment – to consider a preliminary
                    procedural point.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">A preliminary procedural point</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     There was a preliminary procedural point
                    which, as we shall see, was of crucial importance. This arose from the
                    Respondent’s submission to this court that the Appellant’s appeal in
                    the present case required leave from the Judge and that, in the circumstances,
                    as no leave had in fact been obtained, the notice of appeal must be struck out.
                    Whether the Respondent’s submission succeeded depended on whether the
                    application to adjourn the EJD was an “interlocutory application”.
                        Paragraph (<em>e</em>) of the Fifth Schedule to
                    the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) provides
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Except with the leave of a Judge, no appeal shall be brought to the Court
                        of Appeal in any of the following cases:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(<em>e</em>) where a Judge
                            makes an order at the hearing of any <em>interlocutory
                                application</em> other than an application for any of the
                            following matters:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-3">(i) for summary judgment;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-3">(ii) to set aside a default judgment;</p>

                                a pleading;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-3">(iv) to dismiss an action or a matter commenced by a writ of
                                summons or by any other originating process;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-3">(v) for further and better particulars;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-3">(vi) for leave to amend a pleading;</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The Respondent’s argument in this
                    particular regard was a straightforward one: the Appellant had applied only for
                    an <em>adjournment</em> of the EJD which had been granted
                    in favour of the Respondent and the Appellant’s substantive argument
                    against the EJD Order was, <em>inter alia</em>, the subject
                    of a separate appeal before this court as part of the Setting Aside proceedings
                    (which appeal was, in fact, also recently dismissed without any written grounds
                    in Civil Appeal No 145 of 2012). In the circumstances, the Respondent
                    argued that the dismissal of the application for an adjournment was an order
                    made at the hearing of an interlocutory application – for which leave to
                    appeal was required but not obtained. We found much force in this argument,
                    having regard not only to the Judge’s own view in this case (see the GD at
                    [1] and [7]) but also to the Setting Aside proceedings just mentioned. Indeed,
                    it did not make sense that the Appellant would mount a similar (and substantive)
                    attack on the EJD Order in two simultaneous sets of proceedings. It was then
                    clear, in our view, that the application before the Judge was an interlocutory
                    application which did not finally determine (as to which see the decisions of
                    this court in <em>Wellmix Organics (International) Pte Ltd v Lau
                        Yu Man</em> [2006] 2 SLR(R) 525 at [12]–[15] and <em>Dorsey James Michael v World Sport Group Pte Ltd</em> [2013]
                    3 SLR 354 (“<em>Dorsey James
                    Michael</em>”) at [90] (the latter commenting on this court’s
                    decision of <em>OpenNet Pte Ltd v Info-Communications Development
                        Authority of Singapore</em> [2013] 2 SLR 880 (“<em>OpenNet Pte Ltd</em>”))) any of the Appellant’s
                    claims under the Setting Aside proceedings. As such the notice of appeal in the
                    present case ought to have been struck out and the Appellant’s appeal had
                    to fail on this ground alone. However, as detailed arguments in both written and
                    oral forms were presented to us and as the legal issues in question (in
                    particular Issue 1) were significant ones, we will nevertheless proceed to
                    address them accordingly.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Our decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issue 1</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The crux of our decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     A point of some importance, in our view, was
                    in fact referred to briefly by the Judge (see the GD at [31], also quoted below
                    at [25]): that the application for an EJD order, whilst implemented via
                    O 48 of the Rules, is not mentioned in O 45 of the Rules which is a
                    general rule setting out the various modes by which a judgment or order for the
                    payment of money may be <em>enforced</em>. In so far as a
                    judgment or order for the payment of money (<em>not</em>
                    being a judgment or order for payment of money <em>into
                        Court</em>) is concerned, O 45 r 1(1) refers to the
                    following modes of execution: writ of seizure and sale, garnishee proceedings,
                    the appointment of a receiver as well as (where O 45 r 5 applies) an
                    order of committal. And, in so far as a judgment or order for the payment of
                    money <em>into Court</em> is concerned, O 45
                    r 1(2) refers to the following modes of execution: the appointment of a
                    receiver and (where O 45 r 5 applies) an order of committal. Like the
                    application for an EJD order (which, as mentioned, is implemented via
                    O 48), all these various modes of execution are also elaborated upon in
                    separate orders in the Rules themselves. <em>However</em>,
                    as already mentioned, it is significant, in our view, that <em>an
                        EJD</em> order is <em>not</em> included within
                    the specific modes of execution mentioned in O 45 r 1(1)–(2).
                    The reason for this is clear from <em>the nature and
                        functions</em> of an <em>EJD</em>
                itself.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Indeed, in Form 99 of the Rules (relating
                    to the affidavit in support of an application for an EJD order), it is stated at
                    para 3 that the application is “[i]n order to enable the plaintiff
                    to decide upon <em>the methods to employ to enforce</em>
                    the said judgment” [emphasis added]. Indeed, as Prof Jeffrey Pinsler
                    points out in his leading treatise on civil procedure in Singapore, <em>Singapore Court Practice 2009</em> (LexisNexis, 2009), at
                    para 48/1/1:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The rules provide a process for the examination of the judgment debtor so
                        that information as to his means may be obtained <em>for the
                            purpose of </em><b><em>determining the appropriate
                            mode of enforcement</em></b>. (In <em>Re Sassoon
                            Ezekiel</em> [1933] MLJ 245, at 246, the process was said to be
                            ‘<b><em>discovery in aid of
                        execution</em></b>’.). … The official process of examination
                        is <em>useful because it may </em><b><em>confirm and supplement </em></b><em>any existing
                            </em><b><em>information </em></b><em>which the judgment creditor might have by allowing him to
                            </em><b><em>obtain additional or new information
                            </em></b><em>which may be available

                        [emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     It is clear, in our view, that an EJD order is
                        <em>not – in and of itself –</em> a
                        <em>mode of execution</em> of a judgment. It is
                    intended to aid the judgment creditor (here, the Respondent) in garnering
                    additional <em>information</em> which might – or
                    might not – result in the implementation of actual <em>execution</em> of the judgment concerned (see also the decision of
                    the English Chancery Division reported in <em>Republic of Costa
                        Rica v Strousberg</em> (1880) 16 Ch D 8 (“<em>Costa Rica v Strousberg</em>”) at 10, <em>per</em> Malins VC, which was overturned on appeal but
                    not on this point; the GD at [26]–[30], citing the English Court of Appeal
                    decision of <em>Fagot v Gaches</em> [1943] 1 KB 10;
                    the Singapore High Court decision of <em>United Overseas Bank Ltd
                        v Thye Nam Loong (S) Pte Ltd</em> [1994] SGHC 262; as well as the
                    Straits Settlements (Singapore) decision of <em>Re Sassoon
                        Ezekiel</em> [1933] MLJ 245 (the last-mentioned decision which was in
                    fact cited by Prof Pinsler (see above at [15]))). In other words, an EJD
                    order does not <em>effect</em> the judgment of the court
                    but it may render that judgment more <em>effective</em>. It
                    is also worth noting that in the UK, the EJD order is provided for under
                    Part 71 of the Civil Procedure Rules 1998 (SI 1998 No 3132) (UK),
                    the preamble to which states that it contains “rules which provide for a
                    judgment debtor to be required to attend court to provide information, <em>for the purpose of </em><b><em>enabling
                        </em></b><em>a judgment creditor to enforce a judgment or
                        order against him</em>” [emphasis added in italics and bold
                    italics]. Further, such an order can be obtained even where the enforcement of
                    the judgment has been stayed (see <em>Civil Procedure</em>
                    vol 1 (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2013) at para 71.2.8 citing the
                    English High Court decision of <em>Sucden Financial Ltd v
                        Fluxo-Cane Overseas Ltd</em> [2009] EWHC 3555 (QB), 4 December
                    2009, unreported).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In the circumstances, an EJD is <em>quite different from</em> the <em>bankruptcy
                        notice</em> which was the focus of the Singapore High Court decision
                    of <em>Re Cheah Theam Swee, ex parte Equiticorp Finance Group Ltd
                        and another</em> [1996] 1 SLR(R) 24 (“<em>Cheah Theam Swee</em>”), wherein it was held that a bankruptcy
                    notice did fall within the meaning of “execution” under
                        s 3(3)(<em>b</em>) of the RECJA, which provides
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(<em>b</em>) the registering court shall have the
                        same control and jurisdiction over the judgment as it has over similar
                        judgments given by itself, but <em>in so far only as relates
                            to execution under this section</em>; [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Indeed, <em>unlike</em>
                    an EJD, a bankruptcy notice is the first legal step towards the <em>enforcement</em> of the judgment itself by way of a securing
                    of the judgment debtor’s assets; viewed in this light, it is not unlike
                    the modes of enforcement already referred to above at [14] (for example, a writ
                    of seizure and sale as well as garnishee proceedings). Whilst, however, it is
                    true that a bankruptcy notice would entail more than what is involved when the
                    traditional modes of execution are concerned, this does not detract from the
                    fact that the issuance of a bankruptcy notice <em>includes</em> the <em>same</em> purpose as the
                    traditional modes of execution. This is a critical distinction, especially since
                    the Appellant had relied almost solely on <em>Cheah Theam
                        Swee</em> in attempting to make out its case in the context of the
                    present appeal. Whilst it could be argued that an EJD might also lead ultimately
                    to a securing of the judgment debtor’s assets, this is <em>not</em> its <em>predominant</em> purpose which
                    is (as we have just noted) the garnering of additional <em>information</em> and which is, in our view, <em>one
                        prior step removed</em> when compared to the issuance of a bankruptcy
                    notice. Looked at in this light, it is our view that there is in fact a real
                    distinction between an EJD on the one hand and the issuance of a bankruptcy
                    notice on the other.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     This is also borne out by the historical
                    development of the two orders. The direct ancestry of the EJD procedure can be
                    traced to s 60 of the Common Law Procedure Act 1854 (17 &amp; 18
                    Vict c 125) (UK), which provided that a judgment creditor could apply to
                    the court for an order that the judgment debtor be orally examined in relation
                    to any debts owing. Prior to this, the oral examination of the judgment debtor
                    did not appear to be part of the procedure of either the common law or chancery
                    courts (see <em>Costa Rica v Strousberg</em> at 9,
                        <em>per</em> Malins VC). However, a similar order
                    was available in the Court of Bankruptcy established by the Bankruptcy Court
                    (England) Act 1831 (1 &amp; 2 Will IV c 56) (UK). In the
                    18th century, imprisonment for debt was a common means of enforcement
                    against judgment debtors (on which see William Cornish <em>et
                        al</em>, <em>The Oxford History of the Laws of
                        England</em> vol 12 (Oxford University Press, 2010) at
                    pp 797–803). The hardship of such an enforcement mechanism prompted
                    numerous reforms, including the passage of the Execution Act 1844
                    (7 &amp; 8 Vic c 96) (UK) which allowed judgment debtors to file
                    a Petition for Protection from Process so as to prevent his committal or
                    continued detention. Section 5 of the Act gave the Commissioner of the
                    Court of Bankruptcy a broad power to compel the attendance of the petitioner
                    (and also <em>inter alia</em> his wife, creditors, and any
                    other person in possession of the petitioner’s property) to be examined
                    regarding his person, trade, business, calling, dealings or property in this
                    connection. It would therefore appear that a variant of this procedure was
                    adopted into the wider apparatus of the common law courts in 1854. Subsequently,
                    in the Debtors Act 1869 (32 &amp; 33 Vic c 62) (UK), it was
                    provided that imprisonment for debt could only be imposed if it could be shown
                    that the judgment debtor had the means to pay but refused or neglected to do so.
                    Section 5(2) of that Act provided for the examination of the judgment
                    debtor on oath for this purpose. Indeed, our present Bankruptcy Act
                    (Cap 20, 2009 Rev Ed) also provides for the examination of the
                    bankrupt under s 83(1), in relation to which the EJD procedure under
                    O 48 of the Rules can be considered a distant cousin. Thus it can be seen
                    that the modern day EJD procedure has its origins as an <em>ancillary</em> process to bankruptcy proceedings whereby an EJD has
                    always been both instrumental and anterior to execution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     However, in fairness to the Appellant, this is
                    not the end of the matter in so far as this appeal is concerned because it could
                    be argued that the analysis just set out is consistent with a <em>narrow</em> reading of the word “execution” in
                    O 67 r 10(2), whereas the approach
                    Warren L H Khoo J adopted in <em>Cheah Theam
                        Swee</em> constituted a <em>broad</em> reading of
                    the same word (albeit in the context of s 3(3) of the RECJA). The learned
                    judge’s reasoning in this regard was as follows (at
                    [20]–[26]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">20    What then is the effect of [s 3(3)(<em>b</em>) of the RECJA], where it is provided that the
                            registering court has the same control and jurisdiction over the
                            registered judgment as it has over its own judgments, “but in so
                            far only as relates to the execution under this
                        section”?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">21    As pointed out by the learned editors of <em>Halsbury's Laws of England</em> vol 17
                            (Butterworths, 4th Ed) at para 401, the word
                            “execution” can mean one of two things. In its wide sense,
                            it signifies the enforcement of or giving effect to the judgments or
                            orders of courts of justice. In its narrower sense, it means the
                            enforcement of those judgments or orders by a public officer under the
                            various modes of execution provided by rules of court, such as writs of
                                <em>fi fa</em>, possession,
                        delivery.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">22    It seems to me that in the context of s 3 of
                            the Act and the Act as a whole, it is more than likely that the word
                            “execution” in para (<em>b</em>)
                            [of s 3(3) of the RECJA] has the wider meaning, rather than the
                            narrower. Since the Act, or s 3, does not refer to the various
                            modes of execution of a registered judgment, it is difficult to construe
                            the words “execution under this section” as meaning
                            execution in the narrower sense.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">23    It appears to me that para (<em>b</em>) [of s 3(3) of the RECJA] can easily be read
                                <em>as merely intending to enact the rule that a
                                defendant who desires to impeach the original judgment must do so in
                                the originating court, and not in the registering court.</em>
                            This impression is reinforced by the existence of the provisions in the
                            previous two subsections of the Act. Firstly, under sub-s (1), the
                            registering court has to satisfy itself that it is just and convenient
                            that the judgment should be enforced in Singapore. Secondly, it is
                            provided that a judgment should not be registered if any of the
                            circumstances set out in sub-s (2) applies. <em>The
                                purpose of para (b) of sub-s (3), it seems to me, is that
                                once a judgment has passed the hurdles set out in sub-ss (1)
                                and (2), and has been registered, it </em><b><em>must be given effect according to its terms</em></b><em>. No proceedings to impeach its validity are to be allowed.
                                In other words the judgment debtor is not permitted to go behind the

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">24    Paragraph (<em>b</em>)
                            [of s 3(3) of the RECJA] <em>gives the registering
                                court the same control and jurisdiction over the registered judgment
                                as if it was a judgment of its own</em>. <b><em>Without the words “but in so far as relates to the execution
                                under this section”, it might be open to the judgment debtor
                                to argue that the registering court has the jurisdiction to
                                entertain proceedings to impeach the registered judgment, on ground
                                such as that the original court had made a mistake of fact or of
                                law. The purpose of adding this qualification in para (b), it
                                seems to me, is to forestall this possibility, so that once the
                                judgment has passed the hurdle set out in sub-ss (1) and (2),
                                it is to be treated as final and conclusive. If the judgment debtor
                                wishes to challenge it on any ground not set out in those
                                subsections, he has to go before the originating court, and not the
                                registering court. In other words, the intention of para (b) of
                                sub-s (3) is to confer a jurisdiction on the registering court
                                to carry out the terms of the registered judgment, once it has been
                                registered, and to entertain all proceedings to that end, but not
                                proceedings seeking to go back on the
                        judgment.</em></b></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">25    It follows that when considering the question
                            whether bankruptcy proceedings may be taken on a registered judgment on
                            the strength of sub-s (3) [of s 3 of the RECJA], the question to be
                            asked is not whether such proceedings are a form of
                            “execution” in the sense, for example, that a writ of
                            seizure and sale is a form of execution. <em>The relevant
                                question, rather, is whether they are proceedings properly taken on
                                the registered judgment as a final and conclusive judgment, as
                                opposed to proceedings seeking to impeach the existence or validity
                                of the judgment.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">26    For these reasons, I would hold that on a proper
                            construction of these provisions of the Act a bankruptcy notice can be
                            founded upon a judgment registered under the Act.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     With respect, we are of the view that the
                    judge in <em>Cheah Theam Swee</em>, whilst correct in
                    adopting a broad reading of the word “execution” in
                        s 3(3)(<em>b</em>) of the RECJA, had stated that
                    reading rather <em>too</em> broadly. Consistent with the
                    analysis set out above (at [16]–[18]), the <em>predominant
                        purpose</em> of the proceedings concerned must be to <em>ultimately</em> achieve what the more traditional forms of
                    execution mentioned in O 45 r 1(1)–(2) of the Rules (referred to
                    above at [14]) would accomplish. This is not, in fact, inconsistent with
                    Khoo J’s own conclusion (<em>Cheah Theam
                        Swee</em> at [24], extracted in the preceding paragraph) to the effect
                    that s 3(3)(<em>b</em>) of the RECJA was “to
                    confer a jurisdiction on the registering court <em>to carry out
                        the terms of the registered judgment</em>, once it has been
                    registered, <em>and to entertain all proceedings to that
                        end</em>, but not proceedings seeking to go back on the
                    judgment” [emphasis added]. Put simply, the phrase “all
                    proceedings”
                    <em>must have, as the final objective, the enforcement</em>
                    of the judgment concerned in the so-called <em>narrower</em> sense. Even allowing for the fact that certain
                    proceedings <em>might</em> involve <em>other</em> matters, it is, in our view, clear that, at the very
                    least, the <em>predominant purpose</em> of such proceedings
                    must be to <em>ultimately</em> give effect to the <em>enforcement</em> of the judgment in the <em>narrower</em> sense which is encompassed within the more traditional
                    modes of execution referred to above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     If the less radical approach (from predominant
                    purpose) set out in the preceding paragraph had been adopted by Khoo J in
                        <em>Cheah Theam Swee</em>, the <em>same</em> result would have been arrived at by the court, albeit
                    without the use of the much broader approach which the learned judge utilised in
                    that case and which stretched unduly (or even, with respect, distorted) the
                    meaning of “execution”. However, as just alluded to, we agree with
                    Khoo J to the extent that, given the nature and function of not only the
                    RECJA but also the Reciprocal Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act
                    (Cap 265, 2001 Rev Ed) (“REFJA”) as well as O 67
                    r 10(2), a <em>slightly</em> broader reading of
                    “execution” in the manner just described would be appropriate. The
                    need for a slightly broader reading is, in fact, buttressed by the reasoning of
                    Lai Kew Chai J in the Singapore High Court decision of <em>Re Tan Patrick, ex parte Walter Peak Resorts Ltd (in
                        receivership)</em> [1994] 2 SLR(R) 379 (“<em>Re Patrick Tan</em>”) where the learned judge had to
                    consider the same issue (<em>viz</em>, whether a bankruptcy
                    notice fell within the purview of the word “execution” in
                    s 3(3) of the RECJA). In this regard, Lai J was of the view that the
                    use of the more general word “proceedings” in
                        s 4(2)(<em>b</em>) of the old Reciprocal
                    Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act (Cap 265, 1985 Rev Ed) (“the old
                    REFJA”) (now s 4(4)(<em>b</em>) of the REFJA)
                    (which <em>would</em> cover a bankruptcy notice) was to be
                    read with s 4(2)(<em>d</em>) (now s 4(4)(<em>d</em>) of the REFJA) of the same Act, in which the phrase
                    “so far as only as relates to execution” in s 3(3)(<em>b</em>) of <em>the RECJA</em> had been
                    omitted. The learned judge arrived, in the circumstances, at the conclusion (at
                    [14]) that there was nothing in s 4(2) of <em>the old
                        REFJA</em> “which limits the jurisdiction of the courts over
                    foreign judgments registered under the REFJA to matters relating to
                    execution”. Lai J then proceeded to observe thus (at [16]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Although structured differently, the relevant provisions of the REFJA and
                        the RECJA are couched in similar enough terms to make it clear that the two
                        Acts <em>were meant to </em><b><em>complement </em></b><em>one another</em>.
                            <b><em>That being so and for the sake of consistency, it is
                            necessary to bring the two Acts in line with each other. Given that
                            s 4 of the REFJA cannot be interpreted to exclude the issue of a
                            notice of bankruptcy from the jurisdiction of the registering court, it
                            follows that the jurisdiction of the courts under the RECJA ought not to
                            be restricted to strict matters of execution.</em></b> For this
                        reason, I was of the view that we should not follow the cases of <em>In re Watson</em> and <em>In re A
                            Bankruptcy Notice</em> ... In my view, therefore,
                            s 3(3)(<em>b</em>) [of the RECJA] ought not to
                        limit the otherwise general operation of s 3(3)(<em>a</em>) [of the RECJA]. Quite clearly, para (<em>a</em>) contemplates bankruptcy proceedings and if
                            para (<em>b</em>) is read independently of
                            para (<em>a</em>), then there is no reason why
                        it should operate to limit the scope of para (<em>a</em>). [emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Although Lai J utilised the above reasoning in arriving at his
                    conclusion that a bankruptcy notice fell within the purview of
                        s 3(3)(<em>b</em>) of the RECJA, we are
                    respectfully of the view that, whilst such reasoning is helpful in the manner
                    just outlined, it cannot – in and of itself – constitute the main
                    (let alone sole) reason for the conclusion just mentioned.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Returning to the issue at hand, although a
                        <em>slightly broader</em> reading of the word
                    “execution” in s 3(3)(<em>b</em>) of the
                    RECJA is necessary (albeit not as broad as that suggested by Khoo J in
                        <em>Cheah Theam Swee</em>), a <em>balanced</em> approach is nevertheless imperative and, to this end,
                    the criterion ought, in our view (and for the reasons set out above), to be that
                    centring on the predominant purpose of the proceedings concerned. Looked at in
                    this light, it is clear that an EJD clearly does <em>not</em> fall within the ambit of “execution” as the
                        <em>predominant purpose</em> of such proceedings is the
                    garnering of additional <em>information</em> which might
                    – or might not – result in the implementation of actual <em>execution</em> of the judgment concerned (see also above at
                    [16]). In the circumstances, therefore, it follows that the word
                    “execution” does <em>not</em> include an EJD
                    for the purposes of O 67 r 10(2).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     However, in fairness to Khoo J in
                        <em>Cheah Theam Swee</em>, to the extent that a
                    bankruptcy notice does <em>not</em> lead <em>immediately</em> to the enforcement of the judgment concerned, it
                    could be said that regarding a bankruptcy notice as falling within the ambit of
                    “execution” is a “broader” reading of sorts. That
                    having been said, as already explained above (at [17]), the situation in which a
                    bankruptcy notice is issued is still <em>quite distinct
                        from</em> an EJD which is <em>(at best) much more
                        distantly related to “execution” as it is traditionally
                        conceived</em>. However, this “distant” relationship is
                    not wholly irrelevant and might yet raise an alternative argument for the actual
                    approach adopted by Khoo J in <em>Cheah Theam
                        Swee</em>. And it is to a consideration of that possible alternative
                    argument that our attention must now turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">A more literal interpretation?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     As alluded to at the outset of these grounds
                    of decision, there remain (further) problems of <em>language</em> with regard to the word “execution”.
                    Notwithstanding the analysis which we have just proffered, we do note that
                    – from a strict linguistic (or perhaps, more appropriately, literal)
                    perspective – it might also be (and has been) argued that the word
                    “execution” might include any step taken pursuant to actual
                    execution of the judgment concerned. Indeed, the Judge was alive to this
                    possibility in the court below, but concluded thus (see the GD at
                    [31]–[32]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">31    It is true that an EJD can only be ordered once
                            judgment has been obtained by the judgment creditor. <b><em>In that sense</em></b>, an EJD <b><em>is a
                                step</em></b> taken towards the enforcement of a judgment because
                            it is a post-judgment proceeding that furthers the successful
                            plaintiff’s interest in obtaining the fruits of his judgment.
                                <b><em>Yet, the proposition that an EJD is a thing
                                apart from the typical forms of execution is supported by the
                                structure of the Rules. Order 45, which deals with the methods
                                of enforcing judgments, refers to various writs of execution,
                                garnishee proceedings, the appointment of a receiver and an order of
                                committal as means by which a judgment can be enforced. In this
                                regard, the application for an EJD is notably absent from O 45
                                and is instead found in O 48.</em></b></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">32    On this basis, even if “execution”
                            should take on the wide meaning, then <b><em>unless</em></b> it is construed in its <em>loosest</em> sense to include <em>any
                                step</em> taken towards the enforcement of a judgment, I am of
                            the view, having regard to the nature of an EJD, that it would still not
                            fall within “execution” in O 67
                        r 10(2).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in italics in original; emphasis added in bold italics and
                        underlined bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Hence, the Judge arrived at the conclusion
                    that this (literal) reading ought to be rejected by referring – as has
                    this court – to the rather <em>different</em> nature
                    of an EJD, compared to procedures which, in point of fact, effect actual
                    execution of the judgment concerned. We would only add that the rejection of
                    this (literal) reading is buttressed by a <em>purposive</em> reading of O 67 r 10(2) as well. It is, of
                    course, true that, depending on the precise legislation (or part thereof) in
                    question, the literal language could well <em>coincide</em>
                    with the purpose of the same. <em>However</em>, where there
                    is a conflict between the literal language on the one hand and the purpose of
                    the legislation (or part thereof) on the other, it is clear that the latter must
                    prevail (and see, for example, s 9A of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1,
                    2002 Rev Ed); the seminal Singapore High Court decision of <em>PP
                        v Low Kok Heng</em> [2007] 4 SLR(R) 183 at [39]–[57]; as
                    well as the recent decisions of this court in <em>OpenNet Pte
                        Ltd</em>, especially at [15] and <em>Dorsey James
                        Michael</em> at [16]–[20]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The purposive interpretation trumps the literal
                interpretation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Turning then to broader considerations which
                    are consistent with a purposive approach towards O 67 r 10(2), it is
                    clear, in our view, that the predominant purpose of “execution” in
                    this rule must (as we have explained above) have, as its <em>ultimate</em> objective, <em>the execution of the
                        judgment concerned in its traditional sense. Only then would the purpose of
                        not only O 67 r 10(2) but also the RECJA and the REFJA be
                        fulfilled. Any other interpretation would result in a failure of substantive
                        purpose inasmuch as both the RECJA and the REFJA are intended to give effect
                        to the foreign judgment concerned and this can only be accomplished by the
                        Singapore court not (as Khoo J emphasised in</em> Cheah Theam
                        Swee<em>) by re-opening the substantive merits of that
                        judgment but, rather, by proceedings which will lead to actual execution of
                        the judgment itself.</em> Indeed, we would add that, even allowing for
                    the delay incurred by the judgment creditor (the Respondent in the present
                    appeal) if an EJD is postponed until a setting aside application is finally
                    determined, there is also the prospect of judicial time and court resources
                    being wasted if it transpires upon examination that the judgment debtor is a man
                    of straw. Conversely, if the judgment creditor were permitted to examine the
                    judgment debtor during the pendency of the setting aside proceedings, it might
                    elect not to contest those proceedings if it becomes apparent that there are no
                    worthwhile assets for execution in Singapore. From an institutional perspective,
                    therefore, it is clear that the early conduct of an EJD would be preferable.
                    However, it should be noted that there are some loose ends to be tied
                up.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Some loose ends</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     At this juncture, we have some comments on the
                    Judge’s observation that the Appellant had “used the wrong starting
                    point” inasmuch as it (the Appellant) ought to have compared O 67
                    r 10(2) with s 4(5) of the REFJA instead as the former had
                    “[adopted] the wording” of the latter (see the GD at [21]). The
                    following (and further) observations by the Judge (at [20]–[22]), which
                    will figure in the analysis that follows, might also be usefully set out at this
                    point:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">20    [Counsel for the
                            Appellant] submitted that O 67 must be consistent with and
                            facilitative of its empowering statute (<em>ie</em>, the RECJA) and therefore the meaning of
                            “execution” in O 67 r 10(2) must have the same
                            meaning as “execution” in the RECJA (as interpreted by
                                <em>Re Cheah Theam Swee</em>). For this
                            submission, he relied on Warren Khoo J’s dicta (at
                            [22]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Since [RECJA], or s 3 [RECJA], does not refer to the various
                            modes of execution of a registered judgment, it is difficult to construe
                            the words ‘execution under this section’ as meaning
                            execution in the narrower sense.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">21    However, [counsel for the Appellant’s]
                            argument appears to have used the wrong starting point. Even if his
                            argument is accepted in principle, given that O 67 r 10 adopts
                            the wording of s 4(5) of the REFJA (see [19] above), the analysis
                            should perhaps have started with the meaning of
                            “execution” in the REFJA and not the RECJA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">22    It seems clear from <em>Patrick
                                Tan</em> that s 4(4) of the REFJA, like s 3(3) of
                            the RECJA, deals with the <em>scope</em> of the
                            Singapore court’s jurisdiction over a foreign judgment, as opposed
                            to purely procedural matters, which is what s 4(5) of the RECJA
                            (and correspondingly, O 67 r 10) deals with. It is therefore
                            not necessarily the case that “execution’ should bear the
                            same meaning in s 4(5) of the REFJA and in O 67
                            r 10.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The Judge was of the view that the meaning of
                    the word “execution” should have been analysed by reference to
                        <em>the REFJA instead of the RECJA</em> (see the GD at
                    [20]). Adopting such an approach, he was of the further view (citing <em>Re Patrick Tan</em>) that s 4(5) of the REFJA (and,
                    correspondingly, O 67 r 10(2)) dealt with “purely procedural
                    matters” (see the GD at [22]) – whereas s 3(3) of the RECJA
                    (which was, it will be recalled, interpreted in <em>Cheah Theam
                        Swee</em>) and s 4(4) of the REFJA dealt with “the
                        <em>scope</em> of the Singapore court’s
                    jurisdiction over a foreign judgment” [emphasis in original] (see
                        <em>ibid</em>). The Judge then reasoned that, because
                    of the distinction just mentioned, the word “execution” in
                    s 4(5) of the REFJA (and, correspondingly, in O 67 r 10(2)) would
                    not necessarily bear the same meaning as that in s 3(3) of the RECJA
                    (which, it will be recalled, was given a <em>broad</em>
                    reading by Khoo J in <em>Cheah Theam
                    Swee</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     He then proceeded (see the GD at [24]) to
                    demonstrate that whilst s 4(4)(<em>d</em>) referred to
                    “execution”, s 4(4)(<em>b</em>) of the
                    REFJA referred to “proceedings” and that in <em>Re
                        Patrick Tan</em>, Lai J had (as noted above at [22]) held that
                    the word “proceedings” in what is now s 4(4)(<em>b</em>) of the REFJA “encompasses bankruptcy
                    proceedings”. The Judge then proceeded to observe as follows (see
                        <em>ibid</em>):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">24    … Clearly, such an interpretation of
                            “proceedings” is broad enough to cover an EJD as well. The
                            question then is this: in the light of the broad construction of
                            “proceedings” in s 4(4) of the REFJA, was it still
                            necessary to construe the word “execution” in s 4(4)
                            of the REFJA widely in order to demarcate the boundaries of the court's
                            jurisdiction in relation to foreign judgments registered under the
                            REFJA? It would seem, therefore, that unlike the case of
                                s 3(3)(<em>b</em>) of the RECJA, nothing
                            in the plain language of s 4(2) of the REFJA requires
                            “execution” to have a wide meaning in order to give effect
                            to the legislative intention of the REFJA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     We would respectfully note that there is no
                    reason in principle why, even in s 4(4) of the REFJA, the word
                    “execution” should not be construed in a somewhat broader sense
                    (as explained above at [21]–[23]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     We also note the following observations by the
                    Judge in the court below (see the GD at [25]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">25    One must also have sufficient regard for the
                            context in which “execution” is used in O 67
                            r 10 (and correspondingly in s 4(4) of the REFJA), <em>ie</em>, the words “execution ... shall not
                            issue”. On a plain and natural reading of the provision, the word
                            “issue” in relation to “execution” is likely
                            to be shorthand for the issuing of a writ of execution or such other
                            enforcement procedures which have similar consequences for the judgment
                            debtor as a writ of execution. If so, this lends itself to the narrow
                            construction of “execution” and an EJD (the nature of
                            which is discussed below) would not fall within this narrow
                            meaning.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     With respect, the observations set out in the
                    preceding paragraph – to a large extent –
                    <em>assume what precisely needs to be proved</em>. In our
                    view, that proof finds its source in ascertaining (as we have above at
                    [21]–[23]) <em>the precise nature and function of
                        “execution” which, as we have sought to demonstrate, admits of
                        only one clear approach and which therefore excludes an EJD in the context
                        of, inter alia, O 67 r 10(2). It is also significant that the
                        Judge, again in the observations set out in the preceding paragraph, refers
                        (in the final sentence) to the nature of an EJD, which is the central topic
                        of the next part of his judgment and which centres precisely around the
                        nature and function of “execution” itself.</em> Put
                    simply, both sets of observations by the Judge (quoted above at [28] and [32])
                    are, with great respect, unpersuasive and disregarding them does not detract
                    – in any way – from the Judge’s own analysis and (more
                    importantly) conclusion to the effect that the word “execution”
                    does <em>not</em> include an EJD for the purposes of
                    O 67 r 10(2) (see the GD at [26]–[32]). Indeed, we are in total
                    agreement with the Judge to the extent that he relies, in the main at least, on
                    the nature and function of “execution” as explored in its
                    legislative context (see <em>ibid</em>) as it is consistent
                    with our own analysis above (at [21]–[23]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">No prejudice to the judgment debtor</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The (more general) issue remains as to whether
                    undue prejudice to the judgment debtor (here, the Appellant) would ensue if the
                    approach set out above is adopted. This issue is not an unimportant one since it
                    brings into focus the question of <em>fairness</em> to the
                    judgment debtor as the Judge’s conclusion on Issue 1 has been
                    affirmed. In our view, there would be no such prejudice because the judgment
                    debtor would always be free to apply to the court for <em>a
                        stay</em> of the EJD.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     It is clear, therefore, that, based on logic
                    and principle as well as a purposive approach, the word
                    “execution” (as demonstrated in our analysis of Issue 1) does
                        <em>not</em> include an EJD for the purposes of
                    O 67 r 10(2), and we therefore found in favour of the Respondent in so
                    far as Issue 1 was concerned.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issue 2</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     As in the court below, in the light of our
                    decision on Issue 1 above, it was unnecessary to decide Issue 2. This
                    was particularly the case because the Appellant had – correctly, in our
                    view – focused on Issue 1. It also seems to us that a definitive
                    ruling with regard to this particular issue would be more appropriate in a later
                    case, although we would observe that the Judge’s reasoning and conclusion
                    on this issue (see the GD at [33]–[44]) seem to us to be quite
                    persuasive.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     For the reasons set out above, we dismissed
                    the appeal with costs of $25,000 (including disbursements) to be awarded to the
                    Respondent, and the usual consequential orders.</p>
