The NCOA is a registered society under the Societies Act (Cap 311, 2014 Rev Ed) (“the Societies Act”). It is governed by rules set out in a document entitled “Constitution of the Neptune Court Owners’ Association” (“the NCOA Constitution”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 Pursuant to Rule 7 of the NCOA Constitution, each member of the NCOA pays a monthly subscription fee.

By way of background, Neptune Court was built by the Singapore government in 1975 as a housing benefit for civil servants. While the 752 units within Neptune Court are held by individual owners (“unit owners”), the land and common areas of the estate (“the Land and Common Areas”) are owned by the Ministry of Finance (“MOF”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 Sometime in or around 2010, the MC raised the idea of privatising Neptune Court. Privatisation would involve Neptune Court unit owners collectively purchasing the Land and Common Areas from the MOF. It was ultimately hoped that there might be an <span class="font-italic">en bloc </span>sale of Neptune Court. Pursuant to the proposed privatisation, a privatisation committee was established (“the Privatisation Committee”), and the MC engaged Messrs Tan &amp; Au LLP (“T&amp;A”) as solicitors to assist in the privatisation process.

The decision to commence this claim was also taken under legal advice from T&amp;A. Like DC 1545, DC 3091 was also a claim in defamation. This time brought on the basis that the Proposed 37th AGM Resolutions were defamatory. The 26 defendants were Neptune Court residents who had added their signatures in support of the Proposed 37th AGM Resolutions. DC 3091 was heard by the learned District Judge Loo Ngan Chor, who, on 22 January 2016, dismissed the claim. His grounds of decision are reported in <span class="font-italic">Tommy Wong Poh Choy &amp; ors v Seah Kim Bee &amp; ors </span>[2016] SGDC 85 (“<span class="font-italic">Wong v Seah</span>”). District Judge Loo found that the Proposed 37th AGM Resolutions were not defamatory (<span class="font-italic">Wong v Seah </span>at [23]–[34]) and, in any event, the defences of qualified privilege and fair comment were applicable to the claim (at [35]–[38]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 Dissatisfied with that outcome, the plaintiffs in DC 3091 appealed the decision by way of District Court Appeal 4 of 2016 (“DCA 4”). DCA 4 was dismissed on 15 September 2016 by See Kee Oon JC (as he then was). The MC then applied to the High Court for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal. That application, too, was dismissed by See JC on 12 January 2017.

The affidavit exhibited the minutes of this meeting, which make reference to the 2012 Letters, the March 2012 Email and the Proposed 37th AGM Resolutions.

The Defendants also cited the case of <span class="font-italic">Taylor v National Union of Mineworkers </span>[1985] IRLR 99 (“<span class="font-italic">Taylor</span>”), which was described in their written submissions as being a case in which Vinelott J had dismissed an application for restoration of misspent union funds “on, among other bases, that the plaintiffs had no standing to commence the action on behalf of the trade union”.

</div> This was not an accurate description of that decision. The plaintiffs in <span class="font-italic">Taylor</span> were members of the National Union of Mineworkers (Derbyshire Area) (“the Derbyshire Union”). They obtained a declaration that a strike called by the Derbyshire Union was called in breach of the rules of the union. Subsequently, upon inspecting the Derbyshire Union’s books of account, the plaintiffs discovered that the union had spent over £1.7 million in support of the strike. They then applied for summary judgment on their claim that the payments were unlawful and a misapplication of the union’s funds, and sought “damages” from the union’s secretary and treasurer for breach of contract and/or breach of trust. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Contrary to what the Defendants have argued, Vinelott J did <span class="font-italic">not </span>find that the plaintiffs lacked <span class="font-italic">locus standi</span>. In fact, Vinelott J held the very opposite (<span class="font-italic">Taylor </span>at 102):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The first question is whether the plaintiffs are in a position to maintain an action against the individual defendants in effect on behalf of the Derbyshire Union whose members have not been consulted on the question whether proceedings should be brought against the individual defendants.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In <span class="font-italic">Edwards v Halliwell</span>, the plaintiff, a member of the same union, claimed that a resolution increasing the contributions of employed members was invalid. Under the rules such a resolution required a two-third majority obtained at a ballot vote. The purported resolution was passed without a ballot. The Court of Appeal held that the rule in <span class="font-italic">Foss v Harbottle </span>did not apply to bar the plaintiff’s right to sue. (…) Any member was entitled to refuse to pay an increased subscription unless made payable by a valid resolution. In a classic exposition of the rule in <span class="font-italic">Foss v Harbottle</span>, (…) Jenkins LJ said:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">“The rule in <span class="font-italic">Foss v Harbottle</span>, as I understand it, comes to no more than this. First, the proper plaintiff in an action in respect of a wrong alleged to be done to a company or an association of persons is <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>the company or the association of persons itself. Secondly, where the alleged wrong is a transaction which might be binding on the company or association and on all its members by a simple majority of the members, no individual member of the company is allowed to maintain an action in respect of that matter for the simple reason that, if a mere majority of the members of the company or the association is in favour of what has been done, then <span class="font-italic">cadit questio</span>. (…) If, on the other hand, a simple majority of members of the company or association is against what has been done, then there is no valid reason why the company or association itself should not sue. (…)</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The cases falling within the general ambit of the rule are subject to certain exceptions. It has been noted in the course of argument that in those cases where the act complained of is wholly <span class="font-italic">ultra vires </span>the company or association the rule has no application because there is no question of the transaction being confirmed by any majority.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I have read that passage in full, because Jenkins LJ <span class="font-italic">makes it clear that the protection afforded by the rule in </span>Foss v Harbottle <span class="font-italic">to a company and a trade union does not extend to cases where the plaintiff seeks to prevent or remedy an application of the funds of the body which is outside the powers conferred by its constitution</span>. The reason is that such an application cannot be ratified by a mere majority of the members or indeed by any majority, however large. Any member is entitled to insist that the funds of the body be used exclusively in furtherance of its objects, those objects to be inferred from its constitution.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 On the facts of the case, Vinelott J held that the expenditure of the Derbyshire Union’s funds in support of the strike was indeed <span class="font-italic">ultra </span><span class="font-italic">vires</span>. The Defendants are correct in pointing out, however, that Vinelott J dismissed the plaintiff’s application for summary judgment. He reasoned that although the misapplication of union funds could not be ratified by any majority of the members, the members could nevertheless resolve not to take any action to remedy the wrong done to the union, and that such a resolution, if made in good faith and for the benefit of the union, would bind the minority. Since Vinelott J had before him an “impressive body of evidence” suggesting that the “overwhelming majority” of the members approved of the expenditure in question, he felt he could not rule out the possibility that a majority of members might be able to properly and lawfully take the view that it would not be in the interests of the union that the individual defendants should be made personally liable (<span class="font-italic">Taylor </span>at 107). This is a point I will return to later. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 For present purposes, what is significant is that <span class="font-italic">Taylor </span>stands as authority for the proposition that the rule in <span class="font-italic">Foss v Harbottle </span>does not bar the right of an individual member to maintain an action against the officers of an unincorporated association claiming that a particular application of funds by the officers was <span class="font-italic">ultra vires</span>, and requiring the officers to make good the loss to the unincorporated association. This is consistent with the following remarks from <span class="font-italic">Warburton </span>at pp 78–79: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If a member considers that the committee or the treasurer are <span class="font-italic">using funds for purposes other than those of the association, </span>he can apply to court for a declaration that payments made were unauthorised<span class="font-italic">. </span>(…) The court may also grant an injunction restraining any further misapplication of the association’s funds<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">and order the relevant officers to repay the funds misspent.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The question that followed was whether the use of the funds of the NCOA to pay for the costs of the Defamation Proceedings and the present proceedings was <span class="font-italic">ultra vires </span>the objects of the NCOA Constitution. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether the use of the NCOA funds to pay for the legal fees of the Defamation Proceedings was beyond the objects of the NCOA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 The Defendants argued that the use of the NCOA funds to pay for the costs of the Defamation Proceedings was within its objects for the following reasons:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The very object of adding Rule 2(b) to the NCOA Constitution (see [7] above) was “to empower the NCOA MC and the members of Neptune Court to take such steps arising out of or in connection to the proposed privatisation of Neptune Court”.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The Defendants commenced the Legal Proceedings for the benefit, and on behalf of the members of Neptune Court because they wished to protect the process of privatisation from “degenerating into a mudslinging contest between the pro-privatisation and anti-privatisation factions in Neptune Court”, “to encourage a transparent and open discourse on the issues affecting the interest of the members of Neptune Court”, and “to send a signal to the members of Neptune Court that slanderous, untrue and baseless allegations (…) could not be tolerated”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Having considered these arguments, I was unable to see how the Defamation Proceedings were within the objects of the NCOA. Under Rule 2(b), one object of the NCOA is to allow Neptune Court unit owners “to express their collective opinion and determination on <span class="font-italic">matters affecting the interests of Neptune Court and the residents including enhancement and status of the estate and use of rights and privileges accorded by the Land Titles (Strata) Act</span>” (emphasis added). Yet even accepting that the italicised portion of this phrase could well encompass the proposed privatisation of Neptune Court, I did not agree that simply <span class="font-italic">any </span>matter arising in connection with the proposed privatisation came within the objects of the NCOA. The fact remained that the object stated in Rule 2(b) was to allow the unit owners “to express their collective opinion and determination”. Thus, the question was whether the Defamation Proceedings bore any reasonable connection with allowing the unit owners to express their collective opinion and determination on privatisation. In my view, they did not. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Defamation is concerned with reputation: not honour as such. The Defamation Proceedings in question were brought in the name of the Defendants and not in the name of the NCOA. The Defamation Proceedings were concerned with the <span class="font-italic">personal </span>reputations of the Defendants and the other plaintiffs therein. Doubtless, the Defendants were office bearers within the NCOA MC, but that does not alter the point that the reputations at issue in these suits were the personal reputations of the defendants. I failed to see how proceedings to vindicate these personal reputations were necessary or even helpful for allowing the unit owners to express their will in relation to privatisation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 The Defendants claim that they were trying to “protect the process of privatization” from turning into a “mudslinging contest”. To begin with, however noble this purported goal of eliminating hostilities between the “pro-privatisation and anti-privatisation factions in Neptune Court” may have been, it seemed to me that the acrimony of court proceedings would hinder, rather than further that goal. More fundamentally, I did not feel that this goal came within the object of allowing the members of Neptune Court to voice their collective opinion on matters relating to privatisation at all. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The Defendants also appeared to suggest that they needed to commence the Defamation Proceedings because any comments which impugned their handling of the privatisation exercise would affect their ability to successfully <span class="font-italic">accomplish </span>the privatisation of Neptune Court. As stated by the 1st defendant in his affidavit dated 5 October 2016:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The defamation proceedings against the Defendants in DC 1545/2012/E, DC 3091/2012/X and HC/DCA 4/2016 were instituted to protect office-bearers of the [MC] and [the Privatisation Committee] from further continued harassment and unjustified attacks on their integrity and reputation, which has a direct correlation with their ability <span class="font-italic">to carry out privatisation</span> and affects public confidence in their execution of their duties to the Association.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The 1st defendant also deposed on affidavit that “privatisation is the <span class="font-italic">raison d’etre</span> for the NCOA and will remain so unless and until this object clause is removed from the Constitution”.

That distorted understanding, whether honestly held or not, appears to have been relied upon to further and justify a distinctly pro-privatisation agenda, and the commencement of the Defamation Proceedings was but an example<span class="font-italic"> </span>of this.  Indeed the Defendants say that they commenced the Defamation Proceedings to “protect the process of privatisation”. Yet the goal of privatisation is <span class="font-italic">not </span>as such<span class="font-italic"> </span>within the objects of the NCOA Constitution. What <span class="font-italic">is </span>within the objects of the NCOA Constitution is allowing the members of the NCOA to express their collective will on matters including privatisation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 For the payment of the legal fees incurred in connection with the Defamation Proceedings to be <span class="font-italic">intra vires</span>, the Defamation Proceedings would need to bear a reasonable relationship to that object.  This relationship was not established. The alleged connection between the defamation claims brought by the Defendants (and others) and “allowing the members to express their collective opinion” on the issue of privatisation was far too tenuous. I therefore found that the use of the NCOA funds to pay for the legal fees of the Defamation Proceedings was <span class="font-italic">ultra vires </span>the objects of the NCOA and, as such, <span class="font-italic">Foss v Harbottle </span>did not apply to the Plaintiffs.

I note, however, that it was not strictly necessary for me to determine this issue. Given my finding that the use of the NCOA funds to pay for the legal fees of the Defamation Proceedings was <span class="font-italic">ultra vires </span>the objects of the NCOA, the effect of this was that such an expenditure “[could not] be ratified by a mere majority of the members or indeed by any majority, however large” (see <span class="font-italic">Taylor </span>at 102, cited at [46] above). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the impugned use of the NCOA funds was duly approved in accordance with the NCOA Constitution</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether the MC had discretion to approve the impugned use of the NCOA funds without complying with Rule 18(a)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 As noted above, the Defendants sought to argue that even if the use of the NCOA funds to pay for the legal fees of the Defamation Proceedings had not been approved in accordance with Rule 18(a), Rules 14, 32 and 35 of the NCOA Constitution conferred the MC with wide powers to approve such use.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 For convenience, I set out Rules 14, 32 and 35 of the NCOA Constitution in full:

Thus, both these rules are obviously subject to the express provisions of the NCOA Constitution <span class="font-italic">including </span>Rule 18(a), which stipulates how non-maintenance expenditures are to be approved.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 I accept that Rule 32, unlike Rules 14 and 35, does not contain any such clause which explicitly subordinates the Committee’s power to bind the NCOA to the other Rules within the NCOA Constitution. However, I think Rule 32 must be seen in the context of the entire NCOA Constitution, which, like every other contract, should be construed as a whole, with no words being ignored, omitted or glossed over (<span class="font-italic">Citicorp Investment Bank (Singapore) Ltd v Wee Ah Kee </span>[1997] 2 SLR(R) 1 at [72]). Rule 32 comes amidst numerous detailed provisions which expressly delimit the MC’s powers, one of which is Rule 18(a) which addresses the MC’s powers to with respect to expending the funds of the NCOA. On the Defendants’ argument, Rules 14, 32 and 35 taken together would confer the MC with such wide discretion that rules such as Rule 18(a) would effectively be rendered otiose. In my view, that is an untenable interpretation of the NCOA Constitution. A far more reasonable interpretation of Rule 32 read together with the other provisions of the NCOA Constitution is that while all resolutions of the committee are binding on the Association (unless subsequently revoked), those resolutions must be made in accordance with, and within the confines of the rest of the Rules.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Accordingly, I found that Rules 14, 32 and 35 did not have the effect of giving the MC broad discretion to approve any use of the NCOA’s funds without having to comply with the other Rules of the NCOA Constitution, including Rule 18(a). Therefore, whether or not the use of the NCOA’s funds was duly authorised was a matter to be determined by reference to that Rule.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether the approval of the Income and Budget Statements complied with Rule 18(a)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 As noted above, the Defendants did not dispute that the use of the NCOA funds to pay for an expenditure such as the Defamation Proceedings needed to be approved at an AGM, SGM or by consent of a simple majority obtained through a balloting exercise, pursuant to Rule 18(a). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 However, the Defendants appeared to suggest that the means of obtaining approval at an AGM under Rule 18(a) had to be read together with Rules 23 and 24 (see [28] above). The Defendants’ overall position, as I understood it, was that the MC was entitled to gain approval for non-maintenance expenditures by simply including such expenditures within the Income and Budget Statements and laying them before the AGM. Indeed it should be noted that the Defendants’ primary position was that <span class="font-italic">no </span><span class="font-italic">approval was needed at all </span>(see [28(e)] above) and the AGM was simply to “receive” such Income and Budget Statements. Its secondary position was that approval was <span class="font-italic">in fact </span>obtained through a one-proposer-two-seconder mechanism (see [28(f)] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 I dismissed this argument for two reasons. First, as a matter of construction, I did not agree that the stipulation in Rule 18(a) that “approval must be obtained from the AGM” should be interpreted by reference to Rules 23 and 24. With regard to Rule 23, it was simply untenable that the meaning of “obtaining approval” in Rule 18(a) was for the MC to lay its Income and Budget Statement before the AGM and have the AGM “receive” the said report. The words of a contract cannot be given a meaning which they cannot reasonably bear (<span class="font-italic">Yap Son On v Ding Pei Zhen </span>[2017] 1 SLR 219 (“<span class="font-italic">Yap Son On</span>”) at [31]). Yet to interpret Rule 18(a) in the manner that the Defendants contend for would be to do exactly that – to give the words “<span class="font-italic">obtaining approval</span>” a meaning which they could not reasonably bear. The entire exercise would not, in any sense, be an obtaining of any approval at all. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 With regard to Rule 24, this was simply a provision which stipulated how resolutions proposed to be voted on at an AGM should be brought to the Honorary Secretary’s attention, tabled, accompanied by an explanatory note and circulated to the members. The fact that the Defendants had complied with these provisions with regard to their Income and Budget Statements did <span class="font-italic">not </span>mean that they had thereby obtained approval for the expenditure reflected within those statements under Rule 18(a). I note, however, that the Defendants go further – they say they have complied with Rule 18(a) not only by complying with Rule 24, but also by “approving” the Income and Budget Statements through a one-proposer-two-seconder mechanism. This, argues the Defendants, was a proper way of obtaining approval because this was how things had been “dealt with…year after year after year” (see [30] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 I was unable to agree. To begin with, I did not think it was a reasonable interpretation of Rule 18(a) that approval could be obtained for an expenditure by mentioning the said expenditure in an Income and Budget Statement, and then having one proposer and two seconders approve that Statement. I failed to see how the Defendants could, on one hand, accept that a simple majority was necessary to pass a resolution,

The Defendants do not dispute that the amounts spent on these legal fees were inconspicuously parked under “Privatisation Expenses” for the Income and Budget Statements for the years ending 31 December 2013, and “Privatisation/Legal Expenses” for the years ending 31 December 2014, 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2016.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> As for the year ending 31 December 2013, “Privatisation Expenses” was a complete mislabelling which hid, rather than revealed, the fact that funds of the NCOA were spent to finance the Defamation Proceedings. Even when this label was changed in subsequent years, there was a failure to explain or to specify what was meant by “Legal Expenses”. Given the history that the MC had in the past engaged lawyers to advise them on matters directly relating to the proposed privatisation of the estate (see [7] above), such a label was liable to mislead. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 The Defendants have emphasised that the explanatory notes to the Income and Budget Statements which were circulated before each of the AGMs included comments which showed that the NCOA funds were being used to pay for the legal fees incurred in connection with the Defamation Proceedings. These comments were as follows:

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Defendants’ Skeletal Submissions, para 40</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In the explanatory notes to the Income and Budget Statement circulated before the 39th AGM (in March 2014), it was stated that “the Court Case is still on-going. It is not appropriate for the Committee to estimate as there may be potential recovery of up to 70%”. This same comment was repeated in the explanatory notes to the Income and Budget Statement circulated before the 40th AGM (in March 2015).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) In the explanatory notes to the Income and Budget Statement circulated before the 41st AGM (in March 2016), it was stated that “an appeal to the Supreme Court of Singapore has been lodged. The committee is only able to estimate after the full grounds of decision is out.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 In my view, these cryptic and brief one or two-line comments were grossly insufficient to allow the members of the NCOA to make any kind of informed judgment on what exactly these “privatisation/legal expenses” were. I also note that the <span class="font-italic">earliest </span>of these explanatory notes came about in 2014, which was some time after the MC had <span class="font-italic">already </span>begun using the NCOA funds to pay for the legal costs of the Defamation Proceedings. It must follow that circulating these comments along with the Income and Budget Statements was no substitute at all for following the procedure clearly set out in Rule 18(a) of the NCOA Constitution.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether the Defendants could rely on the fact that some members were aware of the impugned use of the NCOA funds</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Finally, the Defendants urged me to consider the circulation of the Income and Budget Statements in the light of what was actually raised and discussed at the AGMs. As I understand it, the point was that since some members did raise queries on the expenses, the members of the NCOA must have been aware that the funds of the NCOA were being used to pay for the legal fees incurred in connection with the Defamation Proceedings, and yet had not voiced any objections.

</div> I was unpersuaded by this argument for two reasons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 First, even if it is true that some members of the NCOA were <span class="font-italic">aware </span>of the impugned use of the funds of the NCOA, the fact was that the general body of the NCOA was never given the chance to <span class="font-italic">vote</span> on whether its funds should be used to pay for the legal expenses for the Defamation Proceedings. That was the procedure clearly set out in Rule 18(a). It was not followed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Secondly, while it may be true that the court does not take “too rigid an approach” in considering the rules of an association (see [31] above), I was not prepared to infer that the Defendants had effectively obtained approval or ratification for the impugned use of the NCOA funds simply because the general body had failed<span class="font-italic"> </span>to pass a resolution objecting to such expenditure. In the first place, I was not convinced that the members of the NCOA had an informed and clear picture of how and/or to what extent the funds of the NCOA were being used in connection with the Defamation Proceedings. Having examined the minutes of the AGMs, I found that the discussions relating to the issue were at times mingled with other topics relating to the contentious issue of privatisation, and often clouded by acrimony. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 Furthermore, it seemed that when questions were raised by members about the expenditures in question, the responses from the 1st defendant were often somewhat evasive and, with respect, rather self-serving.

</div> Again, such remarks incorrectly implied that the MC had already done the necessary to obtain authorisation for the impugned use of the NCOA funds. I also note that the 1st defendant commented that he “would not know” what would happen with regard to the legal costs of the Defamation Proceedings if the MC were to lose the case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 In considering such discussions, I was ultimately concerned with whether the members of the MC had a reasonably clear and informed appreciation of both the facts and details of how the NCOA funds had been and would be used in connection with the Defamation Proceedings, as well as their <span class="font-italic">right to be consulted and to give or to withhold </span>approval for such use. Only then could the lack of a resolution opposing such expenditure be taken as implicit approval or ratification which substantially complied with the requirement in Rule 18(a). On the whole, given the acrimony of the discussions, the manner in which they were conducted and the incomplete and sometimes misleading information that was communicated in the course of those discussions, I did not feel that any implicit approval had been obtained. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether the use of the NCOA funds to pay for the legal fees incurred for the Defamation proceedings had been approved by the defeat of Resolution 7</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 The Defendants argued that the use of the NCOA funds to pay for the legal fees of the Defamation Proceedings had effectively been approved by virtue of the defeat of “Resolution 7” at the 40th AGM.

</div> In this regard, the Defendant cited the case of <span class="font-italic">Tan Boon Hai</span>, where Kannan Ramesh JC (as he then was) applied the contractual doctrine of substantial performance to the question of whether an election process within an unincorporated association should be set aside because the elections committee (“EC”) was improperly constituted. Ramesh JC held that any breaches of the Constitution of the HTCA had not been breaches of rules which were equivalent in status to “conditions” within a contract, and had only had “trifling” consequences. He therefore refused to declare the elections null and void.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 I pause to note that Ramesh JC was clearly concerned with “the implications of constitutional breaches which are, in substance, procedural irregularities” (see <span class="font-italic">Tan Boon Hai </span>at [62]). There is of course the question whether the approach taken was applicable to the present facts where the breach of the NCOA Constitution complained of was no mere “procedural irregularity” but a total failure to seek approval for a specific use of the association’s funds. Even assuming that <span class="font-italic">Tan Boon Hai </span>was applicable, and putting aside the issue of whether Rule 18(a) is equivalent in status to a “condition” within the <span class="font-italic">Tan Boon Hai </span>analysis (see <span class="font-italic">Tan Boon Hai </span>at [69]), what is clear is that in applying the doctrine of substantial performance, Ramesh JC was taking an approach focused on the <span class="font-italic">effects </span>of the breach. It was only where the breach had occasioned no prejudice and only had trifling consequences that the duties enshrined in the constitution could be said to have been “substantially performed” (see <span class="font-italic">Tan Boon Hai </span>at [69] and [72]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 The question, therefore, was whether it could be said that the MC’s failure to seek approval to use the NCOA funds to pay the legal fees incurred in the Defamation Proceedings had occasioned no prejudice and/or only had trifling consequences. That seemed to me to be a completely untenable position to take. The effect of such failure was that some $427,700 in funds contributed by the members of the NCOA had been spent in the course of legal proceedings <span class="font-italic">without</span> the general body having been given an opportunity to vote on such expenditure beforehand.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 The Defendants appear to suggest that no prejudice had been occasioned because, through the defeat of Resolution 7, the impugned use of the NCOA funds had nevertheless been ratified. In my view, however, the defeat of Resolution 7 was not to be equated with an implied retrospective approval of the MC’s previous use of the NCOA funds to pay for the legal expenses incurred in the Defamation Proceedings.  There may have been any number of reasons why certain members had not voted in favour of Resolution 7 as it was tabled and worded. Indeed the 1st plaintiff herself abstained from voting after her suggestion that Resolution 7 should have retrospective effect was met with Mr Soon’s clarification that he intended for Resolution 7 only to have prospective effect (see [35] above).

</div> The point I make is that there was evident controversy over the scope and implications of Resolution 7, and the fact that a majority of the members attending the 40th AGM did not vote in favour of Resolution 7 cannot be taken to mean that they approved of the specific use of the NCOA funds impugned in these present proceedings – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, to pay the legal fees incurred in connection with the Defamation Proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 I therefore found that there was no merit to the Defendants’ argument that the use of the NCOA funds to pay for the legal fees incurred for the Defamation proceedings had been approved by the defeat of Resolution 7 by a majority.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the Plaintiffs were estopped from bringing this action</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 I was of the view that the Defendants’ argument on estoppel by acquiescence was a non-starter.

Far from it, the 1st plaintiff had raised her concerns and expressed her dissatisfaction not only through a letter in September 2013 (see [38] above), but also in successive AGMs, year after year.

</div> Although the test in <span class="font-italic">Nasaka Industries </span>contemplated that encouragement could take the form of one party “abstaining from asserting his legal rights”, I did not agree that the Plaintiffs had “abstained from asserting their legal rights” merely because they had initially chosen to raise their objections through letters and making comments at AGMs rather than bringing an action in court. In any event, a failure to assert one’s rights by commencing legal proceedings does not necessarily amount to “encouragement”. The element of “encouragement” in <span class="font-italic">Nasaka Industries</span> may perhaps be understood with reference to other authorities on estoppel by acquiescence which have stated that “it has to be shown that the party estopped <span class="font-italic">simply stood by </span>knowing full well that an innocent part was labouring under a mistake as to his rights” (<span class="font-italic">Keppel Tatlee Bank Ltd v Teck Koon Investment Pte Ltd and others </span>[2000] 1 SLR(R) 355 at [27]; see also <span class="font-italic">Yongnam Development Pte Ltd v Somerset Development Pte Ltd </span>[2004] SGCA 35 at [48]). Quite clearly this was not a situation where the Plaintiffs had “simply stood by” in relation to the wrongful use of the NCOA funds. I therefore found that the Plaintiffs were not estopped from bringing this action.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The 42nd AGM</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 This concludes the main part of my decision. For completeness, I note that at the first day of the hearing on 1 March 2017, the case was adjourned during the course of arguments. This was to enable counsel to take instructions on certain matters in connection with a possible method for amicable resolution.   This was unsuccessful. The Defendants proceeded to table a fresh resolution for the 42nd AGM of the NCOA scheduled for 26 March 2017 (“the Fresh Resolution”). In brief, the Fresh Resolution sought approval of the members for payment of the legal expenses incurred by the Defendants in their unsuccessful Defamation Proceedings out of the funds of the NCOA. The Plaintiffs objected to the proposed resolution and filed a summons for an injunction that was placed before me when the hearing resumed on 22 March 2017.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 At the resumed hearing on 22 March 2017, I declined to grant the injunction. In reaching that decision, I noted that the substantive issue before me in OS 913 of 2016 concerns the use of NCOA funds to pay the legal costs of the defamation suits brought by the defendants.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96  The Defendants like any member of the NCOA enjoyed the right to table resolutions for discussion and approval at an AGM. That said, leaving aside the issue as to whether the AGM has the power to ratify an <span class="font-italic">ultra vires</span> decision, I noted that Vinelott J in <span class="font-italic">Taylor </span>held that Members of the Union could resolve that no action should be brought to recover an <span class="font-italic">ultra vires</span> payments (see [47] above).  The decision, however, had to be made in good faith and for the benefit of the society/union (<span class="font-italic">Taylor </span>at 107). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 Whether any resolution (even if passed) would be effective depends on the facts and circumstances and whether the “defect” can be cured or effectively defended against as a matter of law by the AGM passing the fresh resolution in question. It bears repeating that I decided that the payments made for the legal expenses of the Defendants were <span class="font-italic">ultra vires</span>. I noted that even if the expenditure was <span class="font-italic">intra vires</span> it was clear that the NCOA MC had failed to obtain proper approval for the items in accordance with the established procedures. The question as to whether the proposed Fresh Resolution, or any resolution to the effect that the members would not require the MC to repay the misspent monies, would meet the <span class="font-italic">Taylor </span>standards (<span class="font-italic">ie </span>that such resolutions had to be made in good faith and for the benefit of the NCOA) was not a matter that could be decided in the current proceedings.  The legal effect of any such resolution and the applicability of the <span class="font-italic">Taylor </span>holding would have to be addressed (if necessary) at the appropriate time in subsequent proceedings. That said, I note again Vinelott J’s comments, that his decision was based on what he regarded as “wholly exceptional circumstances” (<span class="font-italic">Taylor </span>at 107) which circumstances included the point that there was evidence before him that the members <span class="font-italic">would</span> likely resolve not to take any action to rectify the <span class="font-italic">ultra vires</span> payments.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 For the aforementioned reasons, I allowed the Plaintiffs’ claim in OS 913/2016. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 For completeness, I add that prior to the hearing of OS 913/2016, the Defendants by Summons 399/2017 applied for leave to cross-examine the Plaintiffs.
