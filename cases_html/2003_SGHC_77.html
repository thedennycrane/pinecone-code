<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">5<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> The prosecution proceeded with 11 charges:</span></p>

<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">6<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> The offences came to light in the following manner:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-List-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt 1in" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(a)<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> On 13 September 2002, the victim’s teacher referred the victim to the school principal when the victim returned to school after being absent for two days from 10 to 12 September 2002.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-List-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt 1in" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(b)<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> The victim was referred to the school counsellor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> During the counselling session, the counsellor understood that the victim had been molested.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The counsellor informed the school principal who contacted the victim’s mother to see her the same day.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-List-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt 1in" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(c)<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> When the mother came to the school, the victim was brought to the principal’s office to meet her mother.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Upon seeing her mother, the victim broke down and cried and disclosed to her mother that the accused had been sexually abusing her for some time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The principal then advised the mother to make a police report but the mother requested some time to consider whether to do so.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-List-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt 1in" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(d)<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> Two weeks later, on 27 September 2002, when the principal did not hear from the mother, the principal instructed the counsellor to report the matter to the Child Protection Service of the Ministry of Community Development and Sports (“MCDS”) for the matter to be reported to the police and the counsellor did so.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-List-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt 1in" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(e)<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> On 30 September 2002, the victim was taken down to MCDS to be interviewed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Later that day, she lodged a police report.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">7<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> The accused pleaded guilty to the 11 charges and was convicted accordingly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He agreed to the remaining charges being taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">8<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> Most of the offences under s 377 of the Penal Code involved instances of anal intercourse.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Only the 20<sup>th</sup> and 22<sup>nd</sup> charges, which were also under s 377, involved the accused making the victim perform fellatio on him.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">9<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> Most of the offences under s 354 of the Penal Code involved instances where the accused inserted his finger into the anus of the victim.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Only the 21<sup>st</sup> charge, which was also under s 354, was an instance of the accused touching the vulva of the victim.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">10<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> The accused’s reason for committing the offences was that he could not control his lust.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He thought that by having anal intercourse, this would be less painful because faeces pass through the anus.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He claimed to regret what he had done and sought leniency.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">11<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> Mr Imran Hamid for the prosecution did not press for a deterrent sentence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Mr Hamid submitted that the case before me stood somewhere between the case of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Lim Hock Hin Kelvin v Public Prosecutor</i> <nobr>[1998] 1 SLR 801</nobr> and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Adam Bin Darsin v Public Prosecutor</i> <nobr>[2001] 2 SLR 413</nobr>.</span></p>

<p class="Judg-List-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt 1in" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(a)<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> of the three forms of unnatural carnal intercourse, anal intercourse was the most serious.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Causing a victim to perform fellatio was of intermediate gravity and performing fellatio on the victim stood at the bottom of the scale,</span></p>
<p class="Judg-List-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt 1in" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(b)<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> anal intercourse was, depending on the circumstances, equated with rape,</span></p>
<p class="Judg-List-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt 1in" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(c)<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> the appropriate sentence for performing fellatio on the victim was around five years in the absence of mitigating or aggravating circumstances.</span></p>

<p class="Judg-Headg-1" style="MARGIN: 12pt 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><strong>My Decision</strong></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">15<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> For cases under s 354, Yong CJ had also said in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Ng Chiew Kiat v Public Prosecutor</i> <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> <nobr>[2000] 1 SLR 370</nobr> that nine months’ imprisonment and caning is warranted for acts of molest involving intrusion of the victim’s private parts although in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Toh Kok How v Public Prosecutor</i> <nobr>[1995] 1 SLR 735</nobr>, the accused was also sentenced by Yong CJ to nine months’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane for using his knuckles to press onto the right breast of the victim.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> On the other hand, Yong CJ also said in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Ng Chiew Kiat</i> that there were offences under s 354 which were relatively minor for which a fine would suffice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Ultimately, the appropriate sentence would depend on the nature of the act of molest as well as the circumstances surrounding the commission of the offence.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">16<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> I accepted Mr Hamid’s submission that in the case before me, the gravity of the offences and the circumstances surrounding the commission of the offences under s 377 stood somewhere between the case of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Lim Hock Hin Kelvin</i> and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Adam Bin Darsin</i>.</span></p>

<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">18<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> For the offences under s 354, the accused had inserted his finger into the anus of the victim which was more painful for the victim than if he had simply touched her private parts.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">19<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> The accused had a previous conviction in 1990 for voluntarily causing hurt with dangerous weapons or means for which he was sent to a reformative training centre.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He also had a previous conviction in 1999 for theft in a dwelling, read with s 34 Penal Code on common intention, for which he was sentenced to two weeks’ imprisonment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Those offences were not similar to the offences for which he was charged before me.</span></p>
