<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font color="#800000"><strong><u>GROUNDS OF DECISION</u></strong></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">1

        The Defendant is a company registered in

Singapore and is the local subsidiary of New Era of Network, Inc ("NEON"), a

U.S. company.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">2

        The Plaintiff was an employee of the Defendant.

By letter dated 23 May 2001, the Defendant terminated the Plaintiff’s employment by

giving him six months’ notice pursuant to the terms of his employment. This meant

that his employment would end on 23 November 2001. However the letter stated that the

Defendant was in the course of investigating an allegation that the Plaintiff had made an

unauthorised bonus payment to himself of the sum of $72,000. Pending that, the Defendant

reserved its right to take further action against the Plaintiff. At that time the

Plaintiff was the Defendant’s Senior Vice-President and Managing Director,

responsible for its operations in the Asia-Pacific.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">3

        By a further letter dated 6 June 2001 the

Defendant advised the Plaintiff that it had completed the investigation and was satisfied

that the Plaintiff had made the bonus payment without authorisation, in contravention of

its instructions. On that ground, the Defendant terminated the Plaintiff’s employment

with immediate effect. This would have the effect of depriving the Plaintiff of the six

months’ salary that he would have received had he been permitted to serve out the

notice period in accordance with the terms of the letter of 23 May 2001. The Plaintiff

contends that the summary dismissal was wrongful and commenced this action to claim the

following:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(i) US$100,000 being salary in

    lieu of notice or alternatively damages for wrongful termination;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(ii) US$40,000 being the balance

    of the unpaid bonus for the year 2000;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(iii) US$10,000 being the balance

    of his bonus for the first quarter of 2001;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(iv) US$150,000 being the bonus

    for the second, third and fourth quarters of 2001 or alternatively damages; and</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(v) interest and costs.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">4

        The Defendant denies all liability on the

ground that the dismissal was justified and that the Plaintiff was not entitled to the

bonuses claimed. The Defendant counterclaims for $72,000 which the Plaintiff had caused to

be paid to himself as part payment of his bonus for the first quarter of 2001 (and in

respect of which the Plaintiff claims the balance of US$10,000).</font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The facts</font></p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">5

        The Plaintiff joined SLI Consulting

International AG ("SLICI") in 1992 and in 1996 acquired a 13.3% share of the

company. He developed the company’s business in the USA and Asia-Pacific,

incorporating the following subsidiary companies in the process: SLI Consulting Sdn Bhd in

Malaysia, SLI Consulting Ltd in Hong Kong and SLI Consulting Pte Ltd in Singapore. In

October 1998, he moved to Singapore and became the Managing Director of SLI Consulting Pte

Ltd. He was concurrently a director in all SLI Consulting entities in Malaysia, Singapore

and Hong Kong.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">6

        Under the terms of his employment contract with

SLI Consulting Pte Ltd, he was paid a gross salary of $15,000 per month and an

objective-based bonus of $120,000 per year. In respect of termination, SLI Consulting Pte

Ltd had the right to forthwith terminate his employment at any time without prior notice

in the event of any misconduct, disobedience, negligence, incompetence and breach of duty

of good faith on his part in the course of carrying out his duties as a Managing Director.

Otherwise, his employment may be terminated, unless mutually agreed, by six months’

prior written notice. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">7

        In early 1999, NEON entered into negotiations

to acquire SLICI and all its subsidiaries. At the time the shareholders of SLICI were

Franz Koepper who controlled 66.6% of the total shareholding, the Plaintiff who had 13.3%,

and two others who held the remaining 20%. The acquisition took place in May 1999. Koepper

was appointed a Senior Vice-President of NEON and the Chief Executive Officer of the SLI

group worldwide.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">8

        Sometime in June 1999 Koepper, on behalf of the

Defendant, verbally agreed with the Plaintiff that from the date of the acquisition the

Plaintiff would be employed by the Defendant on the same employment conditions that he had

prior to the acquisition. Koepper also informed him that a written contract would be drawn

once the revised terms have been agreed upon. They agreed that for the time being, the

Plaintiff would be employed on the conditions of his original employment contract with SLI

Consulting Pte Ltd but increases of salary and objective-based bonus might also be made by

oral agreement according to any increased responsibilities. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">9

        Sometime in February 2000, the Plaintiff was

promoted to the position of Vice-President and headed its Asia-Pacific Commercial Business

unit. The promotion and new reporting lines were introduced during a Sales Conference held

in February 2000 at Denver, Colorado, USA. At a subsequent Sales Conference in July 2000

at Denver, the Plaintiff was further promoted to Senior Vice-President and Managing

Director of the Defendant, placing him in charge of NEON's operation in the Asia-Pacific.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">10

        Around October 2000, the Plaintiff negotiated

with Leslie Lundberg, NEON’s Vice-President, Human Resources in respect of his

remuneration for 2000 and 2001. Lundberg confirmed that for 2000, the Plaintiff’s

base salary would be US$160,000 with an objective-based bonus of a further US$160,000. For

2001, Lundberg confirmed that the Plaintiff’s base salary would be US$200,000. As for

the objective based bonus, Lundberg suggested that it be based on a percentage of revenue

and proposed a figure of 0.8% on the basis of a target revenue of $25 million and target

bonus of US$200,000. According to the Defendant, the parties did not reach any agreement

on the issue of the target bonus for 2001 by the time matters came to a head in May 2001.

However the Plaintiff contended that there was agreement on an annual target revenue of

US$16.7 million with a first quarter target of US$2 million. I shall deal with this

dispute of fact later.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">11

        In early January 2001 the Plaintiff requested

Lundberg to process and make payment of his bonus for the year 2000. Lundberg requested

the Plaintiff to provide some information for that purpose, which the Plaintiff did.

Lundberg consulted Fred Horn, NEON’s Executive Vice-President, Operations at the

time, and the person to whom the Plaintiff reported directly. There was some disagreement

as to the quantum that the Plaintiff was entitled to. The Plaintiff claimed that he ought

to receive the full US$160,000 while Horn took the position that he was only entitled to

three-quarters, i.e. US$120,000 as he had only achieved the target revenue for the first

three quarters of 2000. The matter was escalated to Pat Fortune, the President and Chief

Operating Officer of NEON at the time, who decided that the Plaintiff should only receive

US$120,000 as his bonus for 2000. He was eventually paid that sum. The Plaintiff was

unhappy with the decision and in an e-mail dated 17 March 2001, notified Fortune that he

would refer the matter to his legal counsel in the US. The Plaintiff followed this up with

an e-mail dated 6 April to Leonard Goldstein, NEON’s corporate counsel, setting out

his case and holding out for a settlement.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">12

        Such were the inter-personal atmospherics in

the first three months of 2001. Meanwhile another acquisition was in the offing. On 20

February 2001 Sybase, Inc ("Sybase"), a company listed on the New York Stock

Exchange, entered into an agreement ("Acquisition Agreement") to acquire all the

shares of NEON. A public offer was also made to acquire all the publicly traded shares of

NEON. This acquisition triggered the chain of events that gave rise to the present

dispute. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">13

        The Acquisition Agreement provided that NEON

and its subsidiaries could carry on their normal business during the transition period,

but they were not to enter into any commitments that were not in the ordinary course of

business. In order to comply with those provisions it was decided to implement certain

payment control procedures which would give the NEON head office close control over cash

disbursements. Another reason for these measures was the need to ensure that the financial

information that had been disclosed to Sybase during the due diligence exercise remained

accurate. Indeed, according to Lonnie Clark, NEON’s Vice-President, Accounting, there

was talk at the time that various individuals were going to pay bonuses to themselves

without validation that they had earned it and Sybase had requested NEON to tighten its

controls. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">14

        Pursuant to this decision, two instructions

emanated from NEON corporate headquarters to its subsidiaries worldwide. The first was

dated 4 April 2001, an e-mail from Brian Duff, the Vice-President and Corporate

Controller. It was addressed to various authorised signatories of bank accounts and the

Plaintiff’s name was under the "cc" category. This e-mail, which the

Plaintiff admitted receiving, reads as follows:</font></p>

        On 10 April 2001 Clark sent an e-mail to

various authorised signatories of the bank accounts of NEON and its subsidiaries

worldwide. The Plaintiff’s name was also in the "cc" category. However he

denied receiving it. The e-mail contained the following message:</font></p>

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">16

        It should be recalled that NEON was in a state

of flux by this time as the acquisition by Sybase was expected to result in a major

restructuring. The Plaintiff said that by early April 2001 he was being sidelined as all

his subordinates were transferred to other supervisors and he was without any functional

staff. He was cut off from the executive circulation list. As he had accumulated a

substantial amount of leave, he took leave for four weeks from 4 April 2001 and after that

extended it for another three weeks. He said that when he went to the office during that

period, he could not do anything. Indeed by 23 April 2001, the decision was made by Sybase

to terminate his services due to redundancy and preparations were afoot to give him the

formal notice.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">17

        Meanwhile the Plaintiff wanted to be paid his

bonus for the first quarter of 2001. He sent an e-mail dated 6 May 2001 to Horn, copied to

Fortune and Lundberg in the US, and to Peh Soo Lin and Tan Yew Yen in Singapore. Peh was

the Defendant’s Regional Manager, Human Resources and Tan was its Accountant. The

e-mail advises that he had authorised payment to himself of a provisional bonus of

US$40,000 and asks Horn to verify the exact amount. It states as follows:</font></p>

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">18

        The following day, on 7 May 2001, the Plaintiff

presented the Defendant's cheque for $72,000, being payment of the provisional bonus of

US$40,000 in equivalent Singapore currency. The payment was cleared on 8 May. Up to that

time, there had been no response to his e-mail of 6 May from Horn or anybody else in the

US. It is this act that the Defendant relies on to summarily dismiss the Plaintiff in its

letter of 6 June 2001. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">19

        The Defendant alleged that the Plaintiff had

committed misconduct by contravening the instructions given in the two e-mail dated 4

April and 10 April 2001 thereby breaching his duty of fidelity and good faith to the

Defendant. The Plaintiff alleged that he did not receive the e-mail of 10 April and

submitted that he had not contravened the instructions in the 4 April e-mail. Furthermore,

even if he was in contravention, the Plaintiff contends that it was an oversight on his

part and did not justify summary dismissal.</font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">E-mail of 10 April 2001</font></p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">20

        The main dispute of fact between the parties is

whether the Plaintiff received e-mail of 10 April 2001 sent by Clark. In the ordinary

course of things, that e-mail would have been delivered by the computer system, like all

the other e-mail referred to in evidence (the deliveries of which are not in dispute).

Occasionally e-mail fail to get delivered to certain addressees for a variety of reasons.

In such instances the e-mail system would generate an e-mail to the sender advising of the

non-delivery. Clark said that she had not received any such e-mail advising her of

non-delivery of her 10 April e-mail to the Plaintiff. Counsel for the Plaintiff did not

cross-examine Clark on this point nor suggest to her that she had received such a

non-delivery advice.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">21

        To corroborate his evidence that he did not

receive Clark’s 10 April e-mail, the Plaintiff adduced evidence of the difficulties

encountered by the Defendant with its e-mail server which resulted in certain e-mail being

undelivered. Marcus Wan, the Defendant’s IT Manager Asia-Pacific, testified that the

Plaintiff had complained to him of non-delivery of e-mail in October 2000. Wan carried out

a number of test e-mail to check that the system was functioning. The Plaintiff again

complained about this in December 2001 and again Wan sent a test e-mail to check. On 20

March 2001 the Plaintiff complained to Wan about an e-mail he could not send or receive

and sent to Wan a test e-mail which went through. Finally on 3 April 2001 the Plaintiff

asked Wan to fix his "chris.schuler@neonsoft.com" e-mail address as he was

experiencing problems with it. A number of test messages flowed between Wan and the

Plaintiff between 3 and 5 April to test the system. Wan did not encounter any problem with

any of these test e-mail and he could only conclude that the system was working at that

point in time. But Wan said that this did not mean it was working properly all the time as

the Plaintiff would not have made those complaints. Wan said that there had been a lot of

problems with the e-mail system since it was first installed. In response to this, counsel

for the Defendant pointed out that the Plaintiff received an e-mail from Duff – who

was in the same office as Clark in Denver, Colorado – on 10 April, the date of

Clark’s e-mail. The Plaintiff had even replied to that e-mail. This, counsel

contended, showed that there was nothing wrong with the delivery of e-mail from the Denver

server.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">22

        In general it is difficult to prove a negative

and in the present case there is evidence of some problem with the Defendant’s e-mail

server. However there are several factors in the present case that contradict the

Plaintiff’s version.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">23

        The first is the fact that he initially took

the position that he did not receive not just Clark’s e-mail of 10 April but also

Duff’s e-mail of 4 April. This is pleaded in 2 of his Reply filed on 14 January

2002, in which he denied receiving both e-mail at the material time. However in its

affidavits evidence-in-chief the Defendant produced an e-mail from the Plaintiff which was

a response to Duff’s e-mail. At the trial, the Plaintiff admitted to receiving

Duff’s e-mail, but took the position that he did not consider that the instruction

applied to him. However he maintained his position that he did not receive Clark’s

e-mail at the time.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">24

        The second factor relates to the chronology of

the payment. The impression given by the Plaintiff in his affidavit evidence-in-chief was

that he had been open about the payment. Prior to the payment, on 5 May 2001, he had made

a formal announcement by e-mail to Horn and Lundberg in the US, as well as to Tan and Peh

in Singapore. It was only after he had ascertained that there was no objection from Horn

or Lundberg that he effected the payment on 8 May. This was what he said in his affidavit:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">14. Following the end of Q1/2001

    in April the operational review showed that I had achieved the revenue target for the

    first quarter of 2001 and is entitled to a bonus of US$50,000.00 pursuant to the revised

    terms of my employment with the Defendants as set out above. I informed Regional Human

    Resource Manager, Ms Peh Soo Lin and Finance Manager Tan Yew Yen, that I would be making a

    provisional down payment of US$40,000.00 for the bonus for the first quarter of 2001.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">15. On 5 May 2001, I made a

    formal announcement by e-mail of the payment of this provisional bonus to the

    Defendants’ Fred Horn, Leslie Lundberg and Ms. Tan Yew Yen and Ms. Peh Soo Lin. I

    also asked Ms Peh Soo Lin to verify with Fred Horn and Leslie Lundberg on the exact

    amount. I understand from her that she did not receive any response from them.

    Accordingly, I effected the US$40,000.00 payment on May 8, 2001.</font></p>

</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">25

        It was pointed out to him in cross-examination

that the e-mail concerned appeared to be dated Sunday 6 May 2001 and not 5 May as he had

claimed. He agreed that it was sent out on 6 May. Counsel then suggested that, as the

cheque was cleared on Tuesday 8 May, he would have presented it on Monday 7 May. He

conceded that it must have been presented on 7 May. When it was pointed out to him that

Horn and Lundberg would not have gone to work to read the e-mail by the time he presented

the cheque he changed his tack. This was what he said:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Q: Anytime prior to close of

    business on 7 May would still be before business hours in US on Monday?</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">A: I guess so.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Q: So there would not be any time

    for the relevant people to approve or object to the payment?</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">A: Not correct. I made a

    provisional payment which I asked for verification of exact amount. Even if I had banked

    in a cheque, an objection could be made and I could be told to pay it back. AB123, I sent

    e-mail to Jim Parks on 10.5.2001 to say I've made payment already. On 11.5.2001, Jim Parks

    replies, attaching 10 April e-mail from Lonnie Clark and reminds me of this. I told Jim

    Parks that I had made payment already and copied to Tan Yew Yen, Lonnie Clark, Fred Horn,

    Pat Fortune and Leslie Lundberg to remind them to verify. This was again an opportunity

    for them to get back to me to say that there was something wrong. I was Senior Vice

    President, in charge of 100 people and eight years with company. I only get copied on an

    instruction, and there was not even a hint that there was something wrong. Moreover, on 11

    May 2001 in telephone conference with Fred Horn and Leslie Lundberg, which my wife heard

    on speaker phone, Fred Horn mentioned that they were terminating me for redundancy and the

    bonuses for 2000 and 2001 would be paid in full. There would have been an opportunity to

    say that there was something wrong, but it was not mentioned at all.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">26

        It can be seen that the Plaintiff's initial

position was that his 6 May e-mail to Horn and Lundberg was a "formal

announcement" and he had only effected payment when he did not receive any objection

from them. When it was shown that he did not wait long enough for such objection to be

made, he changed his position. It became a request for verification of the exact amount.

Even this explanation is disingenuous because on his own case, he had achieved the agreed

target revenue of US$2 million for the first quarter and the exact amount was US$50,000.

There was no need for verification of the quantum of bonus. The only verification

necessary was the entitlement to that bonus. And if such verification was necessary, then

he ought not to have paid himself the advance of US$40,000 before receiving confirmation.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">27

        Furthermore, it would appear that the Plaintiff

was well aware that Horn was not the person to refer to for such "verification".

This is because on 10 April 2001 the Plaintiff had sent an e-mail to Horn asking him to

determine the first quarter 2001 bonus as soon as possible. Horn’s reply was that the

matter was out of his hands. He said as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Since you informed Pat Fortune

    that you would have a lawyer contact Leonard [Goldstein] regarding your compensation

    issues I am told I am unable to address your Q1 compensation.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The matter will be handled by

    Leonard Goldstein and Dan Carle (Sybase).</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Personally, I hope the matter is

    resolved quickly so we can focus on growing our business.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">It was about four weeks later

that the Plaintiff sent his "formal announcement" e-mail of 6 May. Although he

mentioned in that e-mail that Dan Carle had never responded to his attorney’s

attempts to contact him and Goldstein had left NEON, it would be rather surprising in the

light of Horn’s statement that the matter was out of his hand that the Plaintiff

could believe that Horn is the appropriate person to "verify" the bonus.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">28

        The third factor relates to the preparation of

the cheque for $72,000 which the Plaintiff presented to his bank on 7 May. The Defendant

managed to retrieve this cheque from its bank. It was dated 30 April 2001, a good six days

before the Plaintiff sent the e-mail to Horn and Lundberg on 6 May. The Defendant was not

able to recall when he wrote the cheque and suggested as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">I cannot remember when I wrote

    the cheque. It could be that I was in the office earlier in the week, and signed it and

    left it there and only after my announcement, banked cheque. I had informed Peh and Tan

    Yew Yen verbally and by e-mail that I would make such a payment. Why date there is

    30.4.2001, I cannot remember now, one year later. Fact was that I had banked it only after

    I had announced it to my superior.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Yet this explanation does not sit

well with his revised position, that he wanted Horn or Lundberg to verify the quantum of

bonus. The Plaintiff had made out and signed the cheque on Monday 30 April 2001, why not

send out the e-mail on that day? Why wait until Sunday to send out the e-mail before

presenting the cheque the following Monday?</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">29

        The fourth factor concerns the Plaintiff’s

reaction after he was told that the payment to himself of the $72,000 was in contravention

of Clark’s e-mail. On 11 May 2001 Jim Parks, who was in the finance department at

Denver, sent an e-mail to the Plaintiff in which he said that in the course of going

through the May cash flow forecast with Tan Yew Yen, she had told Parks that the Plaintff

had authorised the bonus payment. Parks reminded the Plaintiff of Clark’s e-mail and

told him to submit the request for approval to her. In his e-mail, Parks forwarded a copy

of Clark’s e-mail of 10 April. The Plaintiff replied as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">I’ve sent information about

    the payment to the relevant people on May 6, 2001 and asked for verification of the exact

    amount.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">It is significant that the

Plaintiff expressed no surprise to the revelation of Clark's e-mail and merely said that

he had asked for verification of the exact amount from the "relevant people".

Furthermore, the letter of dismissal of 6 June 2001 had specified as the reason for his

dismissal the payment to himself of $72,000 in contravention of the instructions in the

two e-mail of 4 and 10 April 2001. In his reply of 27 June to that letter, he did not

state that he had not received the 10 April e-mail. On or before 24 July, the Plaintiff

had sent an e-mail to John Chen, the CEO of NEON, in which he complained about the summary

dismissal. Again he did not mention the non-receipt of the 10 April e-mail. On 24 August

2001, his solicitors wrote a letter of demand to the Defendant which also does not mention

that the Plaintiff did not receive the 10 April e-mail.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">30

        The Plaintiff claimed that in a conference

telephone call he had with Germanowski, Horn and Lundberg on 6 April 2001, he had told

them that he had not received the 10 April e-mail. The Plaintiff’s position is

somewhat supported by Lundberg, who said this in cross-examination:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Q: In that conversation, did you,

    Fred Horn or Glen Germanowski ask Plaintiff to explain payment?</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">A: Yes.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Q: What was his answer?</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">A: He felt he had - can't recall

    exactly, but I think he claimed he had not received the e-mail from Brian Duff and Lonnie

    Clark and he felt that he had the right to pay himself.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">31

        However Germanowski distinctly recalled that

the Plaintiff did not say this at all. That call was made on Germanowski’s request,

in order to give the Plaintiff an opportunity to explain the matter. This was what

Germanowski said in evidence:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The phone conversation was

    initiated at my request with Leslie Lundberg and Fred Horn on it because we had looked

    inside to verify that memos were sent by Lonnie Clark and Brian Duff and cheque was made

    out by Plaintiff and cashed by him. We wanted to find out what Plaintiff’s answer for

    that was, why he cashed the cheque, having received those monies. I was looking for

    mitigating circumstances where I would have to extend investigating to check anything he

    said. I recall beginning by asking Plaintiff for his side of the story. I referred him to

    our earlier letter saying that we were investigation the memo from Lonnie Clark and Brian

    Duff and asking why he cashed the cheque. His response was fairly straight-forward and a

    bit surprising. He had a sense of frustration, saying that he had earned it, had been

    asking for it, so he cashed the cheque. …</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">I should add that the same sense

of frustration at having earned the bonus as described by Germanowski is found in the

Plaintiff’s letter to the Defendant of 27 June and his e-mail to John Chen, the CEO

of NEON.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">32

        Counsel for the Defendant pointed out that

Lundberg had qualified her answer by saying that she could not recall exactly and that she

thought that the Plaintiff had claimed he had not received the two e-mail. He also pointed

out that Lundberg, who was giving evidence by video conferencing from Denver, Colorado,

had been cross-examined for more than three hours and where she was it was almost midnight

at the time the question was asked. This is in contrast with Germanowski’s assertive

evidence on the matter. Counsel pointed out that as NEON’s associate general counsel,

it was his job to investigate the matter. Germanowski was the person who initiated the

call for the purpose of giving the Plaintiff the opportunity to explain his action. As

Germanowski had said, he was looking for mitigating circumstances where he would extend

his investigation. The Defendant had not investigated into whether the 10 April e-mail was

received by the Plaintiff and Germanowski said that if he had made that assertion he would

have investigated it. This is consistent with the documentary trail which does not show

any denial by the Plaintiff of receipt of that e-mail.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">33

        The fifth factor relates to the other

contradictions that the Plaintiff's version of the facts have with the rest of the

evidence. I refer particularly to his allegations in respect of the first quarter 2001

bonus which is dealt with in detail further below. This shows that his evidence is not

reliable. Furthermore, the Plaintiff’s actions in respect of the making and payment

of the cheque for $72,000 would be explicable if he did receive and was aware of

Clark’s e-mail of 10 April. These events occurred at a time when the Plaintiff was in

the course of being made redundant and he had been frustrated by the delay in receiving

his bonus for 2000.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">34

        On the evidence before me, I hold that the

Plaintiff did receive Clark’s e-mail of 10 April 2001.</font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Did Plaintiff contravene

instructions</font></p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">35

        The Defendant claimed that, in paying to

himself the bonus of $72,000 on or about 8 May 2001, the Plaintiff had contravened

instructions contained in Duff’s e-mail of 4 April and Clark’s e-mail of 10

April 2001. The Plaintiff argued that he had not contravened the instructions, on the

ground that: (i) both e-mail were not addressed to him directly as his name was under the

"cc" list; (ii) Duff was junior to him in the organisation chart; and (iii) they

did not relate to bonus payments.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">36

        I do not agree with the Plaintiff’s

contentions. Both e-mail are clear enough. Duff had said in his e-mail that all payments

of commissions and bonuses worldwide relating to the first quarter of 2001 – the

subject matter of the $72,000 – requires to be approved by Lundberg or Duff. He said

that this was a transitional procedure imposed purely to comply with the Sybase

acquisition agreement. Duff had given a list of the bank accounts affected, which did not

include the Defendant's accounts in Singapore. At the time the Plaintiff had noticed this

omission and had replied to Duff to point this out and even instructed his accountant to

provide Duff with the account information to rectify this. Therefore for the Plaintiff to

say that this instruction did not apply to him would be rather disingenuous on his part.

Certainly he would be procuring a breach of the procedure by instructing his staff to make

out the cheque for him.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">37

        As for Clark’s e-mail of 10 April, it said

that the message was to inform <i>"all authorized signatories" </i>- within

which description the Plaintiff fell. The cheque for $72,000 was in fact signed by him.

The instruction relates to cash disbursements in excess of US$10,000 which covers the

payment in question. Again it would be rather disingenuous to say that because the

Plaintiff’s name was in the "cc" category, therefore the instruction did

not apply to him.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">38

        I therefore find that the Plaintiff had

contravened the instructions in Duff’s e-mail of 4 April and Clark’s of 10

April. This was the ground upon which the Defendant summarily terminated the

Plaintiff’s employment. The next question is whether it was sufficient ground for

summary dismissal.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">39

        Paragraph 14 of the Plaintiff’s employment

contract provides for summary dismissal and states as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">We shall have the right to

    forthwith terminate your employment with us at any time without any prior notice in the

    event of any misconduct, disobedience, negligence, incompetence and breach of duty of good

    faith on your part in the course of carrying out your duties as a Managing Director with

    our company.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">40

        At the point of the acquisition of NEON by

Sybase in February 2001, the Plaintiff was holding the position of Senior Vice-President

and Managing Director. He was responsible for all software sales and professional services

of NEON for Asia-Pacific. He had a duty of fidelity to the Defendant not only in respect

of its assets but also not to jeopardise the Acquisition Agreement. He knew that the

Defendant was in dispute with him in respect of his fourth quarter 2000 bonus. He was in

control of the Defendant and his superiors were a long way away. They relied on him to

manage the company in Singapore. He had been told by Horn that he should refer the matter

of his first quarter 2001 bonus to Goldstein or Carle. Yet he chose to effect payment to

himself in a manner that obviously did not give Horn an opportunity to object and stop

payment and in blatant contravention of the instructions in the e-mail of 4 and 10 April

from corporate headquarters.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">41

        In the circumstances I am unable to find the

Defendant’s decision to dismiss him summarily as unjustified. Accordingly the

Plaintiff’s claim in unfair dismissal fails and would be dismissed.</font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Bonus for fourth quarter 2000</font></p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">42

        For the year 2000, the Plaintiff was paid a

bonus of US$120,000 in respect of the first three quarters of 2000, a sum of US$40,000 per

quarter. He was not paid a bonus in respect of the fourth quarter. However he claimed that

he was entitled to the bonus of US$40,000 for that quarter. In his affidavit

evidence-in-chief he said that the revenue target for 2000 was about US$3.8 million and he

had achieved about US$4.5 million. This is supported by the evidence of Koepper. Therefore

the Plaintiff had exceeded his target and was entitled to the full US$160,000. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">43

        However there is no documentary evidence of any

sort that supports the contention that the target was US$3.8 million. The Plaintiff

himself had presented the following figures at the Denver meeting in January 2001 in

relation to the Defendant’s performance for 2000:</font></p>

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">This shows that the targets were

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">44

        On 3 January 2001 the Plaintiff sent an e-mail

to Lundberg to request for payment of his bonus for 2000, which he said amounted to

US$120,000 as he had achieved the target for the first three quarters but missed the

fourth. The e-mail goes as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">

</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">This is entirely consistent with

the presentation that he was to make in Denver at the end of that month and with the

Defendant's position that he was only entitled to bonuses for the first three quarters of

2000.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">45

        The Plaintiff appears to say that he was

entitled to some other target. But not only is there no evidence of this, it is entirely

contradicted by his own presentations at the Denver sales conference. In the circumstances

his claim for payment of bonus for the fourth quarter 2000 fails and is accordingly

dismissed.</font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Bonus for first quarter 2001</font></p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">46

        The Defendant’s position is that the

revenue target for 2001 had not been settled. In October 2000 Lundberg had proposed to the

Plaintiff a figure of US$25 million as the revenue target for 2001 with his bonus pegged

at 0.8% of the actual revenue. The parties did not come to an agreement on that at the

time. The Plaintiff’s position was that the 2001 target revenue was settled at the

annual sales conference at Denver in late January/early February 2001. He said that he had

made a presentation in which he had proposed the figure of US$16.5 million as the 2001

target revenue with a US$2.785 million target for the first quarter. According to the

Plaintiff, at the executive committee meeting Horn revised the first quarter figure

downwards to US$2 million on account of the downturn in the economy. Therefore the matter

was settled, with US$16.5 million being the target for 2001 and US$2 million the first

quarter target.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">47

        However the subsequent documented

communications do not support this. About a month after the Denver conference, on 1 March,

Horn sent an e-mail to Lundberg, and copied to the Plaintiff and Fortune, which indicates

that there was agreement that the revenue target for 2001 would be US$25 million. That

e-mail goes as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Please make sure Mr. Schuler is

    paid his 2000 bonus per my earlier email ($120k) promptly. I understand that he disagrees

    with m position on his bonus for the year. If he wishes to discuss this with [Fortune]

    please facilitate this discussion.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Also, I understand that you are

    ready to send him the 2001 plan. Please send him this as soon as possible. I believe the

    high level business terms ($25mUSD) are not in dispute.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Please confirm his payment and

    the sending of this years plan.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">48

        In cross-examination the Plaintiff said that he

was surprised at this change of position by Horn, but did not explain the reason. This was

what he said:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">When he sent this e-mail, I was

    surprised to see US$25 m again. We had several disputes about the way NEON was conducting

    the business. There is a marked change in Fred Horn's tone towards me - he called me

    "Mr Schuler" whereas before that I was "Chris".</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Whereupon the Plaintiff was shown

his e-mail in reply dated 9 March 2001 which goes as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">For the record</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">1. I have still not received the

    2001 plan and outstanding employment contract (which I have requested for more than 8

    months now and which should have been automatically taken care of with two promotions 2000

    form SLI MD to NEON VP/MD and SVP/MD APA0. Please do not get back to me on this later than

    March 12, 2001.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">2. In relation to the "high

    level business terms" I have not agreed on USD25 Mio. which would suggest a growth of

    150% for Asia Pacific. In line with the corporate revision and ahead of the Sales

    Conference I have suggested a budget of USD16.5 Mio 65% growth.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">2. [sic] As far as it concerns

    the dispute on the Bonus 2000 my position remains the same as per my earlier e-mails.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">It would appear that about one

month after the Denver sales conference the Plaintiff himself had forgotten that his 2001

target had been agreed at US$16.5 million. His response to this question on

cross-examination was a meek: <i>"Mistakenly I had written this"</i>.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">49

        There followed an exchange of e-mail which

confirms the Defendant’s position that the matter was far from settled. Indeed, the

Plaintiff himself, in an e-mail dated 6 April 2001 to Goldstein (NEON’s corporate

counsel) said, in relation to the January/February 2001 Denver conference: <i>"…

The finalization of my contract and plan in Denver was purposely delayed in light of the

Sybase Acquisition. The target bonus and its underlying financial targets, which were

presented to me, were never realistic."</i> It is clear from the evidence that there

was no agreement at the Denver conference to set the revenue target at US$16.5 million for

2001 and US$2 million for the first quarter as the Plaintiff contends.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">50

        The Plaintiff relies on the evidence of Koepper

to support his position that Horn had reduced the first quarter 2001 target to US$2

million from US$2.785 million. However I am of the view that Koepper was a partisan

witness as he himself had a disagreement with NEON and from the position he took in

relation to the 2000 target (see above). It is rather surprising that Horn would

gratuitously reduce the Plaintiff’s proposal of US$2.785 million to US$2 million. And

that is certainly not corroborated by the rest of the evidence. I therefore find that

there was no agreement at the Denver sales conference that the first quarter 2001 target

would be US $2 million.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">51

        The parties agree that the revenue achieved in

the first quarter was US$2.119 million. Even if the first quarter target proposed by the

Plaintiff in his presentation at Denver of US$2.785 million had been agreed to, it would

not have been reached. Accordingly the Plaintiff is not entitled to any bonus in respect

of the first quarter 2001 and his claim in respect of this must fail. As he had caused to

be paid to himself $72,000 as part payment of this bonus, it follows that the

Defendant’s counterclaim succeeds and there shall be judgment for that sum in its

favour.</font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Bonus for the second to fourth

quarters 2001</font></p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">52

        The Plaintiff’s claim for bonus for the

second to fourth quarters 2001 is predicated on a finding that his summary dismissal was

unfair, as well as a finding that the targets were reached in those quarters. As I had

dismissed his claim in relation to unfair dismissal, it follows that this claim also

fails. I would also add that there is no evidence before me of what the targets are and

whether they were achieved.</font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Costs</font></p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">53

        In view of the foregoing, the Plaintiff’s

claims are dismissed and there shall be judgment in the sum of $72,000 on the

Defendant’s counterclaim, with interest at the usual rate from the date of the filing

of the counterclaim. There shall be an order for the Plaintiff to pay to the Defendant the

costs of this action, to be taxed if not agreed.</font></p>
