</div>  Since this is not a case where there are multiple classes of assets to which the parties had made different contributions (the Husband was responsible for acquiring the assets as the Wife did not work), the “global assessment methodology” is the appropriate methodology to be used here.

</div> The Wife does not object to the Husband’s retention of his membership. Since the Husband does not wish to transfer the membership to someone else, I see no reason to deduct the transfer fee from the value of the membership.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 I also note that when a party retains property (such as a house) in his or her own name in the event of a divorce, fees that are usually incurred in a potential future sale (such as conveyancing fees) are not typically deducted from the value of that property. Further, where real property (such as the matrimonial home) is transferred from one party to another, it is typically the transferee who bears the cost of any future transfer. Thus, by analogy, I find it reasonable for the Husband, who will continue to retain the benefits of the membership, to solely bear the notional cost of transfer as the membership is already in his own name. I thus adopt the Wife’s valuation of $190,000.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(4) Johor country club membership</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 The Wife values this membership at $6,666 while the Husband values this membership at $4,333. The difference between the values of this asset given by the Parties is again the transfer fees. For the same reasons given in ascertaining the value of the Singapore country club membership, I hold that the value of this asset is $6,666.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(5) Wife’s Prudential Limited Pay insurance policy</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 This is an insurance policy taken out in the Wife’s name. The Wife values it at $33,000 while the Husband values it at $34,764.99. The Wife’s valuation is based solely on the participating assured sum, and the Husband’s valuation consists of that as well as the total guaranteed bonus as at 31 December 2016 and the 2017 guaranteed bonus.

When valuing insurance policies, the courts generally take the surrender value of the policies as the date of the ancillary matters hearing, or any other date agreed by the parties. In other words, the courts do not take into account any increase in the value of policies after the divorce proceedings. Returning to the facts of this case, the bonuses which the Husband has included are payable on claims or maturity only.

1043 (“<span class="font-italic">ANJ v ANK</span>”) the Court of Appeal laid out a structured approach for the division of matrimonial assets. That structured approach was succinctly summarised in <span class="font-italic">TIT v TIU</span> [2016] 3 SLR 1137 at [21] as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) express as a ratio the parties’ direct contributions relative to each other, having regard to the amount of financial contribution each party made towards the acquisition or improvement of the matrimonial assets (“Step 1”);</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) express as a second ratio the parties’ indirect contributions relative to each other, having regard to both financial and nonfinancial contributions (“Step 2”); and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) derive the parties’ overall contributions relative to each other by taking an average of the two ratios above (the derived ratio shall be referred to as “the average ratio”), keeping in mind that, depending on the circumstances of each case, the direct and indirect contributions may not be accorded equal weight, and one of the two ratios may be accorded more significance than the other. Adjustments could also be made in respect of other relevant factors under s 112 or s 114(1) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) (“the Charter”) (“Step 3”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 However, in <span class="font-italic">TNL v </span><span class="font-italic">TNK</span> [2017] 1 SLR 609 (“<span class="font-italic">TNL v TNK</span>”), the Court of Appeal cautioned that the structured approach in <span class="font-italic">ANJ V ANK</span> should not be applied to single-income marriages: at [46]. This is because the working spouse would be “accorded 100% (or close to 100%) of direct contributions” and would “also be accorded a substantial percentage under Step 2 solely on the basis of his or her indirect financial contributions … even if he or she made little or no non-financial contributions”. The non-working spouse is therefore “doubly and (severely) disadvantaged”: at [44]. Thus, in single income marriages, the court should tend towards equal division. In<span class="font-italic"> UBM v UBN</span> [2017] 4 SLR 921, it was clarified that a single-income marriage includes a marriage where one party was primarily the breadwinner and the other primarily the homemaker. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 This approach has been applied in a number of cases. In <span class="font-italic">UMU v UMT and another appeal</span> [2019] 3 SLR 504, the parties were married for 22 years. Although the Wife worked for a number of years, her monthly income was only $650 to $900, a sum so low that she was unable to make any direct financial contribution to the acquisition of matrimonial assets. In the circumstances, the High Court recognised that the husband was the primary breadwinner and the wife a primary homemaker, which resulted in the wife receiving 45% of the assets (before taking into account an adverse inference drawn against the husband). Another similar case is <span class="font-italic">UKA v UKB</span> [2018] 4 SLR 779, where the parties were married for almost 28 years. The husband’s contributions were “very substantial in the breadwinning role”, in building and running a company which was the source of the family’s wealth. Conversely, the wife’s most substantial contributions were in homemaking, largely in raising four children. And while the Wife helped out in the company and the Husband also spent time with the children, the High Court found that the marriage “was an equal partnership of different efforts and should be recognised as such in the division of assets”, and ordered that the assets be divided equally.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 In my judgment, the present case involves a quintessential long single income marriage. The Parties were married for 39 years before they started leading separate lives: [2] above. The Wife was a homemaker throughout the entire marriage. The Husband’s career took him to many countries: between 1973 and 1980, he was posted to Indonesia, Africa and the United States of America. The Wife followed him overseas, where the children spent their initial years. I recognise that it was not easy for the Wife to care for young children, especially when the family was living in Khartoum, Sudan from 1975 to 1978, when the daughters were still babies. There, the family experienced times of food and petrol shortages. As the Husband accepted, it was a difficult posting which he contemplated abandoning when he first arrived.

</div> I also note that that was before a time where one could easily communicate across borders with smart devices and social media. Thus, the Wife’s efforts in caring for the family, particularly in the early years of the marriage, were substantial. This was all the more the case as she did not always have domestic help. On the other hand, I accept that the Husband played his part at home whenever he could. However, the reality was that a substantial proportion of time was spent on his career. Nevertheless, it was through his efforts that the Parties were able to amass more than $7 million worth of assets.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Although each party attempted to accentuate their contributions while downplaying that of the other party, this marriage is in my judgment “an equal partnership of different efforts”. Applying the approach in <span class="font-italic">TNL v TNK</span>, I am of the view that the pool of assets should be divided equally.

Indeed, the High Court has recognised that “maintenance is based on need and not on parties’ contributions to the marriage”: <span class="font-italic">BUX v BUY</span> [2019] SGHCF 4 at [55].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Other issues</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 In his written submissions, the Husband points out that the Parties had in 2009 agreed to split household expenses equally following the sale of an apartment where each party received an equal share of the sale proceeds.
