<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was an action by the plaintiffs against the
                    first defendant, Dafni Igal (“Captain Dafni”), an ex-employee of
                    the first plaintiff, Zim Integrated Shipping Services Ltd (“Zim
                    Shipping”). After Captain Dafni resigned from Zim Shipping, the company
                    claimed it discovered that Captain Dafni had breached his fiduciary duties
                    owed to the plaintiffs and/or his obligations under his employment contract with
                    Zim Shipping and brought the present action against him. Zim Shipping is also
                    suing Benedict Ng Koo Kay (“Benedict”) and Rajathurai Suppiah
                    (“Suppiah”), who is known to some as “Benny”, for
                    procuring Captain Dafni to breach his employment contract and/or fiduciary
                    duties. The plaintiffs raised six distinct incidents which they alleged were
                    breaches of such obligations.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Zim Shipping, the first plaintiff, is an Israeli
                    company in the container shipping business with operations worldwide. As an
                    Israeli company, Zim Shipping was, at the material time, unable to conduct its
                    business directly in Malaysia. The second plaintiff, Gold Star Line Ltd
                    (“GSL”), is a company incorporated in Hong Kong. The third
                    plaintiff, Seth Shipping Ltd (“Seth Shipping”), is a company
                    incorporated in the Republic of Mauritius. The fourth plaintiff, Star Shipping
                    Agencies (Singapore) Pte Ltd (“Star Shipping Agencies”) is a
                    company incorporated in Singapore. GSL and Seth Shipping are owned (ultimately)
                    by Zim Shipping. Star Shipping Agencies is a joint venture between Zim Shipping
                    and some other partners. Henceforth, all four plaintiffs will be referred to
                    collectively as the “plaintiffs” while Zim Shipping and Seth
                    Shipping will be referred to jointly as the
                “Principals”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Captain Dafni joined Zim Shipping as a seaman in
                    1966 and gradually rose through the ranks. With time, Captain Dafni came to hold
                    important positions within the organisation. His following appointments are
                    material for the purpose of the present action:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Managing Director of GSL (30 November 1995
                            – 1 December 2004);</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">President of Zim Shipping for Asia region

                            (4 January 2005 – 30 June 2006).</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Under an employment contract dated 24 May
                    2000 made with Zim Shipping (the “Employment Agreement”), Captain
                    Dafni was appointed as a director of GSL with effect from 1 January 1999.
                    Although there was no prior agreement in relation to Captain Dafni’s
                    appointment as a director of GSL, it is not disputed that Captain Dafni had been
                    so appointed since 30 November 1995, as reflected in the minutes of a GSL
                    directors’ meeting held on 16 August 1995. The salient terms of the
                    Employment Agreement, which was translated from the Hebrew language, are the
                    following:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.    You will perform your job with dedication and
                            loyalty and exercise the best of your knowledge, experience and
                            expertise.</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5.    Throughout your employment with [Zim Shipping], you

                            free of charge, except subject to written authorization from [Zim
                            Shipping’s] CEO, and provided that no real or apparent conflict of
                            interest may arise between [Zim Shipping’s] interests and such
                            other occupation, and that such additional occupation shall not
                            interrupt the performance of your duties.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">27.    (a) During and after your employment with [Zim
                            Shipping], you shall not transfer or make use of any information about
                            [Zim Shipping] or information you have received through your employment
                            with [Zim Shipping] in connection with [Zim Shipping] and which is not
                            in the public domain, you shall maintain the confidentiality of all
                            matters concerning [Zim Shipping’s] business and affairs, and
                            shall not in any way adversely affect [Zim Shipping’s]
                            goodwill.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b) In the event that your employment with [Zim Shipping] is terminated,
                        and regardless of the reason for such termination, you shall not, during one
                        year from the end of your employment with [Zim Shipping], engage in any
                        occupation or provide any service that is liable to create direct
                        competition or a conflict of interest between you and [Zim Shipping], except
                        subject to [Zim Shipping’s] prior consent; with regard to an
                        occupation or provision of service that are liable to create indirect
                        competition or a conflict of interest between you and [Zim Shipping], your
                        above obligation shall be limited to six months from the termination of your
                        employment with [Zim Shipping]. The determination whether competition or a
                        conflict of interest exist shall be made exclusively by [Zim
                        Shipping].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(c)    For the purposes of this Section, “[Zim

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">29    Any conflict arising between you and [Zim Shipping[

                            shall agree, and if you fail to reach an agreement regarding the
                            arbitrator, one will be appointed by the president of the Israel Bar
                            Association at such time.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This Section shall, for all intents and purposes, be deemed an arbitration
                        agreement between you and the [Zim Shipping].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Captain Dafni resigned from Zim Shipping on
                    16 May 2006 as a result of differences with the management. He was placed
                    on garden leave until November 2006. Thereafter, Captain Dafni joined Cheng Lie
                    Navigation Co (“Cheng Lie”), which was a competitor of the
                    plaintiffs. At the time of the trial, Captain Dafni was
                unemployed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Starship Agencies Sdn Bhd (“Starship
                    Agencies”), the fourth defendant, is a company incorporated in Malaysia
                    that carries on the business of a shipping agent. Benedict, the second
                    defendant, was the managing director and owned 55% of the share capital of
                    Starship Agencies. Suppiah, the third defendant, was also one of the directors
                    and shareholders of Starship Agencies. Starship Agencies was incorporated after
                    Benedict had secured the rights to act as Zim Shipping’s shipping agent in
                    Malaysia. At that time, Starship Agencies was managed by Johnny Lim
                    (“Johnny”), who took care of the company’s day to day
                    operations until he passed away on 14 December 2005. Starship Agencies
                    entered into an agreement with Star Shipping Agencies to act as its sub-agent
                    for all the shipping services of Seth Shipping Corporation (which is not to be
                    confused with the third plaintiff). The agreement was formalised under a
                    Standard Agency Agreement dated 1 September 1997 (but executed on
                    19 February 1998). Starship Agencies also had an agreement with GSL made
                    sometime in 1998, under which Starship Agencies was appointed as GSL’s
                    shipping agent in Malaysia.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       In April 1999, GSL started a service between
                    various ports in South East Asia via Port Klang (Malaysia) to Colombo (Sri
                    Lanka). The operator of Port Klang at that time was Westports Malaysia Sdn Bhd
                    (“Westports”). There is considerable dispute between the parties
                    over the tariffs imposed by Westports for the services it provided to Starship
                    Agencies between 2000 and 2005. GSL alleged that Starship Agencies had failed to
                    disclose and/or account for certain waivers and rebates which Westports had
                    allegedly given to Starship Agencies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       As shipping agents for GSL and Star Shipping
                    Agencies, Starship Agencies was also responsible for sourcing transport
                    operators within West Malaysia to provide trucking and depot services for
                    containers shipped onboard the vessels of GSL or Star Shipping Agencies and
                    calling at Port Klang. The plaintiffs alleged that Starship Agencies had failed
                    to secure the most competitive market rates for such depot and trucking charges,
                    and claimed that they managed to negotiate substantially lower rates after
                    Starship Agencies’ services were terminated sometime in
                2006.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Starship Carriers Agencies Pte Ltd
                    (“Starship Carriers”) is a company incorporated in Singapore on
                    1 September 2004 and is a shipping line providing ship management services.
                    It deals (<em>inter alia</em>) with exporting used vehicles
                    from Singapore. Both Benedict and Suppiah are the only two directors and
                    shareholders of Starship Carriers. Star Shipping Agencies (the fourth plaintiff)
                    has a subsidiary known as Zim Logistics S.E.A. Pte Ltd (“Zim
                    Logistics”), which is <u>not</u> a party to the
                    present action. Zim Logistics was formally incorporated on 23 February 2005
                    and is also in the business of providing used-car freight forwarding services.
                    None of the plaintiffs provide such a service. The plaintiffs claimed that
                    Starship Carriers had passed off its business as being that originating from the
                    plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Sometime in August or September 2005, Starship
                    Carriers transferred US$80,000 to Maxwin International Development Ltd
                    (“Maxwin”), a company incorporated in Hong Kong. Captain Dafni
                    holds approximately 60% of the share capital of Maxwin. Another company,
                    Interlink Development Limited, holds the remaining shares in Maxwin. According
                    to the plaintiffs, this US$80,000 was transferred by Starship Carriers under
                    Benedict’s instructions to procure Captain Dafni to breach his employment
                    contract with GSL.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Charter Shipping Agencies (S) Pte Ltd
                    (“Charter Shipping”), the sixth defendant, is a company
                    incorporated in Singapore on 30 January 2002 and is a shipping agency
                    (freight) that provides ship-management services. Benedict is currently the only
                    shareholder of this company, while he and Suppiah are the (only) directors.
                    Suppiah used to be a shareholder of Charter Shipping and became a director with
                    effect from 15 June 2005. Between 2003 and 2006, Charter Shipping employed
                    Captain Dafni as a consultant in respect of certain break-bulk services which
                    the company was interested in providing. Charter Shipping paid for Captain
                    Dafni’s CPF contributions and income tax while he was its employee. There
                    was considerable dispute as to whether Captain Dafni had in fact, accepted a
                    salary from Charter Shipping during the period in question. While employed by
                    Charter Shipping, Captain Dafni, with the company’s assistance, managed to
                    obtain permanent residence and, later, citizenship in Singapore. The plaintiffs
                    alleged that Captain Dafni was in breach of his Employment Agreement and/or
                    fiduciary duties owed to them in accepting the appointment and/or a salary from
                    the company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Additionally, it was the plaintiffs’
                    case that they discovered the following planned purchases by Captain Dafni,
                    Benedict and Suppiah:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_a"></a>(a)     International Freight Logistics LLC
                        (“IFL”), a company incorporated in the United States of
                        America, on or around 15 March 2005; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_b"></a>(b)     a vessel known as MV Pancon Diamond (the
                        “Vessel”) sometime on or around 17 June
                    2005.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It was further alleged that the three persons intended
                    to compete with the plaintiffs’ business through the above
                    purchases.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     After the present action was started, Captain
                    Dafni commenced Summons No 537 of 2008 in which he sought (<em>inter alia</em>) a stay of proceedings under the
                    International Arbitration Act (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed) in favour of
                    arbitration in Israel, pursuant to cl 29 of the Employment Agreement (see
                    above at <a href="#p1_4">[4]</a>). The Assistant Registrar held
                    that cl 29 was wide enough to cover the disputes arising from the claim
                    between Zim Shipping and Captain Dafni and therefore granted a stay of all
                    proceedings between Zim Shipping and Captain Dafni in favour of arbitration. Zim
                    Shipping did not appeal against the stay order.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issues to be determined</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Based on the brief facts set out above, the
                    following issues arose for the court’s determination:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_a"></a>(a)     Did Starship Agencies fail to
                        disclose and/or to account to GSL for the rebates and waivers from
                        Westports?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_b"></a>(b)     Did
                        Starship Agencies fail to secure the best rates available in the market for
                        GSL and/or Seth?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_c"></a>(c)     Did Starship Carriers pass itself off as being a member of the
                        plaintiffs’ group of companies in starting and carrying on the
                        business of freight forwarding of used cars?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_d"></a>(d)     Was Captain Dafni in breach of any of his
                        fiduciary duties in accepting employment from Charter
                    Shipping?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_e"></a>(e)     Was
                        Captain Dafni in breach of any fiduciary duties in planning to purchase IFL
                        or the Vessel?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_f"></a>(f)     Had Captain Dafni failed to disclose his close relationship with Benedict
                        and Suppiah to the plaintiffs?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_g"></a>(g)     Were Starship Agencies, Starship Carriers and/or Charter
                        Shipping the <em>alter egos</em> of Benedict and/or
                        Suppiah?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The applicable law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Before I turn to elaborate upon each of the
                    plaintiffs’ claims, it would be apposite for me to briefly set out the
                    applicable law. There are two levels to the plaintiffs’ case. First, they
                    are claiming against the main parties who had allegedly breached their duties
                    and/or obligations owed to the plaintiffs. I will deal with such primary duties
                    and obligations when they arise later.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Secondly, the plaintiffs are also claiming
                    against those who they claim are accessories to the various breaches. For
                    example, the plaintiffs are claiming (<em>inter alia</em>)
                    against Benedict and Suppiah for allegedly procuring Captain Dafni to breach his
                    employment agreement with GSL by using Charter Shipping to employ him as a
                    consultant and by using Starship Carriers to pay US$80,000 to Maxwin. Starship
                    Carriers is also being sued for “wrongfully [inducing] and [procuring]
                    Captain Dafni’s breach of fiduciary duty with Star Shipping Agencies by
                    paying the sum of USD 80,000”. In addition, there appeared to be a claim
                    made by the plaintiffs that Benedict and Suppiah had procured Captain Dafni to
                    breach his statutory duties as a director under the Companies Act (Cap 50,
                    2008 Rev Ed) (“the CA”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     I will now set out the law on: (i) the tort of
                    inducing a breach of contract as well as on (ii) inducing a breach of fiduciary
                    duties and statutory duties under the CA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(i)   The tort of inducing a breach of contract</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     In order to make out a claim for the tort of
                    inducing a breach of contract, the plaintiff must show that the procurer (a)
                    acted with the requisite knowledge of the existence of the contract (although
                    knowledge of the precise terms is unnecessary) and (b) <em>intended</em> to interfere with the plaintiff’s contractual
                    rights, with such intention to be objectively ascertained (<em>Tribune Investment Trust Inc v Soosan Trading Co Ltd</em> [2000]
                    3 SLR 405 (“<em>Tribune Investment
                    Trust</em>”) at [17]). The act of inducement <em>per
                        se</em> is not actionable (<em>id</em>). As to
                    the first element, the Court of Appeal clarified (in <em>Tribune
                        Investment Trust</em> at [18]) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is sufficient if the defendant <em>knows of the
                            existence of the contract</em> or <em>turns a blind
                            eye to its existence</em> or is <em>reckless as to
                            the consequence of his actions</em> in the sense of being
                        indifferent whether or not a breach happens.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Useful clarification as to what the second
                    element of intention relates to can be found in the following observations of
                    Lord Hoffman in <em>OBG v Allan</em> [2008] 1 AC 1
                        (“<em>OBG</em>”) at [39]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">To be liable for inducing breach of contract<em><u>, you
                            must know that you are inducing a breach of contract. It is not enough
                            that you know that you are procuring an act which, as a matter of law or
                            construction of the contract, is a breach. You must actually realize
                            that it will have this effect. Nor does it matter that you ought
                            reasonably to have done so</u></em>. This proposition is most
                        strikingly illustrated by the decision of this House in <em>British Industrial Plastics Ltd v Ferguson</em> [1940] 1 All ER
                        479, in which the plaintiff’s former employee offered the defendant
                        information about one of the plaintiff’s secret processes which he, as
                        an employee, had invented. The defendant knew that the employee had a
                        contractual obligation not to reveal trade secrets but held the eccentric
                        opinion that if the process was patentable, it would be the exclusive
                        property of the employee. He took the information in the honest belief that
                        the employee would not be in breach of contract. In the Court of Appeal
                        [1938] 4 All ER 504, 513, MacKinnon LJ observed tartly that in accepting
                        this evidence the judge had “vindicated his honesty … at the
                        expense of his intelligence” but he and the House of Lords agreed
                        that he could not be held liable for inducing a breach of contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It is therefore clear that the plaintiffs must show that the
                    defendant(s) in question knew that it was procuring a breach of Captain
                    Dafni’s Employment Agreement. It would not be sufficient merely to show
                    that the acts committed by the defendant had the effect of doing
                so.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(ii)   The tort of inducing a breach of fiduciary duties and
                statutory duties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The plaintiffs also sought to hold Starship
                    Carriers liable as an accessory for Captain Dafni’s breach of fiduciary
                    duties. They did not cite any authorities that expressly recognised the
                    existence of such a tort. Instead, they relied on an article by Lee Eng Beng,
                        “<em>A Perspective on the Economic
                    Torts</em>” [1996] SJLS 482 at 482–483 (the
                    “Article”), whereby the learned author argued:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">While detailed rules have evolved with regard to each of the economic
                        torts, that is, interference with contract, intimidation, conspiracy and
                        unlawful interference with trade or business, the same cannot be said with
                        respect to the founding of a logical structure for the area as a whole.
                        Still less has there been any judicial consideration of the relationship
                        between these torts and the incidence of liability in analogous situations
                        in other areas of the law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is tempting to conclude that the economic torts are nothing more than
                        disparate miscellany which are usually grouped together for reasons of
                        convenience or neatness. Indeed, such a conclusion is not difficult to
                        justify on the existing state of the authorities. <em>The
                            adoption of such a compartmentalised approach, however, ignores the
                            undeniable congruence of policy concerns underlying the purpose and
                            operation of this group of torts, which are admittedly sometimes
                            obscured by inconsistent and anomalous rules</em>. The factual
                        similarities in the contexts in which they are usually invoked are also too
                        obvious to brush away.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The learned author went on to opine (at
                    p 499):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5. Knowing implication in breach of trust or fiduciary duty</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In equity, certain principles of liability bear a strong resemblance to
                        the tort of interference with contractual and other rights and <b><em>the question of whether these principles should be amalgamated
                            with the corresponding tortious principles merits attention</em></b>.
                        The equitable wrong of being knowingly implicated in a breach of trust or
                        fiduciary duty is one example. A defendant who has dishonestly assisted in a
                        breach of trust or fiduciary duty is liable to account to the beneficiary
                        for his loss, irrespective of whether the assisted person also acted
                        dishonestly or fraudulently. <b><em>The position should be the
                            same if he takes the initiative and knowingly induces the breach of
                            trust or fiduciary duty</em></b>. Similarly, a defendant is liable for
                        procuring a breach of an equitable obligation to account owed to the
                        plaintiff by his agent. <b><em>Putting aside the distinctive
                            terminology of the equitable jurisdiction, it is evident that the
                            principle of liability in all these equitable wrongs is fundamentally
                            the same as in the tort of interference with rights</em></b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The similarity between the content of the two principles as well as the
                        context in which their application would usually arise is well-illustrated
                        in <em>Watson v Dolmark Industries Ltd</em>. The
                        defendant in this case was the substantial proprietor of a company which had
                        been granted manufacturing and marketing rights by the plaintiff for a
                        certain type of plastic storage tray, in consideration for royalties
                        calculated by reference to the number of trays manufactured. The defendant,
                        acting on behalf of the company, dishonestly under-declared to the plaintiff
                        the number of trays produced by the company in order to avoid paying the
                        full royalties to which the plaintiff would have been entitled. The company
                        then used the money saved to manufacture and sell a similar product. On
                        facts such as these, it is probable that an action for interference with
                        rights would have succeeded against the defendant for the amount of
                        royalties which had been lost by the plaintiff. As it turned out, however,
                        the defendant’s liability was argued and decided on the basis of
                        knowing implication in a breach of fiduciary duty.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b><em>Keeping the two principles artificially apart by
                            labelling them tortious and equitable cannot be good for the development
                            of the law. The concept of interference in the tort is, by now, probably
                            wide enough to encompass all forms knowing implication in a breach of
                            trust or fiduciary duty</em></b>. Further, a person’s rights
                        under a trust or pursuant to a fiduciary duty owed to him are clearly
                        capable of being protected under the tortious principles. As Lord Hoffman,
                        writing extra-judicially, points out, <b><em>fiduciary
                            obligations and contractual obligations are merely species of
                            obligations and it should be possible to assimilate or at least to
                            reconcile the two forms of liability. The proposition that there is no
                            tort known as inducing a breach of trust or, presumably, also a breach
                            of fiduciary duty, may have to be re-considered in the not-too-distant
                            future</em></b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The learned author’s argument that there
                    is no reason for the distinction in accessory liability between equity and tort
                    law is, on its face, attractive. After all, given that both forms of accessory
                    liability really stem generally from the law of obligations, albeit developed
                    under very different circumstances (as one developed in the realm of equity and
                    the other under the common law), one may argue that there is no good reason for
                    maintaining such a distinction (see Philip Sales, <em>The Tort of
                        Conspiracy and Civil Secondary Liability</em> 49 (1990) CLJ 491 at
                    508).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     From a policy perspective, it would be
                    necessary to consider whether the current forms of accessory liability that have
                    developed in equity, <em>viz</em>, dishonest assistance and
                    knowing receipt, are sufficient to maintain the sanctity of fiduciary
                    relationships vis-à-vis third parties, or whether it is necessary for the law to
                    expand its protection for these vulnerable beneficiaries. Even if such an
                    expansion is necessary or warranted, a question will then arise as to whether
                    such an expansion should take place by relaxing the requirements for knowing
                    receipt and/or dishonest assistance, or by introducing tortious liability for
                    accessory assistance (see, in this respect, the decision of the UK Court of
                    Appeal in <em>Metall und Rohstoff AG v Donaldson Lufkin &amp;
                        Jenrette Inc</em> [1990] 1 QB 391 at p 481).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     From a legal perspective, there may also be
                    conceptual difficulties that would require adjustments into other areas of law:
                    see <em>Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Tort</em> (Sweet &amp;
                    Maxwell, 19th Ed, 2006 at para 25–39). Further, there may be a
                    possible issue relating to remedies. For the tort of inducing a breach of
                    contract, it is said that the claimant may recover in respect of <em>loss of business</em> caused by non-performance of the
                    contract, subject to the rules of remoteness (<em>id</em>).
                    However, a breach of fiduciary duty does not necessarily result in a loss (see
                    the facts of <em>Regal (Hastings) Ltd v Gulliver</em>
                    [1967] 2 AC 134). In addition, it is said that the tort of inducing a
                    breach of contract arises because contractual rights are treated as a species of
                    property deserving of special protection by the imposition of secondary
                    liability on the person who procures the party that breaks the contract to do so
                        (<em>OBG</em> at [32]). It is not clear whether
                    fiduciary rights belong within the same class of property and are deserving of
                    the same special protection as a result.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The Court of Appeal in <em>Canadian Pacific (Bermuda) Ltd v Nederkoorn Pte Ltd</em> [1999]
                    2 SLR 18 considered an argument raised by the appellants that the tort of
                    interference with contractual relations had been extended to procuring or
                    inducing a fiduciary duty, citing <em>The Prudential Assurance Co
                        Ltd v Lorenz</em> (1971) 11 KIR 78 in support. The Court of
                    Appeal dismissed that argument on the ground that the case did not stand for the
                    proposition stated, but did not authoritatively decide whether or not such a
                    tort existed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     On the facts of this case, I find that no
                    breach of the primary fiduciary duties as alleged by the plaintiffs have been
                    proven. As such, it is not necessary for me to decide whether the law of tort
                    should be expanded to recognise the inducement of a breach of fiduciary duty as
                    being actionable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     As for the tort of inducing a breach of
                    statutory duty, this tort appears to be recognised by the UK courts: see
                        <em>Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts</em> (above at
                        <a href="#p1_24">[24]</a>) at para 25–36. However,
                    it must be shown that the provision in question gives rise to a civil remedy
                        (<em>id</em>). Here, the provision in question is
                    s 157 of the CA and s 157(2) entitles the company to bring an action
                    against the director for any profit made by him or damage suffered by the
                    company as a result of any breach of the section. It would therefore appear that
                    the plaintiffs’ can proceed based on the tort of inducing a breach of
                    statutory duty. I will now turn to consider the individual allegations levelled
                    by the plaintiffs against the defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Issues</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(i)   The Rebates and Waivers</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The plaintiffs’ pleaded case was that
                    Starship Agencies had breached its duty as agent in failing to account for the
                    monies which it had received from Westports belonging to Seth Shipping. It was
                    alleged that Captain Dafni, as managing director of GSL and Area President of
                    Asia for Zim Shipping, had negotiated and entered into an agreement with
                    Westports in relation to the tariffs to be paid by the Zim Shipping or GSL for
                    Zim Shipping’s container ships. The plaintiffs alleged that Westports had
                    agreed to grant the following concessions to the Principals or GSL:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_a"></a>(a)     a yearly incentive rebate of 5% on
                        port tariffs paid by the Principals or GSL for all outbound containers
                        exported from Westports from 2000 to the first half of 2005
                        (“Outbound Rebates”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_b"></a>(b)     a yearly incentive rebate on port tariffs paid by the
                        Principals or GSL for all containers transhipped through Westports from 2000
                        to 2001 (“Transhipment Rebates”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_c"></a>(c)     waivers and refunds on the yearly charges paid
                        by the Principals or GSL for storage charges and special request charges
                        from 2003 to 2005 (“Charge Waivers”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     According to the plaintiffs, the above
                    Outbound Rebates (totalling RM 1,477,474), Transhipment Rebates (totalling RM
                    2,921,935) and Charge Waivers (totalling RM 1,231,239) (together, the
                    “rebates and waivers”) were received by Starship Agencies but not
                    passed on to GSL. Further, it was pleaded that Captain Dafni was in breach of
                    his fiduciary duties when, as managing director of GSL and Area President of the
                    Principals, he failed to disclose the rebates and waivers to the management of
                    the Principals or GSL, or to ensure that the rebates and waivers were paid to
                    and received by the Principals or GSL. Further, it was alleged that Captain
                    Dafni had breached his fiduciary duties as the Area President of the Principals
                    in Asia, in failing to take action to terminate Starship Agencies as sub-agent
                    of the Principals when he discovered that Starship Agencies had wrongfully
                    retained the rebates and waivers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Two main issues arose for consideration
                    pursuant to the plaintiffs’ allegations:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_a"></a>(a)     Whether the rebates and waivers were
                        disclosed to the Principals or GSL and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_b"></a>(b)     Whether the rebates and waivers were received by Starship
                        Agencies but not passed onto GSL.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Dan Hoffman (“Hoffman”) who took
                    over as Area President for Asia of Zim Shipping in May 2006, testified that
                    Captain Dafni had overall responsibility for the negotiations of port charges
                    for the vessels of Zim Shipping and Seth Shipping vessels calling at Port Klang,
                    and did so negotiate with Westports. The plaintiffs relied on a letter dated
                    4 February 1999 from Westports to Johnny of Star Shipping Agencies
                    informing them of the rates and tariffs for the various services offered by
                    Westports. In addition, on 23 February 1999, Westports had written to
                    Johnny as follow:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I refer to recent meetings, our confidential letter dated February 4th and
                        several telephone conversations.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In addition to the terms and conditions as contained in the official
                        tariff and in letter dated February 04th we can extend the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1.    Gold Star to enjoy exemption from service charges
                            for a stock of 100 teus of MT equipment for the initial six months of
                            operation</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2    We reaffirm that transhipment cargo charges as per
                            our fax dated February 04th are already discounted by 50
                        percent.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.    Gold Star to enjoy a 5 percent discount on the
                            Terminal Handling &amp; Stevedorage charges for local
                        cargo.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4.    Gold Star line to confirm that they remain
                            committed to the exclusive use of the WestPort terminal within Port
                            Kelang for the service for an initial period of 18 months.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Hoffman alleged that neither of these two
                    letters sent by Westport (the “1999 letters”) or the terms thereof
                    was disclosed to Zim Shipping or GSL. Therefore, Zim Shipping, GSL and Seth
                    Shipping paid full standard rates for all transhipment cargo, outbound cargo and
                    storage charges. Hoffman also testified that Captain Dafni was involved in
                    subsequent negotiations with Westports between 2001 and 2005. In 2001, there
                    were a number of letters exchanged between Captain Dafni and representatives of
                    Westports with respect to the tariffs payable by GSL for Westports’
                    services. These 2001 letters were not copied to Zim Shipping or to anyone else
                    in GSL. Eventually, on 6 December 2001, Captain Dafni (writing on
                    GSL’s letterhead) wrote to Westports to confirm that GSL had accepted
                    Westports’ proposal. Westports’ proposal included a term that they
                    would continue to bill GSL as per the tariffs and would, from January 2001
                    onwards, pay the difference in the rates in the form of a rebate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Further, on 31 October 2002, Captain
                    Dafni wrote to Westports (without copying anyone else) seeking to reduce the
                    rate for handling of MT containers to match the rates offered by PSA, though
                    Westports did not agree to Captain Dafni’s proposal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Schmuel Yoskovitz (“Yoskovitz”),
                    who is the current managing-director of GSL and the previous financial
                    controller for Zim Shipping in the Asia Pacific region (between 2006 and 2008),
                    also testified for the plaintiffs. He stated that he was instructed by Hoffman
                    to account for the transactions entered into by GSL and Seth Shipping with
                    Westports. He received a reply from Ms Chan Chu Wei
                    (“Ms Chan”) of Westports on 30 April 2007 confirming
                    that GSL had “been enjoying a 5% incentive rebate yearly for all its
                    local containers (laden and empty) since its inception with us in 1999”.
                    Upon investigation, Yoskovitz discovered that GSL, Seth Shipping or Star
                    Shipping Agencies did not have copies of the 1999 letters and that they did not
                    have any record of the rebates or discounts referred to in Ms Chan’s
                    letter dated 30 April 2007. Hoffman therefore contacted Westports for a
                    statement of accounts for all rebates, discounts and benefits to Seth Shipping
                    and/or GSL and received an email from Lee Mun Tat (“Lee”) who was
                    a manager of Westports, setting out the rebates and waivers that had allegedly
                    been paid to Starship Agencies. Yoskovitz claimed that GSL did not receive the
                    rebates and waivers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Lee was a witness for the plaintiffs. He
                    provided a record of the relevant documentation purportedly relating to the
                    rebates and waivers, including a long list of credit notes prepared between 2000
                    and 2005 which purportedly reflected the Transhipment Rebates and Charge Waivers
                    given during the period.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The plaintiffs argued that Captain Dafni and
                    Benedict knew about the 1999 letters sent by Westports (see above at <a href="#p1_31">[31]</a>) and had failed to disclose them to any of
                    the plaintiffs, a fact which Captain Dafni denied. The defendants raised a
                    preliminary objection that the 1999 letters were inadmissible as evidence as the
                    makers were not called as witnesses. In response, the plaintiffs argued that
                    s 32(b) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (“the
                    EA”) was applicable. The provision states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Cases in which statement of relevant fact by person who
                            is dead or cannot be found, etc., is relevant</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">32. Statements, written or verbal, of relevant facts made by a person who
                        is dead or who cannot be found, or who has become incapable of giving
                        evidence, or whose attendance cannot be procured without an amount of delay
                        or expense which under the circumstances of the case appears to the court
                        unreasonable, are themselves relevant facts in the following cases:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">or is made in course of business;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b) when the statement was made by such person in the ordinary course of
                        business, and in particular when it consists of any entry or memorandum made
                        by him in books kept in the ordinary course of business or in the discharge
                        of professional duty, or of an acknowledgment written or signed by him of
                        the receipt of money, goods, securities or property of any kind, or of a
                        document used in commerce, written or signed by him, or of the date of a
                        letter or other document usually dated, written or signed by him;</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     However, in order to rely on s 32(b) of
                    the EA, it is incumbent on the plaintiffs to show that the 1999 letters came
                    within the scope of the section and in particular, that it was made in the
                    ordinary course of business (<em>Syarikat Jenka Sdn Bhd v Abdul
                        Rashid bin Harun</em> [1981] 1 MLJ 201). The plaintiffs adduced
                    no evidence whatsoever to show that the 1999 letters had been written in
                    Westports’ ordinary course of business.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Even if the 1999 letters were admissible, I do
                    not think they assist the plaintiffs’ case. The plaintiffs had argued that
                    Captain Dafni and Benedict knew about the 1999 letters at the material time.
                    They relied on three planks to support this contention. First, the plaintiffs
                    pointed out that Captain Dafni had the authority to negotiate the port charges.
                    They highlighted that Captain Dafni had, in his defence, “bragged”
                    about negotiating with the Malaysian Ministry of Transport and stated how GSL
                    had expanded <em>under his leadership</em>. Further, during
                    the 2001 negotiations, Captain Dafni, did not copy the letters to anyone else
                    and indeed, the first letter was initiated by Captain Dafni himself. Second, the
                    plaintiffs highlighted that in a letter dated 30 August 2001, Captain Dafni
                    had rejected the “unnegotiable proposal” and stated he would
                    instruct his agents to pay all bills in accordance with the “current
                    tariff”, indicating that Captain Dafni was in full control of the
                    negotiations and had full authority over the agents in Malaysia. Third, the
                    plaintiffs argued that the defendant’s contention that there were no
                    negotiations of any rates in 1999 was untenable. In a letter dated
                    18 October 2001 from Westports, it was stated that Westports would
                    “maintain… the agreement to hold the RM 70/105 until
                    31 December 2001”, making it clear that the negotiations were for
                    the purpose of resisting an increase in the transhipment tariffs. It was highly
                    unlikely that the commencement of services to GSL was based solely on an oral
                    assurance given to Johnny Lim without any quotations or documentations. The
                    plaintiffs also highlighted that Captain Dafni had, in his Further and Better
                    Particulars filed on 18 December 2008, stated that he could not remember
                    what the government subsidised rates were but could, during cross-examination,
                    state that a 50% rebate was given for all transhipment tariffs to all users.
                    While Benedict claimed there was a published discount rate, he was unable to
                    produce the document even though he said that he had possession of the
                    same.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Although the 1999 letters referred to meetings
                    and telephone conversations, they did not state the parties who had taken part
                    in such discussions. The letters were addressed only to Johnny and were neither
                    addressed nor copied to Captain Dafni. Neither did the letters allude to Captain
                    Dafni’s participation in such discussions. Hoffman had admitted that he
                    did not have personal knowledge as to whether Captain Dafni had conducted the
                    negotiations himself in 1999 (without informing any other staff member in Zim
                    Shipping and/or GSL) or whether the 1999 letters had in fact, been sent to
                    Johnny. Captain Dafni resolutely denied being aware of the 1999 letters at the
                    material time and the plaintiffs did not and could not produce any evidence to
                    contradict him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     There was also nothing in the evidence which
                    showed that Star Shipping Agencies had accepted the offer stated in the 1999
                    letters. In order to enjoy the discounts stated, GSL had to use Westports’
                    facilities exclusively for 18 months but there was no evidence that GSL had done
                    so. Hoffman did not know whether GSL had accepted the condition imposed or used
                    Westports’ facilities exclusively for the first 18 months and neither did
                    Yoskovitz. On the other hand, it was Benedict’s unchallenged evidence that
                    GSL had also used North Ports on many occasions. There was therefore no evidence
                    that the terms of the 1999 letters were binding on the parties
                involved.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Further, the 1999 letters only mentioned the
                    giving of discounts and did not speak of providing the <em>rebates</em> which the plaintiffs are now claiming. As such, even
                    assuming that the 1999 letters were made in the ordinary course of business,
                    they did not help to advance the plaintiffs’ case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The plaintiffs also sought to rely on
                    Ms Chan’s letter of 30 April 2007 (see above at <a href="#p1_34">[34]</a>). A similar objection was raised by the
                    defendants that this letter was inadmissible as Ms Chan was not called to
                    testify. The plaintiffs likewise relied on s 32(b) of the EA (see above at
                        <a href="#p1_36">[36]</a>) to contend that the letter was
                    admissible evidence. Again, the plaintiffs did not adduce any evidence to show
                    that such a letter was made in the ordinary course of business. Even if the
                    letter had been made in the ordinary course of business, I note that there was
                    considerable doubt as to its accuracy. Lee himself believed that there was a
                    mistake in the letter, as the 5% incentive rebate was not meant for empty
                    containers. Hoffman similarly opined that based on the 1999 letter, the discount
                    for local cargo (at item 3 in <a href="#p1_31">[31]</a> above)
                    was not applicable to empty containers. Also, Ms Chan did not provide any
                    evidence to back up the assertions in her letter. Therefore, even if it was
                    admissible, I would have given little weight to Ms Chan’s letter said
                    letter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     As for the negotiations in 2001, it was not in
                    dispute that Captain Dafni was indeed involved in the negotiations, as was
                    clearly borne out by the correspondence between the parties during that period.
                    Captain Dafni had clearly informed Zim Shipping and GSL about the new rates that
                    he had negotiated and agreed to with Westports. On 7 December 2001, Captain
                    Dafni sent a handwritten fax to various senior personnel of Zim Shipping and GSL
                    in Hong Kong, as follow:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Please be advised that we have concluded our negotiation with Westport

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis in underline original, emphasis in bold added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Hoffman himself agreed during
                    cross-examination that Captain Dafni had informed GSL and Zim Shipping about the
                    new rates in 2001. As such, the plaintiffs’ claims that Captain Dafni had
                    been in breach of his fiduciary duties by not disclosing the rebates and waivers
                    to Zim Shipping and/or GSL is clearly not made out.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     I turn now to consider whether Starship
                    Agencies had received the rebates and waivers from Westports as alleged by the
                    plaintiffs. The plaintiffs’ evidence on this point came from Yoskovitz and
                    Lee. Lee had, in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”),
                    provided a computation of the Outbound Rebates, Transhipment Rebates and Charge
                    Waivers purportedly received by Starship Agencies while Yoskovitz testified that
                    the rebates and waivers had not been received by GSL.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     I will first deal with the Transhipment
                    Rebates and the Charge Waivers. On the face of the documents which Lee provided,
                    it was not clear who had prepared the credit notes purportedly evidencing the
                    Transhipment Rebates and Charge Waivers, but it is clear that it was not made by
                    any of the witnesses at trial. The plaintiffs again sought to rely on
                    s 32(b) of the EA to admit these documents into the evidence and argued
                    that Lee had given unchallenged evidence that those documents were made in the
                    ordinary course of business. However, I could find nothing in the evidence to
                    support the plaintiffs’ assertion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Be that as it may, even if those documents
                    were made in the ordinary course of business, I would not have accorded any
                    weight to them. None of these credit notes were signed and as I mentioned
                    earlier, there was no indication as to who the maker of those credit notes was.
                    Apart from the credit notes, the plaintiffs did not produce any other document
                    to show that Starship Agencies had received the Transhipment Rebates or the
                    Charge Waivers to the exclusion of GSL. The plaintiffs therefore fail in their
                    claim for the Transhipment Rebates and Charge Waivers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     I will next deal with the Outbound Rebates.
                    Benedict did not deny that Starship Agencies received cheque payments from
                    Westports between 2000 and 2006. He appeared to accept that the amounts received
                    corresponded to those pleaded by the plaintiffs. His evidence was that the
                    payments were gratuitous incentive payments given to Starship Agencies for its
                    support and patronage and that it had not solicited for such payments. As
                    Starship Agencies did not think that the monies were meant for the plaintiffs,
                    the amounts were not paid over to them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Although Benedict admitted that Starship
                    Agencies had received the monies from Westports amounting to RM 1,477,474, he
                    did not admit that the payments were in respect of the Outbound Rebates. The
                    plaintiffs bore the burden of proving that those payments received were the
                    Outbound Rebates as pleaded. I find that the plaintiffs have not discharged
                    their burden of proof in this respect. The only evidence adduced by the
                    plaintiffs came from the exhibits in Lee’s AEIC comprising of payment
                    vouchers, tables purportedly showing the volume of FCL cargo within the
                    specified time period that were either signed by Ms Chan or one Datuk Tan
                    or unsigned; there were also photocopies of cheques that were made out to
                    Starship Agencies. Lee had admitted that he became involved in the rebate
                    calculation process only from mid-2004 onwards. Therefore, the rebates tables
                    and payment vouchers prepared before June 2004 were inadmissible as Lee was not
                    the maker. No evidence was adduced to show that the documents were prepared
                    in the ordinary course of business. Indeed, given that Lee had admitted that
                    such rebates were highly confidential, it did not seem to me that such tables
                    and vouchers had been prepared in the ordinary course of business. I did not get
                    the impression that it would not be possible to procure the makers of those
                    documents to attend court without unreasonable delay and expense as both
                    Ms Chan and Datuk Tan were still involved in Westports’ business at
                    the time of the trial. As for the rebates tables and payment vouchers prepared
                    after June 2004, Lee had admitted during cross-examination that he did not have
                    any personal knowledge about the rebates to GSL and/or Zim Shipping as these
                    matters were highly confidential. Further, I noted that the payment vouchers and
                    tables that were prepared by Westports were internal documents that had not been
                    provided to Starship Agencies for its verification. Apart from those documents,
                    the plaintiffs did not produce any other documents to show that Starship
                    Agencies had indeed received the Outbound Rebates as pleaded. Accordingly, the
                    plaintiffs fail in their claim for the rebates and waivers.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">
<em>(ii)W</em>ere the depot and trucking charges
                competitive or inflated?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The plaintiffs alleged that Starship Agencies,
                    as agent for GSL and Star Shipping Agencies, had failed to ensure that they
                    would secure the most competitive rates for depot and trucking charges available
                    at the market, for freight that was carried on board the vessels of Zim Shipping
                    calling at Port Klang, for the period between 2002 and 2005. The plaintiffs
                    alleged that the rates paid by GSL were substantially inflated. They also
                    pleaded that Captain Dafni had breached his fiduciary duty as managing-director
                    of GSL by failing to ensure that GSL would obtain the most competitive rates for
                    depot and trucking charges for freight carried on board Zim Shipping’s
                    vessels calling at Port Klang between 2002 and 2005. The plaintiffs also alleged
                    that Captain Dafni was in breach of his fiduciary duties when, as Area President
                    of the Principals, he did not take any action to terminate Starship Agencies as
                    a sub-agent of the Principals, when he knew that Starship Agencies had
                    wrongfully charged GSL or the Principals inflated depot and trucking
                    rates.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     To support their claims, the plaintiffs relied
                    primarily on a comparison chart prepared by Simon Whitelaw

<p class="Judg-1">The chart also provided a similar comparison in respect of services at
                    Penang and Pasir Gudang. In addition, the plaintiffs also relied on Ayal
                    Anat’s evidence that when GSL and Seth Shipping renegotiated the rates on
                    their own after 2006, they managed to get significantly lower rates even without
                    much bargaining. Ayal Anat is the Logistics Director for Zim Shipping in the
                    Asia Pacific region and has held on to this position since February 2004. The
                    plaintiffs further contended that Starship Agencies’ claim that it had
                    given all the quotations in this respect to GSL for approval and that
                    GSL’s staff had made regular visits and audits were untenable, especially
                    since no quotations had been provided.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     The plaintiffs’ claim was that inflated
                    trucking and depot charges had been paid for freight carried on board Zim
                    Shipping’s <em>vessels</em> calling at Port Klang
                        <em>between 2002 and 2005</em>. However, Hoffman
                    himself had admitted that Zim Shipping’s vessels did not call at Port
                    Klang during this period. In addition, although the plaintiffs’ claim
                    related to the period between 2002 and 2005, none of the witnesses gave evidence
                    on what the prevailing market rates were during that period. Hoffman and Ayal
                    Anat agreed that they did not have any personal knowledge on this issue. As for
                    Whitelaw’s chart, it only related to the rates payable in the first six
                    months of 2006. In addition, there was no evidence that the rates CMA paid in
                    2006 were the prevailing market rates at the material time. Indeed, given the
                    differences in the size of the two companies and the volume of their respective
                    operations at Port Klang, it is questionable whether the rates obtained by CMA
                    (the world’s third largest container shipping company) as reflected in the
                    chart could have been obtained by other smaller players in the same market.
                    Whitelaw himself admitted that there were substantial differences between the
                    size of the operations of CMA and Zim Shipping and added that the rates obtained
                    by CMA were “probably the best rates available in the market”.
                    Additionally, Whitelaw did not provide any documentation to substantiate the
                    rates that CMA was purportedly paying as shown in the chart. Neither did Zim
                    Shipping provide any proof to substantiate its claim that the rates it obtained
                    thereafter were substantially lower.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Further, it appeared to me that the contracts
                    for such trucking and depot services had to be approved by Zim Shipping before
                    Starship Agencies could accept them. During cross-examination, Ayal Anat stated
                    that the procedure for entering into such a contract and reviewing claims
                    thereafter was as follow:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    …Are you saying that the agency can enter
                            into contracts with the vendors without the approval of you or
                            Zim?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    It’s against our policy but he

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     As such, I find that the plaintiffs have not
                    satisfied their burden of proving that the depot and trucking charges between
                    2002 and 2005 were substantially inflated. There was no basis for the
                    plaintiffs’ claims against Starship Agencies in agency or against Captain

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(iii)   The claim in passing-off</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     It is not immediately clear which parties
                    amongst the plaintiff(s) were claiming under the tort of passing off. While
                    Starship Carrier’s business most closely resembled Zim Logistics’
                    business, the latter is not a party to the present action. The plaintiffs’
                    Statement of Claim (Amendment No 3) simply states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b><u>The Principals’ claim against Starship

                            freight forwarding of used cars in Singapore…</p>

                            used car forwarding business in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">58.    Starship Carriers had passed itself off as being

                            Principals in Singapore and unless prevented to do so will continue to
                            pass off as one of the Plaintiffs’ group of
                        companies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     During cross examination, Vincent Chew
                    (“Vincent”), the director of Zim Logistics and the general manager
                    of Star Shipping Agencies, gave evidence that neither Zim Shipping nor Seth
                    Shipping were in the business of providing freight-forwarding of used cars in
                    Singapore, contradicting the Plaintiffs’ pleaded case at paras 55 and 58.
                    The plaintiffs clarified that the “Plaintiffs’ group of
                    companies” in the Statement of Claim (Amendment No 3) referred to
                    Star Shipping Agencies only, and that the goodwill referred to in para 58
                    thereof was “in the name “Star Shipping” and the business
                    that was associated with the name “Star Shipping”” (in
                    providing all kinds of freight services). Further, Vincent agreed during
                    cross-examination that the action for passing-off was being brought by Star
                    Shipping Agencies. As such, I will proceed on the basis that Star Shipping
                    Agencies is the party claiming under the tort of passing-off.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The plaintiffs pleaded that Captain Dafni had
                    breached his fiduciary duty and statutory duty owed under s 157 of the CA
                    when, as Area President of the Principals in Asia, he failed to stop Benedict
                    and Suppiah from incorporating Starship Carriers to compete with the
                    Principals’ business. It is also pleaded that Benedict and Dafni had
                    induced Captain Dafni to breach his statutory duty in so doing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     In order to succeed in their claim for
                    passing-off, the plaintiff bears the burden of proving (a) the presence of
                    goodwill; (b) misrepresentation; and (c) damage to goodwill (<em>Novelty Pte Ltd v Amanresorts Ltd</em> [2009] 3 SLR 216
                        (“<em>Amanresorts (CA)</em>”) at
                    [37]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     The two essential features of goodwill are:
                    (a) the association of a good, service or business on which the
                    plaintiff’s get-up (its mark, name, labelling, <em>etc</em>) has been applied with a particular source; and (b) this
                    association being an attractive force which brings in custom (<em>Amanresorts (CA)</em> at <a href="#p1_38">[38]</a>).
                    Such goodwill can be limited to particular sections of the public, however small
                    so long as they are not negligible (<em>id</em> at
                        <a href="#p1_44">[44]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Vincent’s evidence was that Zim
                    Logistics had entered into the used car freight forwarding business sometime in
                    2004. When Benedict and Suppiah came to know about Zim Logistics’
                    lucrative business, they decided to compete for a share in the market. Vincent
                    claimed his sales staff told him that Benedict’s staff had approached
                    their customers, and that the customers were confused and believed that Starship
                    Carriers belonged to the Zim group of companies, especially Star Shipping
                    Agencies. Vincent also noted that Starship Carriers’ website mistakenly
                    indicated that it was incorporated since 1997, which coincided with the time Zim
                    Logistics started the used car freight forwarding business. Vincent also
                    highlighted that he had sent an email to Benedict (copied to Captain Dafni) to
                    complain about how Starship Carriers had aggressively entered the market,
                    undercut rates and was taking away Zim Logistics’ clients through the
                    confusion. Hoffman’s evidence was to the effect that Star Shipping
                    Agencies carried on business as Zim Shipping’s exclusive agent for
                    Singapore and its function was to monitor, supervise and manage all the
                    sub-agents around South East Asia, including Starship Agencies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     However, the plaintiffs did not provide any
                    evidence of goodwill associated with the “Star Shipping” name. In
                    addition, it seems to me that any goodwill that may be associated with the
                    “Star Shipping” name would not be in relation to the used car
                    freight forwarding business, as Vincent agreed that Star Shipping Agencies did
                    not carry on such a business. The plaintiffs therefore have not satisfied their
                    burden of proving that there was any goodwill associated with the “Star
                    Shipping” name.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     In any case, even assuming that there was
                    goodwill associated with the “Star Shipping” name, the plaintiffs
                    did not show or explain how Starship Agencies had made a misrepresentation to
                    the relevant sector of the public or how such misrepresentation resulted in
                    actual or probable damage to Star Shipping Agencies’ goodwill. The
                    plaintiffs relied on the phonetic and visual similarities between the two names
                    and the fact that Starship Agencies had represented that they had been in the
                    business since 1997 and used the same Export Processing Zone as Zim Logistics.
                    While there may be some visual and phonetic similarities between the two names
                    involved, there was however no evidence that the name “Star
                    Shipping” had become distinctive of its services, especially since the
                    name consisted of ordinary descriptive words. In any case, it is clear that any
                    misrepresentation for passing-off would be actionable only if it caused actual
                    or likely confusion (<em>Amanresorts (CA)</em> at [77]).
                    Vincent’s assertions that he “received news <em>from
                        [his] sales staff</em>” [emphasis added] that Star Shipping
                    Agencies’ customers were confused and believed that Starship Carriers
                    belonged to the Zim group of companies (particularly Star Shipping Agencies) was
                    hearsay and inadmissible as evidence. The plaintiffs produced no evidence of any
                    confusion over the “Star Shipping” name.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     As such, I would dismiss the plaintiffs’
                    claims for passing-off. I also reject the plaintiffs’ claim that Captain
                    Dafni was in breach of his fiduciary duties in allowing Starship Carriers to be
                    incorporated to compete with the business of the Principals’ carriers in
                    this respect. Vincent admitted that within the Zim group, only Zim Logistics was
                    involved in the used car freight forwarding business. It was therefore not
                    possible for Starship Carriers to compete with the business of the Principals in
                    Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(iv)   Captain Dafni’s employment by Charter
                Shipping</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     The plaintiffs pleaded that Captain Dafni had
                    breached his fiduciary duty and statutory duty under s 157 of the CA when,
                    as Area President for the Principals in Asia, he had worked for and received
                    remuneration from Charter Shipping, and that Benedict and Suppiah had procured
                    Captain Dafni to breach his statutory duty. They further pleaded that Benedict,
                    Suppiah and Charter Shipping had wrongfully induced and procured Captain Dafni
                    to breach his employment contract with GSL by using Charter Shipping to employ
                    and pay (in Benedict and Suppiah’s case) or in employing and paying (in
                    Charter Shipping’s case) Captain Dafni a salary and CPF
                    contributions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     Hoffman’s evidence on this point was
                    that he came to find out about Captain Dafni’s employment by Charter
                    Shipping after Captain Dafni had resigned from Zim Shipping. It is not in
                    dispute that Captain Dafni was employed by Charter Shipping between January 2003
                    to November 2006, and had received CPF contributions and income tax payments
                    from the company. In January 2003, Charter Shipping assisted Captain Dafni to
                    apply for an employment pass to work in Singapore, and approval was obtained
                    shortly after for Captain Dafni to work as the chief operating officer of
                    Charter Shipping. Hoffman highlighted that in Captain Dafni’s application
                    for permanent residence in September 2003, both Captain Dafni and Charter
                    Shipping stated that he was employed as an executive director and drew a gross
                    salary of $15,000 per month since March 2003. When the application was rejected,
                    Charter Shipping wrote to the authorities to state that Captain Dafni was still
                    drawing a salary of $15,000 as executive director and was stationed overseas.
                    His application for permanent residence was later approved.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     Subsequently, in September 2005, Captain Dafni
                    wanted to apply for Singapore citizenship and was informed that the main issue
                    to his application would be his physical presence in Singapore. Captain Dafni
                    was told to obtain a letter from his company stating that his job required him
                    to spend time outside Singapore. Captain Dafni sought Benedict’s
                    assistance on this matter. Thereafter, Captain Dafni successfully obtained
                    Singapore citizenship.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     According to Captain Dafni, he had taken up
                    employment with Charter Shipping as a consultant to facilitate his application
                    for Singapore citizenship and to assist it in its business in project cargo and
                    oversized conventional break bulk cargo, a business which GSL and Zim Shipping
                    were not and did not intend to be involved in. The Singaporean passport was of
                    importance to him as his job required him to travel regularly to Muslim
                    countries, which was not permissible with an Israeli passport. Captain Dafni
                    proposed to the management of Zim Shipping that he obtain a Singapore passport
                    as there were plans to move and list GSL in Singapore, but the move did not
                    materialise due to the economic downturn in 2002. When Charter Shipping sought
                    his advice on its business, he saw an opportunity to use this consultancy to
                    obtain Singapore citizenship. Captain Dafni claimed he verbally informed
                    Mr Strammer, who was Zim Shipping’s vice-president based in Israel,
                    about this arrangement and that Mr Strammer had approved it. Captain Dafni
                    also stated that he waived the monthly salary of $15,000 as he was already
                    receiving a salary from Zim Shipping.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     The plaintiffs submitted that Captain Dafni
                    had lied about his employment by Charter Shipping as a consultant and waiving
                    his salary. They relied heavily on the documents submitted by Charter Shipping
                    and Captain Dafni in support of his application for permanent residence (above
                    at <a href="#p1_65">[65]</a>). Further, the plaintiffs argued
                    that Mr Strammer’s approval had not been obtained as there was
                    nothing in writing. In addition, if Mr Strammer’s approval had been
                    obtained, the plaintiffs would have arranged for Star Shipping Agencies (rather
                    than a third party) to assist Captain Dafni in obtaining an employment pass or
                    permanent residence. Also, Captain Dafni’s employment contract expressly
                    prohibited him from working for any other party. Given that Captain Dafni had
                    worked for Charter Shipping (and had declared the same to the ICA and the IRAS),
                    the plaintiffs argued that the burden of proof shifted onto Captain Dafni to
                    show that he had obtained Zim Shipping’s approval, under s 108 of the
                    EA. In addition, the plaintiffs relied on the fact that Captain Dafni, when
                    questioned by Zim Shipping in 2006 about his ties with Benedict, did not mention
                    about his employment by Charter Shipping.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     I believe Captain Dafni’s evidence that
                    he had informed Mr Strammer about his employment by Charter Shipping in
                    order to obtain Singapore citizenship and that Mr Strammer had consented to
                    such. The fact that Captain Dafni wanted to obtain Singapore citizenship did not
                    appear to be a secret to me. David Malkoff, another of the plaintiffs’
                    witnesses, gave evidence that Captain Dafni had told him about his desire to
                    become a Singapore citizen, and how he “tried…for a long time to
                    become a Singapore citizen”. Further, David Malkoff also recounted that
                    Captain Dafni had, during a meeting with him, discussed the possibility of his
                    (Captain Dafni’s) obtaining permanent residency in Singapore during
                    negotiations about relocating GSL’s offices to Singapore for GSL to enjoy
                    certain tax benefits and to conduct an initial public offer. The plaintiffs do
                    not dispute this part of David Malkoff’s evidence. Since Captain Dafni had
                    previously attempted to become a Singapore citizen, he would have required Zim
                    Shipping’s or GSL’s support to do so and would therefore have
                    informed his superiors about his plans.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     In addition, I accept Captain Dafni’s
                    explanations that it was not possible to be employed by Star Shipping Agencies
                    in order to obtain his Singapore citizenship. Star Shipping Agencies was the
                    agent of GSL (of which Captain Dafni was the managing-director) and that would
                    have created a conflict of interest. Further, Star Shipping Agencies was owned
                    partly owned by Indonesian parties with political or military links and Captain
                    Dafni did not want them to be aware of his reason for becoming an employee. The
                    plaintiffs did not challenge that part of his evidence. Further, Captain Dafni
                    gave evidence that he had waived the $15,000 salary from Charter Shipping. His
                    evidence was corroborated by Benedict, whom I found to be a truthful witness
                    from observing his demeanour in court. Hoffman himself admitted during
                    cross-examination that he did not know whether Charter Shipping had, <em>in fact</em>, paid Captain Dafni his $15,000
                salary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     Whatever had been stated on the respective
                    forms from Captain Dafni or Charter Shipping to the relevant authorities, to the
                    effect that Captain Dafni was drawing a salary of $15,000 per month was, in my
                    view, not conclusive of the issue of whether Captain Dafni did, <em>in fact</em>, draw a salary from Charter Shipping in the
                    present circumstances. At most, it would indicate that the makers of those
                    statements had been less than honest (a finding which I do not need to make),
                    and in any case, this would be a matter between them and the relevant
                    authorities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     Given that Captain Dafni had informed
                    Mr Strammer about his employment by Charter Shipping, I do not think that
                    Captain Dafni was in breach of his fiduciary duties. The plaintiffs did not
                    meaningfully dispute Captain Dafni’s evidence that Charter
                    Shipping’s business was not in competition with that of the plaintiffs. In
                    this light, it is difficult to see how any breach of fiduciary duty arising out
                    of a conflict of interest or otherwise can arise. As for the issue as to whether
                    Captain Dafni was thereby in breach of the Employment Agreement, I would observe
                    that the proceedings between Zim Shipping and Captain Dafni have been stayed in
                    favour of arbitration in Israel (see above at <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a>) and it is therefore not necessary to decide the issue
                    here.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     Assuming Captain Dafni was in breach of the
                    Employment Agreement (a finding which I need not make), in my view, neither
                    Benedict nor Suppiah would have been liable for inducing Captain Dafni to breach
                    the Employment Agreement. The plaintiffs have not discharged their burden with
                    respect to proving the requisite elements of knowledge and intention (see above
                    at <a href="#p1_18">[18]</a>-<a href="#p1_19">[19]</a>). There was no evidence that Benedict and/or Suppiah were
                    aware about the Employment Agreement. Further, Benedict had given evidence that
                    he honestly thought Captain Dafni had obtained the requisite approval and
                    therefore would not be in breach of any agreement. As I have indicated earlier
                    (at <a href="#p1_70">[70]</a>), I found Benedict to be a truthful
                    witness. Suppiah, on the other hand, only became a director of Charter Shipping
                    in 2005 and therefore could not have procured or intended for Captain Dafni to
                    breach the Employment Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(v)   The US$80,000 transfer from Starship Carriers to
                Maxwin</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     The plaintiffs alleged that Benedict and
                    Suppiah had wrongfully induced and procured Captain Dafni to breach his
                    employment contract with or fiduciary duties owed to GSL by using Starship
                    Carriers to pay US$80,000 to Maxwin, a company controlled and owned by Captain
                    Dafni, purportedly to cause Captain Dafni to favour Starship Carriers over the
                    interests of Star Shipping Agencies and its used car freight forwarding
                    business. It was also claimed that Starship Carriers had wrongfully induced and
                    procured Captain Dafni to breach his fiduciary duty with Star Shipping Agencies
                    by paying him US$80,000 and by causing Starship Carriers to pass itself off as
                    being part of the plaintiffs’ group of companies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     In his affidavit, Hoffman stated that Starship
                    Carriers, a company controlled and owned by Benedict and Suppiah, had caused
                    US$80,000 to be transferred into Maxwin, which he alleged was Captain
                    Dafni’s “private company”. However, during
                    cross-examination, Hoffman admitted that Maxwin was not a company
                    “controlled and owned by Captain Dafni” as pleaded in the
                    plaintiffs’ Statement of Claim (Amendment No 3). Hoffman also
                    admitted that he had no evidence as to how the alleged US$80,000 inducement had
                    led to any of the breaches alleged by the plaintiffs or that Starship Carriers
                    had procured Captain Dafni to breach his fiduciary duties with Star Shipping
                    Agencies by paying this US$80,000 sum to Maxwin. The plaintiffs plainly had no
                    evidence to show how this transfer of US$80,000 caused Captain Dafni to be in
                    breach of the Employment Agreement or his fiduciary duties. There was also no
                    evidence on how Benedict, Suppiah or Starship Carriers had the requisite
                    knowledge or intention (see above at <a href="#p1_18">[18]</a>-<a href="#p1_19">[19]</a>) to support the
                    plaintiffs’ claims for accessory liability. I would accordingly dismiss
                    the plaintiffs’ claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(vi)   The planned purchase of IFL and the Vessel</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     The plaintiffs pleaded that Captain Dafni was
                    in breach of his fiduciary duty when, as Area President for the Principals in
                    Asia, he (together with Benedict and Suppiah) had planned to purchase IFL (on or
                    around 15 March 2005) and the Vessel (on or around 17 June 2005) to
                    compete with the plaintiffs’ business. In respect of the planned purchase
                    of the Vessel, it was further pleaded that Captain Dafni had also breached his
                    statutory duties under s 157 of the CA in so doing which breach was
                    procured by Benedict and Suppiah.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     With regard to the planned purchase of IFL,
                    Hoffman relied on an email sent by one Carmelita Yulo
                    (“Ms Yulo”) to Captain Dafni dated 16 March 2005 in
                    which Ms Yulo sought a response from Captain Dafni as to whether Suppiah
                    was the sole decision-maker in relation to the proposed purchase, and whether
                    Captain Dafni would support the venture. Hoffman also relied on a separate chain
                    of emails dated 15 March 2005 that Suppiah wrote to Benedict and Captain
                    Dafni, recommending against entering into the IFL purchase.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     As for the planned purchase of the Vessel,
                    Hoffman relied on an email dated 17 June 2005 sent by Benedict to Captain
                    Dafni to assert that they had intended to purchase the same to compete with the
                    plaintiffs’ business. The email stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Hi Igal</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Vincent Lim of Excel Shipping proposed us to purchase this ship.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[An attachment containing the Vessel’s particulars was
                        attached]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The price of this ship is about USD5.5 million.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The proposed deployment routes will be Singapore, Pasir Gudan, Port Klang,
                        Penang &amp; Belawan.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As I do not know the ship’s price, kind advise whether the price is
                        acceptable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Best Regards</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Ben Ng</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     The defendants contended that they did not
                    plan to purchase IFL or the Vessel to compete with any of the plaintiffs’
                    business. Benedict and Suppiah gave unchallenged evidence that neither IFL nor
                    the Vessel competed with the plaintiffs’ business. Hoffman admitted during
                    cross-examination that he did not know whether those transactions were
                    undertaken or completed, and, that he had no evidence to show that Captain
                    Dafni, Benedict and Suppiah were business partners.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     It is true that in an email sent by Captain
                    Dafni to Ms Yulo on 19 March 2005, he had said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>The biz in the states is a biz that is supposed to be
                            done under a private company owned by me and ben, mr, benny suppiah is

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">You have to understand that no biz. Is being done for charity, biz is

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I do not have the chance to come currently to the states, and in any case

                        not go for it as we can invest this money in some other biz that can yield
                        better return on our investment…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     I am of the view that the email is on its own,
                    insufficient to substantiate the plaintiffs’ claim. I accept Captain
                    Dafni’s explanation that he had given the impression that he was a part of
                    the deal in order to pacify Ms Yulos, who was dealing with Suppiah and
                    Benedict for the first time. The email has to be seen in the light of
                    Ms Yulos’ earlier email where she was asking questions about Suppiah
                    (at <a href="#p1_77">[77]</a>). The plaintiffs could not show any
                    evidence of any company which was owned by both Captain Dafni and
                    Suppiah.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     With respect to the email on the Vessel (at
                        <a href="#p1_78">[78]</a>), Captain Dafni’s evidence
                    that Benedict had asked him for his opinion about the Vessel was borne by the
                    text of the email. Hoffman agreed this was the case during cross-examination.
                    Further, it is noteworthy that Captain Dafni had sent an email to Zim
                    Shipping’s office to ask for advice on the value of the Vessel. It is
                    therefore difficult to see how it could be said that Captain Dafni was in breach
                    of his fiduciary duties owed to the Principals in such a case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     There was therefore no evidence that either
                    IFL or the Vessel was in competition with the plaintiffs’ business.
                    Neither was there any evidence that Captain Dafni was interested in those
                    business opportunities, or that either purchase had taken place. Indeed, if
                    Captain Dafni had intended to purchase the Vessel and such act amounted to a
                    breach of his fiduciary duties, it would make no sense for him to seek a
                    valuation from Zim Shipping. I would therefore dismiss the plainiffs’
                    claim that Captain Dafni was in breach of his common law fiduciary duties or his
                    statutory duties under the CA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(vii)   Did Captain Dafni fail to disclose his relationship with
                Benedict and Suppiah?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     The plaintiffs pleaded that Captain Dafni was
                    in breach of his fiduciary duties by failing to disclose to the Principals about
                    his close relationship and/or cooperation with Benedict and Suppiah, who
                    controlled Charter Shipping at that time. Charter Shipping, the plaintiffs
                    highlighted, was a shipping agent of Cheng Lie.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     The plaintiffs relied on an email dated
                    19 March 2005 at <a href="#p1_80">[80]</a> (wherein Captain
                    Dafni had stated that he owned a company with Benedict and Suppiah, the emails
                    sent in June 2005 in relation to the Vessel (at <a href="#p1_78">[78]</a>) and how Captain Dafni came to be employed by Cheng Lie
                    after resigning from Zim Shipping. Consequently they argued that Captain Dafni,
                    by failing to disclose his relationship and cooperation with Benedict and
                    Suppiah, was put in a conflict of interest and therefore was in breach of his
                    fiduciary duties. However, as I explained earlier, the emails that the
                    plaintiffs relied on did not establish that Captain Dafni had agreed to do
                    business with Benedict or Suppiah. Neither do I see how Captain Dafni, by
                    joining Cheng Lie after being placed on garden leave for six months, could
                    thereby be in breach of his fiduciary duties. I would accordingly dismiss this
                    item of the plaintiffs’ claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(viii)   Were Starship Agencies, Starship Carriers and/or Charter
                Shipping alter egos of Benedict and/or Suppiah?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     The plaintiffs pleaded that Starship Agencies,
                    Starship Carriers and Charter Shipping were likewise accessories to the tort of
                    inducing the breach of Captain Dafni’s Employment Agreement, together with
                    Benedict and Suppiah. They relied on the fact that Benedict and Suppiah held the
                    majority and controlling interest in the respective companies, the roles that
                    each company played in respect of the alleged breaches and the fact that those
                    companies had benefitted from the alleged breaches.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     I understood the plaintiffs’ position,
                    from its submissions, to be that the corporate veil for Starship Agencies,
                    Starship Carriers and Charter Shipping should be lifted and these companies
                    should likewise be liable for the tort of inducing a breach of contract.
                    However, I do not think that the plaintiffs can succeed. The plaintiffs, in its
                    submissions, relied on the following matters to support their claim that the
                    corporate veil should be lifted. For Charter Shipping, the plaintiffs
                    highlighted that the declarations it made to the various statutory authorities
                        (<em>e g</em> the IRAS and CPF) were “pure
                    fabrication” that created a false impression that Captain Dafni was being
                    “paid” for consultancy work. For Starship Carriers, the plaintiffs
                    highlighted how the company’s website had wrongly stated that it had been
                    in the used car freight forwarding business since 1997, that it had paid
                    US$80,000 to Maxwin (controlled by Captain Dafni) and had used confidential
                    information to compete directly with Zim Logistics, and argued that the company
                    had been used to create a false picture that there was a separate and distinct
                    business from Star Shipping Agencies when, in fact, it had paid Captain Dafni
                    for a share of the pie. For Starship Agencies, it highlighted how the company,
                    by not disclosing the 1999 letters, enjoyed the retained monies and inflated
                    charges and could not have done so without Captain Dafni agreeing to stay
                    silent. It also highlighted that Benedict and Suppiah were the majority and
                    controlling shareholders of the three companies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     In my view, the fact that Charter Shipping had
                    wrongly made declarations to the authorities or that Starship Carriers had
                    wrongly stated when it commenced its used car freight forwarding business do not
                    justify the lifting of the corporate veil. As for the remaining allegations, I
                    have already found that they had not been made out based on the
                    plaintiffs’ own evidence. In addition, I would point out that Starship
                    Agencies was managed by Johnny until he passed away in 2005. In any case, the
                    plaintiffs accepted that the fact that Benedict and/or Suppiah were the
                    controlling or majority shareholders of the defendant companies, without more,
                    would not be enough to lift the corporate veil. I would accordingly dismiss this
                    last head of the plaintiffs’ claims as well.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     For all the reasons set out earlier, I dismiss
                    the plaintiffs’ eight heads of claim with costs to the defendants to be
                    taxed on a standard basis unless otherwise agreed.</p>
