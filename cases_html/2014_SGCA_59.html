<p class="Judg-Author">
        Chao Hick Tin JA:</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The present criminal references, Criminal
                    Reference Nos 5 and 6 of 2013 (hereafter referred to separately as “CRF
                    5/2013” and “CRF 6/2013”) arise out of two criminal cases
                    heard by the High Court in the exercise of its original criminal jurisdiction.
                    The two cases involve trafficking and importation offences under ss 5(1)
                    and 7 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the
                    MDA”) respectively, for which the punishment was, until very recently,
                    death.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       From 1 January 2013, following amendments
                    to the MDA, s 33B of the MDA (“s 33B”) allows a person
                    convicted of an offence under ss 5(1) and 7 of the MDA to avoid the
                    mandatory death penalty if two conditions are met. The first condition, pursuant
                    to s 33B(2), is that the person convicted must prove, on a balance of
                    probabilities, that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(<em>a</em>)    … his involvement in the offence
                            under section 5(1) or 7 was restricted —</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(i)    to transporting, sending or delivering a
                                controlled drug;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(ii)   to offering to transport, send or deliver a
                                controlled drug;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(iii)   to doing or offering to do any act
                                preparatory to or for the purpose of his transporting, sending or
                                delivering a controlled drug; or</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(iv)   to any combination of activities in
                                sub-paragraphs (i), (ii) and (iii) …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>A person convicted who satisfies the court that he falls
                        within one of sub-paragraphs (i) to (iv) will be considered a courier. This
                        mitigating scheme under s 33B(2) shall be referred to, for convenience,
                        as “the statutory relief of being a courier”, the relief being
                        that the death penalty is not mandatory <em>if</em> the
                        person convicted also meets the second condition, which is:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(<em>b</em>)    the Public
                            Prosecutor certifies to any court that, in his determination, the person
                                [<em>ie</em>, the courier] has substantively
                            assisted the Central Narcotics Bureau in disrupting drug trafficking
                            activities within or outside Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>For ease of reference, this will be referred to as the
                        “s 33B certificate”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Even if the two conditions are met,
                    s 33B(1) gives the court the discretion to decide if the person convicted
                    should nevertheless be given the death penalty. If the court decides that the
                    death penalty is not warranted, the court may sentence the person convicted to
                    imprisonment for life and caning of not less than 15 strokes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       It suffices to note that Parliament’s
                    objective in amending the law was specifically to provide a less harsh sentence
                    for drug couriers who are willing and able to assist the Central Narcotics
                    Bureau (“CNB”) in disrupting drug trafficking activities within or
                    outside Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       In the two criminal cases before the High Court,
                    the judge there (“the Judge”) was asked to determine if the
                    persons convicted in the two cases were couriers within the meaning of
                        s 33B(2)(<em>a</em>). Although the Judge held that
                    they were, he observed that there were certain difficulties with the application
                    of that provision. Those observations prompted the Public Prosecutor to seek
                    clarification from this court on three questions of law by way of the present
                    criminal references.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The two cases decided by the Judge are <em>Public Prosecutor v Chum Tat Suan</em> [2013] SGHC 221
                        (“<em>Chum Tat Suan</em>”) and <em>Public Prosecutor v Abdul Kahar bin Othman</em> [2013] SGHC
                    222 (“<em>Abdul Kahar</em>”). The issue
                    before the Judge in both cases was extremely narrow, namely, whether the person
                    convicted in each case (collectively, “the Respondents”) was a
                    courier within the meaning of s 33B(2)(<em>a</em>). It
                    is important to note that at this stage, the Respondents have already been
                    convicted by the Judge of their respective charges of importation and
                    trafficking in controlled drugs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Chum Tat Suan</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The parties in <em>Chum Tat
                        Suan</em> agreed that the only issue for the Judge to determine at
                    that stage was whether the person convicted (“Chum”) was a
                    courier.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       If the Judge found that Chum was <em>not</em> a courier, s 33B(1) read with
                        s 33B(2)(<em>a</em>) would not apply to exempt
                    Chum from the mandatory death penalty. If, however, the Judge found the converse
                        (<em>ie</em>, that Chum was a courier), then the
                    Prosecution would take a further statement from Chum for the purposes of
                    determining whether he meets the requirements of s 33B(2)(<em>b</em>), that is, whether Chum has substantively assisted the
                    CNB such that the s 33B certificate is deemed by the Public Prosecutor to
                    be justified.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Should the Public Prosecutor certify that Chum
                    has substantively assisted the CNB, the court may then exercise its discretion
                    to sentence Chum to life imprisonment and caning. However, the defence counsel
                    indicated that should the Public Prosecutor decline to issue a s 33B
                    certificate despite a finding that Chum was a courier, Chum’s defence
                    would be that he was suffering from an abnormality of mind, which is yet another
                    new exception to the mandatory death penalty pursuant to s 33B(1) read with
                    s 33B(3).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The Judge found the evidence-gathering
                    procedure for the purposes of applying s 33B to be fraught with difficulty.
                    On the one hand, if he allowed new evidence to be introduced, there was a
                    possibility of evidence emerging that might undermine the findings of fact that
                    he had made earlier in convicting Chum. On the other hand, if he did not allow
                    the introduction of new evidence, and premised his decision exclusively on his
                    findings of fact which had resulted in the conviction, Chum might be prejudiced
                    in that his earlier defence for the purposes of conviction might have been
                    conducted in a manner which furnished no occasion for evidence of his being no
                    more than a courier to emerge at trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     In the end, the Judge did not have to resolve
                    the dilemma that he presented as the parties proceeded on the basis that no new
                    evidence would be introduced on the question of whether Chum was no more than a
                    courier. The remaining course open to him, therefore, was to scrutinise the
                    evidence that was adduced at trial. He held (at [7] of <em>Chum
                        Tat Suan</em>) that the evidence adduced as to whether Chum was no
                    more than a courier was not unequivocal. Furthermore, there was the possibility
                    that Chum could have but did not give evidence which would have supported a
                    finding that he was no more than a courier. In the circumstances, it was unsafe
                    to rely on the available evidence to find that Chum was more than a courier, and
                    Chum should be given the benefit of the doubt.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Abdul Kahar</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The outcome in <em>Abdul
                        Kahar</em>, which was decided after <em>Chum Tat
                        Suan</em>, was the same, namely, that the person convicted
                    (“Abdul Kahar”) was found to be no more than a courier. The
                    Judge’s reasoning, however, was different. In fact, he found (at [3] of
                        <em>Abdul Kahar</em>) that the evidence showed that
                    Abdul Kahar was more than a courier in that his “involvement went beyond
                    transporting, sending or delivering [the drugs]”. However, the Judge held
                    (at [4] of <em>Abdul Kahar</em>) that Abdul Kahar was
                    effectively a “re-packer” – someone who re-packed drugs into
                    smaller packets – and it was unclear from the wording of s 33B
                    whether Parliament intended for such persons not to have the same benefit as
                    couriers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Nevertheless, the Judge thought it more likely
                    that Parliament had not intended to exclude ancillary acts such as re-packing
                    from the type of acts that define a courier. On that basis, the Judge thought
                    that Abdul Kahar should be given the benefit of the doubt at least until the law
                    on “transporting, delivering or sending”, which informs whether or
                    not an accused is a courier, is expressed more clearly.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Questions for this court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The questions raised by the Prosecution in
                    both criminal references are identical. They are:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_a"></a>(a)     Whether a person convicted of an
                        offence of drug trafficking or importation under ss 5(1) or 7 of the
                        MDA bears the burden of proving on a balance of probabilities that he
                        satisfies the requirements under ss 33B(2)(<em>a</em>) and 33B(3)(<em>a</em>) (see [2]
                        above). This shall be referred to as “Question
                    1”.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_b"></a>(b)     Whether
                        the court must take into account evidence that had been adduced at the trial
                        leading to a conviction under ss 5(1) or 7 of the MDA to determine
                        whether the person convicted satisfies the requirements under
                            ss 33B(2)(<em>a</em>) and 33B(3)(<em>a</em>). This shall be referred to as “Question
                        2”.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_c"></a>(c)     Whether an accused person, who had intended to sell the controlled drugs
                        which form the subject matter of a charge under ss 5(1) or 7 of the MDA
                        for which he had been convicted, satisfies the requirements under
                            ss 33B(2)(<em>a</em>) and 33B(3)(<em>a</em>). To paraphrase, the issue is whether an accused
                        person who intended to sell the controlled drugs and is convicted on that
                        basis can nevertheless be considered a courier (that is, his involvement in
                        the offence can be described as falling under one of the grounds in
                            ss 33B(2)(<em>a</em>) and 33B(3)(<em>a</em>)). This shall be referred to as “Question
                        3”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Although the questions refer to both
                        ss 33B(2)(<em>a</em>) and 33B(3)(<em>a</em>), the two subsections are identical.
                        Section 33B(3)(<em>a</em>) applies to persons
                    convicted who can show that they have such abnormality of mind that
                    substantially impaired their mental responsibility for the offending acts.
                    Hence, unless the context otherwise requires, the remainder of this judgment
                    will make reference to only s 33B(2)(<em>a</em>) even
                    though the same interpretation and consequences obviously apply equally to
                        s 33B(3)(<em>a</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">My decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Preliminary question of jurisdiction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     As the sentences for both cases have not yet
                    been pronounced, there is an issue of whether the criminal references are
                    prematurely brought. Mr Aedit Abdullah, SC
                    (“Mr Abdullah”), on behalf of the Prosecution, explained that
                    the criminal references were brought pursuant to s 59(4) of the Supreme
                    Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) (“2007 SCJA”) even
                    before sentence was meted out because the difficulties in the application of
                    s 33B mentioned by the Judge had a broad impact, particularly in relation
                    to other pending cases. A clarification from the apex court was therefore
                    desirable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     It is true that s 59(4) of the 2007 SCJA
                    does not mandate that a reference may only be brought after sentence has been
                    passed. There is nothing in the express words of the provision to that effect.
                    The provision simply provides that the Public Prosecutor may certify that any
                    points of law arising on a trial before the High Court acting in the exercise of
                    its original criminal jurisdiction in which an accused person has been convicted
                    of an offence ought to be further considered. This is the position in relation
                    to the two cases before us. In fact, the absence, or deliberate omission, of the
                    word “sentence” when contrasted against the use of
                    “conviction” as a marker suggests that the only precondition in
                    s 59(4) of the 2007 SCJA is that the accused person must have been
                    convicted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     However, the court obviously retains the
                    discretion to refuse to hear criminal references in appropriate circumstances.
                    An example of a case where a criminal reference may be inappropriately brought
                    and accordingly dismissed is <em>Mohammad Faizal bin Sabtu and
                        another v Public Prosecutor and another matter</em> [2013] 2 SLR 141,
                    where this court dismissed two criminal motions on two separate questions of law
                    because, amongst other reasons, the court below had not made a final ruling or
                    imposed a sentence and allowing the motions in those circumstances “would
                    lead to an unnecessary and unacceptable disruption to the final disposal of both
                    matters” (at [27]). Although I do have some reservations with the
                    necessity of the two references now before the court (see [69] below), they do
                    not cause unnecessary or unacceptable disruption to the final disposal of the
                    underlying matters. I will therefore proceed to answer the three
                    questions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Question 1: Whether the person convicted bears the burden of proving
                on a balance of probabilities that he was only a courier</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The answer to Question 1 is an obvious
                    “yes”. The Prosecution and Respondents are in agreement that the
                    person convicted bears the burden of proving on a balance of probabilities that
                    he was only a courier. Question 1 is therefore a non-starter and need not have
                    been raised. The language in s 33B(2) could not be any
                clearer.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Question 2: Whether the court in deciding whether a person convicted
                is a courier must take into account evidence at the trial leading to
                conviction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Question 2 is neither here nor there. The
                    dilemma faced by the Judge was not whether the evidence given at the trial
                    leading to the conviction <em>must</em> be taken into
                    account. If taking into account simply means having regard to, the answer to
                    Question 2 is an unequivocal “yes” – the court must take
                    into account all the evidence that has been adduced at the trial leading to the
                    conviction. I did not think that this was controversial by any measure. Indeed,
                    midway through his oral submissions, Mr Abdullah agreed that Question 2 could
                    have been better framed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Rather, the real concern or difficulty raised
                    by the Judge was whether the court is <em>limited</em> to
                    considering only the evidence presented at the trial leading to the conviction,
                    or whether the court is entitled to hear new evidence at the sentencing stage in
                    relation to the statutory relief of being a courier which was not raised at the
                    trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     There are three related parts to this
                    issue:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, is an accused person
                        permitted, at the sentencing stage, to raise this alternative statutory
                        relief of being a courier, which may be inconsistent with the original
                        defence at trial of having no knowledge of the existence of the controlled
                        drugs? This is an issue concerning the types of defences that can be
                        considered by the court for the purposes of sentencing. The question of
                        adduction of new evidence for the purpose of satisfying the statutory
                        definition of a courier does not arise here.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_b"></a>(b)     Secondly, if the accused person is so permitted
                        to raise the statutory relief of being a courier at the sentencing stage,
                        should the sentencing judge hear new evidence from the accused
                        person?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_c"></a>(c)     Third,
                        what is the proper treatment of inconsistent evidence on the record, if any,
                        as a result of the hearing of new evidence at the sentencing
                    stage?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Is an accused person permitted to raise the statutory relief of being
                a courier at the sentencing stage for the first time? </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Typically, a person accused of the offence of
                    drug trafficking or importation under ss 5(1) and 7 of the MDA respectively
                    will claim at trial that he had (a) no knowledge of the existence of the
                    controlled drugs or (b) no knowledge of the true nature of the contents of the
                    article that he was told to traffic (Chen Siyuan, “Singapore’s New
                    Discretionary Death Penalty for Drug Couriers (2014) 18(3) International Journal
                    of Evidence &amp; Proof 260 at p 264 (“<em>Chen</em>”)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Under the defence of no knowledge of the
                    existence of the controlled drugs, the accused person generally makes one of the
                    following two claims:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_a"></a>(a)     that he did not know of the
                        existence of the article containing the controlled drugs,
                    or</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_b"></a>(b)     that he knew of
                        the article but thought that the contents were something other than
                        drugs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Under the defence of no knowledge of the true
                    nature of the contents of the article, the accused person generally admits to
                    knowing that he was carrying drugs but claims that he was told that the drugs
                    were not controlled drugs. For clarity, I shall refer generally to these three
                    broad defences going towards conviction as the “primary
                    defence”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     As a general proposition, an accused person
                    should raise his full and complete defence, as well as adduce all the relevant
                    evidence, at trial. The issue here is whether, by virtue of s 33B, an
                    accused person has to admit <em>at trial</em> that he is a
                    courier in order to engage s 33B at the sentencing stage. On a plain
                    reading of s 33B, I do not think that the statutory scheme mandates such a
                    conclusion. In any case, it seems to me that, in relation to the two primary
                    defences mentioned in [24(b)] and [25] above, the fact of the accused person
                    possibly being a courier in the transaction would have been implicit and
                    obvious. The very basis of those two primary defences would be that the accused
                    person was carrying the article for others, that is, acting as a
                courier.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The real difficulty arises where the primary
                    defence is inherently inconsistent with the statutory relief of being a courier.
                    This occurs when the accused person’s primary defence is that he had no
                    knowledge as to the existence of the article containing the controlled drugs. In
                    a sense, and as a matter of logic, this primary defence is inconsistent with an
                    alternative averment of being a courier, because a person must at the very least
                    know of the existence of the article containing the controlled drugs in order to
                    make the claim that he was a courier. It would therefore be neither implicit nor
                    obvious in the pleading of such a primary defence that the accused person might,
                    in the alternative, be a courier.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In such exceptional circumstances where the
                    raising of the statutory relief of being a courier at trial would undermine his
                    primary defence, an accused person would be acting reasonably in <em>not</em> putting forth a submission that he was a courier. To
                    say that the accused person should raise this latter alternative albeit
                    inconsistent position at trial would place him in an invidious position as he
                    would be required to undermine his primary defence. This is exacerbated by the
                    fact that admitting to be a courier, even on an alternative basis, is not a
                    guarantee to the accused person that he will escape the death penalty. He would
                    still have to be given the s 33B certificate, a matter which is entirely at
                    the discretion of the Public Prosecutor (save where the determination by the
                    Public Prosecutor is done in bad faith or with malice) (see [2]
                above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     As the court cannot rule out the possibility
                    that an accused person may, in very special circumstances, genuinely not know
                    that he was carrying the article containing the controlled drugs, the accused
                    person should be given a fair opportunity to run the aforementioned primary
                    defence as his sole defence without being made to raise the statutory relief of
                    being a courier as an alternative position that is at odds with his primary
                    defence. This is so even if the court eventually rejects the primary defence as
                    spurious. I do not read the legislation as mandating otherwise, although the
                    accused person’s liberty to reserve, as it were, the option of running the
                    statutory relief of being a courier, is subject to a myriad of limitations that
                    will invariably affect the proving of the statutory relief subsequently (see
                    [40], [42] and [50]–[56] below). An accused person would therefore not
                    necessarily be better off under this approach.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Ultimately, it is a question of justice. The
                    accused person claiming to have no knowledge of the article containing the
                    controlled drugs is mounting a factual defence – he is putting forward a
                    particular state of affairs. If the court disbelieves his version of events and
                    convicts him as a result, this simply means that the court rejects the factual
                    state of affairs claimed by the accused person in favour of another state of
                    affairs. The statutory relief of being a courier then becomes relevant at this
                    point because the court has to decide what the appropriate sentence ought to be
                    in the context of what it has found to be the true state of
                affairs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     I should add that even though an accused
                    person may have claimed that he had no knowledge as to the existence of the
                    article that was eventually found to have contained the controlled drugs, it is
                    not impossible that an accused person could, on the basis of the factual state
                    of affairs which the court finds to be true, meet the requirements set out in
                    s 33B(2) and hence qualify to be a courier. This is the critical
                    distinction between an accused person’s factual defence at trial and the
                    positions in law that are still available to the accused person during
                    sentencing, whether on the facts claimed by the accused or the contrary facts
                    found by the court. The accused person should therefore be permitted to raise
                    the statutory relief of being a courier for the purposes of sentencing in this
                    circumstance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Whether the accused person is able to show or
                    prove that he meets the definition of a courier on the facts as found by the
                    court is, I stress, a separate question altogether. Likewise, whether the
                    accused person is permitted during sentencing to adduce new evidence to support
                    the statutory relief of being a courier is also a separate question altogether
                    (see [49]–[56] below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     As far as this first part of Question 2 posed
                    at [22(a)] above is concerned, the sole issue is whether the accused person
                    ought to be able to raise the statutory relief of being a courier at the
                    sentencing stage for the first time. For the above reasons, the answer to this
                    part of Question 2, in my view, is a “yes”, whichever is the
                    primary defence run by the accused person.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     I am cognisant that there is a view that an
                    accused person has a choice between coming clean and stating from the beginning
                    that he was a courier (not just in the sense that he was a courier of a generic
                    parcel but that he was a courier of the controlled drugs), and “playing
                    games” with the Prosecution by sticking to one of the three primary
                    defences without admitting that he was a courier. Under this view, if the court
                    disbelieves his primary defence, he should not be allowed to invoke the
                    statutory relief of being a courier. The accused person has to live or die,
                    literally, by his or her decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     This view is not devoid of support. As was
                    pointed out in <em>Chen</em> (at p 265), the Minister of
                    Law stated during the Second Reading of the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Bill
                        (<em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official
                        Report</em> (14 November 2012) vol 89 (K Shanmugam, Minister
                    for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Law) (“<em>Official
                        Report (14 Nov)</em>”) at p 36) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[I]f the accused knows something, and has to decide between trying to run
                        a false defence that he knows nothing, and telling the truth and assisting
                        the CNB – I do not think Members will argue against giving him an
                        incentive to tell the truth, to help us, and to help himself.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     However, the context in which the Minister
                    made the above statement is important. The Minister was <em>not</em> proposing that accused persons had to make their own bed
                        <em>at trial</em> and lie in it throughout. He was
                    responding to a concern raised by a Nominated Member of Parliament, Assistant
                    Prof Eugene Tan (“Asst Prof Tan”), that the difficulty with
                    providing substantial assistance as well as the potential for abuse by CNB
                    officers may result in an accused person incriminating himself of a capital
                    charge in the hope that he would be spared the ultimate sanction (see <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</em>
                    (12 November 2012) vol 89 (“<em>Official Report (12
                        Nov)</em>”) at p 48). The above excerpt was a development of
                    the Minister’s initial response which was (<em>Official
                        Report (14 Nov)</em> at p 35):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Asst Prof Eugene Tan asked whether the mechanism <em>creates a risk of self-incrimination? There is that risk</em>.
                        But let me throw back the question: what does that mean? Should we therefore
                        not have this exception? [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The Minister’s riposte must therefore be
                    viewed in context. He agreed with Asst Prof Tan that the way s 33B was
                    structured carried some risk that an accused person may cave in and simply admit
                    to being a courier. What is of significance is that the Minister could have
                    stated, but did not, that the whole point of this new regime was to make it
                    mandatory for accused persons who were <em>in truth</em>
                    couriers to incriminate themselves, and that if they chose to run a defence at
                    trial that was inconsistent with being a courier, they would not, under any
                    circumstances, be permitted later during sentencing to raise the point that they
                    were only couriers. If that were the objective, the Minister would have
                    clarified the concern raised by Asst Prof Tan in that way. But he did
                    not.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     I would hasten to add that in adopting the
                    aforesaid approach of permitting the accused person to raise the statutory
                    relief of being a courier for the first time during sentencing, I am mindful
                    that Parliament has reaffirmed its tough stance against drugs. That said, the
                    court should still apply the new avenue available to a person convicted of drug
                    trafficking (to avoid the death penalty) in a fair and sensible way. In these
                    cases involving specified drugs under the sixth column of the Second Schedule to
                    the MDA, the issue is not so much whether a lenient or strict reading of
                    s 33B should be preferred but rather what is just, having regard to what is
                    expressly stated in the legislation and Parliament’s intention in so far
                    as it can be discerned from the relevant parliamentary materials.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether new evidence can be heard by the sentencing judge</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     This leads me to the main controversy in these
                    criminal references: in addition to canvassing the statutory relief of being a
                    courier at the sentencing stage, can an accused person introduce new evidence to
                    bolster his claim to being a courier?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     As stated in [26] above, the general
                    proposition is that, an accused person should raise his entire defence <em>and</em> adduce all his evidence at trial. I do not think
                    that Parliament, in enacting s 33B, contemplated that there should be two
                    separate trials, one for the purpose of establishing the charge and the other
                    for the purpose of determining sentence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Notwithstanding that, there is no rule which
                    absolutely precludes the adduction of new evidence at the sentencing stage.
                    Although Mr Abdullah’s submissions seem to concede that the
                    legislation is silent as to the “correct procedure” in relation to
                    s 33B, all the parties are in agreement on this crucial point that further
                    evidence <em>can</em> be taken during
                sentencing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     In my view, that must be correct even if it is
                    equally right that there must be limits to the ability of parties to adduce
                    further evidence at the sentencing stage. The fundamental principle of justice
                    requires that every offender be, as far as possible, sentenced on the basis of
                    accurate facts (see <em>Ng Chun Hian v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [2014] 2 SLR 783 (“<em>Ng Chun
                        Hian</em>”) at [24]; and <em>Public Prosecutor v
                        Aniza bte Essa</em> [2009] 3 SLR(R) 327). In the present context, if
                    the accused person upon conviction but before sentence wishes to adduce further
                    evidence to show that he was only a courier, he must satisfy the trial judge why
                    the further evidence was not and could not be adduced earlier at the trial
                    leading to the conviction. Furthermore, whatever new evidence that is sought to
                    be adduced must not contradict the finding of the court that the accused person
                    is guilty of the charge and must only relate to the sentence to be imposed, that
                    is, to show that he was just a courier in the transaction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Indeed, it is an established practice in
                    criminal process that new evidence is sometimes introduced at the sentencing
                    stage through a Newton hearing, a procedure that is entirely at the discretion
                    of the court. The paradigm situation that calls for a Newton hearing is when the
                    accused person makes a claim or assertion relevant to the sentence to be imposed
                    which is disputed by the Prosecution. A recent example of a Newton hearing is
                    the case of <em>Public Prosecutor v Azuar Bin Ahamad</em>
                    [2014] SGHC 149 (“<em>Azuar</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The accused in <em>Azuar</em> pleaded guilty to charges pertaining to, amongst other
                    things, rape and outrage of modesty and was convicted accordingly. However, for
                    the purposes of sentencing, he contested the Prosecution’s position that
                    he had surreptitiously administered stupefying drugs to the victims by spiking
                    their alcoholic beverages in order to render them unconscious (or incognisant)
                    before sexually violating them. The trial judge therefore conducted a Newton
                    hearing to determine this factual issue of whether the accused had spiked his
                    victims’ drinks.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Although Newton hearings are generally
                    conducted in cases where the accused person had pleaded guilty and was convicted
                    on that basis, they are not restricted to such cases. Locally, a Newton hearing
                    was sought by the Prosecution at the sentencing stage in at least one case where
                    the accused person had claimed trial, although the district judge there decided
                    that the hearing was inappropriate on the facts: see <em>Public
                        Prosecutor v Andrew Sivanesan s/o Balakrishnan</em> [2011] SGDC 66 at
                    [141]. Reference may also be had to Leveson LJ’s judgment in
                        <em>R v Cairns</em> [2013] 2 Cr App R (S) 73 at [9]
                    where he stated that a Newton hearing after a trial might be necessary in
                    circumstances where the disputed fact which was not canvassed at trial is not
                    relevant to guilt but relevant to sentence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Counsel for Chum, Mr Manoj Nandwani
                    Prakash (“Mr Nandwani”), helpfully pointed out that a Newton
                    hearing is not anomalous under the current rules governing criminal procedure in
                    Singapore. Indeed, ss 228(5)(<em>a</em>) and
                        (<em>b</em>) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68,
                    2012 Rev Ed) (“the CPC”) very clearly contemplate that new
                    evidence may be heard and weighed by the court for the purposes of
                    sentencing:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(5) After the court has heard the plea in mitigation, it
                        may —</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>a</em>)    at its
                                discretion or on the application of the prosecution or the accused
                                    <em>hear any evidence to determine the truth or
                                    otherwise of the matters raised before the court which may
                                    materially affect the sentence;</em><em>and</em></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>b</em>)    
                <em>attach such weight to the matter raised as it considers
                                    appropriate after hearing the evidence.</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     I pause here to mention that I agree with See
                    Kee Oon SDJ’s (as he then was) description in <em>Public Prosecutor v Shaw Chai Li Howard</em> [2012] SGDC 319 at [39]
                    of s 228(5)(<em>a</em>) of the CPC as encapsulating
                    the concept of a Newton hearing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Mr Abdullah highlighted that although the
                    CPC now has s 228(5), there was no such equivalent provision in the old
                    Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) (“the old CPC”),
                    which is the regime governing these proceedings. If by this it was suggested
                    that Parliament had intended to preclude the taking of further evidence
                    post-conviction under the old CPC, I disagree. Although there is no statutory
                    mechanism under the old CPC for taking evidence post-conviction, the Newton
                    hearing is an established procedure and has been applied by countless courts
                    determining cases governed by the old CPC regime: see <em>eg</em>, <em>Biplob Hossain Younus Akan and others v
                        Public Prosecutor and another matter</em>
                    [2011] 3 SLR 217; <em>Public Prosecutor v Soh Song
                        Soon</em> [2010] 1 SLR 857 and <em>Public
                        Prosecutor v McCrea Michael</em> [2006] 3 SLR(R) 677.
                    Further, Mr Abdullah at another part of his submissions agreed that
                    “the judicial practice of receiving evidence during sentencing had
                    developed even prior to the introduction of [the CPC].”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Thus, broadly speaking, it is proper in my
                    view that new evidence <em>may</em>, under the right
                    conditions, be adduced and heard at any stage of proceedings, including at the
                    sentencing stage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The key question is what conditions warrant
                    the adduction of new evidence at the sentencing stage. A Newton hearing is,
                    after all, an exception rather than the norm even for cases where the accused
                    person had pleaded guilty, much less cases where the accused person has claimed
                    trial and has given his evidence during the trial. It is not a further
                    opportunity for the accused person (or more accurately, the person convicted) to
                    adduce evidence to contradict or cast doubts on the conviction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     In this regard, I agree with the principle
                    articulated by Sundaresh Menon CJ in <em>Ng Chun
                        Hian</em> (at [24]) that a Newton hearing is called for only if the
                    court is satisfied that “it is <em>necessary</em> to
                    do so in order to resolve a <em>difficult question of
                        fact</em> that is <em>material</em> to the
                    court’s determination of the appropriate sentence [emphasis
                    added]”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Whether a question of fact is material to the
                    court’s determination of the statutory relief of being a courier, and if
                    so, whether hearing new evidence is necessary and ought to be allowed, are all
                    matters for the sentencing judge exercising his discretion to decide, having
                    regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the considerations
                    mentioned in [42] above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     In the context of s 33B(2)(<em>a</em>) (as well as s 33B(3)(<em>a</em>)), clear examples where a Newton hearing would be <em>unnecessary</em> and should not be called include:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_53-p2_a"></a>(a)     where the accused person’s
                        case in relation to the statutory relief of being a courier is
                        “absurd or obviously untenable” (see <em>Ng
                            Chun Hian</em> at [24]);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_53-p2_b"></a>(b)     where the question of fact in dispute bears <em>no relation</em> to sentencing, that is, the evidence
                        sought to be adduced is irrelevant to establishing the accused
                        person’s role as a courier;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_53-p2_c"></a>(c)     where the new evidence sought to be adduced relates
                        directly to conviction, for instance, if it pertains to whether the accused
                        person is guilty of drug trafficking or importation under ss 5(1) and
                        (7) of the MDA respectively); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_53-p2_d"></a>(d)     where the specific issue of the accused person’s
                        role in transporting, delivering or otherwise moving the drugs was in issue
                        at trial (irrespective of whether the statutory relief of being a courier
                        was formally canvassed), and consequently, evidence was already adduced on
                        the issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     To elaborate on the last example, where the
                    statutory relief of being a courier was already implicit or evident in relation
                    to a primary defence, no further evidence ought to be adduced for the purposes
                    of sentencing because all the relevant evidence ought to have been produced at
                    trial and the accused person should be sentenced on that basis. Where the
                    accused person ought to have adduced all relevant evidence of being a courier at
                    trial (because it was not inconsistent with his primary defence) but did not,
                    the accused person, if convicted, should not be permitted to adduce further
                    evidence and if at sentencing he should claim to be only a courier in the
                    transaction, the trial judge would, subject to the most exceptional
                    circumstances, have to decide the question based on the evidence already
                    adduced.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     I should add that in most, if not all, cases,
                    including cases where the accused person claims not to have knowledge of the
                    existence of the article containing the controlled drugs, the court would in the
                    course of trial have heard evidence relating to the transportation, delivery or
                    movement of the controlled drugs, and made findings in relation to the same,
                    which findings would ordinarily be sufficient for the court to decide whether
                    the accused person’s involvement was limited to that of being a courier.
                    Thus, the accused person would, in practical terms, have to demonstrate how the
                    new evidence, if any, would be germane to the question of his involvement as a
                    courier and give good reasons why the new evidence should be adduced now even
                    though it was not adduced earlier at the trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Accordingly, the likelihood of the accused
                    person being able to meet the test of necessity that additional evidence not
                    already before the court should be allowed to be adduced, would be remote. The
                    range of possibilities where further evidence should be permitted to be adduced
                    during sentencing is thus extremely narrow. However, even though I am skeptical
                    that there will even be cases which would meet these stringent conditions for
                    the adduction of new evidence, I simply do not think it can or should be ruled
                    out completely. I am, therefore, unwilling to shut the door fully. To disallow
                    absolutely the adduction of new evidence could, in particular situation, give
                    rise to injustice. Subject to the perimeters which I have sought to delineate
                    above, the trial judge would be in the best position to assess whether the
                    adduction of new evidence should be allowed. While I recognise that this could
                    be seen to introduce some uncertainty, such discretion is nothing new in the
                    trial process where the trial judge has to make judgment calls all the time on a
                    variety of circumstances and issues.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     In passing, and for completeness, I should add
                    that s 27(2) of the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Act 2012 (No 30 of
                    2012) (“Amendment Act”), which introduced the new s 33B, does
                    not advance the Respondents’ argument that the court is permitted to take
                    further evidence. While the wording of s 27 of the Amendment Act expressly
                    permits the hearing of further arguments or admission of further evidence, that
                    section only applies to persons convicted before the day that the amendments
                    came into force, that is, 1 January 2013. In the two cases before us, Chum
                    and Abdul Kahar were convicted on 5 August 2013 and 27 August 2013
                    respectively. Section 27 of the Amendment Act is accordingly
                    inapplicable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     In summary, if a person convicted fails to
                    show that permission should be granted to him to adduce new evidence, the court
                    will assess the merits of his submission in relation to the statutory relief of
                    being a courier against the factual state of affairs that has been found to be
                    true by the court at trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Treatment of potentially inconsistent evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     I note the Judge’s concern that if an
                    accused person is permitted to give new evidence at the sentencing stage, there
                    is a possibility that the new evidence may cast doubt on the safeness of the
                    conviction of the accused (see <em>Chum Tat Suan</em> at
                    [5]).As I have stated at [54]–[55] above, since the new evidence should
                    not be inconsistent with the conviction recorded against the accused person and
                    should only be germane to establishing that the accused person was a courier, I
                    think that the concern expressed by the Judge is most unlikely to
                arise.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     In my view, whatever new evidence to be
                    adduced is most unlikely to cast doubt on the conviction. Even in cases where
                    the accused person’s primary defence at trial was that he had no knowledge
                    of the existence of the article containing the controlled drugs – which as
                    I have explained is the only situation where the courier relief may be raised
                    for the first time at sentencing (see [27]–[32] above) – any new
                    evidence that goes towards demonstrating the accused person’s limited
                    involvement as a courier would not conflict with or undermine the court’s
                    conclusion that he knew of the existence of the article containing the
                    controlled drugs. If anything, any new evidence that the accused person might
                    give to obtain the courier relief is instead likely to corroborate the earlier
                    findings upon which the conviction was based, because evidence that the accused
                    person was a courier would necessarily buttress the factual finding that he knew
                    of the existence of the article.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     Incidentally, the Prosecution, who should be
                    concerned with any re-opening of findings of fact leading to the conviction or
                    the casting of any doubts on such findings, does not share the Judge’s
                    concerns. Referring to Chum’s case, Mr Abdullah argued that it was
                    “unclear why the Judge apprehended that calling new evidence may
                    undermine the facts already found at the trial”. This reinforces my view
                    above that the Prosecution countenances the possibility and arguably
                    desirability in some exceptional situations of the calling of new evidence at
                    the sentencing stage. Mr Abdullah further observed that as the precise role
                    of Chum was not in issue at the trial, any evidence which Chum might seek to
                    introduce at the sentencing hearing would be limited to his role, and as such,
                    would not have any impact on the court’s finding in relation to
                    Chum’s knowledge of the drugs that eventually supported the
                    conviction.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Question 3: Whether a person who had intended to sell the controlled
                drugs can be considered a courier</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     The answer to Question 3 is a clear
                    “no”. If the person convicted has been found to have the intent to
                    sell the controlled drugs, then he is evidently not merely a
                courier.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     Sections 33B(2) and (3) of the MDA were
                    intended to be “tightly-defined” conditions (see <em>Official Report (12 Nov)</em> at p 37). The narrowness of the
                    definition of a courier in s 33B(2)(<em>a</em>) was
                    recognised by the High Court in <em>Public Prosecutor v Abdul
                        Haleem bin Abdul Karim and another</em> [2013] 3 SLR 734
                        (“<em>Abdul Haleem</em>”) at [51]. In
                    that case, the court, in concluding that a courier is one whose involvement is
                    limited to delivering or conveying drugs from point A to point B, referred to an
                    exchange in Parliament which deserves replication here (see <em>Official Report (14 Nov)</em> at pp 45–46):</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     In addition to the above clarification,
                    Mr Teo Chee Hean, Deputy Prime Minister and Coordinating Minister for
                    National Security and Minister for Home Affairs (“DPM Teo”), had
                    also previously explained that to bring themselves within the statutory relief
                    of being a courier, accused persons must “only have been involved as a
                    courier and not in any other type of activity associated with drug supply and
                    distribution” (see <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates,
                        Official Report</em> (9 July 2012) vol 89 at
                p 21).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     It is also pertinent to note the language used
                    by the Minister of Law during the Second Reading of the Misuse of Drugs
                    (Amendment) Bill to describe the transportational function of couriers –
                    “[t]hey hide the drugs in secret compartments, all sorts of places, and
                    try and traffic through our check points” (see <em>Official Report (14 Nov)</em> at p 33).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     It is therefore abundantly clear that the
                    statutory relief afforded under s 33B does not apply to those whose
                    involvement with drugs extends beyond that of transporting, sending or
                    delivering the drugs. As the exchanges in Parliament above show, it does not
                    matter that the accused person’s involvement is of an ancillary nature. In
                    Parliament’s view, an accused person is either involved <em>only</em> in the transporting, sending or delivering of the drugs and
                    can therefore avail himself of the statutory relief of being a courier, or he is
                    involved in more than those activities, in which case he cannot avail himself of
                    the statutory relief of being a courier.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     There is, however, one clarification which
                    ought to be added. As was noted in <em>Abdul Haleem</em> at
                    [55], if it is clear that the accused person’s involvement was truly that
                    of a courier, the mere incidental act of storage or safe-keeping by the accused
                    person in the course of transporting, sending or delivering the drugs, should
                    not take him outside of the definition of a courier. This is so notwithstanding
                    the clarification from DPM Teo in the excerpt cited above at [63], which
                    should be read as directed at persons whose role is not – or at least not
                        <em>only</em> – restricted to transporting,
                    sending or delivering the drugs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     While the question of whether a particular act
                    is necessary for couriering, so to speak, is fact-specific, in keeping with
                    legislative intention, this caveat has to be construed strictly. Acts necessary
                    for transporting, sending or delivering the drugs cannot include packing, for
                    instance, as packing is not a necessary element of moving an object from one
                    point to another. Simply put, a courier is someone who receives the drugs and
                    transmits them in exactly the same form in which they were received without any
                    alteration or adulteration.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Criminal references should concern genuine
                    questions of law that are of public interest and upon which guidance from the
                    apex court is necessary. While the law gives the Public Prosecutor a wide
                    latitude to bring questions of law to this court’s attention, that right
                    should be exercised judiciously. Factors that ought to be considered include
                    whether there is a genuine controversy, and if so, whether it is imperative for
                    that controversy to be resolved at that stage of the proceedings. Suffice it to
                    say that it seems to me there are questions in this reference which are not
                    altogether necessary. Furthermore, the questions could have been better framed
                    to flesh out the real issues for which clarifications were sought.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     In the light of my answer to Question 3,
                    it follows that the Judge’s decision in relation to Abdul Kahar was
                    incorrect. The Judge was wrong to have held that Abdul Kahar was a courier when
                    the Judge was “satisfied that [Abdul Kahar’s] involvement in
                    trafficking <em>went beyond transporting, sending or
                        delivering</em> [the drugs]” (see <em>Abdul
                        Kahar</em> at [3]). His justification, that “re-packing and
                    collecting payment” are ancillary acts which are not excluded from the
                    definition of courier, is inconsistent with the extracts of the parliamentary
                    debates excerpted at [63] to [65] above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     As for Chum’s case, the Judge was also
                    incorrect in holding that it was “an unsafe course” to scrutinise
                    the evidence adduced at trial in determining whether Chum was a courier (see
                        <em>Chum</em> at [7]). As stated at the outset in
                    relation to Question 2, the court must take into account all evidence that
                    has been adduced at the trial leading to the conviction in considering whether a
                    person convicted is a courier for the purposes of s 33B.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     In the circumstances, pursuant to the
                    court’s power under s 59(5) of the 2007 SCJA, the Judge’s
                    findings that Abdul Kahar’s and Chum’s involvement in committing the
                    offences under ss 5(1) and 7 of the MDA respectively fell within the ambit
                    of ss 33B(2)(<em>a</em>) and 33B(3)(<em>a</em>) ought to be quashed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     Consequently, the Prosecution’s prayer,
                    for an order that the cases concerning Abdul Kahar and Chum be remitted to the
                    Judge, who shall determine whether Abdul Kahar’s and Chum’s
                    involvement in the offences under ss 5(1) and 7 of the MDA respectively was
                    restricted to the activities under ss 33B(2)(<em>a</em>) and 33B(3)(<em>a</em>), is granted. The
                    Judge shall make that determination based on the evidence adduced at the trial
                    and having regard to the determination of this court on Question 1 and
                    Question 3 as well as the majority’s determination on Question 2 (see
                    [77]–[83] below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     Lastly, Mr Nandwani has indicated that
                    Chum may wish to rely on s 33B(3)(<em>b</em>) of the
                    MDA (relating to abnormality of mind), and may, for that reason, wish to adduce
                    further evidence. Under the approach adopted by the majority, that would be
                    impermissible as all evidence relating to an accused’s mental state ought
                    to have been adduced during the trial. Under the approach that I have adopted,
                    it would also be impermissible for Chum to adduce further evidence. As I have
                    stated at [26] above, the general rule is that all defences and evidence should
                    be raised and adduced by the accused person at trial, save where there are
                    special reasons not to do so. There are no special reasons (such as those
                    described at [27]–[28] above) for Chum not to have adduced evidence in
                    relation to his mental state at trial. Nevertheless, as this is the first time
                    that s 33B has been interpreted and clarified in this manner, we are all of
                    the view that,  as an exceptional measure, the Judge should permit Chum to
                    adduce evidence relating to his mental state.</p>
<p class="Judg-Author">
        Woo Bih Li J and Tay Yong Kwang J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     We have read the judgment of Chao Hick
                    Tin JA and use the same nomenclature as in his judgment. We share his
                    reservations about the necessity of the references before the court. However, as
                    he proceeded to answer the three questions pursuant to the references, we will
                    state our answers too.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     We agree with the answers of Chao JA to
                    Questions 1 and 3. As regards Question 2, we agree that a court must
                    take into account all evidence adduced at the trial in deciding whether a
                    convicted accused person is a courier.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     However, we express reservation on his view
                    that, subject to some conditions, an accused person may give evidence about his
                    being a courier at the sentencing stage even though he deliberately withheld
                    such evidence at trial on the ground that such evidence would be inconsistent
                    with his primary defence. As this issue was not, strictly speaking, part of the
                    three questions, we state our brief reasons below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     Even as regards a situation where an accused
                    person’s primary defence is that he has no knowledge of the existence of
                    the article containing the controlled drugs, it is possible for him to give
                    evidence showing that he was in any event an unknowing courier.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     However, in the event that there is evidence
                    that he is a courier which will indeed be inconsistent with his primary defence,
                    he is to elect what his evidence will be, as all the evidence should be given at
                    the same trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     This is not putting him in an invidious
                    position. Before the recent amendments to the MDA, an accused person already had
                    to elect whether or not to give evidence and, if so, what evidence to give. He
                    also had to elect whether or not to cooperate and come clean with the
                    authorities by providing information. If he did, he might persuade the
                    Prosecution not to press a capital charge against him. There was no suggestion
                    then that he was being put in an invidious position.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     The purpose of the recent amendments to the
                    MDA is to state formally that if he provides substantive assistance to the
                    authorities (if he is a courier) and if he obtains the relevant certificate
                    stating the fact of such assistance, the court may decide not to impose capital
                    punishment. The accused person does not have to avail himself of this
                    opportunity. The purpose of the amendments is therefore to give him an incentive
                    to come clean. There is no suggestion in the parliamentary debates that the
                    amendments will result in changing the trial process and give the accused person
                    a chance to deliberately stifle evidence to gain an advantage and then to speak
                    the truth when that strategy fails. If he were allowed to do so, it may even be
                    said that the court is condoning such a strategy which it should be discouraging
                    instead. Furthermore, if the trial process is changed for capital offences under
                    the MDA, then one may argue that it should also be changed for the offence of
                    murder for the same reason, <em>ie</em>, not to put the
                    accused person in an invidious position where the evidence withheld would be
                    inconsistent with his primary defence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     A Newton hearing is for a different purpose.
                    It gives an accused person a chance to adduce evidence on a material fact for
                    the purposes of sentencing which he had no or insufficient opportunity to
                    address earlier. It arises from a bona fide omission and not a deliberate one to
                    stifle evidence to gain an advantage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     Furthermore, it is at the discretion of the
                    trial judge whether or not to have a Newton hearing. Any suggestion that an
                    accused person will be allowed to adduce new evidence at the sentencing stage,
                    because he believed he had a valid reason to deliberately withhold such evidence
                    and even though this is subject to conditions, should be avoided.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     Likewise, any evidence about an accused
                    person’s mental disability for the purpose of s 33B(3)(<em>b</em>) of the MDA should be given at the same
                trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     We agree with the consequential orders of Chao
                    JA for Abdul Kahar and Chum.</p>
