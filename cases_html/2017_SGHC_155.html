After hearing the parties’ arguments, I dismissed the plaintiff’s claim and found in favour of the defendants. The plaintiff being dissatisfied has filed an appeal. These are the grounds of my decision.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The plaintiff is Ling Diung Kwong (“the Plaintiff”).

Save as otherwise herein provided, trustees shall be appointed at a [G]eneral [M]eeting of the Temple and they shall hold office for as long as required subject to the right of any trustee to resign his office by giving at least 14 days (<span class="font-italic">sic</span>) notice to the Management Committee.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">19f.

As early as 2006, the Plaintiff had clashed publicly with the 4th and 6th defendants at the Bo Tien Temple’s 36th Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) over the Plaintiff’s allegations that the 4th defendant had manipulated certain AGM minutes.

It suffices to say that they were generally critical of several members of Bo Tien Temple, including the 2nd, 4th and 6th defendants, and that they cast these members in an unfavourable light. The excerpts also raised factual allegations against various individuals, including an assertion that the 4th defendant had committed an act “criminal in nature”.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> Given the close links between OS 998/2014 and the present proceedings, it is worth setting out Chong J’s findings in considerable detail. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 Chong J held that the 2012 membership termination decision was invalid for the following reasons:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the decision was <span class="font-italic">ultra vires </span>the BTT Constitution. The MC had failed to comply with Article 8(a) of the BTT Constitution which requires the MC to give a member “such particulars as may be necessary to disclose the basic reason” for his proposed expulsion” (see [5] above). Prior to the meeting on 22 March 2012, Tay had only written the Plaintiff a letter stating that the MC was considering terminating his membership, and which alluded to “the incidents and correspondences [the Plaintiff had] raised between both [the Plaintiff and Tay] and the organisation”.
                   <sup><button class="btn btn-link superscript-btn" data-target="#fn-be774990-b678-4370-a5e6-8ac37de5a99f" data-toggle="modal" type="button">18</button></sup>

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> However, the letter did not contain sufficient particulars to comply with Article 8(a). Chong J further rejected the defendants’ argument that the Plaintiff was already fully aware of the reasons for the proposed termination of his membership. He noted that there were eight incidents which formed the basis of the Plaintiff’s proposed expulsion, including “the so-called ‘Ngor Ya’ incident of 2004” and the Plaintiff’s intended publication of the Draft Book (see [9] above). Since these incidents spanned a long period of nearly 8 years, the Plaintiff could not have known which of the events in the intervening period were being considered as a basis for his expulsion. Further, many of these incidents had taken place a long time ago, with no action being taken against the Plaintiff. Given the lapse of time, the Plaintiff could not be expected to know that those incidents would form the subject matter of disciplinary action against him.

</div>
</div> In any event, the MC could not dispense with its duty of particularisation under Article 8(a) just because it believed the member concerned knew of the reasons for his proposed expulsion.

</div></div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Secondly, there had been a breach of the Plaintiff’s right to a fair hearing. Natural justice demanded that the Plaintiff had to be given (a) adequate notice of the allegations made against him; and (b) a fair opportunity to be heard. For the reasons summarised in [12(a)] above, Chong J was of the view that the Plaintiff did not have adequate notice of the allegations against him and did not know the case he had to meet.

</div>
</div> He also rejected the defendants’ arguments that the Plaintiff could not complain of being denied a fair hearing because he had chosen not to attend the MC meeting on 22 March 2012. Crucially, the Plaintiff would not have been adequately equipped to defend himself even if he had elected to attend.

Of the five members who sat on the MC, three (the 2nd and 4th defendants herein and Tay) were interested parties. These individuals had been personally involved in the matters which formed the basis of the membership termination decision, including the “Ngor Ya” issue and the intended publication of the draft book. Given the acrimony between the Plaintiff and these three members of the MC, a reasonable and fair-minded person would have had a reasonable suspicion that a fair trial was not possible for the Plaintiff if these three members were to sit on the MC that decided on his proposed expulsion.

Article 19(i) of the BTT Constitution provides that notice of any proposal to remove a trustee had to be given to the Honorary Secretary at least two weeks before the meeting at which the proposal was to be discussed (see [5] above).

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> Chong J was also unpersuaded by the defendants’ argument that even though the decision at the 42nd AGM in 2012 was “irregular”, the Plaintiff’s removal as trustee was validly passed by way of a resolution at the 43rd AGM a year later in March 2013. The BTT Constitution did not allow for defective resolutions at previous AGMs to be cured by future resolutions at later AGMs.

The matters he had asked to include had been left out of the agenda. Item 7 of the agenda was in the following terms:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">To consider the removal of Mr Ling Diung Kwong as a Trustee of the Board of Trustees of Bo Tien Temple under Article 19f of the Constitution which provides that: If a trustee is believed to be guilty of conduct rendering it undesirable that he continues as a trustee, a General Meeting may in its absolute discretion to (<span class="font-italic">sic</span>) remove him from his trusteeship.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 On 29 April 2015, the Plaintiff received another letter from the 2nd defendant which stated that the management of Bo Tien Temple was reinstating the Plaintiff’s position as member and trustee with immediate effect. Subsequently, however, the Plaintiff received another letter dated 5 May 2015 (“the 5 May Letter”) informing him that the members of Bo Tien Temple had “expressed their intention to exercise their absolute discretion under Article 19(f) of the Bo Tien Temple Constitution to remove [the Plaintiff] as a trustee on the grounds that they believe[d] [he was] guilty of conduct which renders [him] undesirable to continue as a trustee”.

</div> The 5 May Letter went on to state that the members would be voting on the matter at the upcoming 45th AGM. The letter also set out “the specific particulars disclosing the conduct which [had] rendered [the Plaintiff] undesirable to continue as a trustee”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17  Broadly speaking, the 5 May Letter raised three issues. The first of these issues was the Plaintiff’s Draft Book, which the letter described as including “many factual inaccuracies regarding many parties who are members of Bo Tien Temple”, “misleading” and “hurting to some members who are totally in dismay of what [the Plaintiff had] penned”. The 5 May Letter went on to set out several excerpts of the Draft Book. The second issue raised in the 5 May Letter was the Plaintiff’s removal of the “Ngor Ya” flag despite repeated warnings from the management of Bo Tien Temple. The third issue was the Name-calling Incident.

</div> For present purposes, it is unnecessary for me to go into the details of what was said. Broadly speaking, the discussions centred on the purported falsity of the excerpts from the Draft Book which had been mentioned in the 5 May Letter, the “Ngor Ya” flag incident and the Name-calling incident. These issues were set out on PowerPoint slides in terms identical to those used in the 5 May Letter. The discussions continued for slightly over an hour before the 5th defendant tabled a motion to remove the Plaintiff from the Board of Trustees at about 9.29 pm. The motion was seconded by a Ms Karen Wong.

In the Plaintiff’s written submissions this argument was based on the fact that the decision to terminate the Plaintiff’s trusteeship was largely premised on the contents of the Draft Book, which the Plaintiff emphasised was only a draft which had not been published. The Plaintiff argued that the decision to “base the inquiry at the 45th AGM on facts pertaining to the draft book” was indicative of their apparent bias.

</div> The Plaintiff knew that the discussions pertaining to the termination of his trusteeship would cover factual, and not legal, issues. Thus, there was no basis for the Plaintiff’s argument that he needed to consult his lawyer in order to prepare for the 45th AGM. In summary, the Plaintiff had decided to relinquish his opportunity to be heard at the 45th AGM and could not now raise the argument that he had refused to participate because of his own “subjective position” that he needed to consult his solicitor.

In this regard the Defendants emphasised that Article 17(j) of the BTT Constitution required that a decision of the general meeting be made by “simple majority of the members present <span class="font-italic">and voting</span>” (emphasis added). Only 13 of the members present had been eligible to vote because 25 of the members had recused themselves from voting. Of those 13 eligible members, they had unanimously voted to remove the Plaintiff as trustee.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 In relation to the decision to terminate the Plaintiff’s membership in Bo Tien Temple, the Defendants argued that there had been no breach of natural justice. First, the Plaintiff had not been deprived of an opportunity to explain himself at the MC Meeting. Many of the members had encouraged the Plaintiff to state his case. He had attempted to explain himself at some junctures, but at other junctures he had been evasive and refused to engage meaningfully with the MC.

</div> Secondly, the Defendants argued that the decision to terminate the Plaintiff’s membership had not been tainted by apparent bias. The mere fact that the five MC members who voted on the issue of the Plaintiff’s membership had also voted in favour of removing him as trustee at the 45th AGM did not disqualify them from voting at the MC Meeting.

</div> Finally, the mere presence of the 2nd and 4th defendants at the MC Meeting did not taint the decision with apparent bias, as the 2nd and 4th defendants had recused themselves from voting.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issues to be determined</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Broadly speaking, the issues and sub-issues to be determined were as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Whether the decision to terminate the Plaintiff’s trusteeship was invalid.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) Whether the decision to terminate the Plaintiff’s trusteeship was reached in breach of the rules of natural justice.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) Whether the decision to terminate the Plaintiff’s trusteeship was <span class="font-italic">ultra vires </span>the BTT Constitution.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Whether the decision to terminate the Plaintiff’s membership was invalid.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) Whether the decision to terminate the Plaintiff’s membership was tainted by apparent bias.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) Whether the decision to terminate the Plaintiff’s trusteeship was <span class="font-italic">ultra vires </span>the BTT Constitution.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Decision and reasons</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 As a preliminary point, in coming to my decision I was conscious of the settled position that the courts’ approach to societies like the Bo Tien Temple is to leave them to manage their own affairs. In <span class="font-italic">Kay Swee Pin v Singapore Island Country Club </span>[2008] 2 SLR(R) 802 (“<span class="font-italic">Kay Swee Pin</span>”), the Court of Appeal made the following remarks at [2]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The traditional approach of the courts to social clubs is to leave such clubs to manage their own affairs. However, where a club expels a member, it may only do so in compliance with the rules of natural justice. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 I note that the Bo Tien Temple is a religious organisation and strictly speaking not a “social club”. However, I was of the view that the remarks in <span class="font-italic">Kay Swee Pin </span>were nevertheless applicable to the present facts. As stated by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Singapore Amateur Athletics Association v Haron bin Mundir </span>[1993] 3 SLR(R) 407 (“<span class="font-italic">Haron bin Mundir</span>”) at [57]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The jurisdiction of the courts in reviewing the decisions of domestic tribunals is clearly of a limited nature. The decision of such a tribunal cannot be attacked on the ground that it is against the weight of the evidence. The function of the courts is to see that the rules of natural justice have been observed, and that the decision has been honestly arrived at. The court has no power to review the evidence for the purpose of deciding whether the tribunal came to a right conclusion.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 It follows that my function was not to scrutinise the merits or correctness of the decisions reached by the general meeting and the MC of Bo Tien Temple. I was only concerned with whether or not these decisions had been reached in compliance with the rules of natural justice, and with the BTT Constitution.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the decision to terminate the plaintiff’s trusteeship was invalid</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Natural Justice</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The Plaintiff’s claim that the decision to remove him as trustee breached the rules of natural justice was based on two points: first, there had been a breach of the <span class="font-italic">audi alteram partem </span>rule because the discussions concerning the termination of his trusteeship had been conducted in his absence; secondly, the decision was tainted by apparent bias (see [33] above). I will address these arguments in turn.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">The alleged breach of the <span class="font-italic">audi alteram partem </span>rule</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The <span class="font-italic">audi alteram partem </span>rule requires that the party liable to be directly affected by the outcome of the disciplinary proceedings (a) must have notice of the allegation(s) against him and (b) should be given a fair opportunity to be heard (<span class="font-italic">Kay Swee Pin </span>at [7]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 As for the first of these requirements, I was satisfied that the Plaintiff had notice of the allegations against him. He had been told that the termination of his trusteeship would be deliberated on at the 45th AGM via a letter on 28 April 2015. This was followed by the 5 May Letter (received by the Plaintiff on 6 May 2015) which set out in considerable detail the specific incidents and particulars which had allegedly “rendered [him] undesirable to continue as trustee” (see [16] above). Although the Plaintiff only received the 5 May Letter some three days before the 45th AGM, this fact must be seen in light of the history of this case, namely, that the general meeting of Bo Tien Temple had previously sought to remove the Plaintiff as trustee in 2012, which formed the basis of the dispute in OS 998/2014. Indeed Chong J had specifically noted in the Oral Judgment that the attempt to remove the Plaintiff as trustee was based in part on the “Ngor Ya” flag incident of 2004 and the Plaintiff’s intended publication of the Draft Book (see [13(a)] above). In view of this, the Plaintiff could not have been surprised by the allegations against him raised in the 5 May Letter. Thus, he had sufficient notice of the matters which would be discussed in connection with the proposed termination of his trusteeship at the 45th AGM. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 As for the second aspect of the <span class="font-italic">audi alteram partem </span>rule (that the party subject to disciplinary proceedings must be given a fair opportunity to be heard), it was clear that the Plaintiff had not actually <span class="font-italic">been</span><span class="font-italic"> heard</span> in the course of the discussions concerning the proposed termination of his trusteeship. He had left the 45th AGM when those discussions commenced (see [19] above). The question was whether, bearing in mind that the Plaintiff had chosen to walk out of the 45th AGM, it could be said that he had been denied a fair opportunity to be heard. I was of the view that this question should be answered in the negative.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 In this regard, I was guided by the case of <span class="font-italic">Fong Chee Keong v Professional Engineers Board, Singapore </span>[2016] 3 SLR 221 (“<span class="font-italic">Fong Chee Keong</span>”), which was cited by the Defendants.

</div>
</div> In that case, the appellant, Fong, appealed against a finding that he was guilty of a disciplinary charge by the Professional Engineers Board, Singapore (“PEB”). PEB had notified the appellant that they would conduct a disciplinary hearing on three occasions, but the appellant had postponed the hearing three times for tenuous reasons. On one occasion he had even claimed he was unable to attend because of a minor traffic accident that had actually occurred a week before the actual hearing date. The PEB finally decided to proceed with the hearing in the appellant’s absence, and found him guilty of the disciplinary charge. On appeal, the appellant argued that the PEB had denied him an opportunity to be heard. That argument was dismissed by Lee Seiu Kin J, who made the following remarks (<span class="font-italic">Fong Chee Keong </span>at [28]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">While it is a trite rule of natural justice that no one should be condemned unheard, the right is not an unlimited one. Indeed, it was apparent from the narration of the facts above that the PEB was not only prepared to hear Fong, but had also bent over backwards to accommodate him. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Under these circumstances, it defies logic that the PEB would be under an obligation to postpone the matter indefinitely for someone who was seeking to evade it. Indeed, this is a case where Fong had been given every opportunity to be heard but had not made use of it. <span class="font-italic">The law requires the tribunal to give Fong an opportunity to be heard; it is up to Fong to make use of that opportunity.</span> <span class="font-italic">The court will, of course, examine the circumstances to decide whether a person has been given a reasonable opportunity to be heard,</span> including whether the tribunal was merely going through the motions. In the present case, however, I found that the PEB had acted with utmost reasonableness and it was Fong who had been unreasonable with his demands and deceptions.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 I note that on the present facts, the Plaintiff has not acted dishonestly or nearly as unreasonably as the appellant in <span class="font-italic">Fong Chee Keong</span>. Nevertheless, the remarks of Lee J in <span class="font-italic">Fong Chee Keong </span>are applicable insofar as they make clear that the right to be heard is not an unlimited right, and that a body or tribunal’s obligation to give an individual a right to be heard is really an obligation to afford a <span class="font-italic">reasonable opportunity </span>for that individual to be heard. The individual’s right to be heard is breached, however, if the circumstances suggest that the tribunal “was merely going through the motions” (<span class="font-italic">Fong Chee Keong </span>at [28]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 On the facts, I was satisfied that the Plaintiff had been afforded a reasonable opportunity to be heard. He was fully aware that the members present at the 45th AGM would be discussing the termination of his trusteeship, but chose to leave the meeting when those discussions began. He did this despite both the 2nd and 4th defendants’ attempts to persuade him to stay to explain himself (see [19] above). Thus, like the appellant in <span class="font-italic">Fong Chee Keong</span>, the plaintiff had been given an opportunity to be heard, but chose not to exercise that opportunity. I was also satisfied that this was not a case where the general meeting was simply “going through the motions”. The discussions concerning the removal of the Plaintiff as trustee continued for about an hour before a vote was taken on the matter (see [20] above). I also note that at some point after the Plaintiff left the meeting, the 3rd defendant had tried to locate the Plaintiff on the premises of Bo Tien Temple because the members “[wanted] to know what [the Plaintiff] would like to address the general assembly regarding his posting (<span class="font-italic">sic</span>)” (see [22] above), but the Plaintiff could not be found. The minutes do not make clear whether the 3rd defendant had searched for the Plaintiff <span class="font-italic">before </span>or <span class="font-italic">after </span>the vote was taken, but what <span class="font-italic">is </span>clear is that those present at the 45th AGM were generally prepared to hear what the Plaintiff had to say. Accordingly, I found that the Plaintiff had been afforded a reasonable opportunity to be heard.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 I note that the Plaintiff’s stated reason for not wanting to participate in the inquiry was that he was unable to consult with his lawyer, who was abroad at the time. I thus considered whether it was reasonable for the MC and the general meeting to have proceeded with the discussions despite knowing that the Plaintiff had been unable to consult his lawyer. In this regard, I felt it was significant that, as a matter of fact, the Plaintiff knew that his trusteeship was proposed to be terminated on the basis that he was “believed to be guilty of conduct rendering it undesirable that he continues as a trustee” under Article 19d of the BTT Constitution. This had been explicitly stated as the basis for his proposed removal in the 5 May Letter (see [16] above). I agreed with the Defendants that this was primarily a factual issue and that there was no great need for the Plaintiff to consult with a lawyer. Indeed when the Plaintiff indicated his intention not to participate in the discussions via email, the 2nd defendant had <span class="font-italic">told </span>the Plaintiff that the meeting would deal with factual, and not legal points (see [18] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 For similar reasons, I was unpersuaded by the Plaintiff’s contention that even if he had remained at the 45th AGM throughout the discussions concerning his trusteeship, he would not have been adequately equipped to defend himself because his lawyer was out of the country at the time. In arguing this point, learned counsel for the Plaintiff, Mr Wijaya, relied heavily on excerpts from the Oral Judgment in which Chong J remarked that even if the Plaintiff had attended the 42nd AGM in 2012, he would not have been adequately equipped to defend himself.

</div>
</div> Those remarks were made in an entirely different set of circumstances where the Plaintiff had not even been given notice of the particulars of the allegations against him (see [13(a)–13(b)] above). In contrast, prior to the 45th AGM, the Plaintiff had been given the full details of the specific incidents which formed the basis of his proposed removal as trustee. In light of this, I was unable to agree that he would not have been equipped to defend himself at the 45th AGM merely because his lawyer was out of the country at the material time. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 I also note in passing that there is no inherent right at common law to be allowed legal representation when appearing before a domestic disciplinary tribunal (<span class="font-italic">Kok Seng Chong v Bukit Turf Club </span>[1992] 3 SLR(R) 722 at [58]), especially where the hearing or meeting deals with points of fact and not points of law (<span class="font-italic">R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, Ex parte Tarrant </span>[1985] QB 251 at 285). As I have already mentioned, whether the Plaintiff was “guilty of undesirable conduct rendering it undesirable that he continues as a trustee” was primarily a factual issue which did not raise any legal questions.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">The alleged apparent bias</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Coming to the issue of apparent bias, the applicable test in Singapore is whether a reasonable and fair minded person knowing all the relevant facts would have a reasonable suspicion or apprehension that a fair trial is not possible (see <span class="font-italic">Re Shankar Alan s/o Anant Kulkarni </span>[2007] 1 SLR(R) 85 at [103] and <span class="font-italic">Sim Yong Teng and another v Singapore Swimming Club </span>[2016] 2 SLR 489 at [62]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Counsel for the Plaintiff argued that bias was apparent from (a) the fact that the decision to terminate the Plaintiff’s trusteeship was largely premised on the contents of the Draft Book, which had not been published and (b) the fact that the MC had informed the Plaintiff that his trusteeship was proposed to be terminated only six days after his trusteeship and membership had been reinstated. The suggestion appeared to be that there was some form of prejudgment, which has been recognised as a form of apparent bias (<span class="font-italic">Kay Swee Pin </span>at [65]). I was not persuaded by these arguments.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 As I have mentioned, my role was not to scrutinise the merits and/or correctness of the decision to terminate the Plaintiff’s trusteeship, especially given that Article 19(d) of the BTT Constitution empowers the general meeting to remove a trustee “in its absolute discretion” (see [6] above). The fact that the decision was premised on the Plaintiff’s intended publication of the Draft Book in 2011 did not, in itself, suggest any kind of bias or impartiality or any other breach of natural justice. Counsel for the Plaintiff was at pains to emphasise that the Draft Book had not been published, but I failed to see the relevance of this. The general meeting of Bo Tien Temple appears to have found it sufficient to constitute a grounds for removal that the Plaintiff had written the Draft Book <span class="font-italic">in</span> <span class="font-italic">the first place</span>, whether or not he had published it. It was not for this Court to judge whether that decision was correct or meritorious. Ultimately, the mere fact that the grounds for the proposed termination of the Plaintiff’s trusteeship were largely premised on the contents of an unpublished Draft Book would not give a fair minded person a reasonable suspicion that a fair trial was not possible.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Counsel for the Plaintiff also made much of the fact that there were only six days between the reinstatement of the Plaintiff’s trusteeship and the time when the MC informed the Plaintiff that the general meeting of Bo Tien Temple would be considering terminating his trusteeship at the 45th AGM.  In his words, the problem was that it was “the same old issues that they were rehashing”.

</div>
</div>
</div> Yet, in my view, this in itself would not suggest any prejudgment or bias to a reasonable and fair minded person. It was a fact that the incidents which formed the basis for the Plaintiff’s proposed removal as trustee had happened quite some time in the past (from as early as 2004 to the latest incident in 2011). It seems that, as far as the general meeting of Bo Tien Temple were concerned, those incidents had not become less relevant considerations despite the lapse of time since they had occurred. Again, it was not for this Court to judge the merits of such a view. The members and management were fully entitled to reconsider removing the Plaintiff soon after he had been reinstated as a member on the basis of his conduct in the past. They were certainly not obligated to wait for any particular period of time to elapse, or for the Plaintiff to engage in fresh conduct rendering him “undesirable” as a trustee before they could consider whether his trusteeship should be terminated.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Finally, it was also argued that the decision was tainted by apparent bias by virtue of the 4th defendant’s involvement in the discussions concerning the proposal to remove the Plaintiff as trustee. As I understood it, the point was that the 4th defendant had a personal interest in the matter because he had been involved in many of the incidents that were discussed as the basis for the Plaintiff’s proposed removal, such as the intended publication of the Draft Book and the “Ngor Ya” flag incident. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 I was unpersuaded by this argument. To begin with, counsel for the Plaintiff’s submission that the 4th defendant was “procedurally involved in the whole thing” was something of an overstatement. The minutes of the 45th AGM reflect that the 4th defendant had spoken four times in the course of the discussions concerning the proposal to terminate the Plaintiff’s trusteeship.

</div>
</div> The first time he spoke, he introduced the topic by updating the general meeting on the outcome of OS 998/2014 and summarizing Chong J’s findings. The second and third times the 4th defendant spoke, he did so to deny the truth of some of the allegations that were raised in the Draft Book. The fourth time the 4th defendant spoke, he reminded the members present at the general meeting that those who had an interest in the matter should recuse themselves from voting (see [20] above). As a whole, given the level of the 4th defendant’s involvement in the discussions, I was not convinced that a reasonable and fair minded person would have apprehended that a fair hearing was not possible for the Plaintiff. Further, while the 4th defendant had clearly participated in the discussions, ultimately the decision was made by those who voted on the matter. The 4th defendant, in light of his personal history with the Plaintiff, had abstained from voting and engaging in that decision-making. I did not think it could be said that the decision was infected by apparent bias by dint of the 4th defendant’s presence and/or participation in the 45th AGM.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 For the above reasons, I was not convinced that the decision to terminate the Plaintiff’s trusteeship had been reached in a manner that breached the rules of natural justice. There was neither a denial of the Plaintiff’s right to be heard, nor any tainting of the decision by apparent bias.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Ultra Vires </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 The Plaintiff also contended that the decision to remove him as trustee was not passed with the number of votes required by Article 17(j) of the BTT Constitution. I dismissed this argument without hesitation. As highlighted by the Defendants, Article 17(j) states that the decision of the general meeting is to be exercised by simple majority of the members <span class="font-italic">present and voting</span>. Only 13 members were “present <span class="font-italic">and voting</span>” because the other members had recused themselves. Four members voted by proxy, which is explicitly permitted under Article 17(d) of the BTT Constitution (see [7] above).  All 17 members voted in favour of removing the Plaintiff as trustee. Even if the term “present and voting” were taken to exclude proxy votes, the 13 members present and voting voted unanimously in favour of removing the Plaintiff as trustee. Thus, there is no doubt that the resolution to remove the Plaintiff as trustee was validly passed in accordance with Article 17(j) of the BTT Constitution.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the decision to terminate the plaintiff’s membership was invalid</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The alleged apparent bias</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 I turn now to discuss the MC’s decision to terminate the Plaintiff’s membership. I reiterate once again that the applicable test is whether a reasonable and fair minded person knowing all the relevant facts would have a reasonable suspicion or apprehension that a fair trial is not possible (see <span class="font-italic">Re Shankar Alan s/o Anant Kulkarni </span>[2007] 1 SLR(R) 85 at [103] and <span class="font-italic">Sim Yong Teng and another v Singapore Swimming Club </span>[2016] 2 SLR 489 at [62]. Bearing this test in mind, I was of the view that the Plaintiff’s contentions were without merit. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 The first reason that the Plaintiff argued that the decision to terminate his membership was tainted with apparent bias was that the MC members who voted on this decision had previously voted to remove the Plaintiff as trustee at the 45th AGM. In assessing this argument, I found that the remarks of Lord Bingham CJ in <span class="font-italic">Locabail (UK) Ltd v Bayfield Properties Ltd </span>[2000] QB 451 (“<span class="font-italic">Locabail</span>”) at [25] were instructive:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">We cannot … conceive of circumstances in which an objection could be soundly based on … <span class="font-italic">previous judicial decisions. </span>… The mere fact that a judge, earlier in the same case or in a <span class="font-italic">previous case</span>, had commented adversely on a party or witness, or found the evidence of a party or witness to be unreliable, would not without more found a sustainable objection.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 It follows that the mere fact that the four members of the MC who voted to terminate the Plaintiff’s membership had also previously voted to remove him as trustee was insufficient to raise a reasonable suspicion of bias in the mind of a reasonable and fair minded person. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Although the Plaintiff did not frame his argument in this manner, for the sake of completeness I also considered whether there was any apparent bias arising from the fact that the 5th defendant had made certain remarks about the Plaintiff at the 45th AGM in the discussions concerning the termination of the Plaintiff’s trusteeship.

But the “draft book” written by [the plaintiff] contained many untrue events showing that he was not honest. He was also not rationale (<span class="font-italic">sic</span>) and logical to put pen to paper about fellow members’ personal life whether they are true or not.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Having regard to the tone of these remarks, I was not convinced that they were sufficient to give rise to a reasonable suspicion of bias. I note that in <span class="font-italic">Locabail </span>at [25] Lord Bingham CJ accepted that a danger of bias might be thought to arise “if on any question at issue in the proceedings before him the judge had expressed views … in such extreme and unbalanced terms as to throw doubt on his ability to try the issue with an objective judicial mind”. However, the 5th defendant’s remarks at the 45th AGM were not in “such extreme and unbalanced terms” as to give a reasonable and fair minded person an apprehension that a fair hearing was not possible for the Plaintiff on the issue of his membership.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 The Plaintiff also argued that the mere presence of the 2nd and 4th defendants at the MC Meeting tainted the decision to terminate his membership with apparent bias. I did not agree. Crucially, the 2nd and 4th defendants were participating in the inquiry in their capacity as witnesses. They were not there in the capacity of adjudicators who had any power to vote or decide on the termination of the Plaintiff’s membership. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The alleged breach of Article 8(b) of the BTT Constitution</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Finally, the Plaintiff suggested that there had been a breach of Article 8(b) of the BTT Constitution because the MC had failed to take into account “relevant considerations”. I reproduce the full text of Article 8(b) for convenience:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Proceedings before the Management Committee shall be as informal as possible and consistently with fairness, all decisions as to the procedure shall be at the discretion of the Management Committee.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The Plaintiff argued that although the 3rd defendant allowed him to offer some explanation in respect of the issue concerning the removal of the “Ngor Ya” flag, the other members of the MC who attended the inquiry were “not of the same mind”.

As I have mentioned (see [28] above), I acknowledge that the Plaintiff was indeed interrupted at several junctures and told by certain members that they did not wish to hear his explanations, or that he was speaking of irrelevant matters. That seemed to be a consequence of the fact that, in line with Article 8(b), the proceedings before the MC were indeed “as informal as possible”. But the mere fact that the Plaintiff had been interrupted, and/or that the Plaintiff met with resistance from some members when he wanted to state his case, did not mean that there had been a breach of the requirement in Article 8(b) that the proceedings were to be “consistently (<span class="font-italic">sic</span>) with fairness”. In fact, despite the arguments that arose in the course of the proceedings, the Plaintiff managed to state in considerable detail his version of the events and his position relating to the “Ngor Ya” issue.

For completeness’ sake, and even though this specific provision was not raised in argument, I also found that there had been no breach of Article 8(a)(ii) of the BTT Constitution, which requires the MC to “give due consideration to any explanation [a member] may make” when considering his expulsion.</div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 For the foregoing reasons, I find that the decisions to terminate the Plaintiff’s trusteeship at the 45th AGM and to terminate the Plaintiff’s membership at the MC meeting on 3 July 2015 were both valid.
