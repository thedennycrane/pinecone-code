BUT is a 27-year-old Singaporean male. He was about 24 to 25 years old at the material time, and was employed as an auxiliary police officer. The victim (“V”) was 25 years old at the material time.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 Sometime in 2014, BUT and V entered into a relationship. They would occasionally book a hotel room, where they would be sexually intimate. BUT was interested in “soft-bondage” sexual activities, and asked V to engage in them with him. V initially rejected his request and told him that she was uncomfortable doing so. However, he continued to cajole V and told her that they should try new things to “spice up” their relationship. Eventually, V relented and allowed herself to be physically bound, effectively placing herself at the mercy of BUT as she wanted to please him and because she loved and trusted him. Over the course of their relationship it was BUT who invariably initiated the soft-bondage acts during sexual intercourse.

In addition to soft-bondage activities, BUT regularly recorded their sexual intercourse as he claimed that viewing the erotic videos would facilitate a more rapid onset of orgasm for him. V similarly disliked the idea of recording their intimate moments, but she relented as BUT had told her it was for his personal viewing pleasure only. To win V’s trust, he promised to delete the videos after watching them. V’s fears were assuaged as she trusted BUT.

Taking into account the offender-specific aggravating factors of the number of charges taken into consideration and BUT’s deletion of incriminating evidence as against the mitigating factor of BUT’s plea of guilt, a sentencing discount of at most a year for each of the charges would be appropriate. The Prosecution thus submitted for a sentence of 14 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane for the 1st and 2nd charges and of 11 years’ imprisonment and eight strokes of the cane for the 5th charge.

She reposed such a degree of trust in him that she allowed herself to be blindfolded and tied up during sex thus placing herself at his complete mercy. The soft-bondage routines entrenched V’s role as the vulnerable party in intercourse and BUT exploited her trust to create an opportunity for SM to sexually assault her.

However, referring to <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v BQW</span> [2018] SGHC 136 at [37], it suggested the present case involved a different level of trust as compared to precedents where the accused was in an occupation of trust, or where there was a familial relationship between the accused and the victim.

Relationships of trust can vary among individuals, and each case turns on its facts. In the present case, I agreed with the Prosecution that there had been a flagrant abuse of V’s trust and this was a significant aggravating factor.

</div> BUT knew that V was against participating in a threesome, yet he proceeded to orchestrate the acts with SM. This was a relationship where V had wholly reposed her trust in BUT, and where she had allowed herself to be bound and blindfolded because she loved and trusted him. Indeed, the second occasion of the abetment of rape occurred when V was <span class="font-italic">celebrating</span><span class="font-italic"> BUT’s birthday</span>. I accepted that V’s shock and horror after she discovered on this occasion, that a <span class="font-italic">stranger</span> had penetrated her vagina as she struggled to free herself from the rope and to make sense of her situation, would have been immense.

V’s engagement in soft bondage activities – though she was initially reluctant – was a choice made because she loved and trusted BUT. It seemed to me that what BUT had done was to foster an assumption in V that when she placed herself in such a compromising position she would not be harmed. Once V had acceded to his request and allowed herself to be additionally vulnerable (by being placed in “bondage”), BUT had exploited that vulnerability and invalidated both her trust and her sexual autonomy. It was the violation of V’s inalienable right to choose how and who she would or would not have sex with that struck at the very heart of why rape was rightly regarded as a heinous offence: see generally <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v V Murugesan</span> [2005] SGHC 160 at [54].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">Deliberate infliction of special trauma</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 I turn to the Prosecution’s submission that there was the deliberate infliction of special trauma.

</div> BUT had transgressed V’s wishes not to engage in a threesome and had filmed the illicit enterprise for his repeated viewing pleasure. There was a further risk of dissemination of the footage. Moreover, BUT went so far as to dip his fingers in SM’s semen and smeared it over V’s lips, subjecting her to further degradation and humiliation for her perpetrators’ sexual pleasure.

It should be noted that on the first occasion (in April 2016), BUT had enabled SM to repeatedly rape V (the subject of the 2nd, 3rd and 4th charges). Further, on both occasions, SM had penetrated V without a condom and thus BUT had knowingly risked V’s exposure to pregnancy and the transmission of a serious disease <span class="font-italic">by a stranger</span>. BUT’s act of smearing SM’s semen over V’s lips showed how he reduced V to a mere sex object to be humiliated at his pleasure.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Offender-specific factors</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">Charges taken into consideration and deletion of evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Next, I considered the offender-specific factors. There were 54 charges taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. This included two other acts of abetment of rape of V by SM (committed on the first occasion in April 2016), four charges of abetment of the outrage of modesty by SM of V (committed on the first and second occasions of the rape by SM in April and August 2016), the making of numerous obscene films pertaining to the acts of the first occasion and, pertinently, committing similar offences of making obscene films of two <span class="font-italic">other</span> unsuspecting females thereby insulting their modesty.

</div> In this regard, I accepted that any effect of an offer by an accused to testify would necessarily be of an unprovable quantity and could be resiled from after sentence was passed. However, limited weight might be afforded to an accused where such an offer appeared to be motivated by genuine remorse, which I was of the view was extant in the present case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 In my view, the number and degree of the offence- and offender-specific aggravating factors placed BUT’s offences at the very least within the middle of Band 2 of <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span> and <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair</span> and hence the indicative starting sentence was 15 years’ imprisonment for abetment of rape and 12 years’ imprisonment for abetment of digital-penetration. I agreed that general and specific deterrence was warranted, given the heinous nature of the crimes committed by BUT and the offence- and offender-specific factors, such as the degree of premeditation and planning, the significant deployment of deception to procure V’s unknowing participation in the acts, how BUT had destroyed incriminating evidence after he was caught, and the number and nature of the charges taken into consideration. It was BUT who had initiated the plan with SM to sexually abuse V and, not being satisfied with having done so once (on the first occasion), repeated the heinous acts again (on the second occasion). His actions led to the degradation and humiliation of V, his own girlfriend. At the same time, I took into account BUT’s plea of guilt, his remorse, and that he had no previous antecedents. I also considered that there was some overlap when referring to various acts and circumstances which were considered in the offence- or offender-specific factors. Further, I was also cognisant that BUT was relatively young when he committed the offences and that any global sentence to be imposed would be lengthy. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Bearing in mind the totality principle and with a view to BUT’s past record and his future prospects, I thus imposed a term of 14 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane for each of the abetment of rape charges (1st and 2nd charges) and 10 years’ imprisonment and eight strokes of the cane on the abetment of digital-penetration charge (5th charge). I ordered the sentences for the 1st and 5th charges to run consecutively, thus totalling 24 years’ imprisonment with the maximum 24 strokes of the cane. As for the total imprisonment term, BUT had previously spent one month in custody in the Institute of Mental Health and would thus serve a sentence of 23 years and 11 months’ imprisonment (after deducting the custody period).</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Audrey Lim  <br/>Judicial Commissioner</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Ng Yiwen, Asoka Markandu, and Eunice Lau <br/>(Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the Prosecution;<br/>Mohamed Baiross and Ashwin Ganapathy (I.R.B.
