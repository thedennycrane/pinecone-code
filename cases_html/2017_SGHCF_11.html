I agreed with the Husband that, in respect of the assets that had been taken by the OA, their valuation must be taken as at a time <span class="font-italic">ex post </span>the OA’s adjudication and distribution. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 To explain the context, after the Husband’s bankruptcy, the parties’ matrimonial home, which was held in the Husband’s sole name, was repossessed and auctioned off on 24 April 2013 for $2.85m. A part of this sum was refunded to the Husband’s CPF account and a part was taken by the mortgagee in discharge of mortgages taken out over the matrimonial home. The OA thereafter took some $996,116.78. Using this amount, the OA paid off $729,076.94 owed by the Husband to various banks and two individuals, Mr Choo and Mr Liang.

The Wife did <span class="font-italic">not</span>, however, adduce any evidence to show that the debts incurred, which were then discharged during the bankruptcy, were dissipations by the Husband or could be attributed solely to him. Given that these sums had been paid out by the OA, whose proper conduct of the matter was not in question before me, there was no reason to hold that the underlying debts paid off were falsely or wrongly incurred. Further, in light of the High Court’s decision in <span class="font-italic">AVM v AWH</span>, it was the annulment of the Husband’s bankruptcy orders that paved the way for parties’ ancillary matters to be dealt with under s 112 of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) (“WC”).

In particular, I found that the Husband’s transfers of [A]’s shareholding in end-2010 to mid-2011 must have been in order to prevent the Wife from laying claim to her rightful share of the matrimonial assets. In this regard, I accepted [B]’s testimony that no money had in fact been paid under these agreements as they were sham transactions. This was buttressed by the fact that in the short span of time covered by the sale and purchase agreements, <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>from January 2011 to February 2011, there was considerable fluctuation in the value attributed to the shares which lent support to [B]’s averment that the transactions were not genuine. In respect of the incriminating email, I appreciated that parties may not have been entirely truthful at the meeting either. However, when seen in context with the other objective evidence, <span class="font-italic">eg</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>the ACRA records which showed [A] as the owner of some shares despite the transaction documents having been executed between [B] and the Husband exclusively, it was clear that as at end March 2011, the Husband desired to put certain [P] Pte Ltd shares out of reach of the Wife. For these reasons, I held that an adverse inference against the Husband was warranted for his conduct in relation to the shareholdings of [P] Pte Ltd, at least to the extent of [A]’s shareholding.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Having decided that, the means by which such an inference may be given effect to is fact-specific, including “by ordering a higher proportion of the disclosed assets to the other party, or, where possible, [by determining] the actual value of the undisclosed assets based on available information, and include[ing] such value in the pool of assets to be divided” (<span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen </span><span class="font-italic">Boey v Sia Hee Soon</span> [2012] 3 SLR 402 at [21]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 In this case, there was no evidence, however, as to the precise value of [A]’s shares in [P] Pte Ltd. [P] Pte Ltd was a private company and there was no readily available data of the market value of its shares. The sale and purchase agreements were also not the best gauge of the value of the company’s share, as they were clearly sham transactions: no money was paid by [A] nor [B] in these various transactions.

Even then, she was not able to show evidence of unexplained dissipation. Further, while counsel for the Wife submitted that [P] Pte Ltd was a conduit for siphoning money, there was no evidence showing transfers from the company to undisclosed accounts or evidence of any other method of siphoning money at the material time.

The Wife took the position that the whole sum was illegitimately expended and should be added back to the pool. The Husband submitted that the largest withdrawal in May 2010 of about $257,000 was used for an abortive Russian oil and gas venture, and other withdrawals were also for legitimate purposes. He highlighted that the withdrawals here were made between September 2009 and October 2010, when there was no intention on either party’s part to initiate divorce. As such, dissipation was highly implausible at that time.

</div> Further, the bulk of the monies which had allegedly been dissipated were withdrawn before the Husband’s adulterous relationship was discovered in July 2010. I also saw merit in the Husband’s submission that there had been significant deposits into this joint account during the relevant period. The Wife focused exclusively on the withdrawals to build her case of dissipation, but she omitted to mention that the Husband had been the one depositing significant sums into this account. For instance, in June 2010 he deposited $167,000 into the account and withdrew a similar amount.

</div> These were therefore legitimate fund movements and not dissipations as such. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In my judgment, the Wife’s submissions on dissipation in respect of these accounts could not be accepted. First, the Wife’s approach here, similar to the approach used for the DBS Autosave account, was to trace withdrawals without<span class="font-italic"> </span>accounting for deposits. This was not a sound approach, whether in quantification or in providing the court with a comprehensive contextual understanding of the relevant transaction history in order that any inference may be drawn from the presence or absence of certain facts. Secondly, these allegations were raised at the eleventh hour. Even if that were not an indication of them being an afterthought, it would mean that any lack of documentation and/or explanation by the Husband must, accordingly, be viewed with some degree of leniency. Thirdly, I accepted the Husband’s evidence that [P] Pte Ltd was at the material time operating as a going concern, with valid if not robust financial turnover, and required the support of various fund transfers between currencies and account types, including of his own personal accounts. For these reasons, I did not accept the Wife’s submissions in respect of the SCB accounts. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(4) Proceeds from Husband’s Aviva Policy No Lxxx4380</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The proceeds from the Husband’s Aviva Policy No Lxxx4380 in the sum of $81,747.50 had been used to pay off, through the OA, the Husband’s credit card debt incurred before he was adjudged a bankrupt. The Wife argued that this amount should notionally be added into the pool because the Husband’s credit card debts were self-induced. The Husband, on the other hand, claimed that the Wife had herself intentionally overspent and laid the responsibility to foot the bills at his feet. As explained, because the sum had been legitimately paid out by the OA for debts incurred by both parties for which responsibility cannot be delineated clearly between them, it should not be added to the pool. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(5) Diamond Rings</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Based on an invoice for two diamond rings for $28,870, the Wife contended that these were purchased for [A], but was unable to point to any evidence of this allegation. The Husband explained that he merely utilized the invoice to collect a tax refund for the wife of [B], when he and [B] were still on good terms, as his employment as a pilot allowed him to do so. Tax invoices were adduced which showed that they had been presented for a tax refund.

As explained above, on 16 August 2012, parties had entered a consent order, amending the initial interim maintenance order and providing that the parties agreed that the maintenance arrears as at August 2012 amounted to $44,000 and that these arrears and the balance of $3,500 per month (payable from September 2012 onwards) would be accumulated and dealt with at the hearing of the ancillary matters.

The Wife denied making any financial contribution towards the acquisition of this property, claiming instead that two of her sisters had paid entirely for it. The Husband pointed out that these sisters had been tasked by the Wife to safekeep large sums of monies which in fact constituted matrimonial assets. In these circumstances, he asked that an adverse inference be drawn against the Wife, who should be made to account for the matrimonial funds used to purchase the property.

Thus, save for one exception, I was of the view that the issue of damages should be kept distinct. This exception related to the issue of the specific loss shown by the Husband in relation to his SIA share options. The 1st Injunction obtained by the Wife covered the SIA share options. Pending dismissal from the SIA, the Husband requested that the Wife consent to the SIA share options being exercised in order to realise their value, as these options would otherwise lapse on his termination of employment. The Wife declined. In my view, such conduct was unreasonable. If the 1st injunction had been temporarily lifted, the options would have been realised, and <span class="font-italic">the share</span><span class="font-italic"> proceeds would have come into and augmented the matrimonial pool prior to the IJ Date</span>.

</div> and she should be given due credit for the ploughed-back proceeds. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 In the circumstances, I held that the Wife’s direct contribution was 5% and the Husband’s direct contribution was 95%. I accepted that the Wife made some contributions to the purchase of Avila Gardens, and was indeed able to do so based on her employment income prior to and at the start of the marriage. Despite the Husband’s claim that the $80,000-$100,000 contribution came from the Husband’s mother instead, there was no objective evidence adduced to show the source of funds, and no clarity as to the nature of the mother’s contribution, which could equally have been a gift to both spouses as that was at a time when the marital disputes had not yet arisen. However, the Wife’s assertion of 7% direct contribution appeared to have been an exaggeration. According to her submissions, this figure was derived by a simple averaging of the parties’ direct contribution ratios to 3 properties: (a) the present matrimonial home, (b) Avila Gardens, and (c) another property undisputedly purchased using funds of the Husband entirely.

</div> This is erroneous for at least two reasons. First, by this methodology, the Wife double-counted her contributions of the same sum which were directed first to Avila Gardens then ploughed back into the present matrimonial home. Second, the simple average of ratios did not account for the difference in base quantum of each property on which that ratio was derived,<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">ie</span>, their different purchase prices and thus different weightages within the matrimonial pool. Rather, it appeared that a fairer method was to divide the Wife’s undisputed contribution against the size of the matrimonial pool, which would give a figure of around 4%. Taking into consideration the proportion of growth in the valuation of the matrimonial home that must be attributed to the Wife’s initial contribution to Avila Gardens, I found the direct contribution ratio of 5:95 in favour of the Husband appropriate on the facts. This is not surprising, given that it was undisputed that for most of the 22-year marriage, the Wife had primarily been a homemaker and was financially dependent on the Husband.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 Having regard to all the circumstances, I set the indirect contribution ratio at 80:20 in favour of the Wife. In my view, the Wife’s indirect non-financial contributions were significant. The Wife had made serious sacrifices in order to support the Husband in his overseas attachments and night classes to obtain his post-graduate degree, and to take care of the son. She had help from the Husband’s mother and a domestic helper, but these were not significant in duration or extent. The Husband’s focus was on his career, which entailed not only piloting but also the management of his side businesses and other ventures. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 The Husband submitted that, in determining the appropriate indirect contribution ratio, I should take into account the Wife’s unreasonable conduct in obtaining the injunctions to cripple him and his businesses, citing <span class="font-italic">Chan Tin Sun v Fong Quay </span><span class="font-italic">Sim</span> [2015] 2 SLR 195 (“<span class="font-italic">Chan Tin Sun</span>”). There, the Court of Appeal accepted that the court, in exercise of its powers of division of matrimonial assets under s 112(1) of the WC, may taking into consideration a spouse’s misconduct (at [22]-[23]). Several principles, however, delimit the contours of this power. First, the court must be cautious not to allow the ancillary matters hearing to become another forum for parties “to dredge up accusations and allegations relating to each other’s conduct”, in light of the no-fault basis of divorce embodied in the WC (<span class="font-italic">Chan Tin Sun </span>at [25]). Secondly and relatedly, “the court only ought to have regard to conduct that is both extreme (<span class="font-italic">ie</span> manifestly serious) and undisputed” (<span class="font-italic">Chan Tin Sun </span>at [25]). Thirdly, while the court could, in principle, give effect to such misconduct by ascribing a negative value to that spouse’s contributions, that was only to be done if that spouse not only failed to contribute to the marriage, but also engaged in conduct that fundamentally undermined the co-operative partnership and harmed the welfare of the other party (<span class="font-italic">Chan Tin Sun </span>at [27]). Even then, the court must bear in mind that the power to divide matrimonial assets “was never intended to serve a punitive function” and that all factors “must be duly assessed and considered in a holistic manner” (<span class="font-italic">Chan Tin Sun </span>at [28]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 In my view, this was not an appropriate case to apply <span class="font-italic">Chan Tin Sun</span>. That case concerned a wife who “had embarked on a premeditated course of action to inflict harm on the [h]usband by poisoning him over a period of time” (<span class="font-italic">Chan Tin Sun </span>at [54]). In our case, the Husband’s quarrel was that the Wife had made large withdrawals from the accounts, overspent on his credit cards, obtained various injunctions against him and related parties, resulting in him losing his job and suffering severe financial losses.

</div>
</div> True it may be that the Wife could have conducted herself in a more cooperative and constructive manner: she caused his loss of employment while previously having benefitted from his side businesses, overspent on his credit cards, withdrew various large sums from bank accounts, and was not reasonable in refusing to allow the Husband to realise his SIA options. It was pertinent to note, however, that the Husband, on his part, hardly displayed exemplary conduct himself. His own misconduct having caused the deterioration of their relationship, he sought to hide assets from the Wife, engaged in retaliatory pad-locking of the matrimonial home, and terminated many of what must in today’s society be considered as necessities<span class="font-italic">, </span>such as his utilities account with the authorities in respect of electricity and water for the matrimonial home, the Wife and son’s mobile phone lines, and the residence’s land line. The injunctions had been granted by various courts based on legal principles. There had, at that material time as assessed by the court, been a real risk of dissipation of assets – which to some extent actualised, as I explained above. In essence, both Husband and Wife were engaged in a mutually destructive exercise. The 80:20 ratio I arrived at was thus made with reference to <span class="font-italic">both</span> their misconduct. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Weighted average ratio</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Assuming equal weightage between the direct and indirect contribution ratios, the final distribution ratio would be 57.5:42.5 in favour of the Husband. Of relevance here was the Court of Appeal’s guidance in <span class="font-italic">ANJ v ANK </span>[2015] 4 SLR 1043<span class="font-italic"> </span>that an uplift to a party’s distribution ratio may be relevant for the purpose of an adverse inference (at [29]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 In the present case, <span class="font-italic">both</span> parties submitted that I should draw an adverse inference against the other from the other’s failure to give proper disclosure of his/her assets. I have gone through the various accounts and assets above, and where relevant, added specific sums back into the pool. That which remained to be accounted were the Husband’s shares in [P] Pte Ltd, for which I held that an adverse inference was necessary. To this end, there was no figure on a specific sum that may be accurately quantified: this was a private company and it was conceded that the paper transactions over the shares were completely sham transactions. The lawyer’s letter adduced by [B] suggested that the Husband was trying to prevent the Wife from laying claim to the contracts coming into [P] Pte Ltd. It was clear, however, that the Wife’s conduct in taking out the injunctions against the Husband and his related parties had a material adverse impact on the company’s financial status. As such, the Husband’s contention was that the company was now not worth anything. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 In my judgment, it was appropriate to adjust the final distribution ratio to 50:50 for equal division between the parties. The 7.5% uplift to the Wife came to around $186,215.27. This was a conservative sum and it was less than the total paper value used in the three sham transactions. Equal division was also just and equitable given the parties’ history with each other: they would share in the losses they had caused by way of shrinkage of the matrimonial pool equally.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Mechanics as to asset division and maintenance arrears</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 On a 50:50 division of the matrimonial assets, the Wife’s half was around $1,241,435.13. Ordinarily, the sums held in her name would be deducted. In this case, however, she had credit of $229,500 more in maintenance arrears. Deducting the arrears from the sum held under her name ($788,198.91) came to $558,698.91. Deducting this derived value, in turn, from the 50% share of the matrimonial assets that she should receive ($1,241,435.12) came to $682,736.22. This was the sum that should be transferred from the Husband’s name to the Wife’s. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 To give effect to this determination, the sum held by OA of $111,618.54 should be transferred to the Wife. The remaining sum of $571,117.68 was to be transferred from the Husband’s CPF Ordinary Account to the Wife’s Ordinary CPF account. This should allow a sufficient remainder in the Husband’s CPF Ordinary and Special Accounts to maintain the minimum sum of around $160,000 after such deduction.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Maintenance for the Wife</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">History of the maintenance orders</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 The history of maintenance applications and payments in this case was rather confused. Interim maintenance was first ordered on 18 July 2011, under which the Husband was to pay $2,500 for the wife and $1,500 for their son per month with effect from 1 February 2011. In addition, the interim order provided that $36,000 was to be paid by the Husband to the Wife’s and son’s joint account for the maintenance during the period from 1 February to 1 October 2011 (9 months). In this regard, however, only $32,000 was in fact paid. Thus, the Wife applied to enforce this order on 20 June 2012.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 In the meantime, the Husband was declared bankrupt on 7 June 2012. On this basis, he applied to vary the maintenance order on 19 July 2012, in the midst of enforcement proceedings by the Wife. On 16 August 2012, a consent order was made, varying the initial interim order, providing that the parties agreed that the arrears as at (and including) August 2012 amounted to $44,000, and that these arrears and the balance of $3,500 per month payable from September 2012 onwards would be accumulated and dealt with at the ancillaries hearing. For the time being, the Husband was to continue to pay $500 per month for the son’s maintenance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 After the Court of Appeal released its judgment in <span class="font-italic">AXM</span><span class="font-italic"> v AXO</span> [2014] 2 SLR 705 (“<span class="font-italic">AXM</span>”), making clear that a final maintenance order could not be backdated, the Husband applied on 20 August 2014 to rescind or vary the interim maintenance order that had initially been granted on 18 July 2011 and thereafter varied on 16 August 2012 (“Rescission Application”). The Rescission Application, <span class="font-italic">vide</span>, MSS 380/2014, pursuant to the Husband’s application on 22 January 2015 and an order of the Deputy Registrar, was on 26 January 2015 fixed to be heard together with the ancillary matters. At that time, parties envisaged a hearing on their ancillary matters in the Family Court. Subsequently, after hearing dates had been fixed at the Family Court on 8 August 2016, the Wife’s solicitors asserted that the pool of assets exceeded $5m. The ancillary matters were thus transferred to the High Court by direction dated 12 August 2016. The Rescission Application did not appear to have been transferred with the rest of the case to the High Court, even though the High Court may, based on s 2(a) of the WC, hear matters under Part VIII of the WC. Nevertheless, I had power under s 12(2) of the Family Justice Act (No. 27 of 2014) (“FJA”) to deal with the Husband’s Rescission Application, and did so exercise accordingly.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 In terms of the substance of the Rescission Application, the Husband sought a rescission of the interim maintenance order as amended, and further relied on <span class="font-italic">AXM </span>for the court’s power to backdate such a rescission order made under s 118 of the WC. In contrast, the Wife took a curious factual position in her submissions that the Rescission Application had been withdrawn after a mediation session between the parties.

The Court of Appeal went on to state, however, that <span class="font-italic">if a </span><span class="font-italic">summons had been filed under s 118 of the WC</span>, which allows a court to vary or rescind any existing order for maintenance, that could be used to rescind or vary the interim order under s 113(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), and there was “no reason in language, principle, or logic why the variation of a maintenance order made pursuant to either limb of s 113 could not be made to apply retrospectively” (at [26]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 In the present case, after first obtaining the amendment to the interim maintenance order by consent on 16 August 2012, the Husband applied to rescind the interim maintenance order on 20 August 2014, and thereafter sought to defer the hearing of the Rescission Application until the substantive ancillaries hearing. This was necessary, according to the Husband, because the proper interaction between interim and final maintenance orders only became clear post-<span class="font-italic">AXM</span>. Until <span class="font-italic">AXM</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the Husband had thought that any interim maintenance order which was entered into by consent could be superseded by the final maintenance order that would eventually be made – his objective had thus been for the ancillary matters court to <span class="font-italic">backdate</span> its maintenance order at that end point and override the prior interim orders.

Section 118 of the WC provides a mechanism for the variation or rescission of the maintenance order on narrowly defined conditions; it is not a bookmark that parties may place on any interim maintenance order made under s 113(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) so that they may later revisit it. As such, applications under s 118 should generally be heard without undue delay. If there has been a change of circumstances, the applicant ought to prove its extent. In this case, the Husband’s deferral of the Rescission Application left the Wife and the son in an undesirable state of limbo. In these circumstances, it would be too prejudicial to the Wife and the son to rescind or vary now the 16 August 2012 interim maintenance order. The better approach would be to take into consideration the intervening bankruptcy when making a decision as to the final maintenance orders going forward under s 113(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the WC, which I did as explained below. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Quantum of maintenance to be ordered</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 The Wife sought a lump sum maintenance of $2.3m,

While the Husband’s bankruptcy had been annulled, he adduced evidence that he had trouble finding gainful employment. He was blacklisted by most local airlines when he was terminated by SIA in 2011. In mid-2013, he acquired a glucose tolerance deficiency (a precursor to diabetes) and suffered from a cervical disc disease affecting the vertebrae around the neck area, which caused pain and numbness in his left thumb and index fingers.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 In my view, a no maintenance order was appropriate on the facts of this case for several reasons. First, as I have explained, rather than rescind or vary the interim maintenance sum, the better approach in this particular case is for the court simply to take the intervening circumstances into consideration in deciding the final order. This should be done in the following way. Parties agreed that as at January 2017, the maintenance arrears stood at $229,500. If a court had considered the issue of variation/rescission in a timely manner after the Husband’s Rescission Application was filed, it would likely have ordered a downward variation rather than a total rescission under s 118 of the WC. Taking this at half the sum, the remainder half sum would have been a sufficient lump sum maintenance for the Wife, allowing her to weather the transition of divorce. Second, the history of the interaction and litigation between the parties in this case, as well as the current employment and financial status of the Husband, suggest that it would be best if they were able to have a clean break. Third, I was of the view that this order, coupled with the orders as to division of matrimonial assets, provide, in the round, sufficiently for the Wife. The court’s power to order maintenance is supplementary to the court’s power to divide matrimonial assets (see <span class="font-italic">ATE v ATD and another appeal </span>[2016] SGCA 2 at [31]–[33]). The cash sum from the OA will ease the transition period immediately following my orders, and the CPF sum will look to her longer term financial security. The evidence also showed that she had withdrawn almost $500,000 prior to IJ and would have had the benefit of the use of those sums in the intervening years. In the circumstances, I ordered no further maintenance for the Wife.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Orders for the son</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 Counsel for both parties agreed that the son was 20 years old at the time of my order.

</div> I realised in the course of writing these grounds, however, and regrettably, that at the time of the judgment, the son was two days past his 21st birthday. In view of s 122 of the WC, these orders ought not to have been made. On the basis that the son was 20, I preferred a no custody order for the son, over a joint custody order, in line with guidance from the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">CX v CY</span> <span class="font-italic">(minor; custody and access) </span>[2015] 3 SLR 690<span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [18]-[19]). This was because the son was serving in National Service and was, <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">hypothesi</span>, close to the age of majority. Care and control was ordered for the Wife, with liberal access to be arranged directly between the son and the Husband. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 Regarding maintenance, $500 per month for the son’s maintenance was ordered to continue until the son finishes his tertiary education. As the son had not yet decided on his college choice between the two local universities for admission in 2018, a specific sum for his tertiary education was too remote at present. It was envisaged that counsel would make a future application, and he was to ascertain whether and how a CPF order might be made in due course for the Husband’s CPF to be utilised for the son’s tertiary education fees. In the circumstances, while maintenance may be ordered in respect of a child over the age of 21 who is serving full-time National Service, in view of the approach of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Thery</span><span class="font-italic"> Patrice Roger v Tan Chye Tee</span> [2014] SGCA 20 (at [48]-[50]), other recourse is necessary and the son should consider making an application under s 69 of the WC.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Costs</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 In this case, both Husband and Wife asked for costs.

The OA requested rectification of the numbers. At the same time, despite the figures having been checked by both counsel prior to judgment, the summation of the assets held in the Wife’s name (which should be $788,198.91 rather than $727,281.01) and total amount of maintenance arrears (which should be $229,500 rather than $220,000) were inaccurate, causing arithmetical errors in the calculations relevant to the asset allocation. These clerical errors were rectified under Rule 427 of the Family Justice Rules (S 813/2014) (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure 2017, </span><span class="font-italic">Vol 1</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2017) at para 20/11/1, which deals with O 20 r 11 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed), a provision that is <span class="font-italic">in</span> <span class="font-italic">pari</span><span class="font-italic"> materia</span> with Rule 427).
