In the absence of restrictive covenants negotiated and agreed by the employee for the legitimate protection of the employer, there is nothing to stop the employee from doing so. The employer must simply adapt and find a replacement. The question may arise, however, of whether the employee has taken confidential information of the employer for use in the new business. In the present case, the employee was indeed very good at his job, having built up experience with his employer in procurement for drop shipping of veterinary and other pet products. The principal issue in this case is whether he had simply honed a skill and legitimately acquired knowledge that he was entitled to carry with him, or instead was wrongfully exploiting confidential information of his previous employer.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The plaintiff is Asia Petworld Pte Ltd, a Singapore-based drop shipper of pet products. The plaintiff procures products from authorised dealers, generally for reduced prices, and then sells those products to online retailers. When a customer of the online retailer places an order on its website, the order is relayed to the plaintiff who fulfils the order by sending the product directly to the customer.

However, it is agreed that the plaintiff started paying the first defendant’s salary and making payments to the first defendant’s CPF account in January 2015. It is also agreed that from that point onwards, the first defendant was an employee of the plaintiff.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 It is worth setting out the plaintiff’s business model in detail. The manufacturers of the pet products which the plaintiff deals with will only sell them to authorised dealers. Thus, the plaintiff acquires pet products from these authorised dealers. There are different authorised dealers in different countries, and the different authorised dealers sell the pet products at different prices. Online retailers prefer to acquire pet products from authorised dealers with lower prices but are not always able to do so. This allows the plaintiff to interpose itself between authorised dealer and online retailer.

</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 As an illustration, let us assume that the authorised dealer in Country A sells pet products at a lower price than the authorised dealer in Country B. An online retailer in Country B would therefore prefer to acquire its products from the authorised dealer in Country A. However, due to the regulations in Country B, it is not able to import a large quantity of products from Country A. The online retailer wants to purchase a large quantity, because the price of the products decreases as the quantity increases. In order to do so, the online retailer from Country B approaches the plaintiff, who, being in Singapore, is able to receive the products wholesale from Country A. The plaintiff receives the products wholesale from the authorised dealer in Country A, packs them into smaller individual packages, and sends them directly to the retail customers who have placed orders with the online retailer in Country B.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 In this business model, the retail customer benefits because they are able to acquire products at lower prices. The online retailer benefits because they are able to sell the products at lower prices than their competition, who purchase their products from authorised dealers in their own country. The plaintiff benefits because they charge the online retailer a fulfilment fee on each order.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 The plaintiff refers to the cost at which it acquires products from authorised dealers as the “true cost”. In order to account for various factors such as cost of freight and exchange rate fluctuations, the plaintiff applies a multiplier to true cost to obtain a figure which it calls “landed cost”. Finally, the fee that is charged to the online retailer is the landed cost plus a further “fulfilment fee”. The fulfilment fee varies based on the volume of orders that the online retailer places with the plaintiff. The larger the volume, the lower the unit fulfilment fee.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 The suppliers of the plaintiff are the authorised dealers. The customers of the plaintiff are the online retailers, who use the plaintiff’s services to send the pet products directly from the plaintiff to the individuals who ultimately receive the pet products. SNPC was one of the online retailers in Australia that made use of the plaintiff’s services. Another online retailer that was responsible for a significant part of the plaintiff’s business was PetBucket.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 The first defendant was the warehouse manager for the plaintiff. He was responsible for overseeing the process whereby products were received wholesale from an authorised dealer in a foreign country, packed into smaller packages, and then sent to retail customers in a different foreign country to fulfil orders which had been conveyed to the plaintiff by online retailers.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 On 1 February 2021, the first defendant e-mailed his letter of resignation to Ms Marhalim, stating that his last day of work would be 28 February 2021.

The plaintiff contends that first defendant would only have done this with such confidence if he had used the Information to persuade the plaintiff’s customers to transfer their business to his new company, the second defendant. Also, there was a general uptrend in SNPC’s business with the plaintiff until it disappeared completely when the second defendant was formed. The only explanation for this sudden change is that it was never possible for SNPC to create its own supplier until it finally was in possession of the Information through the first defendant.

The plaintiff’s pleaded case is that its loss arises from the loss of PetBucket and SNPC’s business. However, the defendants contend that both companies stopped business with the plaintiff for commercial reasons which had nothing to do with either of the defendants. SNPC decided to leave the plaintiff because of the issues that it had with the service provided by the plaintiff. The same was true of PetBucket. In any case, PetBucket could not have left the plaintiff as a result of a conversation with the first defendant in February 2021, because the evidence shows that they continued doing business with the plaintiff until August 2021. PetBucket left the plaintiff because, like SNPC, they had found a better alternative (which, in PetBucket’s case, was not even the second defendant).

</div> On 4 April 2022, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Lim Oon Kuin</span><span class="font-italic"> and others v Rajah &amp; Tann Singapore LLP and another appeal </span>[2022] SGCA 29 (“<span class="font-italic">Lim Oon Kuin</span>”), at [40] to [42], clarified that the modified approach outlined in <span class="font-italic">I-Admin</span> (and described below at [37]) was limited to cases of unauthorised acquisition.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 In light of <span class="font-italic">Lim Oon </span><span class="font-italic">Kuin</span>, I invited counsel to make further submissions on this point. I also invited submissions on an English case, namely <span class="font-italic">E Worsley &amp; Co Ltd v Cooper </span>[1939] 1 All ER 290 (“<span class="font-italic">E Worsley</span>”), in particular pages 307 to 309, concerning an ex-employee’s use of his knowledge of suppliers obtained in his previous employ.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Both counsel duly filed submissions on these two cases.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issues to be determined</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 I will address the issues in the following order: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) What was the nature of the first defendant’s duty of confidentiality to the plaintiff?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Did the Information possess the necessary quality of confidence?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) If so, did the first defendant and/or the second defendant misuse the Information?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Did the defendants conspire to injure the plaintiff?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Did the first defendant breach his duty of good faith and fidelity to the plaintiff during his employment?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) What loss did the defendants cause to the plaintiff by their breaches?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) Should there be an inquiry as to damages in respect of the interim injunction?</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 1: What was the nature of the first defendant’s duty of confidentiality to the plaintiff?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The interplay between an express contractual duty of confidentiality and obligations of confidentiality in equity has been explained by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Adinop Co Ltd v Rovithai Ltd</span> [2019] 2 SLR 808, at [37] to [41]. Briefly, it can be summarised as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) An express contractual confidentiality obligation is to be construed in accordance with the usual principles of contractual interpretation to determine the extent of confidentiality obligations.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The express contractual obligation may be more extensive than an equitable duty, for example where certain information is agreed to be treated as confidential even though it would not be so treated if considered only under equitable principles. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) In general, where the express contractual obligation is more limited than that which may arise under equity, the court will not impose those additional or more extensive obligations in equity. Ordinarily, the parties will be viewed as having defined or limited the confidentiality obligations between them by agreement. However, this is not always the case, and there may be occasions where equity may still step in to impose a duty of confidence to give force to the demands of conscience.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Where there is no express term in the contract (or no contract at all), equity may impose a duty of confidence whenever a person receives information in circumstances importing an obligation of confidentiality. Three basic elements must be met:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) the information must possess the necessary quality of confidence;</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) the information must have been imparted or received in circumstances such as to give rise to an obligation of confidentiality; and </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) there must have been unauthorised use and detriment to the party who disclosed the information to the recipient who misused it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 A modified approach is now adopted in respect of the third element, following <span class="font-italic">I-Admin</span> at [61] and <span class="font-italic">Lim Oon Kuin</span> at [40] to [42], namely that where confidential information has been accessed or acquired without a plaintiff’s knowledge or consent, an action for breach of confidence is presumed and the legal burden is then on the defendant to prove that its conscience was unaffected, for example because it came across the information by accident, was unaware of its confidential nature or believed that there was a strong public interest in disclosing it. It is only where the acquisition of confidential information is unauthorised that the shift in the burden of proof is triggered: <span class="font-italic">Lim Oon Kuin </span>at [41].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 The relationship of employer and employee, which entails good faith, loyalty and fidelity, establishes the circumstances required by the second element, at [36(d)(ii)] above. The first defendant, through his counsel (although not during cross examination), rightly conceded that even if there were no express duty of confidentiality, he would owe the plaintiff a duty of confidentiality pursuant to his duty of good faith and fidelity as the plaintiff’s employee.

</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 As it happens, on the issue of confidentiality, the Singpet Contract defines confidential information in an inclusive fashion and in general terms that adds little, if anything, to the implied duty of confidentiality. None of the identified items of Information were specified in the Singpet Contract, but they would potentially be covered by the sweep up provision of “any other information that will affect the Company’s competitive position” (see [20] above). In order to come within the sweep up provision, such information would have to possess the necessary quality of confidence in much the same way as required for the imposition of a duty of confidence in equity.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Clause 9.3 of the Singpet Contract also provides that the obligation to maintain confidentiality applies after his employment ended, but this was only “until such time that the information is no longer confidential”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Thus, it would not make a difference to my analysis if the first defendant’s employment by the plaintiff was on the same terms and conditions of service as his employment by Singpet, by virtue of a transfer of Singpet’s business to the plaintiff within the meaning of Employment Act s 18A. For completeness, however, given the absence of documentation of the transfer of the business and the transfer of the first defendant’s employment, the plaintiff has failed to discharge its burden of proof that it employed the first defendant on the same terms and conditions as those in the Singpet Contract. I therefore proceed on the basis that the first defendant was subject to an equitable duty of confidence derived from his implied duty of good faith and fidelity, and discuss whether the plaintiff has established the elements set out at [36(d)(i)] and [36(d)(iii)] above.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 2: Did the Information possess the necessary quality of confidence?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 I start with two observations about information that possesses the quality of confidence. First, not all information that an employee is obliged to keep confidential during his employment is information that is protectable as confidential information after he ceases to be employed. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Tang Siew Choy and others v Ce</span><span class="font-italic">rtact Pte Ltd </span>[1993] 1 SLR(R) 835 at [16] cited the following remarks from <span class="font-italic">Faccenda Chicken Ltd v Fowler</span> [1986] 1 All ER 617:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The implied term which imposes an obligation on the employee as to his conduct after the determination of the employment is more restricted in its scope than that which imposes a general duty of good faith. It is clear that the obligation not to use or disclose information may cover … information which is of a sufficiently high degree of confidentiality as to amount to a trade secret.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The obligation does not extend, however, to cover all information which is given to or acquired by the employee while in his employment, and in particular may not cover information which is only ‘confidential’ in the sense that an unauthorized disclosure of such information to a third party while the employment subsisted would be a clear breach of the duty of good faith.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The same distinction is to be found in <span class="font-italic">E Worsley &amp; Co Ltd v Cooper</span> [1939] 1 All ER 290, where it was held that the defendant was entitled, after he had ceased to be employed, to make use of his knowledge of the source of the paper supplied to his previous employer. In our view it is quite plain that this knowledge was nevertheless ‘confidential’ in the sense that it would have been a breach of the duty of good faith for the employee, while the employment subsisted, to have used it for his own purposes or to have disclosed it to a competitor of his employer.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Secondly, the knowledge and experience that an employee acquires during his employment is not protectable confidential information. In <span class="font-italic">Asia Business Forum Pte Ltd v Long Ai Sin and another </span>[2003] 4 SLR(R) 658 (“<span class="font-italic">Asia Business Forum</span>”) at [15] and [17], the court agreed with Farwell LJ’s remarks in <span class="font-italic">Sir W C Leng &amp; Co Limited v Andrews </span>[1909] 1 Ch 763 at 773: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[An employer cannot] prevent his employee from using the skill and knowledge in his trade or profession which he has learnt in the course of his employment by means of directions or instructions from the employer. … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 With these observations in mind, I will assess whether the Information possesses the necessary quality of confidence.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Supplier information</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The first contention of the plaintiff is that its supplier information possesses the necessary quality of confidence. By supplier information, the plaintiff simply means “who the suppliers are”.

</div>
</div>
</div> I therefore gather that the plaintiff’s case is that the confidential information is the information of where one can find the lowest price for a product.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The difficulty with the plaintiff’s position is that this supply chain information was simply information acquired by the first defendant over the years in the course of working for the plaintiff. It is not the plaintiff’s case that it keeps a list of customers which the first defendant took with him when he left. While the plaintiff referred to the CLD in its SOC, no evidence was adduced to suggest that the first defendant took such a list from the plaintiff, nor was any such list produced in evidence. Thus, the plaintiff’s case on this point rests solely on information in the first defendant’s head which he acquired through the course of his employment. This is not information that possesses the quality of confidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In <span class="font-italic">E Worsley </span>(which is cited in the passage at [42] above), the defendants were former employees of the plaintiff company, a firm of paper merchants. One of the defendants had prepared a price list which contained the names of various types of papers while he worked for the plaintiff. While the names of the mills were kept secret and were not included in this price list, the defendant knew which mill each type of paper was from. The court decided that the information concerning the mills from which the papers sold by the plaintiff came and the price list itself were not confidential information or trade secrets. Two of the court’s reasons at 307 and 308 are especially relevant: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The information as to the source from which the various papers came was information which was in Mr Cooper's head, and which formed part of his knowledge acquired in the course of the business.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [the] information [was] of that kind, which was not information which the paper merchant would desire to be spread about to his competitors, but it was not, I think, in the nature of a trade secret, in the way in which that phrase is used in the case. It is quite clear that the defendants were entitled to stock the same papers as the plaintiffs did, and it cannot be any breach of duty, I think, if an ex-employee, knowing the source of a particular paper, goes to that particular mill and says: “I want to buy some.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The plaintiff submits that its business model is unique, and that it is unique because this supply chain information is so confidential. The plaintiff relies on this argument to distinguish <span class="font-italic">E Worsley</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>from the present case.

</div>
</div> I cannot accept this argument. There could be a variety of reasons why a business has no direct competitors, and only one of them is that the business possesses confidential information that is not available to anybody else. Moreover, drop shipping that takes advantage of differential pricing in different geographies is not unusual. That the first defendant did not name any specific competitor does not mean that there are no other companies using this strategy in relation to the supply of pet products. Based on my analysis above, the supply chain information does not possess the necessary quality of confidence such that it was protectable after the first defendant ceased to be employed by the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">True costs</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The true cost of a pet product is simply the price that the supplier charges the plaintiff.

</div> As I have concluded above at [48], neither the identity of the plaintiff’s suppliers nor the information as to which supplier provided the lowest price is confidential information.

</div> It is therefore clear that what the plaintiff refers to as confidential is not the formula itself, but the factor or percentage by which it multiplies true cost to obtain landed cost. Again, this information is not confidential. The knowledge acquired by the first defendant about how to account for factors such as foreign exchange fluctuations, price variations between suppliers and cost of freight in arriving at landed cost would be knowledge and experience acquired by him in the course of his work. As per <span class="font-italic">Asia Business Forum </span>at [43] above, this is not protectable confidential information.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Fulfilment fee rate</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The fulfilment fee is the percentage of the landed cost which is charged to the plaintiff’s customers per order.

</div> This is a widely used and commonly understood system. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 The fulfilment fee rate is no different from the general pricing rates of any business selling into a market. That its unit rate reduces the higher the volume of sales is neither unusual nor special. When a salesman leaves a company, he may well be able to remember how that company priced its products. While it would be wrong for him to take with him unpublished price lists, he is not prevented from using his knowledge and recollection of company’s prices in his new business. Thus, the fulfilment fee rate is also not information possessing the requisite quality of confidence. It would be a different matter if the plaintiff alleged that the first defendant printed out documents which set out its fulfilment fee schedule and took them with him when his employment ended. However, there is no evidence that this happened, nor was it pleaded.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Thus, the plaintiff has failed to point to any information that the first defendant took or had with him that bears the necessary quality of confidence. Returning to my first observation at [42] above, it is evident that the Information is confidential only in the sense that it would be a breach of the first defendant’s duty of good faith to reveal it to a competitor while he was still an employee and such information was current and of value. The Information is not confidential in that it constitutes trade secrets which are protectable after he ceased to be an employee. Also, because there is no evidence of documents or information being taken from the plaintiff by the first defendant at the end of his employment, the Information is simply knowledge and experience in his head that he legitimately acquired while working for the plaintiff. As per my observation at [43], this is not information possessing the requisite quality of confidence.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 3: If so, did the first defendant and/or the second defendant misuse the Information?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Given my conclusion on the second issue, this issue, which is the third element in an action for breach of confidence, is moot.

First, the evidence shows that the first defendant had found Mr Wiradharma a difficult boss and had wanted to leave the plaintiff’s employ for some time.

Thus, to adopt the colloquial phrase, it was a push factor and not a pull factor that operated in relation to the first defendant’s departure from the plaintiff.

In fact, she did not accept his invitation and remained with the plaintiff for some time, although she had left by the time of the trial.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 I also accept Ms Jagruti’s evidence that the first defendant told her he was reaching out to other customers of the plaintiff to inform them of his departure, and did boast that they would move their business to him.

</div> Such  conduct in relation to customers suggests that he probably also informed suppliers to the plaintiff of his planned departure.

It does not follow from the fact that the first defendant spoke to PetBucket prior to his departure that he then, or at any other time, provided PetBucket with the Information. In fact, there was no reason for the first defendant to do so. If his intention was to persuade PetBucket to give their business to his new company, he would not want to give PetBucket the information that would enable PetBucket to undertake its own procurement, taking advantage of geographical pricing differences. For this reason, counsel for the plaintiff did not put his case to the first defendant on the basis of a deliberate disclosure to PetBucket but on the basis that he “inadvertently leaked the confidential information of APW to PetBucket”.

It is hard to see how, during the conversation, the first defendant could have gone into such detail as to give PetBucket a primer on how to compete with the plaintiff. Putting the case on the basis of inadvertency additionally diminishes the force of any argument that so much of the Information that resided in the first defendant’s head was significant or detailed. PetBucket would need to be told what to buy from whom and at what price, as well as how to then charge customers for the service. I find that, at most, the first defendant told PetBucket that whatever he had done for them as an employee of the plaintiff he would be able to do for them in his new company.

But it has not been proved by the plaintiff that the first defendant used any specific item of information, such as what the plaintiff paid for a particular product in one market for drop shipping into another market, for the second defendant’s benefit or to the plaintiff’s detriment. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Additional observations</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 I would add two further observations. First, any knowledge the first defendant carried in his head concerning the prices paid or charged by the plaintiff would have quickly lost its relevance. Markets are not static. This applies both to the markets for purchase and sale of the products and to currency exchange. The relative movement of currencies would obviously play a part in this kind of arbitrage. That is why, even where an employer legitimately protects itself by a restrictive covenant in contracts of employment, these are invariably limited in time. Here, there were no restrictive covenants, and yet the plaintiff has proceeded as if the passage of time has no impact on the utility of the Information, even obtaining an interim injunction that did not include any time limit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Secondly, it is telling that even though Mr Wiradharma knew from a message sent to him by Ms Jagruti on 3 February 2021

That would be the natural immediate step if he had a genuine concern about the possibility of misuse of confidential information. Nor did the plaintiff immediately commence any legal proceedings to protect the Information. Instead, proceedings appear to have been triggered when the first defendant made a police report concerning the plaintiff’s failure, despite repeated requests, to cancel the poisons licence that was in his name for the plaintiff’s business (the “poisons license”), as he needed to obtain a new poisons licence for the second defendant and could not do so because he remained the plaintiff’s licence holder.

While the fact that proceedings were commenced belatedly and for questionable motives does not necessarily mean that they are without merit, such conduct can be material to how the evidence is to be assessed. In this case, the questions for the court include how significant the Information was and how likely it was to be misused. The plaintiff’s own approach in not taking steps to protect itself at the relevant time strengthens the inference (based on the evidence) that the Information was neither significant nor likely to be misused. In other words, if the Information was truly significant and the risks of misuse were truly real and potentially damaging to the plaintiff, the plaintiff would not have waited until after the first defendant’s police report before taking steps to protect itself. It would, at a minimum, have immediately restricted the first defendant’s access to the alleged confidential information upon Mr Wiradharma’s receiving Ms Jagruti’s message or confronted the first defendant with a view to obtaining specific assurances.

One is that these conversations and actions of the first defendant happened prior to incorporation of the second defendant. This fact drove counsel for the plaintiff to rely on s 41 of the Companies Act 1967 (2020 Rev Ed), which permits ratification by a company of contracts or other transactions entered into on its behalf prior to incorporation.

</div> Section 41(1) provides:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Any contract or other transaction purporting to be entered into by a company prior to its formation or by any person on behalf of a company prior to its formation may be ratified by the company after its formation and thereupon the company becomes bound by and entitled to the benefit thereof as if it had been in existence at the date of the contract or other transaction and had been a party thereto.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 I do not agree that an overt act relied on for the purpose of conspiracy can be ratified in reliance on this section unless it is the entry into a contract or transaction purportedly by or on the company’s behalf. The acts complained of in this case were not entry into contracts or transactions, but only at most solicitation for the future that never resulted in any contract or transaction with the second defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 There is another fundamental problem with the claim in conspiracy to injure. The pleadings do not make clear whether the plaintiff’s case is that there was an unlawful means conspiracy to injure or a lawful means conspiracy to injure. In any case, the former would fail because there were no unlawful means. A departing employee who suggests to other employees that they consider coming to work for his new company or informs customers that he is setting up his own business and hopes for their support after he has left his employer is not breaching his contract of employment, as I explain further in the next section at [78]–[79].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 As for a lawful means conspiracy, one necessary element is the predominant purpose to injure the plaintiff: <span class="font-italic">Quah Kay Tee v Ong and Co Pte Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[1996] 3 SLR(R) 637 at [45]. Notwithstanding that the first defendant had come to dislike Mr Wiradharma, I find that his expressions of loyalty to the plaintiff in his email of 9 March 2021 to Ms Marhalim were sincere. His intention in resigning and starting the second defendant with Mr Foley was entirely legitimate, namely to further his own career. As for Mr Foley who was the other director of the second defendant, it would be quite fanciful to suggest that he shared any purpose of injuring the plaintiff, as opposed to proceeding in the best interests of the second defendant and SNPC.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 5: Did the first defendant breach his duty of good faith and fidelity to the plaintiff during his employment?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Had the defendant disclosed the Information to PetBucket while he remained employed by the plaintiff, he would have been in breach of his duty of good faith and fidelity. However, I have found at [70] above that this did not take place. The question that remains is, was it a breach of the first defendant’s duty of good faith and fidelity to incorporate the second defendant during his notice period and to register the second defendant’s website the day before he gave notice of his resignation?

The Court of Appeal also noted at [67] that it is a question of fact “whether or not steps taken by an employee can be considered as preparatory to future competition (which is permissible), or instead constitute actual competitive activity (which is <span class="font-italic">not</span> permissible)” [emphasis in original].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 The pleaded conduct of incorporating the second defendant and registering its website would not of itself cross the line into competitive activity. The suggestion that the first defendant was waiting for a shipment is questionable, but this point was not pleaded nor was the first defendant cross-examined on it. As the evidence shows that the second defendant’s only customer was Mr Foley’s SNPC, it would seem to follow that SNPC had already placed an order with the second defendant prior to the first defendant’s last day with the plaintiff. At the same time, the shipment would only arrive after the first defendant’s last day with the plaintiff, and it would only be upon its arrival that the first defendant as an employee of the second defendant would do the actual drop shipping on SNPC’s behalf. In any event, as it was not pleaded or taken up in cross-examination, I say nothing further about it.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 6: What loss did the defendants cause to the plaintiff by their breaches?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 If I had found for the plaintiff on any of the earlier issues, the question would then be, what profits had it lost as a result of the defendants’ conduct? The evidence adduced by the plaintiff on damages was limited, and even that was unclear its purport and effect. I am also of the view that Mr Foley (and thus SNPC) was dissatisfied with the plaintiff’s service and would likely not have continued to use the plaintiff if the first defendant had simply left its employ, without starting or joining the second defendant. In determining loss of profits, the correct comparator would be the profits the plaintiff would have been able to make without the first defendant. It would be wrong to assess damages against a projection of profits dependent on the continued assistance of the first defendant. This is because the first defendant was not obligated to continue working for the plaintiff. He was entitled to resign and remove his skills from the service of the plaintiff. Additionally, in this case, he had already decided prior to the alleged misuse of confidential information that he could no longer work for Mr Wiradharma (see [59]–[60] above). However, as I have found against the plaintiff on liability, this issue is moot and I say nothing further on it.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 7: Should there be an inquiry as to damages in respect of the interim injunction? </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 The plaintiff conceded on the second day of the hearing that its interim injunction, notwithstanding that it contained no end date prior to trial, ought not to be made permanent.

However, it was not sought on the basis of any restrictive covenant (none such ever having been agreed), but on the ground that such activities on the first defendant’s part would entail the use of the plaintiff’s confidential information, thus affording him an illegitimate advantage if not restrained.

The defendants have taken the position that the second defendant was not set up to be a direct competitor of the plaintiff

</div> Thus, the defendants have not shown an arguable case that they have suffered loss as a result of the interim injunction. Accordingly, I discharge the interim injunction but decline to grant an order for an inquiry as to damages, and consequently release the plaintiff from its undertaking as to damage.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Ultimately, this dispute was something of a storm in the proverbial tea cup: whipped up by slights, resentments and general animosity between the main protagonists. The first defendant did not remove lists or other documents from the plaintiff. The knowledge and skill that he had developed in his time with the plaintiff was something he was entitled to carry with him. I dismiss the plaintiff’s claim against both defendants in its entirety. I will hear counsel on costs.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Philip Jeyaretnam <br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Nandwani Manoj Prakash and Quah Chun En Joel (Gabriel Law Corporation) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Narayanan Vijya Kumar (Vijay &amp; Co) for the defendants.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>

Thus, while an employee is not entitled to take with him confidential price lists of his employer when his employment ends, he is entitled to use his recollection and knowledge of those prices in his new business: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[43]</span>,<span class="font-weight-bold"> [53]</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">[54]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background to the dispute</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">1 The plaintiff, Asia Petworld Pte Ltd, was a Singapore company involved in the drop shipping of pet products. The first defendant, Mr Sivabalan s/o Ramasami, was a former employee of the plaintiff. He was the plaintiff’s warehouse manager for around six years.  </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">2 On 1 February 2021, the first defendant tendered his resignation. Thereafter, he set up the second defendant, Global Pet Company Pte Ltd, with Mr John Robert Foley (“Mr Foley”). Mr Foley was a director and shareholder in Sierra Nevada Pet Company (“SNPC”), a major customer of the plaintiff. After the second defendant was set up, SNPC stopped using the services of the plaintiff and started using those of the second defendant instead.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">3 Before the end of his employment by the plaintiff on 28 February 2021, the first defendant told some of the plaintiff’s employees and customers that he was leaving the plaintiff and setting up a new business (the second defendant). One of the customers that the first defendant spoke to was PetBucket. By August 2021, the volume of orders from PetBucket to the plaintiff had reduced significantly.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">4 The plaintiff alleged that the defendants had misused its confidential information (the “Information”) and had conspired to injure it. The plaintiff also alleged that the first defendant breached his implied duty of good faith and fidelity arising from his employment. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The court’s decision </span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">5 The court dismissed the plaintiff’s claims in their entirety. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Breach of confidence</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-italic">The nature of the first defendant’s duty of confidentiality</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">6 The court first considered the legal basis for the first defendant’s duty of confidentiality to the plaintiff. The court held that the first defendant was subject to an equitable duty of confidence, derived from his implied duty of good faith and fidelity as the plaintiff’s employee: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[41]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">7 As per <span class="font-italic">Adinop</span><span class="font-italic"> Co Ltd v Rovithai Ltd </span>[2019] 2 SLR 808, three basic elements must be met in a claim based on an equitable duty of confidence: </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">a. the information must possess the necessary quality of confidence; </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">b. the information must have been imparted or received in circumstances such as to give rise to an obligation of confidentiality; and</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">c. there must have been unauthorised use of the information, and detriment to the party who disclosed the information to the recipient who misused it. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">Where confidential information has been accessed or acquired without a plaintiff’s consent, the legal burden lies on the defendant to prove that its conscience was unaffected. However, as confirmed by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Lim Oon </span><span class="font-italic">Kuin and others v Rajah &amp; Tann Singapore LLP and another appeal </span>[2022] SGCA 29, this shift in the burden of proof only occurs where the acquisition of the confidential information by the defendant was unauthorised: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[36]</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">[37]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">8 Because the first defendant was an employee of the plaintiff, his relationship with the plaintiff entailed good faith, loyalty and fidelity. Thus, the circumstances required by the second element were established: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[38]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">9 The court then considered whether the first and third elements were established.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-italic">Whether the Information bore the necessary quality of confidence</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">10 The court concluded that the Information did not bear the necessary quality of confidence: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[54]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">11 Information relating to the plaintiff’s suppliers did not possess the necessary quality of confidence. The court rejected the plaintiff’s argument that the information of where one can find the lowest price for a product was confidential. This is because the first defendant had acquired that information over the years, in the course of working for the plaintiff. It was not the case that the plaintiff kept a list of customers which the first defendant took with him when he left. The fact that the plaintiff had no competitors did not mean that its supply chain information was confidential: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[46]</span> to <span class="font-weight-bold">[4</span><span class="font-weight-bold">8]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">12 Information relating to the true costs of the plaintiff’s products did not possess the necessary quality of confidence. This was information that could be found with the plaintiff’s suppliers. Given that the information relating to the plaintiff’s suppliers was not confidential, the cost of their products could not be confidential. It could be obtained by simply approaching the suppliers: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[49]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">13 Information relating to the plaintiff’s cost factoring method also did not possess the necessary quality of confidence. The plaintiff claimed that it operated in a price-sensitive industry and that this information could be used to undercut it. However, this did not make the information confidential. This information was knowledge and experience that the first defendant had acquired in the course of his work: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[51]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">14 Finally, information relating to the plaintiff’s fees did not bear the necessary quality of confidence. While it would be wrong for an employee to take with him unpublished price lists when he left his employer, he would not be prevented from using his recollection and knowledge of the employer’s prices in his new business. Here, the plaintiff had not alleged or provided evidence to show that the first defendant had taken documents relating to the plaintiff’s fee schedule when his employment ended: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[53]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-italic">Whether the Information was misused</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">15 Given the court’s conclusion that the Information did not bear the necessary quality of confidence, this issue did not need to be dealt with. However, the court dealt with it briefly: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[55]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">16 The court first held that the burden of proof to show that the first defendant misused the Information remained on the plaintiff. This was because the first defendant had acquired his knowledge of the procurement or sales market over the years, and this was not an unauthorised manner: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[56]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">17 After considering the evidence, the court concluded that the first defendant had not misused the Information in approaching the plaintiff’s customers. The first defendant was unhappy working for the plaintiff and wanted to resign for this reason. While he had boasted to other employees that his new company would take away business from the plaintiff, this did not indicate that he intended to misuse the Information. Rather, he wanted to show that he could succeed outside the plaintiff and put one up over his former boss. Also, SNPC left the plaintiff not because the first defendant provided it with the Information but because it was dissatisfied with the plaintiff’s services: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[59]</span> to <span class="font-weight-bold">[61]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">18 Further, the first defendant did not inadvertently leak the Information to PetBucket. If his intention was to ask PetBucket to give their business to the second defendant, he would not have wanted to give PetBucket the information that would enable it to undertake its own procurement: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[64]</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">[65]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">19 The first defendant also did not misuse the Information for the second defendant’s business. Naturally, he must have drawn on his knowledge and experience acquired over the years in procuring products. However, it was not proven that the first defendant used any specific item of information for the second defendant’s benefit: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[66]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conspiracy to injure the plaintiff</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">20 The court held that the defendants did not conspire to injure the plaintiff. First, the alleged acts of conspiracy occurred before the second defendant was incorporated. The court rejected the plaintiff’s argument that s 41(1) of the Companies Act 1967, which permits ratification of pre-incorporation contracts or other transactions, could be relied on to ratify an overt act for the purpose of conspiracy: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[72]</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">[73]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">21 Further, the plaintiff did not identify whether it was alleging an unlawful means conspiracy or a lawful means conspiracy. For an unlawful means conspiracy, the plaintiff had failed to establish any unlawful means. For a lawful means conspiracy, it was a requirement that there was a predominant purpose to injure the plaintiff. The plaintiff had failed to establish this, given that the first defendant’s intention in resigning and starting the second defendant was to further his own career, and Mr Foley was simply proceeding in the best interests of the second defendant and SNPC: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[74]</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">[75]</span>. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Breach of implied duty of good faith and fidelity</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">22 The first defendant also did not breach his implied duty of good faith and fidelity to the plaintiff during his employment. Preparatory steps to compete with a former employer would not constitute a breach of the duty of good faith and fidelity. Only actual competitive activity was not permissible. The first defendant’s<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>incorporation of the second defendant and registration of its website did not constitute competitive activity: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[76]</span> to <span class="font-weight-bold">[79]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Loss suffered by plaintiff</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">23 The evidence adduced by the plaintiff on damages was limited, and unclear in its purport and effect. The appropriate comparator to assess loss of profits would be the profits that the plaintiff would have been able to make without the first defendant as an employee. This was because the first defendant was not obligated to continue working for the plaintiff. He was entitled to resign and remove his skills from the service of the plaintiff: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[80]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Inquiry as to damages for interim injunction</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">24 The plaintiffs had, on 16 June 2021, obtained an injunction to restrain the defendants from soliciting the plaintiff’s customers and employees. The injunction was sought on the ground that any solicitation of the plaintiff’s customers or employees would entail the use of the plaintiff’s confidential information. The plaintiff failed to establish that the Information was confidential or that it had been misused. Thus, the plaintiff was not justified in seeking and obtaining the injunction. However, the court declined to order an inquiry as to damages in favour of the defendants because they had not shown an arguable case that they had sustained loss falling within the plaintiff’s undertaking as to damages. This is because they took the position that the second defendant was not set up to compete with the plaintiff, and that it had no need to employ any of the plaintiff’s staff or do business with any of its customers: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[17]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[81]</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">[82]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">25 For the reasons above, the court dismissed the plaintiff’s claims.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-italic">This summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the Court’s grounds of decision.
