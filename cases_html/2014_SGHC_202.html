<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This
is an application by Khor Liang Ing Grace (“Ms Khor”), the executor
of the estate of Tan See Wee, her deceased husband (“the deceased”).
She seeks to remove a caveat filed by Nie Jianmin (“Ms Nie”) against
a grant of probate for the purposes of executing the deceased’s
will.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Ms
Nie’s caveat was lodged on the basis of an alleged $762,000 loan she
had made to the deceased not long before his demise. She is claiming this
sum from the deceased’s estate. I have to decide whether there was
such a loan and also whether the caveat should be removed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The
deceased was a banker and fund manager working first as an investment
manager with the Development Bank of Singapore. Later, he worked
as a fund manager with Merrill Lynch Asset Managers.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> He
died on 18 March 2014,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> leaving behind his will
which named Ms Khor as the sole executor and trustee of his estate.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> There
is no dispute about this.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The dispute</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Soon
after the deceased’s death, Ms Nie lodged a caveat against the grant
of probate in respect of the deceased’s estate. This was filed on
26 March 2014.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> Ms Nie claims that she has an interest
in the deceased’s estate as the deceased owed her $762,000.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> Her
version of the story is that she had lent money to the deceased,
whom her husband, Tan Chau Chuang (“Mr Tan”), had described as a
“reliable long term friend”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> She claims that she had
only lent the money on her husband’s assurance that the deceased
was financially sound and would repay the money. Pursuant to this,
she handed the deceased a cashier’s order for $762,000 in the deceased’s
name on 30 December 2013.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> Ms Nie thus claims that
she lodged the caveat to protect her interest as a creditor.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Ms
Khor’s story is different. The sum was not a loan but rather an investment
in the deceased’s new project in Vietnam. The deceased told her that
he had entered into an investment. She then found out that Mr Tan had
invested his money into the deceased’s new project as well.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> Her position therefore is that the
$762,000 was not a loan given to the deceased but an investment
made by Mr Tan in a business venture with the deceased.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The present proceedings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Subsequently,
Ms Khor made an application on 24 April 2014 in her capacity as
the executor of the deceased’s estate. She sought for probate to be
granted to her.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> The next day, she filed her supporting
affidavit pursuant to O 71 r 5 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R
5, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the ROC”). The supporting affidavit was filed
together with an extract from the Register of Deaths (stating the
cause of the deceased’s death) and his last will.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> It
was then that her lawyers informed her that a caveat had been lodged
by Ms Nie against the grant of probate. As Ms Khor had always known
Ms Nie as “Jessie”, she did not know that they were the same person until
later. It was only after speaking with Mr Tan and a friend, Teoh
Teik Kee (“Mr Teoh”), that she drew the connection between the caveat
that was filed by Ms Nie and the $762,000 investment purportedly
made by Mr Tan.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The meeting between Ms Khor
and Mr Tan in the presence of Samuel Koh</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       In
order to understand the circumstances surrounding the alleged debt
of $762,000, Ms Khor met Mr Tan on 23 May 2014 with a friend, Samuel
Koh (“Mr Koh”). At the meeting, Mr Tan stated that the deceased had
owed him US$500,000. This sum was Mr Tan’s investment in the deceased’s
Vietnam project. This was an investment in Tri Viet Media Corp (“TVM”),
a Vietnamese media company.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       As
proof of Mr Tan’s investment, Ms Khor was shown copies of the remittance
advice to the deceased. She was also shown text messages sent through
WhatsApp Messenger between Mr Tan and the deceased, indicating that
the deceased had asked Mr Tan to prepare a <em>curriculum vitae</em> to
be presented to a Vietnamese company with him as a potential investor.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Ms
Khor later understood from the meeting that Mr Tan had subsequently
borrowed money from Ms Nie to invest in TVM – he did not have the
money to invest in the project then. As the deceased had passed away,
Mr Tan sought a return of his investment and the caveat was filed
to protect his investment interest.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The show cause action</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On
26 May 2014, a notice was served on Ms Nie’s solicitors. It warned her
to appear within eight days of service to file a notice of appearance stating
her interest in the estate of the deceased. If she had no contrary interest,
then she had to show cause against the grant of probate to Ms Khor.
The court would proceed to issue a grant of probate to the executor
if she defaulted.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Ms
Nie thus entered her appearance on 3 June 2014 showing cause against
the grant of probate to Ms Khor. She alleged that she was a creditor of
the deceased’s estate. Therefore, the grant of probate should not
be made unless her interests could be assured. On the other hand,
Ms Khor requested that Ms Nie’s caveat be expunged.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     In
addition to her objections against the grant of probate to Ms Khor, Ms
Nie also requested that her claim be recognised and that the court
make an order for Ms Khor to repay the debt to her.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     On
the above facts, the following issues are:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether
this court has the power under s 33 of the Probate and Administration
Act (Cap 251, 1985 Rev Ed) (“PBA”) to hear or grant Ms Nie’s application
for her debt claim to be recognised or to order that the debt be
repaid to her; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_b"></a>(b)     whether
Ms Nie has a caveatable interest against the deceased’s estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Does this court have the power
under s 33 of the PBA to hear Ms Nie’s debt claim or grant Ms Nie’s
application for her debt claim to be recognised or to order that
the debt be repaid to her?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Section
33 of the PBA reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-Heading1">
<b>Caveat</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>33</b>.    Any
person having or claiming to have interest may, at any time after the
death of a deceased person and before probate or letters of administration have
been granted to his estate, enter a general caveat, so that no probate
or letters of administration shall be granted without notice to
the caveator, and after entry of any such caveat no such grant shall
be made until the caveator has been given opportunity to contest
the right of any petitioner to a grant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Ms
Khor submits that this court does not have the power under s 33 to
hear or grant Ms Nie’s application. This is because, in her view,
the court neither has the power to recognise Ms Nie’s debt claim
of $762,000, nor the power to order the executor to pay the alleged
debt owed to Ms Nie when probate has yet to be granted.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> She also
submits that this power is absent under O 71 r 37 of the ROC.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> Does
this court have the power under s 33 of the PBA or O 71 r 37 of
the ROC to adjudicate on Ms Nie’s debt claim before the grant of
probate? In order to determine this question, regard must be had
to the purpose of s 33 of the PBA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Section
33 allows one to lodge a caveat against the grant of probate. The
person seeking the grant of probate will then be notified before
the grant of probate is issued: <em>Halsbury’s
Laws of Singapore</em> vol 15 (LexisNexis, 2013 Reissue) (“<em>Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore</em>”) at para
190.015. The following passage from Jonathan Winegarten, Roland
D’ Costa &amp; Terry Synak, <em>Tristram and Coote’s
Probate Practice</em> (LexisNexis, 30th Ed, 2013) at para
23.04 is instructive (see also G Raman, <em>Probate
and Administration in Singapore and Malaysia</em> (LexisNexis,
3rd Ed, 2012) (“<em>Probate and Administration
in Singapore and Malaysia</em>”) at p 134):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The following are some of the purposes
for which a caveat may be entered:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(a)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">to give time to the caveator to make enquiries and to obtain
such information as may enable him to determine whether or not there
are grounds for his opposing the grant;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(b)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">to give any person interested in the
estate an opportunity of bringing any question arising in respect
of the grant before the court on summons; and</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(c)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">as a step preliminary to a probate
claim, or to the issuing of a citation …</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">Once the caveat has been filed, the caveator has to show cause
why the grant of probate should not be given. Typically, the show
cause action would take place when the caveator wants some form
of assurance that the deceased’s estate would be administered in
the interests of all the beneficiaries: <em>Probate and
Administration in Singapore and Malaysia</em> at p 135.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Accordingly,
I am of the view that this court does not have the power under s
33 of the PBA or O 71 r 37 of the ROC to decide on the merits of
Ms Nie’s debt claim. The power under s 33 of the PBA or O 71 r 37
of the ROC should <em>only</em> be invoked
insofar as Ms Nie seeks to establish a contrary interest in the
estate, which arises if she is claiming an interest either as an executor
or beneficiary of the will: Ng Peng Hong, George Tan Keok Heng and
Ho Hock Lai, <em>Atkin’s Court Forms Singapore</em> (LexisNexis,
2007) at para 1004. The rights of a creditor should not be adjudicated
at this stage. As Sir William Wynne in <em>Elme
v Da Costa</em> (1791) 1 Phill Ecc 174 at 177 held:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The right of a creditor is only this; <em>he cannot be paid his debt till a representation
to the deceased is made</em>; he can then call on all who
have a right to administer; before an administration is granted
if a will be produced, the creditor has no right to contradict or
deny it; for if there is a will, or a next of kin claims the administration,
then a person offers to make himself a representative, and the creditor
gets all that he has a right to. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     It
is clear that the caveat lodged by Ms Nie cannot circumvent the usual
probate procedure. If she is alleging that she is a creditor of
the deceased, she should wait for the executor to obtain the grant
of probate before submitting her claim to the estate via the executor
or administrator: <em>Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore</em> at
para 190.095. It is not for this court to adjudicate on her claim
at this stage and find that she was owed a loan or make an order
for its return.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Moreover,
Ms Nie’s position is that she does not object to Ms Khor administering
the estate. She is only interested in recovering what she claims
is owed to her. The filing of the caveat in this case is therefore misconceived,
as there is no basis to withhold the grant of probate to Ms Khor.
I agree with Ms Khor’s submission that the court does not have the power
to hear or grant Ms Nie’s debt claim of $762,000 under s 33 of the PBA
or O 71 r 37 of the ROC. I shall now examine whether Ms Nie has
a caveatable interest against the deceased’s estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Does Ms Nie have a caveatable
interest against the deceased’s estate?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The
parties’ dispute is with respect to the nature of the sum and whether
it constitutes a caveatable interest. Ms Nie submits that the $762,000
is a loan which is due to her from the deceased. Ms Khor, on the other
hand, submits that it is an investment, the sum being given pursuant an
investment made by Mr Tan in TVM. A third view appears tenable as well
from the evidence of Mr Tan. He is of the view that the sum had
been lent to him by Ms Nie for his investment in TVM. While he has
provided a third possible view, it is important to note that he
is not party to the proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Which
of the three versions is correct is, in my view, immaterial. I hold
that none of them amounts to a caveatable interest in this case.
In <em>Re Devoy; Fitzgerald v Fitzgerald</em> (1943)
QSR 137 (“<em>Re Devoy</em>”) at 144, it
was held that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… It is conceded that a person who merely
had an interest or pretended interest in the estate could not, merely
upon showing such an interest or pretended interest, oppose a will:
he must have been able to show that the grant of probate would affect
some interest of his. It is also conceded that the law provided
that no person could intervene in a probate action merely because
he was interested in the estate: he must have shown that he was interested
in the cause. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1">A person’s interest arising under a loan or an investment
is not such an interest.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Is a loan a caveatable interest?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Loans
do not give rise to caveatable interests under s 33 of the PBA. This
has been the position in the United Kingdom (<em>Burroughs
v Griffiths and Hall</em> (1754) 1 Lee 544 (“<em>Burroughs</em>”)),
Hong Kong (<em>Re John Tung Chi Ying</em> [1987]
HKCFI 57 (“<em>Re John Tung Chi Ying</em>”))
and Australia (<em>Re Donald Keith Owen</em>,
21 August 1992 (unreported)). In fact, creditors who have lodged
caveats have been criticised as abusing the caveat process. I agree.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     I
find the facts of <em>Re John Tung Chi Ying</em> germane
to this case. In that case, John Tung passed away and left behind
a will. His grandnephew asserted that he had loaned John Tung US$11m
which had remained unpaid. On that basis, the grandnephew lodged
a caveat and subsequently, the executor of the will sought to expunge
the caveat. The application to expunge the caveat was allowed. It
was held that the grandnephew’s actions were “inexplicable and unjustified”.
His interests were better protected and preserved after the grant
of probate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Parallels
can be drawn between <em>Re John Tung Chi Ying</em> and
the present case. Here, Ms Nie’s caveat is premised on her assertion
that the $762,000 was a loan to the deceased. Her interest is for
the return of the $762,000 to her. This was apparent when she stated
in the affidavit that she had lodged the caveat only to protect
her own interests. She was willing to withdraw the caveat provided
Ms Khor gave her some assurances with respect to the debt. I find
no reason to maintain the caveat on the basis of a loan and hold
that the caveat must be expunged from the register.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Is an investment a caveatable
interest?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     I
also do not find that an interest pursuant to an investment can
give rise to a caveatable interest under s 33 of the PBA. In <em>Re Devoy</em> at 145, it was held that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [A] person “interested” or “interested
in the estate” cannot enforce the bringing of an action in which
he can dispute the validity of the will, unless he can show an interest
sufficient to entitle him to object to the grant applied for.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">How is the sufficiency of that interest
to be determined? I know of no other way than by reference to the
general body of probate law; <em>and according
to that law an interest sufficient to entitled a person to object
to a grant must be some right of that person which will be affected
by the grant</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In my view, if the $762,000 were an investment instead of
a loan as Ms Khor contends, it is still not a caveatable interest
as it is not a probate issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Here,
the preliminary question would be whether Ms Nie even has any standing
to bring an action against Ms Khor as the executor, since the investment
was made by Mr Tan. She merely lent money to her husband; she would
have no standing to make this application against Ms Khor. Second,
if the $762,000 was an investment, Mr Tan’s investment could be held
by the deceased on trust for Mr Tan’s benefit or could even be held legally
by Mr Tan. If the former, Ms Nie’s interest would be best taken
care of if the grant of probate is given to Ms Khor. Mr Tan can
then work with Ms Khor as the executor to realise his beneficial
interest under the $762,000. If the latter, Ms Nie’s interest would
be best taken care of between herself and Mr Tan. Ms Khor will not
be involved. Therefore no caveatable interest can arise from an
investment interest.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Is Ms Nie’s claim on moneys
had and received sustainable?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Finally,
I wish to comment on Ms Nie’s claim on the grounds of unjust enrichment.
Ms Nie submits that her claim is one for monies had and received.
She relies on <em>Tjong Very Sumito and others
v Chan Sing En and others</em> [2012] 3 SLR 953 at [81] for
the elements of unjust enrichment. She submits that it is <em>unjust</em> for the deceased’s estate to retain
the sum claimed for.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In <em>Alwie </em><em>Handoyo </em><em>v Tjong Very Sumito and another and another appeal</em> [2013]
4 SLR 308 at [125], the Court of Appeal held that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… <b>Plaintiffs should
be precise in elucidating the basis for their restitutionary claims</b>.
Identifying the precise underlying cause of action for a restitutionary
claim has practical consequences in terms of affecting what the plaintiff
needs to show in order to establish the claim. We agree with the comment
by the editors of <em>Goff &amp; Jones (8th Ed)</em> ([101] <em>supra</em>) at para 1.29 that “[t]he old language
of ‘money had and received’ … conceals as much as it reveals about
the nature of a claim”. In our view, the underlying basis for the
action for money had and received is now embraced under the rubric
of <em>unjust enrichment</em>: see <em>Westdeutsche </em><em>Landesbank </em><em>Girozentrale v Islington London Borough Council</em> [1996]
AC 669 at 710.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[original emphasis in italics; emphasis
added in bold]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Ms
Nie’s bare assertion of an enrichment being unjust is insufficient
if she seeks to establish her claim based on money had and received.
The same point was noted by Judith Prakash J in <em>Lo
Man Heng and another v UBS AG (Yap Loo Mien, third party)</em> [2014]
SGHC 134 at [82]: that an unjust enrichment claim must be premised
on an “unjust factor”. Since Ms Nie has not shown that any such
unjust factor exists, I hold that her claim based on moneys had
and received can neither succeed nor form a basis for a caveatable
interest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     There
are material differences in the facts of <em>Tan
Beng Tian v Teoh Hock Kooi</em> [2012] SGDC 268 which Ms Nie
relied on to show that the court had ordered a refund of an investment
sum. In that case, the defendant, who was the recipient of the money
in question, had induced the plaintiff by stating that if the plaintiff
remained unconvinced about the investment potential of a potential
investment, the defendant would return the investment sum to the
plaintiff. There was no evidence of such facts before me.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Is the sum claimed for an investment
or loan?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The
purpose of the $762,000 is a hotly contested issue between the parties.
It is not necessary for me to dwell on this issue as I have explained above
that I have no power under s 33 of the PBA to recognise Ms Nie’s claim
or to make an order for the debt to be repaid to her. Neither does
Ms Nie have a caveatable interest against the deceased’s estate.
Since the purpose of $762,000 is central to this application, I
shall therefore give my views on whether the $762,000 is more likely
to be a loan or an investment. However, I stress that my findings
are only on the evidence before me. They are without prejudice to
Ms Nie’s right to subsequently bring a claim for the $762,000 on
the basis that it is a loan if it is necessary for her to do so
later.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The case for the $762,000 being
an investment</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Ms
Khor’s position is that the $762,000 was a sum of money which Ms Nie
lent to Mr Tan for the purpose of investing with the deceased in
TVM. Ms Nie and Mr Tan were aware that the deceased had an investment
in TVM. According to Mr Tan’s affidavit, it is undisputed that in
December 2013, the deceased was keenly interested in TVM. At that
time, the deceased required US$2m for the first tranche of the investment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The
crucial issue is whether the deceased borrowed $762,000 from Ms Nie
for this investment or whether Mr Tan used this sum to invest together with
the deceased. Mr Teoh, who knew the deceased, Ms Khor and Mr Tan, stated
in his affidavit that the deceased had told him that Mr Tan and
the deceased had invested in TVM through the deceased’s investment
vehicle ADAD Investments Pte Ltd.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> Mr Tan denied this.
Mr Teoh also said that he was surprised to learn that Ms Nie extended
a loan of $762,000 to the deceased in December 2013.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Furthermore,
Ms Khor said that when she met Mr Tan on 23 May 2013 together with
Mr Koh, Mr Tan stated that the deceased owed him US$500,000. This
sum was Mr Tan’s investment in TVM. This investment proposition
is corroborated by a series of text messages sent through WhatsApp
Messenger from Mr Tan to the deceased in January 2014. The messages
are as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1">Mr Tan also admitted that he had attended the annual dinner
of TVM in Vietnam with the deceased and Mr Teoh on 24 Jaunary 2014.
However, he alleged that his attendance was not in his capacity
as an investor.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The case for the $762,000 being
a loan</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Ms
Nie’s story was that the sum was a loan due to her from the deceased.
However, there was no documentary evidence in either hardcopy or
electronic form to indicate that it was a loan. As Ms Khor pointed
out, all that Ms Nie had tendered in support of her claim was a
remittance advice from her in favour of the deceased.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> The
only other piece of evidence was the affidavit of Ms Nie’s husband,
Mr Tan, who echoed her assertion that the $762,000 was a loan. If
it were a loan, it lacked the essential characteristics of one.
Was it a demand or term loan? If it was a term loan, what was the
duration of that loan? Was it an interest free or interest chargeable
loan? Those questions were left unanswered by the evidence before
me.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     It
appears from Mr Tan’s affidavit that “[b]ased on my understanding,
[the deceased] had been prepared to pay interest of at least 4%
per annum on the loan amount”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> The 4% is merely
what Mr Tan thought should be the interest rate. There was no discussion
or agreement between the deceased and Ms Nie or Mr Tan as to the
interest rate and hence no indication whether the deceased agreed
to the 4% per annum. I find it unusual for the lack of evidence
as the sum loaned is not a small figure. Even among the best of
friends, at the very least, one would expect some evidence with
respect to the interest rate for a loan figure of $762,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Ms
Nie’s explanation is that the absence of any interest rate was due
to the fact that the loan was taken out on an urgent basis. However
I find that the evidence indicated otherwise. The purported loan
was given on 30 December 2013 and the demise of the deceased was
on 18 March 2014. For ten weeks, there had been no documentary or
electronic correspondence on this loan. I find it incredible that
parties as sophisticated as the deceased and Mr Tan, would have
made the loan in this manner, even taking into account their friendship
ties. Therefore, in my view, Ms Nie’s contention that the sum was
a loan is less convincing.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The case for the $762,000 as
an investment is stronger</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The
circumstances above thus seem to point towards the fact that the deceased
and Mr Tan were investing in TVM. Ms Khor’s version of the events
was also corroborated by Mr Teoh’s account. While Mr Tan filed an affidavit
in support of Ms Nie’s version of the events, it appears that Ms Khor’s
version is more likely having regard to the above facts. Ms Nie’s evidence
is mostly premised on bare assertions, with the only person corroborating
her story being her husband, Mr Tan. I thus find that on the evidence
before me it is more likely that the $762,000 is an investment rather
than a loan.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     In
my view the proceedings would have been expedited and Ms Nie would
have been able to recover the $762,000 sooner (if it was really
a loan) had she not lodged the caveat and refused to take it off
the register. The views of Sir George Lee in <em>Burroughs</em> at
551 are apposite:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [A] creditor had only a right to have
a constat of the deceased’s estate, to see whether there were assets
sufficient to pay the debts, but could not controvert the validity
of a will, for it was indifferent whether he should receive his
debt from an executor or an administrator, and if a creditor was admitted
to dispute the validity of a will, it would create infinite trouble, expense
and delay to executors …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     It
is also pertinent to note that Ms Nie does not oppose the grant
of probate to Ms Khor. Thus there is no issue with respect to the
grant of probate. I therefore allow the application made by Ms Khor,
the executor, and order that the caveat be struck off the register
and the grant of probate to be issued. I also dismiss Ms Nie’s application
for the $762,000 to be returned to her and will hear the parties
on costs.</p>
