<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       These proceedings involved several applications
                    in relation to three vessels arrested in Singapore waters – the
                    “Sabalan”, the “Sahand” and the
                    “Tuchal” (collectively, “the Vessels”). In addition
                    to the usual questions arising under admiralty law and practice, the
                    applications raised questions relating to the scope and effect of sanctions
                    imposed on Iran and Iranian entities by the Security Council constituted under
                    Chapter V of the Charter of the United Nations (“the UN Charter”),
                    and the implementation of those sanctions in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The plaintiff in all three actions is Crédit
                    Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, a French financial institution. The
                    defendant owner of the “Sahand” in Admiralty in Rem
                    (“ADM”) No 166 of 2010 is Thirteenth Ocean GmbH &amp; Co KG
                    (“13th Ocean”). The defendant owner of the “Sabalan”
                    in ADM No 176 of 2010 is Fourteenth Ocean Gmbh &amp; Co KG (“14th
                    Ocean”). The defendant owner of the “Tuchal” in ADM No 178
                    of 2010 is Fifteenth Ocean GmbH &amp; Co KG (“15th Ocean”). It was
                    alleged by the plaintiff, and not denied, that the defendants are wholly owned
                    subsidiaries of the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines
                    (“IRISL”). Accordingly, for the purpose of this judgment, I
                    treated the defendants as such.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       There are several contractual arrangements
                    involving the parties and others which are relevant here. Essentially, the
                    contracts provide for a syndicated loan for the construction of several vessels
                    (including the Vessels) and related mortgage and financing arrangements. The
                    first contract is a Loan Agreement governed by English law dated 23 August
                    2006 (“the Loan Agreement”), and amended by letter on
                    28 April 2008 and 10 September 2008. There are several relevant
                    designations under the Loan Agreement, and they are as follows:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the Lenders: the plaintiff, Société Générale, and
                            The Export-Import Bank of Korea (“KEXIM”);</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the Borrowers: the three defendants and Sixteenth
                            Ocean GmbH &amp; Co KG (“16th Ocean”);</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the Guarantors: this included the IRISL, IRISL
                            Europe GmbH and Darya Capital Administration GmbH;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the Swap Banks: the plaintiff and Société
                            Générale;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(e)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the Agent: Société Générale; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(f)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the Security Trustee: the
                        plaintiff.</div>
<p class="Judg-1">For convenience, I will generally refer to the plaintiff, Société
                    Générale, and KEXIM collectively as the Lenders, even though some of the
                    transactions relate to the plaintiff and Société Générale in their capacities as
                    the Swap Banks. Also, since 16th Ocean is not relevant to these proceedings, I
                    will generally refer to the defendants instead of the Borrowers, even though
                    some of the defaults and payments are attributable to the
                Borrowers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The purpose of the Loan Agreement was to make
                    available to the defendants a facility for providing financing for part of the
                    contract price for building four 4,900 TEU (<em>ie</em>,
                    twenty-foot equivalent unit) container carriers (including the Vessels) for the
                    defendants, and further to provide for possible interest rate swap transactions
                    between the Swap Banks and the defendants for the latter to hedge against their
                    exposure to interest rate fluctuations under the Loan Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       On 12 September 2007, the plaintiff and
                    Société Générale each entered into an ISDA (<em>ie</em>,
                    International Swaps and Derivatives Association) Master Agreement with the
                    Borrowers. Pursuant to the ISDA Master Agreement between the plaintiff <em>qua</em> Swap Bank and the Borrowers, 13th Ocean and 14th
                    Ocean entered into two swap transactions with the plaintiff. Pursuant to the
                    ISDA Master Agreement between Société Générale <em>qua</em>
                    Swap Bank and the Borrowers, 15th Ocean and 16th Ocean entered into two swap
                    transactions with Société Générale.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       On 21 April 2008, 13th Ocean executed a
                    German law instrument entitled, as translated, “Abstract Acknowledgement
                    of Debt and Document of Commission of a Ship Mortgage”. According to the
                    English translation of the instrument, 13th Ocean acknowledged a debt of
                    US$110,408,100 and interest, and secured this by granting a first priority ship
                    mortgage on the “Sahand”. For convenience, I shall refer to this
                    instrument as a “German Mortgage”. 14th Ocean executed a German
                    Mortgage on 16 July 2008 with respect to the “Sabalan”, and
                    15th Ocean likewise on 29 August 2008 did the same with respect to the
                    “Tuchal”. According to the plaintiff, the purpose and effect of
                    the German Mortgages was to secure the payment claims of the Lenders and the
                    Swap Banks under the Loan Agreement and the two ISDA Master Agreements.
                    Presumably, they were executed after the Vessels were built.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       On the respective dates they entered into the
                    German Mortgages, each of the defendants also executed a German law instrument
                    entitled, as translated, “Document of Submission into Immediate
                    Enforcement”. According to the plaintiff, this was a standard German law
                    security document under which a borrower declares its mortgagee to have an
                    immediately enforceable claim to a proportion of the full debt in order to
                    facilitate summary enforcement in Germany.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       It was alleged on behalf of the plaintiff that,
                    between 26 April 2010 and 28 July 2010, the defendants failed to pay
                    several sums under the Loan Agreement (as amended) and/or the two ISDA Master
                    Agreements. As of 7 September 2010, the total outstanding sum was
                    US$37,161,645.35. It was further alleged that the defendants failed, in breach
                    of the provisions of the Loan Agreement, to renew hull and machinery and war
                    risks insurance with an approved insurer and to maintain acceptable protection
                    and indemnity insurance over the Vessels.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The procedural history</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On 9 September 2010, the plaintiff filed
                    admiralty actions <em>in rem</em> against the Vessels for
                    the sum of US$37,161,645.35: against the “Tuchal” via ADM No 165
                    of 2010; against the “Sahand” via ADM No 166 of 2010; and against
                    the “Sabalan” via ADM No 167 of 2010. The “Tuchal”
                    was arrested on the same day; the “Sahand” and the
                    “Sabalan” were arrested on 14 September 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On 17 September 2010, the defendants
                    entered appearances to the actions and applied for the release of the
                    “Sabalan” and the “Tuchal”, on the ground that the
                    value of the “Sahand” alone was more than enough to cover the
                    plaintiff’s claim for US$37,161,645.35. On the same day, Société Générale,
                    on behalf of the Lenders, accelerated the amounts owed under the Loan Agreement.
                    According to the plaintiff, the accelerated amount, which did not include the
                    sums already owing, was US$145,143,336.17. Together with the initial claim, the
                    total amount alleged to be owing was US$182,304,981.52. A second set of
                    admiralty actions <em>in rem</em> were filed in respect of
                    this sum on 23 September 2010: ADM No 176 of 2010 for the
                    “Sabalan”; ADM No 177 of 2010 for the “Sahand”; and
                    ADM No 178 of 2010 for the “Tuchal”. The “Sabalan”
                    and the “Tuchal” were rearrested under these actions after they
                    were released from arrest under the first set of actions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     In the meantime, the defendants attempted to
                    make some payment – €4,754,463.91 was transferred to Société Générale on
                    10 September 2010 and a further €49,228.35 on 15 September 2010. These
                    represented the Euro equivalent of certain amounts of principal, interest and
                    swap payments which fell due on 28 July 2010. Clearly, these were far below
                    the amounts claimed. The defendants also made several attempts to obtain
                    security from Iranian, Swiss and Singapore banks but were ultimately unable to
                    offer satisfactory security to compel the release of the Vessels, which
                    according to admiralty practice meant a guarantee from a bank duly licensed to
                    carry on business in Singapore or an undertaking from an acceptable protection
                    and indemnity club. There was also some correspondence relating to providing
                    security by making payment into court, but this also came to naught. It appears,
                    especially from subsequent developments, that the defendants’ principal
                    difficulty lay not in lack of funds, but because of the European Union sanctions
                    against Iran, which applied to them. Among other restrictions, authorisations
                    from the relevant authorities, in this case the French Direction générale du
                    Trésor (the Directorate General of the Treasury), had to be obtained before
                    funds received from the defendants, such as the fund transfers described at the
                    beginning of this paragraph, could be distributed or utilised in payment of the
                    sums owing by the defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The plaintiff, for its part, applied to sell
                    the Vessels <em>pendente lite</em> – the relevant
                    applications were brought on 6 October 2010 for the “Sahand”
                    and on 23 October 2010 for the “Sabalan” and the
                    “Tuchal”. It should be noted that, apart from the initial arrests
                    of the “Sabalan” and “Tuchal”, it was never disputed
                    throughout the proceedings that the plaintiff had a sufficiently meritorious
                    case to justify the arrests of the Vessels – the defendants’ efforts
                    were directed at trying to effect payment or to raise security so as to effect a
                    release of the Vessels. Here, it should be clarified that the sums claimed by
                    the plaintiff in the main admiralty actions comprised sums owing to it, KEXIM
                    and Société Générale in their various capacities as Lenders and Swap Banks under
                    the Loan Agreement and related contracts. In this connection, it would appear,
                    and this was not disputed, that the plaintiff had the necessary standing as the
                    Security Trustee under the Loan Agreement to maintain the actions against the
                    defendants for the sums owing to KEXIM and Société Générale.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The plaintiff’s applications for sale
                    were first heard on 8 November 2010. The hearing was adjourned to
                    12 November 2010 for the defendants to raise security. On 12 November
                    2010, the High Court ordered the sale of the Vessels.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The Sheriff then proceeded to advertise the
                    sale of the Vessels in the Straits Times, the Lloyd’s List, and the
                    TradeWinds. The deadline for submitting bids was set at 3.00pm on
                    14 December 2010. On 6 December 2010, the defendants’ solicitors
                    wrote to the Sheriff requesting the court’s bank account information for
                    payment into court, and requesting a postponement of the sale. The Sheriff
                    promptly – and I should say quite rightly – replied that the
                    court’s order was required for making payment into court and for
                    postponing the sale.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The postponement applications</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     On 9 December 2010, the defendants filed
                    three applications, <em>viz</em>, Summons No 5734, 5735 and
                    5744 of 2010, one in respect of each of the Vessel, for a postponement of the
                    sale to 4 January 2011. The ground for each application was, <em>inter alia</em>, to allow time for the defendants to raise
                    security and because of a sudden increase in the sum claimed. On
                    10 December 2010, the plaintiff’s London solicitors were instructed
                    that the full amount owing by the defendants, including interest projected to
                    14 December 2010, was US$203,855,277, excluding payments which had been
                    remitted but not cleared. The previous sum claimed was US$166.5m.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     These applications came before me on
                    13 December 2010. After hearing counsel, I dismissed the applications with
                    costs. I informed counsel of my intention to and proceeded to record my reasons
                    immediately at the end of my notes of argument so that the parties could
                    expeditiously bring an appeal if they so wished. My key reasons were as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_a"></a>(a)     As a general rule, an order for the
                        sale of arrested vessels would only be postponed in exceptional
                        circumstances: <em>The Acrux</em> [1961] 1
                        Lloyd’s Rep 471. These applications were being made at the last
                        minute.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_b"></a>(b)     It was
                        not disputed that the defendants were in default of their payment
                        obligations under the Loan Agreement and other related
                    contracts.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_c"></a>(c)     I
                        recognised that the defendants were having difficulty in making payment
                        under the various contracts and furnishing security because of the European
                        Union and United Nations (“UN”) sanctions.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_d"></a>(d)     However, these difficulties were known
                        to the defendants at least since the Vessels were arrested, <em>ie</em> for over three months. The parties were also in
                        constant correspondence over how the defendants would make payment or
                        provide security. Despite this, the defendants were not able to make any
                        significant payment or offer sufficient or indeed any security to compel the
                        release of the Vessels, even on the basis of the lesser sum originally
                        demanded, <em>ie</em>, US$166.5m. The best that could
                        be shown was a non-committal communication dated 5 December 2010 from
                        an Iranian bank, Bank Tejarat, which stated:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Without any engagement or responsibility on us – Bank Tejarat
                            Tehran – we would like to inform you that I.R.I.S.L. has deposited
                            an amount of Eur. 135,000,000/00 euro the cover of the settlement of
                            it’s [<em>sic</em>] loan with Messrs. Societe
                            General Banque Paris with us.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">This information is only issued at the request of I.R.I.S.L. and does
                            not bear any sort of involvement on our part in this relation.</p>
<p class="Judg-2">This communication, at best, only illustrated the
                        defendants’ difficulty all along – they had the funds but could
                        not get them across. In these circumstances, I doubted that a postponement
                        of three or four weeks would make any difference.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_e"></a>(e)     The increase in security required by
                        the plaintiff was due to a mistake by the plaintiff’s solicitors in
                        calculation, chiefly taking into account a previous payment that had been
                        frozen; but the defendants should know the extent of their indebtedness, and
                        the fact remained that the defendants had not been able to effect payment or
                        provide security to any significant degree at all since the arrests in
                        September 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_f"></a>(f)     I gave some weight to the fact that the Sheriff had not provided for a
                        postponement of the sale in his advertisements and a postponement of a
                        Sheriff’s sale had never occurred before.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_g"></a>(g)     I also gave some weight to the fact that there
                        were at least 10 parties interested in bidding for the Vessels and some of
                        them had incurred the cost of underwater hull surveys, each of which would
                        cost about S$30,000. Mr Thomas Tan for the defendants argued that this
                        would not be abortive as a postponement of three weeks would not affect the
                        validity of the surveys. I did not, with respect, agree as anything could
                        happen to the vessels in three weeks and anyone bidding a substantial price
                        for the Vessels would want a survey which was as current as
                    possible.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">I could therefore see no exceptional circumstances
                    justifying the postponement sought.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     On 14 December 2010, the day after I
                    dismissed the postponement applications, the defendants filed a second set of
                    applications, <em>viz</em> Summons Nos 5798, 5799 and 5800
                    of 2010, one for each of the Vessels, for, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, the discharge of the order to sell the Vessels, and for the
                    Vessels to be released. The ground for the application was that the defendants
                    had transferred €155m to the plaintiff in satisfaction of the claims made
                    against them (this was not entirely correct: the transferee was actually Société
                    Générale).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     These discharge and release applications stood
                    in another light. The transfer of €155m to Société Générale, together with the
                    earlier payments, appeared to be sufficient to cover the amounts said to be
                    owing by the defendants (and indeed was later confirmed to be so by
                    Mr Winston Kwek for the plaintiff). The defendants therefore took the
                    position that there was no reason for the Vessels to remain under arrest, let
                    alone be sold.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The plaintiff asked for and I granted a short
                    adjournment for them to take instructions and to check whether the €155m had
                    indeed been paid. When the parties returned on 16 December 2010, the
                    plaintiff confirmed the receipt of €155m by Société Générale. Although this
                    changed matters considerably, the defendants still could not be taken to have
                    paid the Lenders because it remained an open question whether the Direction
                    générale du Trésor would give the necessary authorisations to enable the Lenders
                    to be paid out of the sums received. In this regard, plaintiff’s counsel
                    asked for and I granted a further adjournment for the parties to ascertain the
                    position. I further ordered that: (a) the Sheriff was not to open any sealed
                    bids in the meanwhile and in any case until further order of the court; (b) the
                    Sheriff was to write to all parties who submitted bids informing them of my
                    order; (c) any bidder who wished to withdraw his bid was entitled to apply to
                    court to do so and would be favourably considered in view of the changed
                    circumstances; and (d) the plaintiff was to file an affidavit setting out what
                    steps it had taken to obtain approvals from the relevant authorities to secure
                    the release of the funds remitted by or on behalf of the defendants as well as
                    any other relevant matters in connection thereto. I also gave the parties
                    liberty to apply.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     During the adjournment, I further considered
                    the relevant domestic legislation as well as the relevant Security Council
                    resolutions and formed the view that there were serious questions regarding the
                    freezing of funds, other financial assets and economic resources imposed by the
                    UN sanctions (which I will refer to compendiously as the assets freeze) and
                    their applicability to the facts of this case. Specifically, I was concerned
                    that the Vessels, which were arrested and held by the Sheriff in Singapore
                    waters, might be subject to the assets freeze.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     I therefore directed the parties, as well as
                    the Attorney-General (in consultation with the relevant authorities), to make
                    written submissions and file affidavits on a number of questions, which I will
                    refer to in due course. Generally, my directions were aimed at clarifying the
                    scope of the assets freeze imposed by the relevant Security Council resolutions
                    and the implementing domestic legislation, as well as their application to the
                    facts of the case. I must record my gratitude to counsel and to the
                    Attorney-General for their written submissions which were put together over the
                    holiday period.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">My decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     On 5 January 2011, I heard the parties in
                    open court. Having read their written submissions and the affidavits filed and
                    after considering the matter, I reached the decision that the order to sell the
                    Vessels should be rescinded and that the Vessels should be released from arrest.
                    I now give the grounds for my decision. I will proceed as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Given the way which the facts of the case
                    turned out, it is not necessary for me to, and I will not, express a concluded
                    view on all the legal issues on which I invited submissions. But given the
                    general importance of the issues, and in deference to counsel’s extensive
                    submissions which were made at my direction, I will refer to them appropriately
                    in these grounds.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Security Council resolutions: overview</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The sanctions under consideration arise from
                    the international community’s concern over the nuclear activities of Iran.
                    On 27 December 2006, the Security Council adopted Resolution 1737. In the
                    preamble of Resolution 1737, the Security Council expressed, among other things,
                    its concern with Iran’s nuclear programme. Against this background, the
                    Security Council acted to impose a number of sanctions against Iran pursuant to
                    Art 41 of Chapter VII of the UN Charter, which provides that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Security Council may decide what measures not involving the use of
                        armed force are to be employed to give effect to its decisions, and it may
                        call upon the Members of the United Nations to apply such measures. These
                        may include complete or partial interruption of economic relations and of
                        rail, sea, air, postal, telegraphic, radio, and other means of
                        communication, and the severance of diplomatic relations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Security Council also established a Committee (“the
                    Sanctions Committee”) to perform certain specified functions relating to
                    the measures taken.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The measures taken in Resolution 1737 were
                    expanded in three further resolutions of the Security Council: Resolution 1747,
                    adopted on 24 March 2007; Resolution 1803, adopted on 3 March 2008; and
                    Resolution 1929, adopted on 9 June 2010. For convenience, I will refer to the
                    four resolutions – Resolutions 1737, 1747, 1803 and 1929 –
                    collectively as the “Iran Resolutions”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     As a Member of the United Nations, Singapore
                    acted to implement the Iran Resolutions. Of the various measures taken by
                    Singapore, two pieces of subsidiary legislation are relevant for present
                    purposes. The first is the Monetary Authority of Singapore (Sanctions and
                    Freezing of Assets of Persons – Iran) Regulations 2007 (S 104/2007)
                    (“the MAS Regulations”), made by the Managing Director of the
                    Monetary Authority of Singapore (“MAS”) pursuant to
                        s 27A(1)(<em>b</em>) of the Monetary Authority of
                    Singapore Act (Cap 186, 1999 Rev Ed) (“the MAS Act”),
                    which confers upon MAS power to make such regulations concerning financial
                    institutions as MAS considers necessary to discharge or facilitate the discharge
                    of any obligation binding on Singapore by virtue of a decision of the Security
                    Council. The second is the United Nations (Sanctions – Iran) Regulations
                    2007 (S 105/2007) (“the UN Regulations”) made by the Minister of
                    Law pursuant to s 2(1) of the United Nations Act (Cap 339,
                    2002 Rev Ed) (“the UN Act”), which empowers the Minister to
                    make regulations to give effect to Art 41 of the UN Charter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The UN Regulations were made on 28 February
                    2007, and the MAS Regulations on 1 March 2007 – just over two months after
                    the adoption of Resolution 1737. Both regulations were later updated to reflect
                    the rest of the Iran Resolutions as they were adopted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Other implementing measures were taken under
                    the Immigration Act (Cap 133, 2008 Rev Ed), the Merchant Shipping Act
                    (Cap 179, 1996 Rev Ed), the Regulation of Imports and Exports Act
                    (Cap 272A, 1996 Rev Ed), and the Strategic Goods (Control) Act
                    (Cap 300, 2003 Rev Ed) (see, in this regard, Singapore’s reports
                    to the Sanctions Committee of 6 March 2007 (UN Doc No S/AC 50/2007/45), and of
                    27 August 2010 (UN Doc No S/AC 50/2010/28)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     I should also record here the unequivocal
                    submission by Mr Shawn Ho for the Attorney-General that Singapore will
                    strive to give full effect to the Iran Resolutions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">International law and domestic law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Before considering the relevant implementing
                    legislation, it would be necessary for me to consider three aspects of the
                    relationship, in Singapore, between international law and domestic or municipal
                    law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The first aspect relates to whether
                    international law can, of itself, be an independent source of rights and
                    obligations, and powers and duties, in Singapore. In this regard, the Court of
                    Appeal has recently affirmed that a rule of customary international law is not
                    self-executing in the sense that it cannot become part of domestic law until and
                    unless it has been applied as or definitively declared to be part of domestic
                    law by a domestic court: <em>Yong Vui Kong v Public Prosecutor
                        and another matter</em> [2010] 3 SLR 489 at [91]. However,
                    the position with regard to treaty obligations, such as Singapore’s
                    obligation under the UN Charter to implement the Iran Resolutions, has not been
                    subject to judicial consideration in Singapore. Mr Ho for the
                    Attorney-General submitted, in the context of funds paid into court,
                        that:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[b]oth the court and the executive need to take into consideration and
                        give effect to Singapore’s domestic legislation and international
                        obligations. If the funds are required to be frozen under the UNSC
                        Resolutions, the Court may direct that these funds be frozen.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The position in the United Kingdom
                    (“UK”) is stated by Lord Oliver of Aylmerton in <em>J H Rayner (Mincing Lane) Ltd v Department of Trade and Industry and others
                        and related appeals</em> [1990] 2 AC 418 at 500 as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[A]s a matter of the constitutional law of the United Kingdom, the Royal
                        Prerogative, whilst it embraces the making of treaties, does not extend to
                        altering the law or conferring rights upon individuals or depriving
                        individuals of rights which they enjoy in domestic law without the
                        intervention of Parliament. Treaties, as it is sometimes expressed, are not
                        self-executing. Quite simply, a treaty is not part of English law unless and
                        until it has been incorporated into the law by legislation. So far as
                        individuals are concerned, it is res inter alios acta from which they cannot
                        derive rights and by which they cannot be deprived of rights or subjected to
                        obligations; and it is outside the purview of the court not only because it
                        is made in the conduct of foreign relations, which are a prerogative of the
                        Crown, but also because, as a source of rights and obligations, it is
                        irrelevant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The English position appears to be founded on a constitutional
                    objection against the Crown being able, through its treaty-making prerogative,
                    to affect domestic law without the authority of Parliament: see <em>The Parliament Belge</em> (1879) 4 PD 129 at
                    154–155.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     While our constitutional arrangements are not
                    identical to those of the UK, the principle underlying the English position is
                    equally applicable here. By virtue of Art 38 of the Constitution of the Republic
                    of Singapore (1985 Rev Ed, 1999 Reprint), the legislative power of
                    Singapore is vested in the Legislature. It would be contrary to Art 38 to hold
                    that treaties concluded by the Executive on behalf of Singapore are directly
                    incorporated into Singapore law, because this would, in effect, confer upon the
                    Executive the power to legislate through its power to make treaties.
                    Accordingly, in order for a treaty to be implemented in Singapore law, its
                    provisions must be enacted by the Legislature or by the Executive pursuant to
                    authority delegated by the Legislature. In so far as a treaty is not implemented
                    by primary or subsidiary legislation, it does not create independent rights,
                    obligations, powers, or duties. I must therefore reject Mr Ho’s
                    submission, in so far as he meant to say that the court can directly give effect
                    to Singapore’s treaty obligations without them being implemented through
                    legislation, as being inconsistent with the Constitution. That said, I should
                    state unequivocally that the courts will always strive to give effect to
                    Singapore’s international obligations within the strictures of our
                    Constitution and laws.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The second aspect is the use of international
                    law in interpreting primary and subsidiary legislation. The English courts apply
                    a rebuttable presumption that Parliament intends to legislate consistently with
                    international law and specifically treaty obligations. In Singapore,
                    s 9A(2) of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 2002 Rev Ed) permits
                    consideration to be given to extrinsic materials in interpreting a provision of
                    a written law, if such materials are capable of assisting in the ascertainment
                    of the meaning of the provision. This is wide enough to encompass international
                    law in appropriate cases, such as the present, where the MAS Regulations and the
                    UN Regulations were expressly made to give effect to Singapore’s
                    international obligations. Further, s 9A(3)(<em>e</em>) specifically permits reference to any treaty or other
                    international agreement that is referred to in the written law. The Singapore
                    position does not appear to be precisely the same as the English position, but
                    for present purposes it is not necessary to examine this further.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The third aspect is the consideration by the
                    Executive of Singapore’s international obligations when exercising
                    discretionary powers conferred by law. For present purposes, I am content to
                    confine myself to the truism that such consideration is permissible if it is not
                        <em>ultra vires</em> the empowering law or the
                    Constitution.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Implementing the assets freeze imposed by the Iran
                Resolutions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     I now turn to consider the assets freeze
                    imposed by the Iran Resolutions and how it has been implemented in

<p class="Judg-1">Once again, I would note that the exceptions in reg 5(3)
                    are conditional only upon the relevant determination of the MAS, which would be
                    sufficient in the domestic sphere.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     As for operative paras 14 and 15, I observed
                    that they have not been expressly enacted in the MAS Regulations, which unlike
                    the UN Regulations do not provide for a general power of exemption. I therefore
                    invited submissions on this point. From Mr Ho’s submissions, it does
                    not appear that this was a deliberate attempt to disallow the exceptions
                    permitted under those operative paragraphs. Rather, Mr Ho submitted that
                    operative para 14 is merely “clarificatory” in nature and need not
                    be enacted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     As for operative para 15, Mr Ho submitted
                    that it had been enacted via reg 14 of the UN Regulations. I confess some
                    difficulty in following this submission, since reg 14 of UN Regulations only
                    empowers the Minister to make exemptions from the provisions of the UN
                    Regulations, and not the provisions of the MAS Regulations. The position under
                    the MAS Regulations can be contrasted to the UK position under the Iran
                    (Financial Sanctions) Order 2007 (SI 2007 No 281) (UK) (“the UK
                    Order”), made pursuant to s 1 of the United Nations Act 1946 (c 45)
                    (UK). Under art 8(1) of the UK Order, a person may credit a frozen account with
                    interest or earnings, as well as payments due under prior contracts, agreements
                    or obligations. Under art 10, the UK Treasury is empowered to grant exempting
                    licenses. This power extends to exempting payments under prior contracts in
                    accordance with operative para 15 of Resolution 1737: see the Bank of
                    England’s press release of 24 March 2007 entitled “Financial
                    Sanctions: Iran”
                    &lt;http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/fin_sanctions_iran.htm&gt; (accessed 5 January
                    2011). Putting Mr Ho’s submissions to one side, I think that the
                    court may be able to give indirect effect to operative para 15 in the present
                    state of the law by applying the common law principle, described by Staughton LJ
                    in <em>Secretary of State for Social Security v
                        Tunnicliffe</em> [1991] 2 All ER 712 at 724 and approved by
                    Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead in <em>Wilson v First County Trust
                        Ltd (No 2)</em> [2004] 1 AC 816 at [19], “that
                    Parliament is presumed not to have intended to alter the law applicable to past
                    events and transactions in a manner which is unfair to those concerned in them,
                    unless a contrary intention appears.” While Staughton LJ’s dictum
                    was made with reference to statutes enacted by Parliament, I should think that
                    the presumption applies equally to subsidiary legislation such as the MAS
                    Regulations. However, the presumption cannot be applied inconsistently with the
                    object of the MAS Regulations, which as mentioned is to assist in giving effect
                    to the Iran Resolutions. This would be the case if the presumption is applied in
                    its full force, since operative para 15 does not permit <em>all</em> payments under existing contracts, but only those payments
                    which met the criteria stated therein. The presumption can therefore only apply
                    to the extent that the stated criteria have been met. In this way, indirect
                    effect can be given to operative para 15.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     In any event, whatever the true position is
                    under the present state of the law – and the facts do not require me to
                    reach a concluded view – it would certainly be helpful, from a judicial
                    perspective as well as for those who have to comply with the law, if operative
                    paras 14 and 15 were expressly enacted.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Assets in the custody of the court or its officers</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     As mentioned, I was concerned on the facts
                    with applicability of the assets freeze to Vessels, which while they were
                    arrested were assets in the custody of the Sheriff, an officer of the court.
                    More generally, the treatment of assets in the custody of the court and its
                    officers is an important issue given that the court, in the ordinary course of
                    its business, has to deal with all manner of parties and their assets. In this
                    regard, it appears that assets in the custody of the court or its officers are
                    not explicitly covered by the MAS and UN Regulations, which concern assets in
                    the custody of financial institutions and other private entities. Similarly,
                    there is no explicit power for the court to direct the freezing of any assets in
                    its custody. However, if it comes to the attention of the court that assets in
                    its custody are owned or controlled by sanctioned entities, it may well be that
                    those assets would be subject to a <em>de facto</em>
                    freeze. This is because: (a) if the assets were ordered to be released, the
                    recipient of such assets, or his agent in Singapore, would have to act to freeze
                    the assets in accordance with the MAS or UN Regulations; and (b) if there was a
                    risk that the recipient or his agent would not comply with the MAS or UN
                    Regulations, the court will pre-empt this possible illegality by not releasing
                    the assets in the first place. Further, in the case of funds paid into court,
                    which are deposited with the Accountant-General’s bank accounts, the court
                    can direct the financial institutions administering those accounts to comply
                    with their obligations under the MAS Regulations. In these ways, a <em>de facto</em> freeze could be achieved. Of course, all this
                    depends on the issue of sanctions and the identity of sanctioned entities being
                    brought to the attention of the court. This is perhaps unlikely in ordinary
                    civil litigation, since it is not in the interest of parties to point out to the
                    court that the assets over which they are litigating may be frozen and put out
                    of their reach. In this case, the issue of sanctions was only brought to the
                    fore because they were clearly hampering the defendants’ ability to make
                    payment or provide security. Of course, if the authorities come to know that
                    assets in the custody of the court should be frozen, I have no doubt that they
                    will bring this to the attention of the court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     On the facts, two preliminary issues arose in
                    relation to the possible application of the assets freeze to the Vessels. First,
                    are the defendants, who own the Vessels, entities which are caught under the
                    assets freeze? Secondly, assuming an affirmative answer to the first issue, how
                    does the assets freeze affect the Vessels? I dealt with these two issues as
                    follows.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Are the defendants entities caught under the assets freeze?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The answer to this question depended in large
                    part on the more general question of which Iranian shipping entities are subject
                    to the assets freeze imposed in operative para 12 of Resolution
                1737.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The first three of the Iran Resolutions did
                    not designate commercial entities as being subject to the assets freeze. This
                    changed with the adoption of Resolution 1929, which amongst other things
                    designated certain Iranian shipping entities as being subject to the assets
                    freeze. This was done in operative para 19 of Resolution 1929, where the
                    Security Council:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">19. <em>Decide</em>[<em>d</em>]
                        that the measures specified in paragraphs 12, 13, 14 and 15 of resolution
                        1737 (2006) shall also apply to the entities of the Islamic Republic of Iran
                        Shipping Lines (IRISL) as specified in Annex III and to any person or entity
                        acting on their behalf or at their direction, and to entities owned or
                        controlled by them, including through illicit means, or determined by the
                        Council or the Committee to have assisted them in evading the sanctions of,
                        or in violating the provisions of, resolutions 1737 (2006), 1747 (2007),
                        1803 (2008) or this resolution; [emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Operative para 19 is very precisely worded. It refers to the entities
                    of the IRISL specified in Annex III of Resolution 1929, <em>ie</em>, Irano Hind Shipping Company, IRISL Benelux NV and South
                    Shipping Line Iran. It does not refer to Iranian shipping entities in general,
                    or to IRISL, or to IRISL entities generally. On its face, therefore, operative
                    para 19 only imposes the assets freeze on the three Annex III entities, as well
                    as “any person or entity acting on their behalf or at their direction,
                    and to entities owned or controlled by them, including through illicit
                    means”. This was the position taken by the defendants and the
                    Attorney-General.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     This view is confirmed by a perusal of the
                    consolidated list, published by the Sanctions Committee on 19 August 2010, of
                    the individuals and entities subject to the travel ban and assets freeze as a
                    result of the Iran Resolutions. The three Annex III entities, <em>ie</em>, Irano Hind Shipping Company, IRISL Benelux NV and South
                    Shipping Line Iran, are the only shipping entities appearing on the consolidated
                    list, which remains current at the time of these grounds.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Furthermore, general confirmation can also be
                    found in operative para 18 of Resolution 1929, where the Security
                    Council:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">18. <em>Decide</em>[<em>d</em>]
                        that all States shall prohibit the provision by their nationals or from
                        their territory of bunkering services, such as provision of fuel or
                        supplies, or other servicing of vessels, to Iranian-owned or -contracted
                        vessels, including chartered vessels, if they have information that provides
                        reasonable grounds to believe they are carrying items the supply, sale,
                        transfer, or export of which is prohibited by paragraphs 3, 4 or 7 of
                        resolution 1737 (2006), paragraph 5 of resolution 1747 (2007), paragraph 8
                        of resolution 1803 (2008) or paragraphs 8 or 9 of this resolution, unless
                        provision of such services is necessary for humanitarian purposes or until
                        such time as the cargo has been inspected, and seized and disposed of if
                        necessary, and <em>underline</em>[<em>d</em>] that this paragraph is not intended to affect legal
                        economic activities; [emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Operative para 18, by prohibiting the provision of bunkering services,
                        <em>etc</em>, to Iranian owned or contracted vessels if
                    there are reasonable grounds to believe that they are carrying prohibited items,
                    clearly implies that such services may be provided to Iranian owned or
                    contracted vessels if there are no such grounds. This regime would be redundant
                    if all Iranian owned or contracted vessels were captured under assets freeze.
                    Such a wide approach would also be inconsistent with the last clause of
                    operative para 18, which underlined that the paragraph is not intended to affect
                    “legal economic activities”, which in context must mean legal
                    shipping activities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Mr Kwek submitted that IRISL itself is a
                    designated entity under operative para 19 of Resolution 1737. His reason for
                    taking this position was that it would be a stretch to read operative para 19 as
                    excluding IRISL itself, because there would otherwise be no necessity to
                    specifically state the name of IRISL in operative para 19 and in the heading to
                    Annex III. Further, Mr Kwek referred to European Union legislation
                    implementing the Iran Resolutions as well as the Union’s own measures,
                    recently consolidated in Council Regulation (EU) No 961/2010 of 25 October
                    2010 on restrictive measures against Iran and repealing Regulation (EC) No
                    423/2007 [2010] OJ L 281/1 (“the EU Regulation”). The relevant
                    provisions are arts 16(1) and (2), which provide in material part as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-4"><div align="center">Article 16</div>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1. All funds and economic resources belonging to, owned, held or
                        controlled by the persons, entities and bodies listed in Annex VII shall be
                        frozen. Annex VII shall include the persons, entities and bodies designated
                        by the United Nations Security Council or by the Sanctions Committee in
                        accordance with paragraph 12 of UNSCR 1737 (2006), paragraph 7 of UNSCR 1803
                        (2008) or paragraph 11, 12 or 19 of UNSCR 1929 (2010).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2. All funds and economic resources belonging to, owned, held or

                        bodies, not covered by Annex VII...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Mr Kwek pointed out that IRISL is listed in Annex
                VIII.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     I was unable, with respect, to agree with
                    Mr Kwek’s submission. Admittedly, it is not apparent why operative
                    para 19 only designated three IRISL entities and not IRISL itself. But on the
                    other hand it seems clear that this was precisely the intended effect. If IRISL
                    was itself targeted, it would be redundant to specifically mention the three
                    Annex III entities, which appear to be controlled by IRISL. Also, treating IRISL
                    itself as designated by operative para 19 would be inconsistent with the
                    consolidated list issued by the Sanctions Committee which I have just referred
                    to. Mr Kwek’s position was also contrary to the EU Regulation, which
                    he relies on – if IRISL needs to be listed in Annex VIII pursuant to art
                    16(2), it cannot logically be designated under operative para 19 of Resolution
                    1929, which is already provided for in art 16(1).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     It is therefore clear to me that the only
                    Iranian shipping entities which are designated persons within the meaning of the
                    MAS Regulations are Irano Hind Shipping Company, IRISL Benelux NV and South
                    Shipping Line Iran, <em>ie</em>, the three entities
                    specified in Annex III of Resolution 1929. Other IRISL entities, including IRISL
                    itself, are not designated persons. Likewise for Iranian shipping entities in
                    general. The definitions of “designated person” and “UN
                    List” in the MAS Regulations and UN Regulations (see reg 4 of both
                    subsidiary legislation) should be interpreted accordingly.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     However, the assets freeze does not stop at
                    the designated IRISL entities only (or designated persons in general). As
                    indicated in operative para 19 of Resolution 1929, and reflected in reg 5(2) of
                    the MAS Regulations and regs 8(b) and (c) and 9(b) and (c) of the UN
                    Regulations, the obligation extends to “any person or entity acting on
                    their behalf or at their direction, and to entities owned or controlled by them,
                    including through illicit means”. Whether a person or entity falls under
                    this description would have to be determined on the facts of each case. The
                    exercise would be difficult, not least because the position of the three
                    designated entities within the IRISL group is unclear. But the precisely
                    targeted nature of the UN sanctions requires that the exercise be undertaken in
                    every case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     On the facts, and as mentioned, I noticed that
                    the defendants had some links which concerned me. Specifically, I noticed that
                    the defendants were wholly owned IRISL subsidiaries, and that IRISL and IRISL
                    Europe GmbH were listed as guarantors under the Loan Agreement. I also noticed
                    that Mr Mehrzad Soleymanifar, who affirmed the affidavit evidence on behalf
                    of the defendants, was a director of Asia Marine Network Pte Ltd, which had been
                    listed in the EU Regulation as an entity acting on behalf of IRISL in Singapore
                    (see Annex VIII of the EU Regulation). Of course, these links to IRISL do not
                        <em>ipso facto</em> mean that the defendants were
                    linked to the three IRISL entities designated in Annex III of Resolution 1929.
                    But I was sufficiently concerned about the possibility of Singapore’s
                    international obligations being engaged that I directed the parties, as well as
                    the MAS and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (through responsible officers), to
                    file affidavits to indicate whether any of the defendants are designated persons
                    within the meaning of the MAS Regulations, or owned or controlled, directly or
                    indirectly, by any designated person, or acting on behalf of or under the
                    direction of any designated person. I framed my question with reference to the
                    MAS Regulations because that was the main domestic legislation raised in
                    argument before me during the December hearings. The scope of argument has
                    clearly widened since then, but the affidavits would be relevant for the Iran
                    Resolutions generally, since the definition of designated person in the MAS
                    Regulations is made with reference to the UN List, which is in turn defined with
                    reference to the Iran Resolutions (see reg 4 of the MAS
                Resolutions).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     It is clear that the defendants are not
                    designated IRISL entities under operative para 19 and Annex III of Resolution
                    1929. The main question is whether they are controlled, <em>etc</em>, by any designated person.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     MAS’s affidavit in answer to my
                    questions was made by Ms Denise Wong Jin Hua, a Deputy General Counsel with
                    MAS. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ affidavit was made through
                    Ms Long Li Shen, Lynette. Her designation was not indicated in her
                    affidavit but the Government’s directory, available publicly online,
                    stated her to be the Deputy Director of the Counter Proliferation and
                    International Security Branch of the International Organisations Directorate in
                    the Ministry. Both Ms Wong’s and Ms Long’s affidavits
                    stated that they have no personal knowledge that the defendants are designated
                    persons on the UN List as defined in the MAS Regulations, or owned or
                    controlled, directly or indirectly, by any designated person, or acting on
                    behalf of or under the direction of any designated person. I record the
                    court’s appreciation to both officers for attending to the matter so
                    quickly.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     The defendants affirmed two affidavits in
                    response to my questions. Both were made by Mr Soleymanifar. The first
                    affidavit did not answer my question on the defendants’ links to
                    designated persons. The second affidavit, which was expressed to be in response
                    to Ms Wong’s affidavit, confirmed that the defendants are not owned
                    or controlled, directly or indirectly, by any designated person, or acting on
                    behalf of or under the direction of any designated person. The plaintiff’s
                    affidavit was sworn by Mr Kwek. It was founded on the plaintiff’s
                    position that IRISL was a designated person, and stated that among other things
                    that the defendants were subsidiaries of IRISL. But, as I have said, it is only
                    the IRISL entities listed in Annex III of Resolution 1929 which are designated
                    by operative para 19 of the same resolution, and not IRISL itself. Links to
                    IRISL itself are, by themselves, neither here nor there.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     In the circumstances, there was no evidence
                    before the court that the defendants (or any of them) were controlled, <em>etc</em>, by any designated person. The assets freeze imposed
                    by the Iran Resolutions would therefore not apply to assets owned by the
                    defendants, specifically the Vessels in the custody of the Sheriff.
                    Consequently, there can be no question of applying the implementing legislation,
                    whether directly or indirectly, to the defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The extent of the assets freeze</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     My finding that the defendants were not
                    entities caught under the assets freeze sufficiently disposed of any further
                    issues in relation to the assets freeze. However, I considered, for
                    completeness, the possible treatment of the Vessels had the defendants been
                    found to be entities caught under the assets freeze.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     In this regard, it should be recalled that
                    operative para 12 of Resolution 1737, which imposes the assets freeze, is widely
                    worded:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">States shall freeze the funds, other financial assets and economic
                        resources which are on their territories at the date of adoption of this
                        resolution or at any time thereafter, that are owned or controlled by the
                        persons or entities designated ... or by persons or entities acting on their
                        behalf or at their direction, or by entities owned or controlled by them,
                        including through illicit means...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     Mr Ho submitted that the assets freeze
                    does not extend to what he called “property <em>in
                        rem</em>”, such as vessels. I find that difficult to accept.
                        <em>Prima facie</em>, a ship, as Mr Kwek
                    acknowledged, would seem to be an economic resource in the ordinary
                    signification of the term – and indeed a most valuable economic resource
                    – that would have to be frozen.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     However, the true scope of operative para 12
                    of Resolution 1737 must be determined not just with reference to its wording,
                    which is no doubt important, but also with reference to the relevant practice of
                    States in implementing the obligation imposed by it: see Art 31 (especially Art
                    31(3)(b)) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (23 May 1969), UNTS
                    vol 1155, p 331 (entered into force 27 January 1980); see also Sir Michael C
                    Wood, “The Interpretation of Security Council Resolutions”, (1998)
                    2 Max Planck YB UN Law 73 at pp 94–95.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     In this regard, it is instructive to refer
                    again to arts 16(1) and (2) of the EU Regulation, which I set out in full
                    below:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-4"><div align="center">Article 16</div>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1. All funds and economic resources belonging to, owned, held or
                        controlled by the persons, entities and bodies listed in Annex VII shall be
                        frozen. Annex VII shall include the persons, entities and bodies designated
                        by the United Nations Security Council or by the Sanctions Committee in
                        accordance with paragraph 12 of UNSCR 1737 (2006), paragraph 7 of UNSCR 1803
                        (2008) or paragraph 11, 12 or 19 of UNSCR 1929 (2010).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2. All funds and economic resources belonging to, owned, held or
                        controlled by the persons, entities and bodies listed in Annex VIII shall be
                        frozen. Annex VIII shall include the natural and legal persons, entities and
                        bodies, not covered by Annex VII, who, in accordance with Article 20(1)(b)
                        of Council Decision 2010/413/CFSP, have been identified as:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a) being engaged in, directly associated with, or providing support for
                        Iran's proliferation-sensitive nuclear activities or the development of
                        nuclear weapon delivery systems by Iran, including through involvement in
                        the procurement of prohibited goods and technology, or being owned or
                        controlled by such a person, entity or body, including through illicit
                        means, or acting on their behalf or at their direction;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b) being a natural or legal person, entity or body that has assisted a
                        listed person, entity or body to evade or violate the provisions of this
                        Regulation, Council Decision 2010/413/CFSP or UNSCR 1737 (2006), UNSCR 1747
                        (2007), UNSCR 1803 (2008) and UNSCR 1929 (2010);</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(c) being a senior member of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps or a
                        legal person, entity or body owned or controlled by the Islamic
                        Revolutionary Guard Corps or by one of more of its senior members;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(d) being a legal person, entity or body owned or controlled by the
                        Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines (IRISL).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It shall be prohibited, pursuant to the obligation to freeze the funds and
                        economic resources of IRISL and of designated entities owned or controlled
                        by IRISL, to load and unload cargoes on and from vessels owned or chartered
                        by IRISL or by such entities in ports of Member States. That prohibition
                        shall not prevent the execution of a contract concluded before the entry
                        into force of this Regulation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The obligation to freeze the funds and economic resources of IRISL and of
                        designated entities owned or controlled by IRISL shall not require the
                        impounding or detention of vessels owned by such entities or the cargoes
                        carried by them insofar as such cargoes belong to third parties, nor does it
                        require the detention of the crew contracted by them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As can be seen, arts 16(1) and (2) of the EU Regulation impose
                    identically-worded obligations to freeze all funds and economic resources owned
                    or controlled by persons designated by the Security Council and the European
                    Union respectively. In this regard, the three IRISL entities designated in Annex
                    III of Resolution 1929 are listed in Annex VII pursuant to art 16(1); IRISL
                    itself (including all its branches and subsidiaries), as well as 23 other IRISL
                    entities are listed in Annex VIII pursuant to art 16(2).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     It will also be noticed that art 16(2)(d) goes
                    on to provide, among other things, that the obligation to freeze the funds and
                    economic resources of IRISL and of designated entities owned or controlled by
                    IRISL shall not require the impounding or detention of vessels owned by such
                    entities. At first sight, this appears to be a substantive exception which
                    pertains only to IRISL entities designated by the European Union pursuant to art
                    16(2)(d) and which has nothing to do with art 16(1). If this is indeed the case,
                    then, art 16(1), which imposes a freezing obligation identically worded with art
                    16(2), and which is not subject to any exception, must be understood as
                    requiring the impoundment or detention of a vessel owned by an entity covered by
                    it. It would further follow that an IRISL entity falling under art 16(1) could
                    avoid having its vessel impounded or detained by the simple expedient of
                    transferring the vessel to an IRISL entity falling under art 16(2). This would
                    substantially undermine art 16(1), and in turn the freezing obligation imposed
                    by the Iran Resolutions. It is extremely doubtful that the EU Regulation, which
                    was evidently enacted in a robust spirit to implement the Iran Resolutions and
                    to expand upon them, intended such a result. This is especially so given that
                    operative para 20 of Resolution 1929 distinctly raised the possibility of
                    transfers of IRISL-owned vessels to other companies to evade the UN sanctions.
                    It is more likely that the proviso in art 16(2)(d) was not a substantive
                    exception as such, but was inserted for the avoidance of doubt, to reflect the
                    European Union’s understanding that the obligation to freeze the economic
                    resources of IRISL entities, whether designated by the Security Council or the
                    European Union, did not extend to the impoundment or detention of vessels owned
                    by them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Support for this proposition can be found in
                    the notice issued on 27 October 2010 by the UK Treasury in relation to the
                    EU Regulation. The relevant part of the notice reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b><u>SECTION I</u></b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>FREEZING OF FUNDS AND ECONOMIC RESOURCES (Chapter IV -
                            Articles 16-20)</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">7. Articles 16-20 of the Regulation replicate the previous asset freezing
                        measures.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">8. Article 16(2)(d) clarifies the effect of the asset freezing measures on
                        the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Line (IRISL), and of designated
                        entities owned or controlled by IRISL. It is prohibited to load and unload
                        cargoes on and from vessels owned or chartered by IRISL or by such entities
                        in ports of Member States. <em>However, the asset freeze
                            imposed on IRISL does not require the impounding or detention of vessels
                            owned by such entities or the cargoes carried by them if the cargoes
                            belong to third parties</em>, nor does it require the detention of
                        the crew contracted by them.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It is evident that the issue of impounding or detaining vessels was
                    considered by the drafter of the Treasury notice. In the circumstances, it would
                    seem natural for the notice to state that IRISL entities covered under art 16(1)
                    remain liable to have their vessels impounded or detained, if indeed this was
                    required. However, there is nothing to that effect.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     In the circumstances, it seems clear, from its
                    implementation efforts, that the European Union did not understand the assets
                    freeze imposed by the Security Council to require the impoundment or detention
                    of vessels owned by designated IRISL entities. This understanding is vital to
                    the interpretation of the scope of the assets freeze imposed by operative para
                    19 of Resolution 1929 read with operative para 12 of Resolution 1737. This is
                    not just because the membership of the European Union includes two permanent and
                    veto-wielding members of the Security Council, <em>ie</em>,
                    France and the UK, but also because the European Union as a whole has taken a
                    very robust attitude in implementing UN sanctions against Iran, as well as
                    adding further measures of its own. In this regard, I should add that, while the
                    United States would also fall within this description, I could not derive much
                    interpretive assistance from her domestic legislation because, judging from the
                    United States’ report to the Sanctions Committee dated 25 August 2010 (UN
                    Doc No S/AC 50/2010/7), the United States’ legislation made pursuant to
                    her own foreign policy had completely anticipated operative para 19 of
                    Resolution 1929. The relevant part of the United States’ report reads as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Paragraph 19</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Under the authorities of Executive Order 13382 and the
                        International Emergency Economic Powers Act, the United States designated
                        IRISL and 17 other entities controlled by or acting or purporting to act on
                        behalf of IRISL on 10 September 2008. Other IRISL-related entities have
                        been designated subsequently under Executive Order 13382. All three entities
                        included in annex III of resolution 1929 (2010) were so designated on
                        10 September 2008, prior to the adoption of the resolution. Individuals
                        and entities that are designated under Executive Order 13382 are denied
                        access to the United States financial and commercial systems, and United
                        States persons, including United States citizens, permanent resident aliens,
                        United States companies (wherever located), and any person or company in the
                        United States, are prohibited from engaging in transactions with them. This
                        national authority also allows the United States to implement effectively
                        the provisions set forth in operative paragraph 19 of the resolution. In
                        addition to IRISL itself, the following IRISL-related entities have been
                        designated under Executive Order 13382:</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In addition to these designations, the United States has listed the names
                        and International Maritime Organization (IMO) numbers of more than 90
                        IRISL-related vessels as a “blocked vessel”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In accordance with domestic law and international legal frameworks, the
                        United States cooperates closely with partner States to scrutinize the
                        activities of the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines and other Iranian
                        shipping-related companies that pass through airports, seaports, and other
                        international borders, and takes steps to prevent transfers of items
                        prohibited by this and by previous Iran-related resolutions, the United
                        States cooperates closely with partner States to scrutinize the activities
                        of IRISL as well as Iranian cargo shipping companies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As can be seen, the United States had already designated Irano Hind
                    Shipping Company, IRISL Benelux NV and South Shipping Line Iran pursuant to
                    Executive Order 13382 and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act on
                    10 September 2008, with the attendant consequences described in the United
                    States’ report, almost two years before Resolution 1929 was
                    adopted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     I also noted the parties’ submissions
                    that there has been no known case of ships being impounded or detained, in
                    Singapore or elsewhere, pursuant to the Iran Resolutions. This is not what I
                    would expect, some six months after the adoption of Resolution 1929, if there
                    had been an obligation on Member States to impound or detain Iranian shipping,
                    or any part thereof.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     Therefore, it seemed to me that the assets
                    freeze imposed by operative para 19 of Resolution 1929 read with operative para
                    12 of Resolution 1737 does not require the impounding or detention of vessels
                    owned or controlled by the designated IRISL entities. Accordingly, even if I was
                    wrong and the defendants were in fact entities caught under the assets freeze,
                    the Vessels, which were the defendants’ only assets in Singapore, would
                    not need to be impounded or detained under the Iran Resolutions. Consequently,
                    there can be no question of applying the implementing legislation, whether
                    directly or indirectly, to the Vessels.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The admiralty aspect</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     I was therefore of the view that the assets
                    freeze imposed by the Iran Resolutions was inapplicable on the facts because:
                    (a) the defendants were not entities caught under the assets freeze; and (b) the
                    assets freeze would not require the detention or impoundment of the Vessels,
                    which were the defendants’ only assets in Singapore. In the light of this,
                    the applications fell to be disposed of as normal admiralty matters, albeit with
                    rather exceptional facts. In this, my sole concern was whether the defendants
                    had paid the sums claimed from them or provided sufficient security for the
                    claims, such that the Vessels could be released. It is important to note here
                    that the relevant fund transfers occurred in Europe, outside of Singapore. There
                    was therefore no question of a Singapore court freezing the funds – that
                    was up to the relevant European authorities. To reiterate, my only concern was
                    whether the plaintiff’s claims had been met or security provided for
                    them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     In this regard, the defendants had made three
                    transfers of funds to Société Générale in Paris:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">€4,754,463.91 on 10 September
                        2010;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">€49,228.35 on 15 September 2010;
                        and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">€155m on 14 December 2010.</div>
<p class="Judg-1">The last transfer was made by Bank Tejarat on behalf of IRISL and the
                    defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     All three transfers were caught by art 16(2)
                    of the EU Regulation (or its materially identical predecessor) relating to
                    entities designated by the European Union on top on those designated under the
                    Iran Resolutions. Therefore, the necessary authorisations under art 18 of the EU
                    Regulation, which related to existing contracts such as the Loan Agreement and
                    its related contracts, had to be obtained before the funds could be applied
                    towards payment. Otherwise, the funds would remain frozen and could not be
                    considered valid payments or tenders of payment at law. They would also not
                    comply with the Loan Agreement, of which cll 16.12.1 and 16.12.2
                    provided:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">16.12.1 The Agent may at any time at the request of any Lender require
                        evidence satisfactory to the Agent that any payment under this Agreement is
                        legally compliant and until such evidence has been provided to the Agent
                        neither the Agent nor the Lenders (each a <b>beneficiary</b>) shall be obliged to accept any such payment but
                        each beneficiary shall be entitled to place such payment into a suspense
                        account and such payment shall not be an effective discharge of the
                        liabilities of the Borrowers under this Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">16.12.2 For the purposes of this Clause <b>legally
                            compliant</b> means that the payment of any funds under this
                        Agreement and their source (whether direct or indirect) and their receipt
                        and handling is or will be in the opinion of the Agent in all respects in
                        accordance with any law and regulatory requirements of any relevant
                        jurisdiction and [<em>sic</em>], and the receipt of
                        such funds by any beneficiary will not or is not reasonably likely in the
                        opinion of the Agent to impose on any beneficiary any obligation to make a
                        report to any authority or to repay such funds.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     The relevant evidence in relation to the
                    authorisations is set out by the plaintiff’s English solicitors, SNR
                    Denton UK LLP, in their letter of 4 January 2011, which was annexed to
                    Mr Kwek’s affidavit of 4 January 2011. Since it was not
                    challenged or contradicted, I accepted its contents as correct for present
                    purposes. Based on the letter, the parties had to obtain the following
                    authorisations:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_76-p2_a"></a>(a)     Société Générale, a French entity,
                        needed the authorisation of the Direction générale du Trésor for it to
                        receive the funds for its own benefit as well as on behalf of the plaintiff
                        and KEXIM.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_76-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
                        plaintiff, also a French entity, similarly needed the authorisation of the
                        Direction générale du Trésor for it to receive its share of the funds from
                        Société Générale.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_76-p2_c"></a>(c)     KEXIM, a Korean entity, also needed the authorisation of the
                        Direction générale du Trésor for it to receive its share of the funds from
                        Société Générale. However, because it was a Korean entity, KEXIM needed to
                        obtain the authorisation of the Central Bank of Korea, a translated version
                        of which was required to be submitted in support of the application for the
                        Direction générale du Trésor’s authorisation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The
                    position in relation to the authorisations was as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_76-p2_a_1"></a>(a)     Société Générale made an
                        application on 12 August 2010 to the Direction générale du Trésor and
                        was granted a license on 7 October 2010: (i) to receive funds
                        transferred in payment of the sums due from the defendants under the Loan
                        Agreement and related contracts; and (ii) to pay to itself the portion due
                        to it out of the funds transferred.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_76-p2_b_2"></a>(b)     In respect of the first two transfers of €4,754,463.91
                        and €49,228.35 made on 10 and 15 September 2010 respectively:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_76-p2_b-p3_i"></a>(i)       The plaintiff applied on
                            19 October 2010 to the Direction générale du Trésor for
                            authorisation to receive its portion of the funds and on 21 October
                            2010 such authorisation was granted.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_76-p2_b-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       KEXIM applied on 27 October 2010
                            to the Central Bank of Korea for authorisation to receive its portion of
                            the funds and on 2 November 2010 such authorisation was granted.
                            Further to this, Société Générale as Agent applied on 5 November
                            2010 to the Direction générale du Trésor for authorisation to pay KEXIM
                            its portion of the funds and on 31 December 2010 such authorisation
                            was granted.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_76-p2_c_3"></a>(c)     In respect of the third transfer of €155m made on
                        14 December 2010:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_76-p2_c-p3_i"></a>(i)       The plaintiff applied on
                            15 December 2010 to the Direction générale du Trésor for
                            authorisation to receive its portion of the funds and on
                            27 December 2010 such authorisation was granted.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_76-p2_c-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       KEXIM applied on
                            17 December 2010 to the Central Bank of Korea for authorisation to
                            receive its portion of the funds and on 22 December 2010 such
                            authorisation was granted. Further to this, Société Générale as Agent
                            applied on 3 January 2011 to the Direction générale du Trésor for
                            authorisation to pay KEXIM its portion of the funds. The application was
                            pending when I heard parties on 5 January
                    2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     In summary, the repayment position when I
                    heard the parties on 5 January 2011 was that Société Générale and the
                    plaintiff had been fully paid the sums owed to them, having received the
                    requisite authorisations from the Direction générale du Trésor, while KEXIM was
                    only awaiting the Direction générale du Trésor’s authorisation for it to
                    receive its portion of the €155m received on 14 December
                2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     Contrary to what I was told by counsel on
                    13 December 2010 when I heard the applications to postpone the sale of the
                    Vessels, apart from the initial wait of 8 weeks before the 7 October 2010
                    license was granted to Société Générale, the Direction générale du Trésor only
                    took a matter of 2 to 12 days to grant the various authorisations to the
                    plaintiff. In the case of KEXIM’s first application on 5 November
                    2010, there was a similar 8-week wait before authorisation was given on
                    31 December 2010. However, in fairness to counsel, a not insignificant
                    portion of these authorisations came after the hearings in mid-December 2010 and
                    I suspect that those instructing them had not forwarded the relevant facts and
                    details until they were asked for by me.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     As mentioned, the final obstacle to KEXIM
                    receiving full payment was the Direction générale du Trésor’s
                    authorisation in respect of the €155m transfer. Once the authorisation was
                    given, KEXIM would receive payment in full. In this connection, both Mr Tan
                    and Mr Kwek accepted that there was no reason why such authorisation would
                    not be forthcoming in light of the history set out above. Mr Kwek also
                    submitted, quite candidly, that the €155m was sufficient security for the sums
                    claimed by the plaintiff in the interim. According to him, Société Générale
                    would certainly not repatriate the funds back to IRISL or Bank Tejarat no matter
                    what happened.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     In these rather unique circumstances, I
                    rescinded the orders to sell the Vessels and ordered them to be
                released.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     I conditioned the release upon the
                    defendants’ solicitors filing the usual release papers and undertaking to
                    pay the Sheriff’s expenses and this will extend to reimbursing the Sheriff
                    for his time and expenses incurred in respect of the abortive sale of the
                    Vessels. I also ordered the Sheriff to return the sealed bids unopened along
                    with all cheques deposited with him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     Mr Tan informed me that the defendants
                    reserved their rights against the plaintiff in respect of any overpayment,
                    disputed amounts and/or wrongful maintenance of arrests. I noted this when
                    giving my decision, and stated for the avoidance of doubt that I was not making
                    any decision on these issues.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Applications for crew to join the Vessels</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     The defendants had also made three
                    applications on 4 January 2011, <em>viz</em>, Summons
                    Nos 23, 24 and 25 of 2011, one for each of the Vessels, for eight crew members
                    to join each of the Vessels for the purposes of familiarisation, so that the
                    Vessels could resume operation in the shortest time possible if and when they
                    are released. Since I had ordered the release of the Vessels, I made no order on
                    these applications.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Bidder’s request for compensation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     After I rescinded the order for sale,
                    Ms Vivian Ang, who appeared for one of the bidders (whose identity was not
                    known because the bids remained sealed), asked that the defendants compensate
                    the bidder for the expenses it incurred in relation to the bid, <em>eg</em>, the costs of inspections and underwater surveys of
                    the Vessels. I did not accede to this request. The defendant in an admiralty
                    action <em>in rem</em> is entitled to compel the release of
                    the <em>res</em> at any time before its sale by paying the
                    amount claimed or by providing satisfactory security, and paying the
                    Sheriff’s costs, expenses and disbursements. Even if I assume that the
                    defendants in this case somehow owed a duty to the bidders in the aborted sale,
                    all that each bidder would have lost was a speculative chance to purchase the
                    Vessels. Also, the Sheriff’s notice of sale had expressly reserved his
                    right not to sell to the highest bidder or at all. In these circumstances, an
                    order to compensate Ms Ang’s client would set an altogether wrong
                    precedent.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Costs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     Mr Kwek informed me that the sums paid to
                    Société Générale were sufficient to cover the plaintiff’s costs in the
                    present applications and that in the light of this the plaintiff was not seeking
                    a separate order as to costs. Mr Tan submitted that there should be no
                    order as to costs all round. So, as between the plaintiff and the defendants,
                    there was no disagreement that there should be no order as to
                costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     As for the others, Mr Jeyendran Jeyapal
                    said that the Sheriff was not seeking costs. Ms Ang said she was not
                    seeking costs. Mr Ho said that he was instructed to seek $5,000 in costs,
                    including disbursements. I could not accede to this as the
                    Attorney-General’s submissions were made at the direction of the court in
                    furtherance of the public interest in clarifying the scope of the Iran
                    Resolutions, their domestic impact, and their applicability to the facts of this
                    case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     In the result, I made no order as to
                    costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Concluding observations on the assets freeze and ship
                arrests</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     In this case, the defendants were not entities
                    caught by the assets freeze, and so the arrest of the Vessels fell to be treated
                    as an ordinary admiralty matter. However, I wish to emphasise, in concluding,
                    that the general point should not be lost that the full application of the Iran
                    Resolutions would seriously impact the arrest, pursuant to the court’s
                    admiralty jurisdiction, of vessels owned by designated persons and persons or
                    entities controlled, <em>etc</em>, by designated persons.
                    The vessels are not themselves subject to impoundment or detention. However,
                    financial institutions covered by the MAS Regulations would effectively be
                    unable to receive any funds or other financial assets from designated persons as
                    consideration for furnishing a guarantee to secure the release of arrested
                    vessels, because such funds or other financial assets would have to be frozen
                    once received. Also, the proceeds from selling the vessels, and any payment into
                    court to secure the vessels’ release, would have to be frozen by the
                    financial institutions administering funds held by the court. This means that,
                    while the arresting party may be able to obtain a judgment, he may not be able
                    to enforce it against the relevant funds.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     In respect of contracts entered into with a
                    person <em>after</em> it has been designated, this effect
                    is as it should be – the assets freeze imposed by the Iran Resolutions is
                    clearly intended to discourage dealing with designated persons, and those who do
                    so should not be surprised that their rights cannot be efficaciously enforced.
                    The only exceptions applicable in such situations are the exceptions found in
                    operative para 13 of Resolution 1737. However, I should observe, without
                    prejudice to the relevant authorities’ discretion, that these exceptions
                    are unlikely to have very wide application in a commercial
                context.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     In respect of contracts entered into with a
                    person <em>before</em> it has been designated, the proper
                    way would be to obtain an exception pursuant to operative para 15 of Resolution
                    1737, provided of course that the criteria imposed therein are
                satisfied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     Finally, as a matter of practicality, parties
                    should take legal advice and if necessary apply for the relevant exemptions
                    before committing themselves to a course of action which may end up with their
                    funds, financial assets or economic resources being frozen.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Postscript</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     Counsel came before me on 31 January 2011 to
                    settle some orders. They informed me, and I am glad to record, that KEXIM was
                    authorised by the Direction générale du Trésor to receive its share of the €155m
                    transfer on 10 January 2011; the Lenders have therefore been fully paid, and the
                    German Mortgages over the Vessels are in the process of being
                discharged.</p>
