As Judith Prakash J (as she then was) observed in <span class="font-italic">Ong Cher Keong v Goh Chin Soon Ricky </span>[2001] 1 SLR(R) 213 (“<span class="font-italic">Ong Cher Keong</span>”) at [44]–[46] and <span class="font-italic">Sunny Daisy Ltd v WBG Network (Singapore) Pte Ltd </span>(“<span class="font-italic">Sunny Daisy</span>”) at [21], the three circumstances in which an order may be set aside are:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, where the order has been obtained irregularly (<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>the person obtaining the order has not complied with the requirements of the Rules of Court in some aspect);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Secondly, where the judgment has been obtained by fraud. This fraud must relate to matters which <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>would be a reason for setting the judgment aside if they were established by proof and the fraud must have been discovered after the judgment was passed; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Thirdly, where an order or judgment has been obtained in default of the appearance of one of the parties to the suit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 It is clear that the final garnishee order in this case did not fall under any of the three circumstances. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The court retains the discretion to set aside an order outside the three circumstances</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 The garnishee therefore sought to rely on the inherent powers of the Court to prevent injustice to set aside the final garnishee order. In <span class="font-italic">Airtrust</span><span class="font-italic"> (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Kao Chai-Chau Linda </span>[2014] 2 SLR 693 (“<span class="font-italic">Airtrust</span>”), George Wei JC (as he then was) observed at [22] that “the court retains the residual discretion to vary its terms where this is necessary to prevent injustice.” Such views were echoed in <span class="font-italic">Sentosa</span><span class="font-italic"> Building Construction Pte Ltd v DJ Builders &amp; Contractors Pte Ltd </span>[2015] SGHCR 18 (“<span class="font-italic">Sentosa</span><span class="font-italic"> Building</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [46]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I find no reason to depart from the holding in <span class="font-italic">Airtrust</span> that the court retains a residual discretion – even in the case of a contractual consent order – to vary the terms of the order where this is necessary to prevent injustice. This stated principle of law is eminently justified by O 92 r 4 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“ROC”) which provides that “nothing in [the ROC] shall be deemed to limit or affect the inherent powers of the Court to make any order as may be necessary to prevent injustice or to prevent an abuse of the process of the Court” (see also <span class="font-italic">Airtrust</span> at [23]). In my view, the same position should in principle <span class="font-italic">a fortiori</span> hold true vis-à-vis uncontested consent orders.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 Hence, the Court retains a residual discretion flowing from its inherent powers to prevent injustice under O 92 r 4 of the Rules of Court to set aside any order that falls outside the three circumstances identified in <span class="font-italic">Ong Cher Keong </span>and <span class="font-italic">Sunny Daisy</span> (at [15] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Indeed, contrary to the judgment creditor’s assertion,

</div> it is clear that the three circumstances were not intended to be exhaustive of the circumstances in which an order may be set aside. As the court observed in <span class="font-italic">Ong Cher Keong </span>at [47], since the order therein did not fall within any of the three circumstances, “the defendant from the beginning faced an uphill task in his application to set it aside.” Similarly, in <span class="font-italic">Sunny Daisy </span>at [23], as the order also did not fall within any of the three circumstances, the applicant “had an onerous task to establish that that judgment should be set aside.” </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 The words “uphill task” and “onerous task” do not connote impossibility; they merely evince that the threshold for invoking the Court’s inherent powers is high. On the facts of <span class="font-italic">Ong Cher Keong </span>and <span class="font-italic">Sunny Daisy, </span>the high threshold was not met, and the orders were accordingly not set aside.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21  That the threshold for invoking the court’s residual discretion to utilise its inherent powers is high is not new. As the Court of Appeal observed in <span class="font-italic">Roberto Building Material Pte Ltd &amp; others v Overseas-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd and another </span>[2003] 2 SLR(R) 353 (“<span class="font-italic">Roberto Building</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [16]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">By its very nature, the inherent jurisdiction of the court should only be exercised in special circumstances where the justice of the case so demands. The court had, in <span class="font-italic">Wee Soon Kim Anthony v Law Society of Singapore </span>[2001] 2 SLR(R) 821 cited a passage from Sir Jack Jacob published in (1970) 23 Current Legal Problems 23, indicating how this jurisdiction should be exercised:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">This [inherent] jurisdiction may be invoked when it is just and equitable to do so and in particular to ensure the observance of the due process of law, to prevent improper vexation or oppression and to do justice between the parties. Without intending to be exhaustive, we think an essential touchstone is really that of ‘need’.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 It is hereby noted that while the court in <span class="font-italic">Roberto Building </span>had utilised the term “inherent jurisdiction” as opposed to “inherent powers”, it was likely delimiting the scope of its inherent powers. As the Court of Appeal clarified in Re<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Nalpon Zero Geraldo Mario </span>[2013] 3 SLR 258<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [33]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">the terms “inherent jurisdiction” and “inherent powers” should mean different things, the former being the court’s inherent authority to hear a matter, while the latter being its inherent capacity to give effect to its determination by making or granting the orders or reliefs sought by the successful party to the dispute.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Notwithstanding the inappropriate use of “inherent jurisdiction” in <span class="font-italic">Roberto Building</span>, the point remains that the threshold for invoking the court’s inherent powers is high.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 It must also be correct that the Court’s powers of setting aside orders are not to be limited to the three circumstances. As the Court of Appeal recognised in <span class="font-italic">Wee Soon Kim Anthony v Law Society of Singapore </span>[2001] 2 SLR(R) 821 (“<span class="font-italic">Anthony </span><span class="font-italic">Wee</span>”) at [27], the inherent powers of the court “should not be circumscribed by rigid criteria or tests.” Hence, the circumstances in which a court may set aside an order or judgment must remain sufficiently open-ended to account for previously unforeseen situations which would warrant the court stepping in to “prevent injustice or to prevent an abuse of the process of the Court” (O 92 r 4 of the Rules of Court). To deem the three circumstances as exhaustive of the grounds for setting aside would be to subsume the inherent powers of the court in the context of setting aside to those three grounds, directly contradicting the pronouncements in <span class="font-italic">Anthony Wee</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Indeed, in <span class="font-italic">Marshall v James </span>[1905] 1 Ch 432 (“<span class="font-italic">Marshall</span>”), the English High Court invoked its inherent powers to set aside a final garnishee order when none of the three circumstances were present.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 In <span class="font-italic">Marshall, </span>the applicant, Witham, carried on business in partnership with Marshall, the plaintiff, under the firm Marshall &amp; Co. By an order in an action, the plaintiff was ordered to pay James, the defendant, 33<span class="font-italic">l</span>. 11<span class="font-italic">s. </span>9<span class="font-italic">d </span>and costs. The order being unsatisfied, the defendant applied for a provisional garnishee order, ordering that all debts owing or accruing from one W.H. Cullen (“Cullen”) and another Teetgen &amp; Co Limited (“Teetgen”) to the plaintiff be attached to answer the sum which the plaintiff had been ordered to pay the defendant. At the garnishee to show cause hearing, with Cullen’s solicitors appearing and Teetgen’s solicitors not appearing, the garnishee order was made final, and Cullen and Teetgen were ordered to pay the defendant 13<span class="font-italic">l. </span>9<span class="font-italic">s. </span>and 21<span class="font-italic">l. </span>8<span class="font-italic">s. </span>4<span class="font-italic">d. </span>respectively.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Teetgen subsequently paid the sum to the defendant. However, before Cullen had complied with the order, it was discovered that the debts alleged to be due from him and Teetgen to the plaintiff had in fact been contracted with and were due to the firm of Marshall &amp; Co, rather than to the plaintiff in his personal capacity. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 As debts due and owing to Marshall &amp; Co had been wrongfully paid out under the final garnishee order to satisfy a debt owed by the plaintiff personally, the applicant, being a partner of the firm Marshall &amp; Co, applied to have the garnishee order discharged. He also applied to have any moneys paid under the garnishee order to be repaid to the garnishee (Teetgen) or to the applicant himself on behalf of Marshall &amp; Co.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Joyce J decided, on the authority of <span class="font-italic">Moore v Peachey </span>(1892) 66 L.T. 198<span class="font-italic"> </span>and on general principles, that on the proof of the mistake the court had to “remedy the injustice done by the garnishee order” (<span class="font-italic">Marshall </span>at 433). Hence, although the garnishee order had “been made final and [was] so termed”, the order as to Cullen, which remained unpaid, had to be set aside (<span class="font-italic">Marshall </span>at 433).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 As for the order against Teetgen, the evidence was unclear as to whether they had paid out the sum to the defendant under a mistake as to who the debt was owed to (whether Marshall &amp; Co or the plaintiff personally). If Teetgen had not operated under such a mistake, Joyce J observed that he could not reverse the payment. As a result of the lack of evidence, Joyce J suggested a compromise between the parties. The parties eventually agreed to a compromise, whereby the applicant would receive half of the sum of 21<span class="font-italic">l. </span>8<span class="font-italic">s. </span>4<span class="font-italic">d. </span>which had allegedly been paid out by Teetgen to the defendant under a mistake (<span class="font-italic">Marshall </span>at 434). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Reviewing the decision in <span class="font-italic">Marshall</span>, it appears that mistake on the garnishee’s part is an additional basis which would justify the invocation of the court’s inherent powers to set aside an order to prevent injustice. This demonstrates the flexibility of the court’s inherent power to set aside, and proves that the grounds for setting aside are not limited to the three circumstances expressed in <span class="font-italic">Ong Cher Keong </span>and <span class="font-italic">Sunny Daisy</span> (see [15] above).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the final garnishee order should be set aside to prevent injustice</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Nonetheless, as explained in <span class="font-italic">Roberto</span><span class="font-italic"> Building </span>at [16]<span class="font-italic">,</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>the threshold for invoking the court’s inherent powers is high, and the “essential touchstone is really that of ‘need’.” </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 “[I]n looking at the question of necessity in the context of the court’s inherent jurisdiction, one must take a sensible approach that has regard to all the circumstances of the case” (<span class="font-italic">UMCI Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Tokio Marine &amp; Fire Insurance Co (Singapore) Pte Ltd</span> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 95 at [92]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 In the context of setting aside orders, the considerations to be had in ensuring the judicious exercise of the court’s inherent powers “include having finality in litigation, the undesirability of a judge setting aside or reviewing the order made by another judge of equal standing, and the need to prevent back-door appeals and re-litigation of matters” (<span class="font-italic">Powercore</span><span class="font-italic"> Pte Ltd v D+B Projects Pte Ltd (United Overseas Bank Limited, garnishee) </span>[2017] SGDC 157<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [50]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 While such guidelines are useful, preventing injustice is ultimately an amorphous concept, and the facts of each case are of primary importance in determining whether it is warranted for the court to exercise its inherent powers. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Underlying debt no longer accruing</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 In the present case, the substratum on which the garnishee order had been obtained is now held in abeyance, as the garnishee obtained an unconditional stay of enforcement of 1AD, which consists of the debt which was attached under the present final garnishee order. The result is that, until the stay is removed, there is no debt due and owing by the garnishee to the judgment debtor, and accordingly the final garnishee order is attached to a debt that is no longer accruing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Had the garnishee order not been made final, there is no doubt that it would not have been granted in light of the series of events that have occurred. As Chitty J observed in <span class="font-italic">In</span><span class="font-italic"> re General Horticultural Co, ex p. Whitehouse </span>(1886) 32 Ch.D. 512 at 516, a judgment creditor “can only obtain what the judgment debtor could honestly give him”. Here, since the judgment debtor has been stayed from enforcing the debt which it is owed under 1AD, allowing the judgment creditor to enforce the final garnishee order which is premised on the same debt would be to allow the judgment creditor to take what the judgment debtor cannot honestly give him. This would allow the judgment creditor to stand in a better position than the judgment debtor <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> the garnishee. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Indeed, as observed in <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure </span>vol 1 (Chua Lee Ming ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 9th Ed, 2019) at para 49/1/27, while “[t]he question [as to] whether a judgment upon which there is a stay of execution can be attached has never been decided”, “[i]t should follow however, that until the stay is removed there can be no attachment” by way of a garnishee order. This is because a garnishee order is a parasitic order: it is suspended if the right to call on the debt on which it is based is suspended (see <span class="font-italic">Glegg</span><span class="font-italic"> v Bromley </span>[1912] 3 KB 474 at 484). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Exposing the garnishee to a debt which it may not even owe</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Furthermore, upholding the garnishee order could expose the garnishee to a debt which it may not even owe.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Similar circumstances were before the English Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Hale v Victoria Plumbing Co Ltd and another </span>[1966] 2 QB 746 (“<span class="font-italic">Hale</span>”). There, the judgment creditor obtained judgment against the judgment debtor for £256 13<span class="font-italic">s. </span>10<span class="font-italic">d</span><span class="font-italic">. </span>The judgment debt being unsatisfied, the judgment creditor sought to attach a debt which it alleged to be owing from the garnishee to the judgment debtor in satisfaction of the judgment debt which it was owed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 At the garnishee to show cause hearing, the garnishee contended that it had claims against the judgment debtor in excess of the amount which it owed the judgment debtor under the sub-contracts. The transactions between the garnishee and the judgment debtor arose out of building contracts in which the judgment debtor had been appointed as a sub-contractor. Owing to works alleged to have been badly done by the judgment debtor, the garnishee disputed its indebtedness to the judgment debtor in respect of the works. Notwithstanding its potential counterclaim against the judgment debtor, the District Registrar ordered that the garnishee order be made final.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 On appeal, even though it was unclear that the garnishee’s counterclaim against the judgment debtor was valid, the court unanimously deemed it appropriate to set aside the final garnishee order. As Danckwerts LJ observed in plain terms (<span class="font-italic">Hale </span>at 751): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It seems to me to be <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">contrary to justice</span><span class="font-italic"> and sense to order that a garnishee should </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">pay out money which it appears probably will not be due from him at all</span> - because no proceedings have been taken by the judgment debtor against the garnishee, any more than any proceedings have been taken by the garnishee against the judgment debtor. It seems to me contrary to justice that an order should be made for payment of moneys which on the face of it appear not likely to be due and which might perhaps be paid away irretrievably to a man or company who is in trouble. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 In the present case, while 1AD, being a SOPA adjudication determination, has temporary finality in that it “finally and conclusively determin[es] the parties’ rights”, it is liable to being reversed by final adjudication in accordance with the provisions of SOPA (<span class="font-italic">W Y Steel Construction Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Osko Pte Ltd </span>[2013] 3 SLR 380 at [71]). If, upon final adjudication, it is determined that no debt is in fact due from the garnishee to the judgment debtor, the garnishee would have paid to the judgment creditor a debt which it did not even owe. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 In fact, contrary to <span class="font-italic">Hale </span>whereby the garnishee’s counterclaim was merely alleged through an affidavit, an adjudicator has in fact determined that the liquidated damages and back-charges owed by the judgment debtor to the garnishee would likely outweigh the value of works which remain unpaid by the garnishee to the judgment debtor. Here, the second adjudicator in 2AD had, after considering the valuation of works in 1AD <span class="font-italic">as well as </span>liquidated damages and back-charges which were not before the adjudicator in 1AD, arrived at a negative sum of $1,176,050.67.

</div>
</div> Therefore, the garnishee’s counterclaim has been determined to be valid and has temporary finality by virtue of 2AD. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 In the circumstances, it is plainly unjust to order the garnishee to pay the sum for a debt which is no longer enforceable, and which it may not even owe. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Insolvency of judgment debtor</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The injustice is exacerbated given that I have separately found on the back of clear and objective evidence that the judgment debtor is insolvent (<span class="font-italic">UIS v CTPL </span>at [26]). As a result, allowing the enforcement of the final garnishee order could have the effect of unduly favouring the judgment creditor at the expense of the garnishee should the judgment debtor later be subject to an insolvent winding up.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 To elaborate, if the final garnishee order is upheld and remains enforceable by the judgment creditor, the garnishee would have to pay out the sum stipulated in the garnishee order, which sum represents much of the value of the works done by the judgment debtor for the garnishee. Thereafter, if it is determined by final adjudication that the garnishee has a valid counterclaim against the judgment debtor, the counterclaim amount would not simply offset the value of works done by the judgment debtor which remain unpaid. Instead, as the works done by the judgment debtor would in large have been paid by the garnishee pursuant to the garnishee order, the garnishee would have to make a full claim on its counterclaim for the liquidated damages and back-charges which it is owed by the judgment debtor.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Such a counterclaim would be unproblematic if the judgment debtor were solvent. However, given the judgment debtor’s insolvency, it may not be able to pay out the counterclaim in full. If the judgment debtor then goes into an insolvent winding up, the garnishee would have to rank among unsecured creditors in the scheme of priorities, and may not have its counterclaim satisfied in full. Meanwhile, as the judgment creditor’s claim would have been satisfied in full by the garnishee order, the judgment creditor would not have to compete with other unsecured creditors.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Were the garnishee order set aside, the scheme of priorities in the event of an insolvent winding up would remain unchanged: both the judgment creditor and the garnishee (should the value of its counterclaim exceed the value of works done by the judgment debtor) would have to rank equally as unsecured creditors to have their debts satisfied.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 As a result, allowing the final garnishee order to be upheld and enforced could benefit the judgment creditor to the detriment of the garnishee. As the garnishee may not even owe a debt to the judgment debtor, such circumstances mandate that the court exercises its residual discretion to prevent injustice. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The need to prevent injustice to the garnishee</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Garnishee proceedings serve to facilitate the satisfaction of judgment debts. Garnishees, in this regard, often have no objections to garnishee orders being made final, so long as there is a discernible debt due and owing to the judgment debtor; once such indebtedness is established, it is inconsequential to the garnishee who the debt is paid to. However, garnishee orders are premised on indebtedness – without such indebtedness to the judgment debtor, it would be plainly unjust to order a party to pay a sum to the judgment creditor.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 In the circumstances, given that (a) the enforcement of the underlying debt is stayed, (b) the garnishee may ultimately owe no debt to the judgment debtor, and (c) the judgment debtor’s insolvency may work to the detriment of the garnishee, the present case fully necessitates the invocation of the court’s inherent powers to prevent injustice befalling the garnishee.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 As a result, I order that the final garnishee order be set aside. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 I will hear parties on costs if not agreed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Chan Seng Onn  <br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right"><br/>Lee Mei Yong Debbie (ECYT Law LLC) for the appellant;<br/>Lynette Chew and Lu Huiru Grace (Holborn Law LLC) for the respondent. </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-List text-justify"> </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
