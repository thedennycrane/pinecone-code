<i xmlns=""><b>
<p>Introduction</p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">        This was a petition by the

public prosecutor for the criminal revision of the decision of district judge See Kee Oon

in MAC 4000/02. The accused, Loo Kun Long (‘Loo’), pleaded guilty to the charge

of knowingly being in possession of three obscene films, contrary to s 30(2)(a) of the

Films Act (Cap 107, 1998 ed)(‘the Act’). The district judge convicted Loo of

that charge and imposed on him a fine of $500 per film, i.e. $1,500 or 15 days

imprisonment in default. Loo was also convicted and sentenced on two other charges, but

those charges were irrelevant for the purposes of this criminal revision.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">2        The only issue before me

was whether the fine imposed by the district judge, pursuant to s 30(2)(a), was wrong in

law and should be quashed by an exercise of my powers of criminal revision.</p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">The decision below</p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3        Section 30 reads:</p>
<font size="3" xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">30(1) – Any person who has in his possession any obscene film

    shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a <i>fine of not less

    than $500 for each such film</i> he had in his possession (but not to exceed in the

    aggregate $20,000) or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or to both.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">30(2) Any person who has in his possession any obscene film knowing or

    having reasonable cause to believe the film to be obscene shall be guilty of an offence

    and <i>shall be liable on conviction </i>-</p>
<i><blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) to a fine of $1,000 for each such film in his possession (but not

      to exceed in the aggregate $40,000) or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months

      or to both;</p>
<p align="justify">(b) in the case of a second or subsequent conviction, to a fine of not

      less than $2,000 for each such film in his possession (but not to exceed in the aggregate

      $80,000) or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or to both. [emphasis added]</p>
</blockquote></i></blockquote></blockquote></font>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4        There are three possible

interpretations of the phrase "shall be liable … to a fine of $1,000 for each

such film" in s 30(2)(a). First, a ‘fixed quantum’ of $1,000 must be

imposed. Secondly, the maximum fine which may be imposed is $1,000 and thirdly, the

minimum fined which must be imposed is $1,000. In imposing a fine of $500 per film on Loo,

the district judge interpreted the phrase to mean that he had a discretion to impose a

maximum fine of $1,000 per film, i.e. the second possible interpretation. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5        The district judge rejected

the first possible interpretation, i.e. that s 30(2)(a) prescribes a fixed quantum of

$1,000. He found that there was no compelling reason for Parliament to remove the

court’s discretion entirely only for the first offence of knowingly possessing

obscene films when it clearly allowed the courts a discretion in sentencing all the other

offences in the Act. In particular, s 30(2)(b) confers a discretion on the courts in

respect of sentencing repeat offenders of the same offence of knowingly possessing obscene

films as it expressly stipulates a mandatory minimum fine of $2,000, subject to an

aggregate of $80,000. There should be no reason why the court should have a discretion in

imposing a sentence for repeat offenders, but not first time offenders. Reading s 30(2)(a)

literally would lead to absurdity for another reason. Under s 30(1), if a person is

convicted of a strict liability offence of possession of an obscene film, the court has

the power to impose a fine of at least $500 per film but not exceeding $20,000 in

aggregate. It would be absurd if the court must impose a fixed fine of $1,000 for the

offence of knowingly possessing an obscene film while it retains the discretion to impose

a fine of more than $1,000 for the lesser offence of mere possession of obscene films.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6        As between the second

interpretation, i.e. that the court has the discretion to impose a maximum fine of $1,000,

and the third interpretation, i.e. that the court has the discretion to impose a minimum

fine of $1,000, the district judge initially chose the second interpretation. He explained

that he was influenced by the fact that, <i>prima facie</i>, the expression "shall be

liable" does not connote any specific mandatory sentence, much less any mandatory

minimum sentence. He relied on the decisions of the High Court in <i>PP v Lee Soon Lee

Vincent</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=46962&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1998] 3 SLR 552</a>, at  14, followed in <i>Chng Gim Huat v PP </i><a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=59015&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[2000] 3 SLR 262</a> for this proposition. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7        However, in his grounds, he

admitted that the second interpretation was not correct. With the benefit of further

research and hindsight, he agreed with the contention of the DPP in this revision that the

third interpretation was the correct one. This was because a speech made in Parliament by

the Minister for Information and the Arts during the Second Reading of the Films

(Amendment) Bill on 27 February 1998 clarified the intention of Parliament to impose a

mandatory minimum fine of $1,000 for the offence of possession of obscene films. The

Minister made the following statement:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">Sir, the current penalties are clearly not of sufficient

    deterrence. In this Bill, we are therefore proposing enhanced penalties…..For the

    possession of obscene film and videos, the <i><u>minimum fine</u> will also be doubled

    from $500 to $1,000 per film, up to a maximum of $40,000</i>. [emphasis mine]</p>
</font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">My decision</p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8        In my view, the DPP and the

district judge rightly adopted the interpretation that s 30(2)(a) gives the court a

discretion to impose a fine of not less than $1,000 per film with an aggregate not

exceeding $40,000. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9        The district judge

correctly rejected the literal interpretation of s 30(2)(a). He elucidated clearly the

absurdity and anomaly that would result if a literal interpretation was adopted such that

the courts’ hands were tied in sentencing because it would have to impose a fixed

fine of $1,000 per film. Such an interpretation would be inconsistent with the approach

taken by the draftsman in the rest of s 30, as pointed out by the district judge whose

reasoning I have set out at  5.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10        The remaining issue was

whether $1,000 is the maximum or minimum fine that the court can impose when it exercises

its discretion in sentencing. The language of s 30(2)(a) is ambiguous. Difficulties arise

in both interpreting $1,000 as a maximum or minimum fine. The imposition of a maximum fine

of $1,000 appears to be inconsistent with the rest of s 30 which empowers the court to

impose a discretionary fine subject to a mandatory minimum for all the other offences of

possession of obscene films. On the other hand, the expression "shall be liable"

does not, <i>prima facie</i>, connote any specific mandatory punishment, such as a fixed

quantum of fine: <i>PP v Lee Soon Lee Vincent</i>. <i>A fortiori</i>, the phrase does not

necessarily impose a mandatory minimum sentence.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">11        In the face of the

ambiguity in the statutory language, an interpretation that would promote the purpose or

object underlying s 30(2)(a) would be preferred to one which would not do so: s 9A(1) of

the Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 1997 ed.). Furthermore, since this s 30(2)(a) is ambiguous

and a literal reading of the provision is manifestly absurd or unreasonable, in view of

its context, purpose and object, I am entitled to take into account any relevant debates

in Parliament to interpret it, pursuant to s 9A(2)(b) read with s 9A(3)(d) of the

Interpretation Act. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">12        In the present case, the

intention of Parliament in amending s 30(2)(a) was clearly stated in the speech made by

the Minister for Information and the Arts in Parliament during the Second Reading of the

Films (Amendment) Bill on 27 February 1998. In the passage of his speech quoted at  7,

the Minister referred to the doubling of the "minimum fine" from $500 to $1,000

per film, up to a maximum of $40,000, for the possession of obscene films, so as to ensure

that the penalties serve as a sufficient deterrence. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">13        The Minister’s

reference to the previous minimum fine of $500 was a reference to the old statutory

scheme, i.e. the Films Act (1981 ed.). Section 29(1)(a) of the old Act, which dealt with

the offence of possession of obscene films, stated that any person who has in his

possession any obscene film shall be guilty of an offence and "shall be liable on

conviction ….to a fine of <i>not less than $500 </i>for each such film he had in his

possession (but not to exceed in aggregate $20,000)...". The wording of the section

clearly and expressly provided for a minimum fine of $500 per film, for the offence of

possession of obscene films. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">14        Section 30(2)(a) of the

present Films Act was enacted to put into effect Parliament’s intention to raise the

"minimum fine" from $500, as stipulated in s 29(1)(a) of the old Act, to $1,000

per film. Unfortunately, the draftsman of the present Films Act did not retain the clear

wording of s 29(1)(a), i.e. that an offender was liable "to a fine of not less than

$X" to reflect the intention of Parliament to retain the scheme of minimum fines.

Instead, the draftsman adopted the ambiguous language of "shall be liable on

conviction to a fine of $1,000…". In my view, this was a slip in drafting.

Consequently, the literal reading of s 30(2)(a) does not reflect the true intention of

Parliament and should be rejected. Applying s 9A(1) of the Interpretation Act, s 30(2)(a)

must be read to impose a mandatory minimum fine of $1,000 per film for the offence of

knowingly being in possession of obscene films to give effect to the clear and express

intention of Parliament in enacting the subsection. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">15        For the sake of

completeness, it was also necessary to deal with the effect of s 41 of the Interpretation

Act. That section stipulates that:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">Whenever in any written law a penalty is provided for an

    offence, such provision shall imply that such offence shall be punishable upon conviction

    by a penalty not exceeding (except as may be otherwise expressly mentioned in the written

    law) the penalty provided.</p></font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">A straight application of s 41 of the Interpretation Act to the

construction of s 30(2)(a) would mean that a court in sentencing offenders under the

subsection can only impose a maximum fine of $1,000. The application of s 41 of the

Interpretation Act conflicts with the application of s 9A(1) of the same Act. The DPP

contended that s 9A(1) should take precedence over s 41. I agreed with him. Section 9A(1)

encapsulates the fundamental and paramount principle that a purposive interpretation of

statutes is to be preferred as it gives effect to Parliament’s intention. Bearing in

mind that the court’s role in the interpretation and application of the law is to

give effect to, and not hinder the fulfillment of, Parliament’s intention, s 9A(1)

should take precedence over any other tools of statutory interpretation, including s 41.

Accordingly, s 41 should not prevent the court from adopting an interpretation of s

30(2)(a) which gives effect to Parliament’s intention to impose a minimum fine of

$1,000 per film.</p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">Conclusion</p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">16        For the above reasons, I

allowed the petition for criminal revision and enhanced the fine imposed on Loo from $500

to $1,000 per film for each of the three obscene films that he possessed contrary to s

30(2)(a) of the Act, i.e. the total fine imposed was increased from $1,500 to $3,000.

Since Loo had already paid the fines of $1,500 previously imposed on him by the district

judge, he must pay an additional fine of $1,500 or serve 15 days imprisonment in default.</p>
