<strong>Judgment:</strong>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><u><font color="#800000">GROUNDS OF DECISION</font></u></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">1. The plaintiff is the widow of Quek Cheok Boon. The first and second defendants

are their children and are also the executors of the estate of their father Quek Cheok Boon,

deceased. The third defendant is one of the banks in which Quek Cheok Boon, deceased and the

plaintiff held joint accounts, and is being sued by the plaintiff presently on allegations of

complicity in fraud. The fourth defendant is the daughter-in-law of the plaintiff and wife of the

fifth defendant. The sixth, seventh and eighth defendants are the grandchildren of the plaintiff and

the children of the fourth and fifth defendants.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">2. The plaintiffs claim in this suit is essentially for a declaration that she

is solely entitled to the monies in the four joint accounts opened by her deceased husband in their

joint names. The will of Quek Cheok Boon, deceased was read on 28 February 1998. Through this will

Quek Cheok Boon, the deceased declared that the funds in the joint accounts were to be used for

various purposes set out in the will. The defendants (other than the third defendants) consequently

assert that the money in these accounts belong to the estate and not to the plaintiff solely. The

monies had mostly been withdrawn by the plaintiff and paid to the estate account held by the

executors. The plaintiff alleges that she did this under threat by one of the executors.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3. The plaintiff by her counsel Mr. K.S. Chung, applied under O 14 r 12 to

determine this action on a preliminary point of law. A court may proceed to hear the preliminary

point if two conditions set out in r 12 are met. I now set out O 14 r 12 for convenience:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"12.  (1) The Court may, upon the application of a party or of its own

  motion, determine any question of law or construction of any document arising in any cause or

  matter at any stage of the proceedings where it appears to the Court that </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) such question is suitable for determination without a full trial of the

    action; and</p>
<p align="justify">(b) such determination will fully determine (subject only to any possible

    appeal) the entire cause or matter or any claim or issue therein.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">(2) Upon such determination, the Court may dismiss the cause or matter or make

  such order or judgment as it thinks just.</p>
<p align="justify">(3) The Court shall not determine any question under this Order unless the

  parties have had an opportunity of being heard on the question.</p>
<p align="justify">(4) Nothing in this Order shall limit the powers of the Court under Order 18,

  Rule 19, or any other provision of these Rules."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4. Mr. Chung sought to impress upon me that there can be no defence to the

plaintiffs claim simply because the plaintiff is entitled to the money as the right of

survivorship cannot be challenged. Counsel referred me to the High Court decision in <i>Banque

Indosuez v Sumilan Awal aka Aw Kim Lan &amp; Ors </i>(unreported). In the present case, the

proposition that a bank will honour the demand of a survivor in a joint account is not in dispute

but that is not what the principal issue is all about. It is about the intention of the testator

when he opened the joint accounts. In this respect the <i>Awal</i> case does not assist the

plaintiff here. In <i>Awal</i>, the court made a finding of fact as to the intention of the testator

there but did so only after a full trial. Mr. Chungs reliance on <i>Kamla Lal Hiranand v Harilela

Padma Hari </i><nobr>[2000] 3 SLR 696</nobr> is also misplaced because the facts and circumstances in this case

are entirely different. In <i>Kamla Lal Hiranand </i>the court was satisfied that the issue was

whether a particular document was -</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"valid for the purpose of creating and/or evidencing a trust in the estate

  of the deceased is one suitable for determination under O 14 r 12. The determination of this

  question will fully resolve the issue as to whether an unattested testamentary document can in law

  create and/or evidence a trust in the estate of the pleadings that have been filed, this is

  clearly a disputed point of law involved."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5. The affidavits filed by all parties concerned indicate clearly that there is a

crucial issue of fact that must be tried, namely, what was the intention of Quek Cheok Boon and the

plaintiff when they opened the four joint accounts. Even Mr. Chung in his letter of 31 August 2001

requesting for further arguments to be heard, acknowledged the contentious nature of the affidavits.

The material facts set out in the affidavit of the plaintiff are being challenged by the defendants

an vice versa, and in the circumstances, I am of the view that this is not a proper case for

determination under O 14 r 12. Mr. Chung conceded that the intention of Quek Cheok Boon at the time

of opening the joint accounts is "a significant issue of fact" (paragraph 12 of Mr. Chungs

Reply to fourth to eighth defendants counsels submission). That concession itself is

sufficient to defeat an application for a trial on a preliminary point of law, which point, in my

view, was not stated in the plaintiffs application with sufficient clarity. It is not for me to

evaluate the merits of the conflicting claims at this stage because it is not possible to make a

conclusive determination based on affidavit evidence alone. The affidavits and submissions of

counsel indicate that each side has its apparent strengths and weaknesses and these can only be

explored fully at trial.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6. There is no doubt that the disputes as to facts are material. For example,

plaintiff asserts in paragraph 4 of her affidavit of 27 June 2001 that during her "husbands

lifetime, the monies in the above four joint accounts belonged to him and me to be used as a common

purse and a pool of our resources and after his death, the monies would go to me as survivor and

joint accountee of the above four accounts". Indeed, that was the thrust of her case. The

defendants case is that the plaintiffs name was added into the account by her husband for

convenience only. It is their case that the bequests made by Quek Cheok Boon, deceased, in his will

would be rendered nugatory if he had intended the plaintiff to all the money when he died. It is not

necessary for me to deal with each and every allegation and refutation in the affidavits.

Furthermore, the allegations of fraud against the third defendant are allegations of fact that

cannot be determined by affidavit alone. The affidavits present a rich foretaste of a contentious

trial and it is wholly inappropriate presently to make a determination of the point of law. If the

point is that a survivor of a joint account is entitled to the money in the account then the answer

is a straightforward <i>yes</i> unless it can be shown that the survivor held the money as a

trustee, as is central to the dispute in this case. What was presented as the point of law was

crafted by the plaintiffs solicitor as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"The point of law is whether upon the facts pleaded in the Statement of

  Claim, the monies in the undermentioned four joint accounts held by the plaintiff and her late

  husband Quek Cheok Boon (the deceased) belonged to her or his estate upon his death upon her

  surviving the deceased "</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">The material facts that form the bedrock of any claim by a survivor of a joint

account are in dispute. The intention of the account holders as the purpose of opening the joint

accounts are also in dispute. Consequently, it is clear from the wording of the plaintiffs

application which I had reproduced above cannot be determined at this stage.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7. In these circumstances, the application under O 14 r 12 must fail. There is no

question that the intention of Quek Cheok Boon can only be determined "from a careful

assessment of the facts" as Prof. Ellinger pointed out at page 230 of "Modern Banking

Law", 2<sup>nd</sup> Ed., to which I would only add that such an assessment cannot be complete

without the facts deposed being tested under the fire of cross-examination. Mr. Chung is therefore

incorrect to say that "All that is necessary for the plaintiff to prove is the joint accounts

and the fact of her survivorship" (paragraph 25 of Mr. Chungs Reply to fourth to eighth

defendants counsels submission).</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8. For the reasons above, the application for a determination was dismissed.</p>
