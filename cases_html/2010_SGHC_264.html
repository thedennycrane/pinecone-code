<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was a claim for a summary order for account
                    under Order 43 Rule 1 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev
                    Ed) by a private banking customer against a bank. The accounts sought were in
                    respect of certain transactions that took place in relation to the
                    customer’s bank accounts with the bank.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The plaintiff is an Indian national. Sometime in
                    2002, the plaintiff opened an account (“Account 1”) with the
                    defendant bank. In or around late 2005, the plaintiff submitted his application
                    for permanent residence in Singapore for himself and his family under the
                    Financial Investor Scheme (“FIS”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The FIS was introduced by the Monetary Authority
                    of Singapore (“MAS”) to attract foreign individuals of
                    considerable net worth to park their assets with financial institutions in
                    Singapore. In return, these individuals would be granted permanent residency
                    status in Singapore. Under the terms of the FIS, each applicant must, among
                    other things, place financial assets worth at least S$5 million in a financial
                    institution regulated by the MAS. These assets must be held in a designated
                    account under the FIS for a continuous period of 5 years commencing from the
                    date of issuance of the applicant’s Entry Permit. (In all probability the
                    plaintiff had already been in Singapore for some time before Account 1 was
                    opened.)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Account 1 was the designated account for the
                    purposes of the plaintiff’s permanent residency application under the FIS.
                    With more than S$5 million in assets already deposited in Account 1 at the time
                    the application was made, the plaintiff qualified for permanent residency under
                    the FIS. He was granted Singapore permanent residency status on 3 April
                    2006.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Subsequently, the plaintiff grew unhappy with
                    the defendant bank’s services. In April 2009, the plaintiff opened a
                    second account (“Account 2”) with the defendant bank. His
                    purported intention was to transfer the financial assets from Account 1 to
                    Account 2 in the hope of having a fresh start with the bank. However, for
                    reasons that are unclear at this point, the assets were only transferred on
                    7 July 2009. Frustrated with what he perceived as the defendant
                    bank’s incompetence, the plaintiff gave instructions for the transfer of
                    the financial assets in Account 2 to a separate bank account held with Credit
                    Suisse (“the Credit Suisse account”) on 15 July 2009. Both
                    Account 1 and Account 2 were then closed on 21 July 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       In his submissions, the plaintiff alleged that
                    the original sum of more than S$5 million had been depleted to approximately
                    S$3.9 million by the end of 2008. The plaintiff also alleged that following the
                    transfer of the assets to the Credit Suisse account, their total value had
                    fallen even further to approximately S$3.6 million. Not convinced by the
                    defendant bank’s explanation that the losses were entirely attributable to
                    fluctuations in the market, the plaintiff brought this application for an order
                    for account and payment under O 43 r 1.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Law and application</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Theory</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Order 43 relates to a specialised form of
                    accounting inquiry commonly ordered in administration actions, partnership
                    actions and actions for specific performance. It is not usually applied for in
                    the context of banker-customer relations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Upon hearing an application under O 43
                    r 1,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">the Court may, unless satisfied by the defendant by affidavit or otherwise
                        that there is some preliminary question to be tried, order that an account
                        be taken and may also order that any amount certified on taking the account
                        to be due to either party be paid to him within a time specified in the
                        order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The key concept here is that of the “preliminary
                    question”. Counsel for the defendant submitted that there were several
                    – for instance, whether the defendant was actually a fiduciary of the
                    plaintiff, whether the assets had been held in cash or in other instruments,
                    whether unauthorized third parties had dealt with the plaintiff’s assets
                    in Account 1 and Account 2, and how it came to be that the plaintiff’s
                    assets in those accounts had suddenly become emaciated in 2008, and even more so
                    in their subsequent transfer to the plaintiff’s Credit Suisse
                    account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       To my mind, these questions relate to
                    substantive matters that should properly be canvassed at trial. All that had to
                    be shown by the plaintiff here, to qualify for relief under O 43 r 1,
                    was simply that the defendant was “under a duty to render true
                    accounts” (see <em>Mascom (M) Sdn Bhd &amp; Anor v
                        Kamawang Enterprise Sdn Bhd &amp; Anor</em> [2006] 6 MLJ 701
                        (“<em>Mascom</em>”)), and that
                    “the defendant must be an accounting party, whatever the outcome of the
                    trial” (see <em>The Supreme Court Practice 1993 Volume
                        I</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 1993) at [43/1/4] (“the English
                    White Book”), addressing the English version of O 43 r 1, which
                    is <em>in pari materia</em> to ours).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     
          <em>Mascom</em> was a
                    partnership case which concerned allegations of fraud. It was held there that so
                    long as there was an undisputed partnership in existence, the respondent
                    partners would be entitled to an account. The various issues relating to the
                    broader overarching matter of fraud were not preliminary questions to be tried
                    before the taking of an account could be ordered. This was a sensible approach
                    to take, because the claim to an account in <em>Mascom</em>
                    was one not founded on questions of fact relating to the main cause of action,
                    but rather <em>on the duty of partners in any event to render
                        true accounts</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     This principle can be extended. In our case,
                    there is not a partnership to speak of but simply a bank, cast with certain
                    duties to its customers. It has long been established that the banker and
                    customer relationship is one of debtor and creditor, and not of trusteeship (see
                    generally <em>Foley v Hill</em> (1848) 2 H.L.
                    Cas. 28). Accordingly, the plaintiff’s bare assertion that the bank
                    owes the plaintiff an account based on a pre-existing fiduciary relationship
                    must fail, for this issue, at this juncture, on this application. Any
                    establishment of fiduciary duty on the bank’s part involves extraneous
                    questions of fact that must be decided at trial, and therefore cannot be used to
                    overcome the preliminary requirements of the summary procedure under O 43
                    r 1.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     However, it is both commonsensical and
                    intuitive that there must nonetheless be an implied contractual term that a bank
                    must provide accurate statements of account to its customers. A bank is a debtor
                    to its depositing customers (who, naturally, are its creditors). How else are
                    these customers to know the precise quantum owed them, and the extent of their
                    right to recall, if proper accounts are not kept by the debtor bank, the party
                    to whom monies are paid and who assumes ownership of the same monies? Indeed, in
                    the present case the defendant bank was to have, according to the terms of the
                    FIS, “booked and managed” the plaintiff’s assets in Account
                    1 and Account 2.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     To be sure, the accounting duty for a bank
                    – so as to render intelligible the customer’s right of recall
                    – is not an onerous one. The bank simply has to indicate (1) when monies
                    – including any interest – were paid in or paid out, (2) by whom,
                    and (3) what currently stands as the existing account balance. Indeed this is a
                    service we have all come to take for granted when we go to the automated teller
                    machine, or when we have our passbooks updated at the local branch. The
                    plaintiff’s situation here – with allegedly losses of millions at
                    stake – is merely the everyday writ large. In J Milnes Holden, <em>The Law and Practice of Banking (Volume 1: Banker and Customer) 5th
                        Ed</em> (Pitman Publishing, 1991), the author observes candidly at
                    [2-132] - [2-133] that</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[t]here is probably an implied term in the contract between banker and
                        customer that the banker will supply his customer either with a passbook or
                        with statements containing a copy of the customer’s account with the
                        banker. … The banks maintain a high standard of accuracy in their
                        bookkeeping and in the writing up of passbooks or the preparation of
                        statements.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In <em>Lloyds Bank v Brooks</em> [1950] Journal
                    of the Institute of Bankers, Vol LXXII 114, Lynskey J states at
                    pp 121-2:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It seems to me in this case there was a duty on the bank to keep the
                        defendant correctly informed as to the position of her account, and there
                        was a duty on the bank not to over-credit her statement of account
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In our present case, the concern is with over-debiting, but it is easy
                    to surmise that the general principle is common to both.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Practice</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The hypothetical objector now pipes up: surely
                    the process of discovery would suffice for reckoning the proper state of the
                    plaintiff’s account? Surely there must have been statements of account
                    that were auto-generated by the defendant bank and sent to the plaintiff at
                    regular intervals? Unfortunately, this point is far from clear at this juncture.
                    The plaintiff alleged that it had received nothing, and that it even had to ask
                    MAS for annual reports (that were actually only due to be submitted to MAS) to
                    ascertain the state of his own bank account. The defendant, on the other hand,
                    maintained that there had been a hold mail arrangement with the plaintiff in
                    place until February 2009, pursuant to which the plaintiff’s bank
                    statements would not be mailed to the plaintiff, but rather would be held for
                    the plaintiff at the bank. According to the defendant, under its terms and
                    conditions it retained the prerogative to shred mail that remained uncollected
                    for more than 2 years.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     These issues, like those highlighted by the
                    defendant at <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> above, are therefore factual
                    matters strictly for determination at trial. Discovery, consequently, might or
                    might not have been sufficient.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In any case, this preference for discovery has
                    its grounding in practical concerns, not legal ones. When we consider the issue
                    of practicality for applications of the present variety, it appears that much
                    falls in favour of their grant. To begin with, a summary order for account might
                    end these kinds of disputes conclusively at an early stage of proceedings,
                    saving parties and the courts both costs and time. Indeed, O 43 r 1
                    provides the court with discretion for ordering payment relief upon the taking
                    of an account. The English White Book sets out the following at [43/1/4]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If the taking of accounts will end the dispute between the parties, the
                        Order should direct payment of the balance declared due and of any
                        consequential costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Secondly, even if the payment remedy is not
                    ordered outright, the account itself, once taken, will certainly help narrow the
                    arguable issues for trial. In cases such as the present one, the taking of
                    accounts is almost certainly an inevitable eventuality; an earlier focus might
                    help streamline subsequent proceedings at trial. In this regard, the preceding
                    excerpt from the English White Book provides some implied sanction. The passage
                    (and necessarily O 43 r 1 itself) contemplates a middle ground where
                    accounts are ordered without concomitant payment. There must be some rationale
                    for this discretion, and to my mind the rationale would include the practical
                    benefits just enunciated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     In <em>Goh Say Hun v Ooi Chit
                        Lee &amp; Anor</em> [1994] 1 SLR(R) 958 (“<em>Goh Say Hun</em>”), this middle ground was precisely
                    employed. The appellant brought an action in the High Court against two
                    respondents, her daughter and son-in-law, asserting that they had wrongly
                    received and used money belonging to her. This money had been placed in several
                    bank accounts jointly operated by her and her daughter. The appellant sought a
                    full and proper account of these expenditures, and eventually took out an
                    application for a summary order that accounts be taken under O 43 r 1.
                    The Assistant Registrar hearing her application made an order that an account be
                    taken in respect of withdrawals and expenditure of any money from the relevant
                    joint bank accounts by the daughter, but <em>did not make an
                        order that any amount found due upon taking the account be paid to the
                        appellant</em>. At the hearing for the taking of accounts, it was
                    found that the daughter had received a total of S$963,100.43 belonging to the
                    appellant, of which sum S$338,142.91 could not be accounted for. On appeal, it
                    was held that this latter sum was properly accountable by the daughter to the
                    appellant, since it was not disputed that the daughter was a trustee of the
                    appellant in respect of the money.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Two points are worth observing from <em>Goh Say Hun</em>. One, the middle ground approach was indeed
                    employed in that case, although the Court of Appeal eventually decided that the
                    Assistant Registrar ought to have made the order for payment concurrently. This
                    fact, however, does not prejudice the general <em>approach</em>. In <em>Goh Say Hun</em>, the
                    question of trusteeship could be settled at the accounting stage because it was
                    not disputed. Accordingly, payment ordered at that stage, as indicated by the
                    Court of Appeal, would not have been improper. In the present case, parties are
                    disputing everything – from whether there was any trustee relationship at
                    all, to the nature of the assets actually deposited in the two accounts, to the
                    identity of the party or parties who ultimately effected the allegedly
                    unauthorized transactions in (primarily) Account 1. Given all of this, the only
                    issue that may be settled at this pre-accounting stage is the question of the
                    bank’s duty to account: and to my mind the bank <em>has</em> an implied duty to account to the plaintiff as customer, as
                    has already been discussed above at <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a>-<a href="#p1_13">[13]</a>. Accordingly the
                        <em>quantity</em> and <em>quality</em> of assets that had been in Account 1 and Account 2,
                    along with the agents of their alteration, ought to be made clear by the
                    defendant bank. Aside from this, it would be premature to countenance any
                    further arguments on payment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Two, an order for account is not a procedure
                    as summary as one might think – there is every possibility of a
                    court-ordered hearing for the taking of accounts. <em>Singapore
                        Civil Procedure 2007</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell Asia, 2007) sets out
                    the following at [43/1/1]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Accounts and inquiries may deal with purely formal matters (such as
                        computing the interest payable on completion in a specific performance
                        action), or they <em>may be indistinguishable from a full
                            trial with witnesses</em>. For this reason there is no standard
                        procedure laid down in the rules. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Accordingly, the defendant bank in the present case suffers no
                    prejudice from having this aspect of the matter dealt with at this point in
                    time. The label for O 43 r 1 has it as a “summary” order
                    for account, but there will be every opportunity for the defendant (and
                    plaintiff) to iron out issues relating to an accurate taking of the
                    accounts.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     As far as I could see, the threshold
                    requirements for activating O 43 r 1 were met in the context of the
                    present case. Every bank has an implied contractual duty to maintain and provide
                    accurate accounts for its customers. Additionally, the practical benefits of
                    ordering an account here warranted, to my mind, the court’s exercise of
                    its discretion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     There might be some worries that banks will be
                    faced with onerous duties. I do not see the merit in this concern. A bank, in
                    the business of lending and owing, necessarily has to maintain accurate accounts
                    of its customers’ accounts. (The defendant bank here in fact claimed that
                    it did.) An order for account under O 43 r 1, therefore, will usually
                    not have to be resorted to by its customers. The situation that came before the
                    court here presented something unique, since the receipt of regular statements
                    of account by the plaintiff from the defendant was and is still disputed.
                    Accordingly, it would appear that the floodgates remain safely
                shut.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In light of the foregoing, I granted the
                    plaintiff’s prayer for an account of all sums due from the defendant bank
                    to the plaintiff in respect of Account 1 and Account 2. As outlined above at
                        <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a> and rationalized at <a href="#p1_19">[19]</a>, these accounts should indicate <em>only</em> (1) when monies (including interest) were paid in
                    or paid out of Account 1 and Account 2, (2) by whom, and (3) the amount
                    transferred out of Account 2, before its closure, into the Credit Suisse
                    account. There is no necessity or legal basis for any further detail at this
                    interlocutory stage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     All other prayers, save for costs, were
                    dismissed.</p>
