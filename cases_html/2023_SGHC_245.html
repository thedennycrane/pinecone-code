</div> Indeed, I did not see any such contractual obligation in the express words of the contract. There was also no pleading of implication as a matter of business necessity. Such a term would not in any event be necessary in all situations; it is entirely conceivable that the parties would have agreed to a process by which only invoices were to be relied upon. The upshot of this was that the plaintiff was entitled to claim on the face of the invoices or orders issued. This would however be subject to the defendants adducing evidence that no work was in fact done, which was an evidential issue to which I now turn.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 On this issue, while the defendants took issue with the allegation of abandonment and non-completion, I found on the balance of probabilities that the second defendant did not complete and had abandoned the work. This conclusion was in line with much of the documentary evidence, the inherent probabilities of the situation, and the testimony in court. There was little to support the defendants’ version on this score. Their attacks, particularly on the documentary evidence, were not enough to show that the plaintiff’s case was not more probable. There was extensive testimony and cross examination on the documents, especially the various payments made. In the end, while there were indeed weaknesses in the plaintiff’s evidence, including the absence of evidence from the participants of the meeting of 29 November 2018 when the Supplemental Agreement was discussed, I found that the evidence overall was sufficient nonetheless to establish the plaintiff’s case on this claim.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Bills of Exchange Act</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 Turning to the plaintiff’s claims under the BEA, I found that the plaintiff was entitled to the face value of the cheques when presented for payment. These cheques were, in the circumstances, a form of a security for the advances given by the plaintiff, although I had some reservations about characterising these as on-demand performance bonds, as asserted by the plaintiff. Moreover, I disagreed with the second defendant’s position that no consideration was provided for at least some of these cheques on the basis that the second defendant had already completed the relevant part of the Subcontract Works when at least some of the cheques were provided. This was because s 27(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the BEA explicitly provides that valuable consideration for a bill may be constituted by an antecedent debt or liability; such a debt or liability is deemed valuable consideration whether the bill is payable on demand or at a future time. In my view, this would have included the contractual obligations to perform the Subcontract Works. As such, I concluded that the second defendant was liable for damages to the plaintiff under s 57(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the BEA for the dishonoured cheques.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 Be that as it may, and as conceded in any event by the plaintiff in its closing submissions, the sum of damages claimable could not exceed the loss suffered. As such, the amount that could be claimed in damages for the breach of the Supplemental Agreement and Addendum would have to be offset by what was claimable on the cheques. This is an issue which I will address subsequently.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Failed claims and counterclaim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 I did not however find that there was any conspiracy or deceit on the part of the first defendant, as alleged by the plaintiff. The evidence fell short of what was required to establish such torts. The counterclaim of the second defendant failed as well. In sum, liability only attached to the second defendant, and not the first defendant or the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The reliefs awarded</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 I turn now to the reliefs claimed. The overall quantum claimed by the plaintiff on the contract was S$3,437,937.36, including Goods and Services Tax (“GST”).<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>The plaintiff submitted that this amount represented a cap on the damages that the plaintiff was entitled to, taking into account any sums that may also be awarded in respect of the dishonoured cheques, and which thereby did not contravene the rule against double recovery.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31   Despite the plaintiff’s arguments, there was no combination on the facts. While it is true that directors of a company can be in a conspiracy with the company (see <span class="font-italic">PT Sandipala </span>at [51]), the Court of Appeal emphasised in <span class="font-italic">PT Sandipala </span>at [4] that liability cannot be imposed on directors merely because they had some involvement in causing the breach. What needs to be shown by the plaintiff as a requirement of liability is that the directors’ acts, in their capacity as directors, are in breach of their fiduciary or other personal legal duties owed to the company (see <span class="font-italic">PT Sandipala </span>at [62] and [65]). Applied to the tort of conspiracy (whether by unlawful or lawful means), this requirement is relevant to the finding of a combination. The principle is that where a director has breached their fiduciary or other personal legal duties owed to the company by causing the company to commit the unlawful act(s) in question, the law deems that there was a combination between the director and his company to do such acts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Indeed, this principle is grounded on legal policy, as illustrated by the comments of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">PT Sandipala</span> at [63] and [65]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">63 … It would also be wrong to treat the director as <span class="font-italic">conspiring</span> with the company, given that the director is acting as the company. There is effectively only one legal actor in play, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the company, and this is typically fatal to the fundamental requirement of a conspiracy that there be two or more persons acting in concert. To hold that the company’s agents are nevertheless personally liable for the acts taken by the company in relation to a contract entered into <span class="font-italic">by the company</span>, when they act in the company’s capacity and in fulfilment of their duties towards the company, undermines the separate legal personality doctrine and makes nonsense of this fiction that undergirds the fundamental tenets of company law.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">65     … our view is that the most appropriate elucidation of the <span class="font-italic">Said v Butt</span> principle is that a director would ordinarily be immune from tortious liability for authorising or procuring his company’s breach of contract in his capacity as a director, unless his decision is made in breach of any of his personal legal duties to the company. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 As can be gleaned from the extract above, it would not ordinarily make sense to conclude that there was a combination between a director and his company. This is because the company, which has an artificial legal personality, must necessarily act through a natural person. If too loose an approach is taken in finding that directors are acting in combination with the company, directors would often be made personally liable for the acts of the company. This would undermine the separate legal personality of the company, which treats the rights and obligations of the company as being separate from that of its shareholders and managers, and which accordingly does not impose liability on them for the contractual breaches of the company. The company is therefore interposed between its directors and third parties, and such third parties do not typically have a cause of action against the directors for the unlawful acts committed by the company. However, the protective function of such imposition does not operate absolutely in all circumstances. As the Court of Appeal has determined in<span class="font-italic"> PT Sandipala</span>, personal liability may still be visited on a director in the tort of conspiracy where he acts in breach of his fiduciary or other personal legal duties owed to the company in causing the company to commit the acts complained of by the third party. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 In the present case, the plaintiff argued that the first defendant failed to consider the interests of the plaintiff as a creditor when the second defendant was allegedly insolvent or near insolvent.

</div> However, the creditor-regarding duty laid down in <span class="font-italic">Progen </span>was not relevant in the present case. Read in its proper context, notwithstanding that the creditor-regarding duty operates when the company is insolvent or near insolvency, any action premised on the breach of this duty is <span class="font-italic">only relevant</span> where the company in question has entered into liquidation. Indeed, this is telling from the observations of Street CJ in the New South Wales Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Kinsela v Russell Kinsela Pty Ltd (In Liq) </span>(1986) 4 NSWLR 722 at 730:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">But where a company is insolvent the interests of the creditors intrude.<span class="font-italic"> They become prospectively entitled, through the mechanism of liquidation</span>, to displace the power of the shareholders and directors to deal with the company’s assets. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 It may be discerned from the extract above that any action for breaches of the creditor-regarding duty is only relevant when the “mechanism of liquidation” is engaged. Likewise, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Progen</span> alluded to this when it opined at [52] that “individual creditors cannot, <span class="font-italic">without the assistance of liquidators</span>, directly recover from the directors for such breaches of duty” [emphasis added]. This suggests that, among other things, liquidation is a condition precedent to the <span class="font-italic">relevance</span> of the creditor-regarding duty in an action that is premised on its breach. In the present case, while the second defendant was facing financial difficulties, it was not in liquidation. Relatedly, this also highlights that the creditor-regarding duty is owed to the <span class="font-italic">company</span> only. As such, it was inappropriate to even invoke the creditor-regarding duty to begin with.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Even if the creditor-regarding duty were relevant, I did not think that the first defendant breached this duty. In my view, a breach of the creditor-regarding duty is concerned with the taking of “illegitimate risks” (see <span class="font-italic">Progen </span>at [52]), and the law should not punish directors for taking legitimate risks to bring the company back to solvency when a company is insolvent or nearing insolvency. The UK Supreme Court had the opportunity to consider this point (as part of a broader restatement of the creditor-regarding duty) in its recent decision of <span class="font-italic">BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA and others </span>[2022] 3 WLR 709, and the judgments of Lords Reed and Briggs are instructive in this respect. To explain this point, I can do no better than to repeat the observations of Lord Reed at [58]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… In practice, the general body of creditors may well stand to benefit, as well as the shareholders, if the company can be turned around or its business can be disposed of advantageously, since they may have little prospect of receiving any significant distribution in an insolvent winding up. Nevertheless, the creditors will usually remain the primary bearers of the risks involved, and decisions in relation to a rescue strategy should therefore be taken with regard to their interests. <span class="font-italic">That is not, of course, to say that a rescue strategy is ruled out: depending on the circumstances, the directors may well consider in good faith that such a strategy is in the interests of the company, having regard to the interests both of the creditors and also of the shareholders as a whole</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">And those of Lord Briggs at [164]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Nor is it a duty, once engaged, always to treat creditors’ interests as paramount. Section 172(3) speaks in the alternative of a duty to consider creditors’ interests or a duty to act in accordance with them. Creditors are not to be treated as having the main economic stake in the company at least while a company is solvent or, if insolvent, while there is still light at the end of the tunnel. It is not enough to say that, once there is a risk of insolvency, the implicit risk that they as a class will get hurt in their pockets is a sufficient reason for elevating them to the status of paramount stakeholders, still less<span style="color: rgba(33,33,33,1)"> </span>as a class whose interests must always predominate. <span class="font-italic">It is inherent in the law’s encouragement of risk-taking and commercial enterprise under limited liability that creditors of limited companies will get hurt from time to time. Most creditors are voluntary. They are therefore able to make their own judgment about those risks and to take such precautions against them by a demand for security as they think fit, armed with such public information about the financial position of the company as the law makes available, or the company chooses to provide</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">While the UK Supreme Court’s restatement of the creditor-regarding duty has yet to be fully considered by the Singapore courts, and it is not necessary to do so here, it is nonetheless clear that the creditor-regarding duty is subject to qualifications, one of which being that legitimate risk-taking behaviour by directors should not be punished.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Applied to the present facts, I did not think that the creditor-regarding duty was breached as I found that the first defendant’s choice to cause the second defendant to enter into the Supplemental Agreement fell within the acceptable bounds of legitimate risk taking. When the Supplemental Agreement was entered into on 30 November 2018, the Subcontract Works were already substantially underway. On the plaintiff’s own case, at least 60% of the Subcontract Works were already completed on or around May and June 2018.

</div> It would not make commercial sense for the first defendant to completely abandon the Subcontract Works by then even if the second defendant were facing issues with completing the works. The Supplemental Agreement was therefore a reasonable means for the second defendant to increase its odds of fulfilling its remaining contractual obligations to the plaintiff under the 2017 Subcontract, entitling the second defendant to progress payments which might consequently turn the financial situation of the second defendant around. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Moreover, it was crucial that the plaintiff <span class="font-italic">knew</span> of the second defendant’s liquidity issues and nevertheless entered into the Supplemental Agreement on that basis; indeed, p 2 of the Supplemental Agreement explicitly mentions this:

</div> Further or alternatively, the plaintiff argued that the unlawful acts here involved the first defendant’s “crime and torts” in the form of the tort of deceit and/or the crime of cheating pursuant to s 415 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“Penal Code”).

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 While I accepted that a breach of contract would in principle satisfy the element of “unlawful means” (see <span class="font-italic">PT Sandipala </span>at [52]), the outcome of the plaintiff’s claim in unlawful means conspiracy did not ultimately turn on this finding as I had found that there was no combination between the defendants. But for completeness, it leaves me to briefly deal with the plaintiff’s further or alternative argument that the first defendant was liable in deceit and/or s 415 of the Penal Code by causing the second defendant to enter into the Supplemental Agreement with the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 As regards deceit, I did not find that the tort was established. The plaintiff’s case rested on alleged false representations that the first defendant had made at the meeting on 29 November 2018, which the plaintiff said was captured in the Supplemental Agreement executed by the defendants. Essentially, these alleged representations were statements of the first defendant’s intent to perform certain acts in the future. These concerned matters relating to the payment of an advance by the plaintiff, the repayment of moneys to the plaintiff, the completion of the Subcontract Works, salary issues between the workmen, and the certification of the works completed by 29 November 2018.

</div> However, the plaintiff in effect appeared to really hinge its case on the basis that there were no reasonable grounds on the first defendant’s part to regard his statements of intent as true. This was because the only evidence relied upon by the plaintiff in this regard was the admission by the first defendant during cross examination that, if the Subcontract Works were not almost complete as of end-November 2018, there would have been no reasonable basis for the first defendant to say that the second defendant could fulfil all its obligations.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 However, even if the alleged promises were made, I did not find that there was an actionable misrepresentation of fact that would ground any allegation of deceit. As a starting point, it is important to emphasise that there is “a crucial distinction between actionable misrepresentations and a <span class="font-italic">future promise or statement of intention</span>” [emphasis in original], and that “[o]nly false statements <span class="font-italic">as</span><span class="font-italic"> to present fact</span> can constitute the subject matter of a misrepresentation claim” [emphasis added] (see the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Tonny Permana v One Tree Capital Management Pte Ltd and another </span>[2021] 5 SLR 477 at [183]). Applied to the context where a statement of intention is the alleged misstatement of fact, it must be shown that misrepresentation was as to the state of the representor’s mind <span class="font-italic">at the time he made the statement </span>(see the Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Tan Chin Seng and others v Raffles Town Club Pte Ltd </span>[2003] 3 SLR(R) 307 at [12]; see also the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Yong Khong Yoong Mark and others v Ting Choon Meng Meng </span><span class="font-italic">and another </span>[2021] SGHC 246 at [159]). In other words, the plaintiff had to show that at the time when the alleged oral representations were made, the first defendant did not intend to follow through with his promises.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Relatedly, while the plaintiff had attempted to characterise the first defendant’s statements of intent as lacking in reasonable basis, I did not think that the mere unreasonableness of a representor’s belief should <span class="font-italic">ipso facto </span>amount to a lack of intent on the representor’s part to follow through with his promises. As the Court of Appeal emphasised in <span class="font-italic">Wee Chiaw Sek An</span><span class="font-italic">na v Ng Li-Ann Genevieve (sole executrix of the estate of Ng Hock Seng, deceased) and another </span>[2013] 3 SLR 801 at [37], in the same context of fraudulent misrepresentation, it is the representor’s <span class="font-italic">subjective </span>belief that is crucial. While such subjective belief must be ascertained by the court on the objective evidence available, the court “<span class="font-italic">cannot substitute its own view as to what it thinks the representor’s belief was</span>” [emphasis in original]. The concept of objectivity is only to be applied to the<span class="font-italic"> evidence</span> demonstrating what the representor’s subjective belief was, and not to whether the court thinks that a reasonable person would find the representor’s belief unreasonable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 On the present facts, while the evidence showed non-fulfilment of the promises made, nothing showed that the first defendant did not subjectively intend to follow through with his promises at the time when the alleged oral representations were made. It was plausible that the non-fulfilment of the promises made at the 29 November 2018 meeting could have been due to the inability on the part of the defendants to do so, or due to their subsequent choice to pursue other objectives after<span class="font-italic"> </span>the alleged oral representations were made. The latter explanations would have breached the agreement with the plaintiff but would not have amounted to deceit. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Similarly, I did not think that the first defendant committed the crime of cheating under s 415 of the Penal Code. The elements of the crime of cheating are threefold: (a) the victim had to be deceived; (b) there had to have been an inducement such that the victim delivered any property to any person; and (c) there had to have been a dishonest or fraudulent intent on the part of the deceiving person to induce the victim to deliver the property (see the Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Gunasegeran s/o Pavadaisamy v Public Prosecutor </span>[1997] 2 SLR(R) 946 at [42]–[44]). As I had found that there was no evidence to show that the first defendant had no intention to follow through with his promises at the time the alleged representations were made, I likewise did not find that the defendant had a fraudulent intent to induce the plaintiff from paying the additional advance after the meeting on 29 November 2018. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Accordingly, in relation to the element of unlawful means, I found that the plaintiff had not made out its allegations that the first defendant had committed the tort of deceit and/or the crime of cheating under s 415 of the Penal Code.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) The defendants did not intend to cause damage or injury to the plaintiff</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 I turn now to the element of an intention to cause damage or injury, which I found was not made out. To establish this element, a plaintiff has to show that the unlawful means and the conspiracy were targeted and directed at the plaintiff. It is not sufficient that harm to the claimant would be a likely, probable, or even inevitable consequence of the defendant’s conduct. Lesser states of mind, such as an appreciation that a course of conduct would inevitably harm the claimant, would not amount to an intention to injure, although it may be a factor supporting an inference of intention on the factual circumstances of the case. Damage or injury to the plaintiff must have been intended as a means to an end or as an end in itself (see <span class="font-italic">EFT Holdings </span>at [101]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The plaintiff relied on the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">SH Cogent</span> in arguing that if a defendant acts against his commercial interest, this might lend an inference that the defendant in question intended to cause damage or injury to the plaintiff through his actions.

Accordingly, the plaintiff had not shown that it could not have reasonably been in the second defendant’s commercial interest to attempt to trade out of its difficult financial situation.

To summarise my conclusions: (a) there was no combination between the defendants to do unlawful acts; (b) while the first defendant had had caused the second defendant to breach the Supplemental Agreement, the outcome of the plaintiff’s claim in unlawful means conspiracy did not ultimately turn on this finding as I had found that there was no combination between the defendants; for completeness, I also found that the plaintiff’s allegations that the first defendant had committed the tort of deceit and/or cheating under s 415 of the Penal Code were not made out; (c) regarding the plaintiff’s other allegations in relation to the unlawful means element, it was not proven that the first defendant had engaged in deceit and/or cheating as defined in s 415 of the Penal Code; and (d) the plaintiff failed to establish that the defendants intended to cause damage or injury to the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Lawful means conspiracy and deceit</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 In view of my conclusions above in relation to unlawful means conspiracy, it followed that the plaintiff’s claims in lawful means conspiracy and deceit were also not made out.
