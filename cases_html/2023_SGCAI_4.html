However, the general rule is that the making of such privacy orders is a departure from the hallowed principle of open justice and should therefore be the exception rather than the norm. This is so because open justice is fundamental to ensuring public confidence in and the integrity of the judicial system (<span class="font-italic">Leon Tay</span> at [17]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 That being said, the general rule may be departed from in certain circumstances – for instance, in cases involving an abuse of process or the need to prevent a miscarriage of justice or when a statute provides otherwise. The last of this was relevant here because the Appeal pertained to arbitration-related proceedings, and the court’s power to grant privacy orders has been statutorily provided for in ss 22 and 23 of the IAA, which read as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Proceedings to be heard in private</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">22.—(1)  Subject to subsection (2), proceedings under this Act in any court are to be heard in private.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2)  Proceedings under this Act in any court are to be heard in open court if the court, on its own motion or upon the application of any person (including a person who is not a party to the proceedings), so orders.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Restrictions on reporting of proceedings heard in private</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">23.—(1)  This section applies to proceedings under this Act in any court heard in private.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2)  A court hearing any proceedings to which this section applies is, on the application of any party to the proceedings, to give directions as to whether any and, if so, what information relating to the proceedings may be published.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3)  A court is not to give a direction under subsection (2) permitting information to be published unless —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) all parties to the proceedings agree that the information may be published; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) the court is satisfied that the information, if published in accordance with such directions as it may give, would not reveal any matter, including the identity of any party to the proceedings, that any party to the proceedings reasonably wishes to remain confidential.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(4)  Despite subsection (3), where a court gives grounds of decision for a judgment in respect of proceedings to which this section applies and considers that judgment to be of major legal interest, the court is to direct that reports of the judgment may be published in law reports and professional publications but, if any party to the proceedings reasonably wishes to conceal any matter, including the fact that the party was such a party, the court is to —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) give directions as to the action that is to be taken to conceal that matter in those reports; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) if it considers that a report published in accordance with directions given under paragraph (a) would be likely to reveal that matter, direct that no report may be published until after the end of any period, not exceeding 10 years, that it considers appropriate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 The effect of s 22(1) of the IAA is that proceedings under the IAA are <span class="font-italic">to be heard in private by default</span>. Therefore, court proceedings relating to arbitration matters under the IAA are presumptively private as a starting point. Moreover, this is so <span class="font-italic">without </span><span class="font-italic">the need for any application by a party</span>, though the court may nonetheless, on its own motion, or on the application of a party, order that the hearing take place in open court (see s 22(2) of the IAA). Where proceedings are to be heard in private, the court may issue further directions pursuant to s 23 of the IAA to permit the disclosure of information in a way that would protect each party’s reasonable interest in confidentiality. For completeness, O 16 r 9(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and O 16 r 9(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the SICC Rules 2021 also afford the court similar powers to make orders for a private hearing and for restrictions on publication. These effectively mirror ss 22 and 23 of the IAA respectively, though the court’s powers under the SICC Rules 2021 are not limited to the context of arbitration-related proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 However, beyond setting out the position on the terms I have just outlined, ss 22 and 23 of the IAA shed limited light on the nature of the interest in confidentiality that is protected. I therefore approached the determination of that interest by considering the purpose that underlies these provisions, having regard to their legislative history. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 The IAA was largely based on the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration (the “Model Law”). The drafters of the Model Law had been averse to proposals to provide for the confidentiality of arbitral awards, and so chose to leave the position open (UNCITRAL, <span class="font-italic">Report of the Secretary-General: possible features of a model law on international commercial arbitration</span>, UN Doc A/CN.9/207 (14 May 1981) at para 101).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 When the IAA was first enacted on 27 January 1995, it did not include provisions in the form of the present ss 22 and 23. While Parliament did make provision for the confidentiality of court proceedings arising from arbitrations in s 22, that position was essentially the reverse of the present position. In short, the default position under s 22 (as it was first enacted) was that such proceedings would be open, but these could be heard in private on application to the court. Section 22 at the time provided as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Proceedings to be heard otherwise than in open court</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">22.  Proceedings under this Act in any court shall, on the application of any party to the proceedings, be heard otherwise than in open court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 This remained the position for almost the next three decades until the present iteration of s 22 of the IAA came into effect on 1 April 2022 by virtue of the Courts (Civil and Criminal Justice) Reform Bill (Bill No 18/2021). The overall effect of the amendment was to bring the legislation in line with what had become the prevailing practice by providing that court proceedings relating to arbitration will be private unless the court orders otherwise. Significantly, the Minister’s second reading speech clarified that Parliament’s underlying intention<span class="font-italic"> </span>was and had been <span class="font-italic">to protect the confidentiality of the arbitra</span><span class="font-italic">l proceedings </span>(see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates</span>, <span class="font-italic">Official Report</span> (13 September 2021) vol 95 (Edwin Tong Chun Fai, Second Minister for Law)) (“the Minister’s speech”):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">We have considered feedback from various stakeholders, practitioners, that as a matter of practice, it will be common for parties involved in proceedings, involving arbitration, such as in those two Acts, to make applications, for the matter to be heard in private. Given that these applications relate to arbitrations, such applications are often allowed by the Court.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Hence, to better reflect the prevailing practice and streamline the process for parties, clauses 8 and 30 of the Bill will amend the Arbitration Act and the International Arbitration Act respectively, to provide that proceedings under these Acts are to be heard in private by default, unless the Court orders that the proceedings be heard in open court.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">This is<span class="font-italic"> in line with the overall confidential nature of such arbitral proceedings</span> and will result in cost and time savings for parties who now do not have to apply for such proceedings to be heard in private.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 It follows that the confidentiality interest that was meant to be secured by the present, and in my view, even the original, iteration of s 22 of the IAA is ultimately linked to protecting the confidentiality of the <span class="font-italic">arbitra</span><span class="font-italic">l proceedings</span> by ensuring that the related court proceedings are heard in private. In my judgment, this suggestion that is contained in the Minister’s speech that I have extracted above also accords with a common-sense view of the matter. There is no independent interest in the confidentiality of court proceedings. On the contrary, such proceedings are almost always open. And so, when the court gets involved at the stage of enforcement or setting-aside proceedings, the reason why the statute provides for confidentiality is that this is rooted in the conventionally private nature of arbitration proceedings. But for this fact, there would typically be no question of the concomitant enforcement proceedings being conducted in private.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 In line with this, ss 23(3) and (4) provide that if the cloak of privacy is retained, the court may nonetheless publish certain information as long as steps are taken to protect the confidentiality of information that a party “reasonably wishes to remain confidential” or that a party “reasonably wishes to conceal”. It is clear from this that the interest is directed at <span class="font-italic">preserving </span>confidentiality.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 In sum, in my judgment, the purpose of ss 22 and 23 of the IAA is to protect the confidentiality of the arbitration itself and the interest in keeping any enforcement proceedings confidential under the IAA is essentially a derivative interest designed ultimately to protect the confidentiality of the underlying arbitration. This is borne out by the Minister’s statement in Parliament when the Bill introducing these provisions was read, and also by the text of ss 22 and 23 read together in context.<span class="font-italic"> </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 This is also consistent with the fact, as I have noted above (at [14]), that imposing a cloak of privacy on court proceedings is an <span class="font-italic">exceptional</span> measure that departs from the general rule that such proceedings are subject to the principle of open justice. In the present context, the departure from that principle is provided for by statute, but given that this was rooted in the need to protect the confidentiality of the arbitration proceedings, where the confidentiality of the arbitration has been lost, then the principle of open justice would weigh strongly in favour of lifting the cloak of privacy that has been provided for by the statute.<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Significantly, India did not appear to contend otherwise. As I have noted above at [9], India’s primary contention was that the confidentiality of the arbitral proceedings had not been entirely lost.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">My decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 As I have noted (at [8]), India relied o<span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">n two </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">bases: (a) </span>ss 22 and 23 of the IAA read with O 16 r 9(1) of the SICC Rules 2021, and/or (b) the inherent powers of the court. On either footing, the threshold question was whether the confidentiality of the arbitral proceedings had been lost.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 In my judgment, this was clearly a case where the confidentiality of the Arbitration had been lost, as a consequence of which there was no basis for maintaining the confidentiality of the enforcement proceedings in Singapore under ss 22 and 23 of the IAA. In these circumstances, I was satisfied that there was insufficient basis to override the strong interest in open justice in curial proceedings. I elaborate on these points below.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The confidentiality of the Arbitration had been lost</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The court should not be made to go through an empty exercise to protect confidentiality when there is nothing left to protect. As was noted in <span class="font-italic">Dorsey James Michael v World Sport Group Pte Ltd</span> [2014] 2 SLR 208 (“<span class="font-italic">Dorsey James</span>")<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [63], citing <span class="font-italic">Attorney-General v Observer Ltd</span> [1990] 1 AC 109 at 282C (albeit with respect to the law of confidentiality): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The first limiting principle (which is rather an expression of the scope of the duty) is … that the principle of confidentiality only applies to information to the extent that it is confidential. In particular, <span class="font-italic">once it has entered what is usually called the public domain</span> (which means no more than that the information in question is so generally accessible that, in all the circumstances, it cannot be regarded as confidential) then, as a general rule, <span class="font-italic">the principle of confidentiality can have no application to it</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 If the information in question is known to the public at large, it would be idle (in the sense of being both unrealistic and pointless) to seek to deal with it as though it was confidential (<span class="font-italic">Dorsey James</span> at [64], citing R G Toulson and C M Phipps, <span class="font-italic">Confidentiality</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 3rd Ed, 2012) at para 3-112). Indeed, as I have already observed (see above at [22]), s 23(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the IAA speaks of protecting information that a party wishes to “<span class="font-italic">remain</span>” confidential which would suggest that the court is not required to protect information that is already in the public sphere. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 As pointed out by DT, there had already been multiple disclosures of considerable information relating to the Arbitration, the identity of the parties and enforcement proceedings in Singapore and abroad.

</div> I did not think it necessary to make a finding on this because the making of an order lifting privacy is not typically justified as a means of penalising a party and this allegation, even if true, did not seem to me to be material.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Reference was also made to DT having previously applied for confidentiality measures which culminated in the ORC 1321 Consent Order being made in respect of the OS 900 Enforcement Proceedings. As to this, DT suggested that the situation as regards the present application was quite different from the circumstances under which the ORC 1321 Consent Order was made, in terms of both the confidentiality of the underlying Arbitration and the degree to which this had been overtaken by the public disclosures, and also that DT’s interest in keeping information of its enforcement attempts away from other creditors was no longer relevant.

</div> I did not need to reach the question of whether DT’s interest in keeping its enforcement action concealed from other creditors was relevant or sufficient, because I was satisfied that any interest in securing the confidentiality of the Singapore enforcement proceedings was no longer compelling and had been substantially lost once the confidentiality of the underlying Arbitration had been lost. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 DT also contended that India’s actions and certain Indian court decisions pertaining to the winding up of Devas had cast aspersions on DT and it was only fair that any information from the proceedings in Singapore be made publicly available.

</div> However, I did not think it was for the court to manage its processes in order to promote public debate. The decisions of this court are governed by the proper ambit of the statutory rules that apply to the court and applying those rules, the point simply was that there was no longer a basis to maintain India’s presumptive statutory entitlement to a private hearing under the IAA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Therefore, the confidentiality of the enforcement proceedings in Singapore did not merit continued protection under ss 22 and 23 of the IAA. For completeness, I turn briefly to consider the court’s inherent powers.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">There was no basis for the court to exercise its inherent powers to grant the SUM 4 Orders</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 In my judgment, recourse to the inherent powers was unhelpful in the present context. It should be noted that India’s position was supported by the presumptive position of privacy provided for in the statute. India would only need to invoke the inherent powers as an alternative to the statutory position, and that would only be the case where the court had concluded that the presumptive statutory position had been displaced for good reason. In such circumstances, there would be no basis for invoking the court’s inherent powers unless this was done to protect some other interest that was independent of that protected by the statutory provision. That was not the case here because India’s position was advanced on essentially the <span class="font-italic">same grounds</span>, namely that the Arbitration was confidential. Having held that that was no longer the case here when considering the position under ss 22 and 23 of the IAA, an argument for the exercise of inherent power founded on the same grounds struck me as hopeless. It should be noted that the inherent powers of the court must be exercised judiciously based on the touchstone of necessity (<span class="font-italic">Siva Kumar s/o Avadiar v Quek Leng Chuang and others</span> [2021] 1 SLR 451 at [57], citing <span class="font-italic">Wee Soon Kim Anthony v Law Society of Singapore</span> [2001] 2 SLR(R) 821 at [27]). The position could be otherwise if there was some other independent basis which warranted invoking the inherent powers of the court, but that was not the case here.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 India also submitted that the disclosure of information in the Appeal would provide more ammunition for the efforts of third parties to tarnish India’s reputation

As such, the interest in keeping any enforcement proceedings confidential under the IAA is essentially a derivative interest designed ultimately to protect the confidentiality of the underlying arbitration. The enforcement proceedings in Singapore did not merit continued protection under ss 22 and 23 of the IAA as the confidentiality of the arbitration had substantially been lost: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[2</span><span class="font-weight-bold">3]–[24]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">30]–[38]</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">[42]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">•  Recourse to the inherent powers was unhelpful in the present context as the applicant had not sought to invoke the court’s inherent powers to protect some other interest that was independent of that protected by the statutory provision. The applicant’s position was advanced on essentially the same grounds, namely that the confidentiality of the arbitration had not been lost: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">43]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background to the application</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">1 The applicant is the Republic of India (“India”). The respondent, Deutsche Telekom AG (“DT”), is a company incorporated under the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany. An Indian state-owned entity (“Antrix”) and a company (“Devas”) of which DT was a shareholder were parties to an agreement which was subsequently terminated. DT commenced arbitration proceedings in Switzerland (the “Arbitration”) against India, contending that the annulment of the agreement was in violation of a bilateral investment treaty between India and Germany.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">2 Following the Tribunal’s issuance of the Final Award in DT’s favour, DT obtained an order of court granting it leave to enforce the Final Award in Singapore (the “Leave Order”). India then applied in HC/SUM 155/2022 (“SUM 155”) to set aside the Leave Order but was unsuccessful. In CA/CAS 1/2023 (“the Appeal”), India appealed against the dismissal of SUM 155 with costs.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">3 In the present application, India sought for the Appeal and any other applications filed in connection with it to be heard in private, for any information (including the parties’ identities) or documents relating to the Appeal to be concealed, for the case file for the Appeal to be sealed, for the parties in the Appeal to not be identified in any hearing lists and for any published judgment or decision that may be issued in these proceedings to be redacted.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Decision on the application</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">4 Imposing a cloak of privacy on court proceedings is an exceptional measure that departs from the general rule that such proceedings are subject to the principle of open justice. Such a departure has been statutorily provided for in ss 22 and 23 of the IAA. That being said, given that the purpose of ss 22 and 23 of the IAA is to protect the confidentiality of arbitration proceedings itself, where the confidentiality of the arbitration has been lost, then the principle of open justice would weigh strongly in favour of lifting the cloak of privacy that has been provided for by the statute: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">14]–[15] </span>and<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold">[23]–[24]</span>.<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">5 The court should not be made to go through an empty exercise to protect confidentiality when there is nothing left to protect. There had already been multiple disclosures of considerable information relating to the Arbitration, the identity of the parties and enforcement proceedings in Singapore and abroad. The confidentiality of the Arbitration had substantially been lost and the enforcement proceedings in Singapore did not merit continued protection under ss 22 and 23 of the IAA: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[28], </span><span class="font-weight-bold">[30]–[38] </span>and<span class="font-weight-bold"> [42]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">6 There would be no basis for invoking the court’s inherent powers as an alternative unless this was done to protect some other interest that was independent of that protected by the statutory provision. However, India’s position was advanced on essentially the same grounds, namely that the Arbitration was confidential. Having held that that was no longer the case here when considering the position under ss 22 and 23 of the IAA, an argument for the exercise of inherent power founded on the same grounds was hopeless: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">43]</span>. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">7 While India also submitted that the disclosure of information in the Appeal would provide ammunition for third parties to tarnish India’s reputation and this justified invoking the court’s inherent powers, an <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">intrinsic feature of open justice </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">was that the conduct of all parties would be </span>open<span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> to be</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">ing scrutinised by those who may be interested. In any event, further information disclosed in the appeal would not assist these third parties in their alleged attempts to tarnish India’s reputation</span>: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">44]–[46]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><div class="font-italic"><br/></div><span class="font-italic">This summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the Court’s grounds of decision.
