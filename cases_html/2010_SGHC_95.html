<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was an appeal by Capital Gate Holdings Pte
                    Ltd (“the intervener”) against the assistant registrar’s
                    decision in Summons No 2101 of 2009, granting the application of T.S. Lines Ltd
                    (“the plaintiff”) to stay Admiralty in Rem No 233 of 2008
                    (“the Action”) in favour of arbitration in London pursuant to
                    s 6 of the International Arbitration Act (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed)
                    (“the IAA”). EP Carriers Pte Ltd (“the defendant”)
                    was not a party to the appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       On 22 May 2007, the plaintiff as disponent
                    owner entered into a charterparty with the defendant as charterer for the use
                    and hire of the vessel <em>TS BANGKOK</em>. The
                    charterparty provided that disputes arising out of the agreement would be
                    referred to arbitration in London:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">CLAUSE 51 – ARBITRATION: BIMCO STANDARD LAW + ARBITRATION CLAUSE
                        1998</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This contract shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
                        English law and any dispute arising out of or in connection with this
                        contract shall be referred to arbitration in London in accordance with the
                        Arbitration Act 1996 or any statutory modification or re-enactment thereof
                        save to the extent necessary to give effect to the provisions of this
                        clause.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the London Maritime
                        Arbitration Association (LMAA) terms current at the time when the
                        arbitration proceedings are commenced.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       A dispute arose between the plaintiff and
                    defendant after a grounding incident on 10 November 2008 that resulted in damage
                    to the <em>TS BANGKOK</em> relating to claims against the
                    plaintiff by the registered owner of <em>TS BANGKOK</em> in
                    respect of which the plaintiff sought an indemnity from the defendant. The
                    plaintiff claimed, in addition, a sum of US$42,753.94 as outstanding charges and
                    expenses under the hire statement. On 2 December 2009, the plaintiff
                    commenced proceedings <em>in rem</em> in respect of those
                    claims against the “EAGLE PRESTIGE” which was a vessel then
                    belonging to the defendant (“the Vessel”). However, in late
                    December 2008, after the issue of the plaintiff’s writ but before it was
                    served, the defendant transferred ownership of the Vessel to the intervener for
                    US$1.00 and “other good and valuable consideration”. The Vessel
                    was renamed the “ENGEDI”. Just before the transfer the vessel was
                    mortgaged to the United Overseas Bank Ltd (“UOB”) and more than
                    US$8m was outstanding under the mortgage. I am given to understand that upon the
                    transfer this mortgage was discharged and subsequently the intervener granted a
                    new mortgage in favour of UOB.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       On 17 February 2009, the defendant was
                    placed in provisional liquidation. Notwithstanding the defendant’s
                    insolvency, the plaintiff obtained leave of court on 27 February 2009 to
                    continue with the <em>in rem</em> proceedings and to arrest
                    the Vessel. Its <em>ex parte</em> application for leave was
                    expressly made without prejudice to the plaintiff’s rights to arbitrate.
                    The plaintiff arrested the Vessel on 27 February 2009. The defendant
                    entered appearance on 9 March 2009. Later that same month, on 31 March
                    2009, the plaintiff filed an application seeking an order that the Vessel be
                    appraised and sold <em>pendente lite</em> (“the Sale
                    Application”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The intervener obtained leave to intervene on
                    14 April 2009. On the basis that it was the owner of the Vessel at the time
                    she was arrested, the intervener applied, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, to set aside the arrest (Summons No 1777 of 2009)
                    (“the Setting Aside Application”). While that application
                    succeeded before the assistant registrar, it was overturned on appeal. It is now
                    pending the decision of the Court of Appeal. Meanwhile, on 5 June 2009, the
                    Sale Application was heard and allowed. The Vessel has since been sold for
                    S$2,525,000.00.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Presently, there are also two other ongoing
                    matters related to the action.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_a"></a>(a)     On 3 March 2009, following the
                        arrest of the Vessel, UOB lodged a caveat against the release of the Vessel
                        and payment out. UOB claims as mortgagee of the Vessel under the new
                        mortgage granted by the intervener. Its claim exceeds the sale proceeds
                        available. It brought an action on 3 September 2009 seeking judgment against
                        the defendant and the Vessel and a declaration that the Vessel was
                        encumbered by the mortgage securing moneys due to it (Admiralty in Rem No
                        302 of 2009). The defendant did not enter appearance. The plaintiff
                        intervened in those proceedings on 4 November 2009 and is defending
                        UOB’s claim. The plaintiff disputes the assertion that UOB’s
                        claim as mortgagee ranks above its claim in terms of
                    priority.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
                        plaintiff and the registered owners of the <em>TS
                            BANGKOK</em> are engaged in arbitration proceedings relating to
                        the grounding incident in which that vessel sustained
                damage.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Proceedings before the assistant registrar</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       On 5 May 2009, the plaintiff went before
                    the assistant registrar in Summons No 2101 of 2009 seeking an order, <em>inter alia</em>, that all further proceedings in the Action
                    were to be stayed under s 6 of the IAA save for the Sale Application and an
                    application that the intervener provide security for costs of the Setting Aside
                    Application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       In response, it was argued that the stay should
                    not be granted because the plaintiff had not sought leave of court before
                    commencing arbitration proceedings against the insolvent defendant even though
                    s 299(2) of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the
                    Companies Act”) required that leave be sought. It was also argued that
                    the arbitration agreement was incapable of being performed because its
                    performance would affect the intervener’s rights and as such a stay could
                    not be granted under s 6 of the IAA. Further, the intervener argued that
                    s 6 of the IAA referred to the court’s power to stay the proceedings
                    “so far as the proceedings relate to the matter” and those words
                    could not refer to the <em>in rem</em> action which the
                    interveners were defending. In other words, the court was not obliged to grant a
                    mandatory stay of the <em>in rem</em> action even if it was
                    obliged to grant a mandatory stay of the <em>in
                        personam</em> aspects of the claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The assistant registrar did not accept that
                    s 299 of the Companies Act required parties to seek leave before commencing
                    arbitration against a company after the commencement of a creditor’s
                    voluntary winding up. He held that that section only applied to actions and
                    proceedings in a court. The assistant registrar also rejected the submission
                    that there were two separate claims, one <em>in rem</em>
                    and the other <em>in personam</em>. He held that the
                    “matter” to be stayed would include the <em>in
                        rem</em> aspect of the claim as that was not divisible from the
                        <em>in personam</em> aspect. On the basis that the
                    plaintiff had not taken a fresh step in the proceedings in the present Action,
                    and on the basis that the arbitration agreement was neither inoperative nor
                    incapable of being performed, the assistant registrar allowed the application
                    and granted the stay of this action.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The intervener’s appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On appeal before me against the assistant
                    registrar’s decision to grant the stay, the intervener reiterated its
                    arguments based on s 299 of the Companies Act and the effect s 6 of
                    the IAA had on the <em>in rem</em> and <em>in personam</em> aspects of the plaintiff’s claim. It also
                    submitted that the appeal ought to be allowed because the parties to the
                    arbitration agreement were different from the parties to the Action and the
                    interveners could not be compelled to arbitrate even though the plaintiff had,
                    belatedly, indicated willingness to let the intervener participate in the London
                    arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The plaintiff’s/respondent’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The plaintiff’s case was that the appeal
                    ought to be dismissed because s 6 of the IAA provided for a mandatory stay
                    except where the arbitration agreement was null and void, inoperative or
                    incapable of being performed. Since the assistant registrar had not found any of
                    those exceptions to exist on the facts, the court could not refuse to grant the
                    stay. It submitted that it did not require leave of court under s 299 of
                    the Companies Act, and in any event, the necessary leave of court had already
                    been obtained when the court allowed it to proceed with the Action even after
                    the defendant went into provisional liquidation. Furthermore, as the
                    plaintiff’s claim was against the defendant and not the interveners, the
                    intervener had no <em>locus standi</em> to defend the claim
                    at arbitration. In any case, the parties to the action were not different from
                    the parties to the arbitration as the intervener’s defences were limited
                    to those available to the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">My decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     After hearing the parties’ arguments, I
                    decided that the appeal ought to be allowed in so far as the proceedings had
                    been stayed. The stay order granted below was set aside. I now state my
                    reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Section 6 of the IAA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Section 6 of the IAA provides:</p>

                    requirements that need to be met before the court is bound to grant a stay of
                    legal proceedings in favour of international arbitration. First, an
                    international arbitration agreement must exist. Second, a party to that
                    agreement must institute court proceedings against another party to the same
                    agreement. Third, the proceedings must be in respect of a matter which is the
                    subject of the agreement. Fourth, the party seeking a stay must have entered
                    appearance in the court proceedings. Fifth, the party seeking a stay must do so
                    before delivering any pleading or taking any other step in the
                    proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Once these requirements are met, the court
                    will be obliged to grant a stay of court proceedings unless it can be shown that
                    the arbitration agreement is (a) null and void, (b) inoperative or (c) incapable
                    of being performed. While the stay is mandatory, the court may grant the stay on
                    such terms or conditions as it thinks fit. Importantly, however, the
                    court’s power to stay the proceedings only extends so far as the
                    proceedings relate to matters which are the subject of the arbitration agreement
                    between parties. It has no power under s 6 of the IAA to stay proceedings
                    that fall outside that ambit.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether actions in rem fall within the ambit of s 6 of the
                IAA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Under this head, the intervener submitted that
                    the <em>in rem</em> claim was not a matter that was the
                    subject of the arbitration agreement between the plaintiff and the defendant and
                    as such the court was not obliged to grant a stay of the <em>in
                        rem</em> claim pursuant to s 6 of the IAA even if the <em>in personam</em> claim against the defendant ought to be
                    arbitrated in London. In response, the plaintiff submitted that it was
                    artificial to maintain a distinction between the <em>in
                        rem</em> claim and the <em>in personam</em> claim
                    when doing so would lead to a multiplicity of proceedings in regard to what was
                    essentially the same claim. Counsel for the plaintiff argued that as the
                    threshold requirements under s 6 of the IAA had been proved and none of the
                    exceptions applied, a stay of further proceedings in the Action ought to be
                    granted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In coming to my decision on this issue, I was
                    conscious of the traditional distinction maintained between an admiralty action
                        <em>in rem</em> and an action <em>in
                        personam</em>. The action <em>in rem</em>
                    operates only against the <em>res</em>, but once the
                    defendant enters an appearance, he submits to the jurisdiction of the court and
                    from then onwards the action continues as an action <em>in
                        rem</em> against the <em>res</em> and <em>in personam</em> against the shipowner defendant (see
                        <em>The “Damavand”</em> [1993]
                    2 SLR(R) 136 at [18]; <em>The Fierbinti</em>
                    [1993] SGHC 319; <em>The August 8</em> [1983]
                    2 AC 450). While an action <em>in personam</em>
                    and an action <em>in rem</em> may involve the same cause of
                    action, it must be stressed that the defendants of the respective actions are
                    regarded as different parties. In <em>Kuo Fen Ching and Another v
                        Dauphin Offshore Engineering &amp; Trading Pte Ltd</em> [1999]
                    2 SLR(R) 793 at [23], the Court of Appeal specifically rejected the
                    proposition of the House of Lord in <em>Republic of India and
                        another v India Steamship Co Ltd (No 2)</em> [1998]
                    1 AC 878 that in substance the owner of the <em>res</em>, and not the <em>res</em> itself, was
                    the defendant to an action <em>in rem</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Having determined this, I turned to consider
                    whether the threshold requirements in s 6(1) of the IAA had been fulfilled
                    in respect of the action <em>in rem</em>. In this
                    evaluation, I took cognisance of s 7 of the IAA which provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Court’s powers on stay of
                        proceedings</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">7. —(1) Where a court stays proceedings under section 6, the court
                        may, if in those proceedings property has been arrested or bail or other
                        security has been given to prevent or obtain release from arrest, order
                        —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)  that the property arrested be retained as security for the
                        satisfaction of any award made on the arbitration; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)  that the stay be conditional on the provision of equivalent
                        security for the satisfaction of any such award.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Pursuant to the above provision, upon the
                    grant of a stay of proceedings, the court has power to order that property
                    previously arrested be retained as security for the satisfaction of an arbitral
                    award. In other words, the commencement of an action <em>in
                        rem</em> in Singapore to arrest a ship would not necessarily
                    constitute a waiver or repudiation of the right to arbitrate. Nonetheless, I was
                    of the view that I was not obliged to grant a stay of the action <em>in rem</em> pursuant to s 6 of the IAA because there was
                    no arbitration agreement between the plaintiff and the notional defendant of the
                        <em>in rem</em> action which was the <em>res</em>. Of course, in most instances, this distinction has no
                    practical effect. Upon the stay of the <em>in personam</em>
                    aspect of the proceedings in court, parties practically always decide to proceed
                    to arbitration without pressing the <em>in rem</em> claim
                    concurrently in court so as to avoid the spectre of a multiplicity of costs and
                    decisions. This is a sensible decision since where the owner of the <em>res</em> and the defendant to the <em>in
                        personam</em> claim are one and the same, the theory of <em>res judicata</em> and issue estoppel will also operate to
                    prevent parties from mounting different arguments in relation to the <em>in rem</em> claim and the <em>in
                        personam</em> claim. In such cases too, the court if requested to,
                    would almost inevitably grant a stay of the <em>in rem</em>
                    action under its discretionary powers so as to prevent a multiplicity of
                    proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     In the present instance, however, I regarded
                    the distinction to be of the utmost importance because the owner of the
                        <em>res</em> was no longer the defendant, but the
                    intervener. In other words, the <em>in rem</em> claim was
                    not identical to the <em>in personam</em> claim. If the
                    plaintiff and defendant were to proceed to arbitration, and the <em>in rem</em> action in Singapore were to be stayed, the
                    intervener would not be able to protect its interest. The intervener would not
                    have any rights in the arbitral process except those voluntarily conferred on it
                    by the plaintiff and the defendant, <em>ie</em>, the
                    parties to the arbitration agreement. This was important particularly since the
                    defendant was insolvent and was unlikely to defend the arbitration in London. At
                    the time parties appeared before me, the defendant had not participated in the
                    arbitration proceedings. Also, although the plaintiff indicated at a late stage
                    of the proceedings (only on the adjourned hearing) that it was willing to let
                    the intervener participate in the arbitration, the process of arbitration is a
                    consensual one and a party may not be forced to arbitrate against its will. The
                    intervener had indicated that it wanted to proceed with litigation in Singapore,
                    not arbitration in London. In any event, the arbitral tribunal would have no
                    jurisdiction to hear the <em>in rem</em> claim. In my view,
                    therefore, the <em>in rem</em> claim could not be a matter
                    that was a subject of the arbitration agreement between the plaintiff and the
                    defendant falling within the ambit of s 6 of the IAA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     On another note, as summarised in <em>Singapore Court Practice 2009</em>, (Jeffrey Pinsler gen ed)
                    (Singapore: LexisNexis, 2009) at para 70/16/2, the purpose of the procedure
                    for intervention is to enable a party, who is not already a party to the
                        <em>in rem</em> action but with an interest either in
                    the property under arrest or the sale proceedings in court representing the
                    property arrested or whose interest may be affected by any order made in the
                        <em>in rem</em> action, to intervene in the action for
                    the purpose of protecting his own interest. An intervener does not prosecute his
                    own claim in an action in which he intervenes but protects his interest in the
                    property by defending the action <em>in rem</em>. The
                    intervener is permitted to set up such defences as the owner of the ship could
                    have set up had it defended the action (<em>The "Sin Chuen No
                        112" (Union Bank of Taiwan and others, interveners)</em>
                    [2007] SGHC 72 at [6]). The purpose of the procedure for intervention
                    would not be achieved if the plaintiff here was able to exclude the intervener
                    from participating in the defence by removing the dispute to arbitration despite
                    arresting property owned by the intervener or in which it had an interest
                    capable of permitting an intervention.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The overarching purpose of the IAA is to
                    promote Singapore’s role as a growing centre for international legal
                    services and international arbitration (see <em>Singapore
                        Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</em> (31 October 1994) vol
                    63 at col 627 (Associate Professor Ho Peng Kee, Parliamentary Secretary to the
                    Minister for Law)). I did not think that the drafters of s 6 of the IAA
                    intended for that provision to be used as a means of depriving third parties of
                    their right to protect their interests. The plaintiff was always free to
                    commence arbitration proceedings in London against the defendant. However,
                    having acted to arrest the Vessel which was owned by the intervener, it could
                    not, in my view, then turn around and tell the intervener (or, for that matter,
                    any other party who intervened) that it had no right to participate in the
                    defence because the plaintiff and defendant had an arbitration agreement which
                    provided for arbitration in London. In some sense, if there is a risk of a
                    multiplicity of proceedings, that has been created by the plaintiff’s
                    choice to commence an action <em>in rem</em> against a
                        <em>res</em> which may be subject to the rights of
                    others. In other words, the plaintiff cannot eat its cake and have it
                    too.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     As an aside, I would note that before me, the
                    option of the intervener funding the defendant’s defence in the
                    arbitration in London was explored. I was given to understand, however, that
                    that was not the practical solution it would otherwise have been because the
                    liquidators of the defendant had indicated to the intervener that they would
                    require to be secured with costs up front should this route be taken and the
                    intervener had difficulty in meeting that condition.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The intervener drew my attention to the case
                    of <em>The “Soeraya Emas”</em> [1991]
                    2 SLR(R) 479 to support the proposition that the <em>in
                        rem</em> claim could be heard separately from the <em>in personam</em> claim. In that case, the defendant shipowners had
                    consented to a judgment being entered against them. After the consent order was
                    obtained, an interested party obtained leave to intervene. The intervener then
                    applied to set aside the consent order and, in the alternative, it asked for a
                    declaration that the order was not binding on it. Karthigesu J held that
                    the intervener could not be bound by the consent order as at the time the order
                    was made, it had not entered appearance and did not give its consent to the
                    judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In response, the plaintiff cited the case of
                        <em>Pemunya Kapal MV Brihope &amp; Others v Emmanuel E
                        Okwuosa &amp; Others</em> [1997] 1 MLJ 453.
                    Shankar JCA, delivering the judgment of the court, rejected the decision in
                        <em>The “Soeraya Emas”</em>. He dismissed
                    the intervener’s appeal to set aside a judgment passed against the
                    defendant on the ground that the intervener could have intervened before the
                    application for summary judgment was heard but elected not to do so. He held
                    that if the intervener had come in good time, he could have defended the action
                    in place of the shipowner should the shipowner himself fail to appear. However,
                    as the intervener was attempting to set aside a final judgment to which he was
                    not a party, he could not take defences which the owner had not taken because he
                    was no longer defending the claim in place of the shipowner. He could only
                    assert his interest and the judgment <em>in rem</em> had to
                    stand.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     I did not have to reconcile the above
                    decisions as neither dealt directly with the issue before me. Instead, both
                    cases dealt with the situation where the intervener was attempting to set aside
                    a judgment <em>after</em> it had been entered. The issue in
                    the case before me was entirely different. The intervener was asserting his
                    right to defend the <em>in rem</em> action despite an
                    agreement between the plaintiff and defendant to arbitrate an <em>in personam</em> claim based on the same facts. At the time of the
                    hearing, no judgment had been passed on either claim, whether in the Singapore
                    courts or by the arbitral tribunal in London. There are, however, some passages
                    from the judgment of Karthigesu J, himself a very experienced admiralty
                    lawyer, which I found fortified the view I had taken. At [29] and [31] of his
                    judgment, Karthigesu J stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">29    The principle has been clearly established but it
                            will be noted that Lord Brandon in <em>The August
                                8</em> ([19] <em>supra</em>) was
                            concerned to emphasise by stating it more than once in the passage I
                            have quoted above that the action continues against him (the shipowner
                            who has entered an appearance) not only as an action <em>in rem</em> but also as an action <em>in
                                personam</em>. I apprehend that what Lord Brandon was careful
                            to preserve was that an admiralty action <em>in
                                rem</em> did not cease to be an admiralty action <em>in rem</em> simply because the defendant shipowner
                            had entered an appearance. The following words of his judgment bear
                            repeating to which I give emphasis: “<em>the
                                action continued not only in rem against the property proceeded
                                against, namely, the ship, but also in personam against the
                                shipowners themselves</em>”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">31    In my view the learned assistant registrar failed
                            to appreciate this important principle and the refinement given to it by
                            Lord Brandon in <em>The August 8</em>. Had he
                            appreciated it he would not have fallen into the error of applying the
                            principles applicable solely to the setting aside of consent judgments
                            in non-admiralty civil actions and confusing the standing of Inter

                            defendants are concerned, by reason of their appearance and albeit by
                            their consent a judgment has been entered against them for which they,
                            Perkapalan Emas, are also personally liable. (original emphasis in
                            italics, emphasis added in bold italics)</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The foregoing passage serves to underscore my view that s 6
                    of the IAA can have no application to the present situation because vis-à-vis
                    the intervener the Action was an admiralty action <em>in
                        rem</em>. The intervener, as a party to the action <em>in rem</em> only, was not a party to any arbitration agreement with
                    the plaintiff and could not therefore be forced to litigate in another
                    forum.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether the plaintiff had to seek leave under s 299 of the
                Companies Act and the effect that has on its application to stay under s 6 of
                the IAA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Having decided not to grant the stay on the
                    basis of the reasons given in the above section, there was no need for me to go
                    further to decide the issues relating to s 299 of the Companies Act.
                    Perhaps, however, I should state my views.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The main argument mounted against the grant of
                    the stay under this head was that the arbitration agreement was null and void
                    because the plaintiff did not seek the court’s leave pursuant to
                    s 299 of the Companies Act to commence foreign arbitration proceedings
                    against the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The simple answer to that argument was that
                    even if the arbitration proceedings commenced in London were null and void
                    because leave was required but not obtained from the Singapore courts, the
                    arbitration agreement itself was still valid. Parties could nonetheless still
                    seek a stay of court proceedings under s 6 of the IAA unless there was some
                    reason why they could not thereafter apply to the court for leave to arbitrate
                    and start arbitration proceedings afresh. After all, the threshold requirements
                    in s 6(1) of the IAA require the existence of an arbitration agreement and
                    not the existence of the arbitration per se. Nothing in the provision prevents
                    parties from seeking a stay as a preliminary measure prior to the commencement
                    of the arbitration itself.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In any case, I would, most likely, have held
                    that no leave was required under s 299 of the Companies Act to commence
                    foreign arbitrations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Section 299(2) provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">After the commencement of the winding up no <em>action or
                            proceeding</em> shall be proceeded with or commenced against the
                        company except by leave of the Court and subject to such terms as the Court
                        imposes. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">VK Rajah JC noted in <em>Korea Asset Management
                        Corp v Daewoo Singapore Pte Ltd (in liquidation)</em> [2004]
                    1 SLR(R) 671 at [43]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The words "action or proceeding" in s 299(2) and its sister
                        provisions are not defined in the Act. There is however a body of English
                        and Australian case law that appears to suggest the words ought to be
                        broadly interpreted to embrace all manner of civil proceedings, including
                        the prosecution of a counterclaim or the execution of a judgment. This is
                        consistent … with the <em>raison d'etre</em> of
                        the provisions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Earlier in his grounds of decision (at [36]), he explained that the
                    reason for s 299 and other similar provisions:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…is to prevent the company from being further burdened by expenses
                        incurred in defending unnecessary litigation. The main focus of a company
                        and its liquidators once winding up has commenced should be to prevent the
                        fragmentation of its assets and to ensure that the interests of its
                        creditors are protected to the fullest extent. In other words, returns to
                        legitimate creditors should be maximised; the process of collecting assets
                        and returning them to legitimate creditors should be attended to with all
                        practicable speed. Unnecessary costs should not be incurred; liquidators
                        should act in the collective interests of all legitimate stakeholders and
                        not with a view to enhancing their own self-interests or fees.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Even though the words “action or
                    proceeding” ought to be read widely, they are not without limits. For
                    example, it is well established that foreign proceedings are not affected by
                    s 299. The reason is that the courts of one country have no jurisdiction
                    over the affairs of another country. Sir George Jessel M.R. held in <em>Re International Pulp and Paper Co</em> (1876)
                    3 Ch D 594 at 599:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…if any creditor in Turkey, Russia, or any other purely foreign
                        country, were to bring an action, although it would be desirable in the
                        interests of the person concerned in the litigation to make that creditor
                        come in with the rest, yet the Court cannot restrain the action for want of
                        power - not from want of will or want of provisions in the Act of
                        Parliament, but simply that the Act of Parliament cannot give this Court
                        jurisdiction over Turkey or over Russia…. Therefore, as to a purely
                        foreign country, it is of no use asking for an order, because the order
                        cannot be enforced.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This was echoed in <em>Re Oriental Inland Steam
                        Co</em> (1874) LR 9 Ch App 557 at 560:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Parliament never legislates respecting strictly foreign Courts. Nor is it
                        usually considered to be legislating respecting Colonial Courts or Indian
                        Courts, unless they are expressly mentioned.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The same sentiment was expressed again in <em>Re
                        Vocalion (Foreign) Ltd</em> [1932] 2 Ch 196 where it was
                    held that provisions of the UK Companies Act 1929 had no application to actions
                    or proceedings in foreign courts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The issue before me was not whether s 299
                    applied to foreign court proceedings, but whether it applied to international
                    arbitrations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In interpreting the substantive equivalent of
                    s 299 in the Companies Act 1948, Lord Simon opined in <em>Herbert Berry Associates Ltd v Inland Revenue Commissioners</em>
                    [1977] 1 WLR 1437 at 1446:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Companies Act is a statute dealing with technical matters, and one
                        would expect the words therein to be used in their primary sense as terms of
                        legal art. The primary sense of “action” as a term of legal
                        art is the invocation of the jurisdiction of a court by writ;
                        “proceeding” the invocation of the jurisdiction of a court by
                        process other than writ.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">On the basis of this reasoning, it would appear that one does not need
                    to obtain leave before proceeding in arbitration against a company in a
                    creditors’ voluntary winding up. However, it ought to be noted that Lord
                    Simon’s observations were only <em>obiter dicta</em>
                    and there is a line of authority to the contrary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     In <em>Re Taylor (A
                        Bankrupt)</em> [2007] 2 WLR 148 at [56], in the context of
                    the UK Insolvency Act 1986, Kershaw QC, sitting in the High Court,
                    opined:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If Parliament says that proceedings may only be started if leave is
                        obtained from a particular court the jurisdiction of any other court
                            <em>or of an arbitrator</em> is thereby controlled.
                        The leave is not merely permission to the would-be litigant; it is a
                        condition precedent to the jurisdiction of the court in which proceedings
                        are then to be started or of an arbitrator.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This position was echoed in Australia, where the words “action
                    or other legal proceeding” and “action or other civil
                    proceeding” have been interpreted to include arbitration (see <em>Re Vassal Pty Ltd (receivers and managers appointed) (in
                        liquidation)</em> (1984) 2 ACLC 53, <em>Mowbray College v Exhib Design &amp; Construction Pty Ltd (in
                        liquidation)</em> (1987) 5 ACLC 478 (“<em>Mowbray College</em>”), <em>Doran
                        Constructions Pty Limited (in liquidation) v Beresfield Aluminuim Pty
                        Limited</em> [2002] NSWCA 95). In <em>Mowbray
                        College</em>, Nathan J opined at 479:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The essence of the words “civil proceedings” given the legal
                        matrix in which they occur encompasses all processes of disputation
                        involving a company, in an adversarial role with other legal persons,
                        whereby its financial affairs may be affected.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     In my view, the word
                    “proceeding” should be interpreted to encompass the process of
                    arbitration, which in this day and age is a well-established means of dispute
                    resolution. To exclude arbitrations from the ambit of s 299 would be to
                    create a gaping exception to the process of preserving the assets of an
                    insolvent company from dissipation. Yet, just as foreign court proceedings are
                    excluded from the ambit of s 299, I would take the tentative view that
                    foreign arbitrations are also probably not caught by the provision. This is
                    because the local court has no power to control or direct the conduct of foreign
                    arbitrations. It may have the power to refuse to uphold a judgment awarded by an
                    arbitrator or to restrain a party from participating in the arbitration via an
                    anti-suit injunction but that is an entirely separate matter from the power to
                    control the arbitration itself. As such, if I had had to decide the matter, I
                    would likely have held that the plaintiff was not required to seek leave, and
                    arguments along this line could not assist the defendant and intervener.
                    Nonetheless, as already mentioned above, my decision did not turn on this point
                    and I do not express a concluded view on this issue.</p>
