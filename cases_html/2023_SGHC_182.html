According to his account, he was holding on to them and intending to pass them to “Pekboon” and Salim. In this regard, he relied on the fact that the “D” drugs had not been repacked and interfered with, and that his DNA was not found in the interior of the three black-taped bundles containing the “D” drugs.

The accused argued that Salim’s evidence was an attempt to preserve his own self-interest since he was given a discharge not amounting to an acquittal on a capital charge of abetting the accused to traffic in drugs. It was submitted that he would not prejudice himself by admitting that he was involved in the supply of drugs. It was further argued that Salim’s evidence lent itself to a strong inference that he was involved in drug trafficking given that he was jobless but spending up to $700 a week staying in hotels and consuming drugs almost daily since 2017.

In other words, the accused’s position was that he had proven on a balance of probabilities that he was merely a courier taking instructions from “Ah Kwang” and had intended to sell drugs to “Pekboon”. On this point, Salim had also admitted in his long statement (Exhibit D2) that he had called the accused on 8 December 2020, and the accused said that this admission was consistent with the accused’s account.

</div> He did not assert at any point that he was a courier in relation to the “B” drugs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 In my assessment, the accused had clearly lied in his oral testimony and in his 4th long statement when he disavowed ownership and possession of the “B” drugs. This was not only evident from his responses under cross-examination but from his own counsel’s acceptance in the SOAF and in the DSCS that possession of the “B” drugs was undisputed. Despite his claims of being “confused”, the accused himself eventually conceded that he had no explanation for denying possession of the “B” exhibits.

</div> This concession only came about after he was confronted with the findings in the FCPL Report, showing that some of the plastic packets among the “B” drug exhibits were linked to the plastic packets among the “A” and “E” drug exhibits.

</div> The “B” drugs were packed in the same manner and using the same plastic packets as the “A” drugs, the latter which the accused admitted were meant for sale.

</div> He could easily have made a similar claim for the “B” drugs if it was indeed true that they were intended purely for personal consumption. The fact that he did not do so spoke volumes. This strongly suggested that they were not so intended.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The mere fact that the “B” drugs were found together with drug consumption utensils such as a lighter, cotton buds and improvised smoking implements was not sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt that the “B” drugs were intended solely for his own consumption.

</div> As such, while there may have been obvious signs of usage of the utensils for drug consumption, this was of no assistance to him as well since the “B” drugs were not methamphetamine but diamorphine. The fact that the drug utensils were found in the same blue basket “B1” as the “B” drugs did not give rise to a strong inference that the “B” drugs must have been intended for his own consumption. The accused himself did not suggest at any time that he had a habit or practice of keeping all the items intended for his personal use in the same blue basket “B1” where all the “B” exhibits were found.

Moreover, the “B” drugs only concerned a small quantity comprising four packets and two straws of diamorphine. Nevertheless, the consumption defence was an obvious afterthought as it was never raised by the accused until he testified at trial. In his 4th long statement, he had flatly denied possession and ownership of the “B” drugs altogether, despite having initially acknowledged in his contemporaneous statement that the “B” drugs belonged to him. However, possession of the “B” drugs was an agreed fact in the SOAF. The only logical inference from this was that his instructions to counsel must have changed just prior to trial. At trial, he changed his position once again and reverted to his denial of being in possession, only to recant after being confronted with objective evidence in the FCPL Report. He must have realised that he had no other option but to concede his possession of the “B” drugs if his belatedly raised defence of consumption was to even have a leg to stand on. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 In summary, the accused had sought to raise different claims at different points in time where the “B” drugs were concerned. He gave no explanations for why he kept changing his position, in particular why he did not mention his defence of consumption until he gave his defence at trial. I found that the accused, as an undisputed trafficker of the “A” and “D” drugs, had not offered any shred of evidence which would raise a reasonable doubt that the “B” drugs were in his possession for the same purpose of trafficking.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 The accused’s various admissions under cross-examination about having lied were presumptively reliable since they were contrary to his own interest. These were all deliberate lies on material issues raised in his defence. Hence, adopting the Court of Appeal’s guidance in <span class="font-italic">Chukwudi</span> (at [60] and [62]), these lies could only have been motivated by his realisation of guilt and desire to obscure the truth. They were archetypal <span class="font-italic">Lucas</span> lies (<span class="font-italic">R v </span><span class="font-italic">Lucas (Ruth)</span> [1981] QB 720) which were thus strongly corroborative of his guilt. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Despite the accused’s concession that he had falsely implicated Salim, and that he would not be collecting any payments from Salim, he continued to insist when re-examined that he was only acting on “Ah Kwang”’s instructions to pass the “D” drugs or part thereof to Salim. This was illogical and irreconcilable. If he had fabricated his claims of Salim’s involvement, the more likely inference was that no such instructions had actually been given by “Ah Kwang”, if any instructions had indeed been given at all. There was also no cogent reason to disbelieve Salim’s evidence that he was not involved with the “D” drugs, given the paucity of any other evidence implicating Salim and the accused’s own admission that he had lied to falsely implicate Salim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 The accused also agreed that he had no explanation for some other key aspects of the evidence, such as the objective evidence in the POLCAM footages from 9 to 10 December 2020 which showed that he did not take the lift down to the void deck at the material time, as he had claimed, in order to collect the “D” drugs from “Bob”. It was highly implausible that the “D” drugs were meant for “Pekboon” as this was no more than a bare and unsubstantiated assertion on the accused’s part. He further claimed in his oral testimony that he did not have “Pekboon”’s contact number and was waiting to be contacted by Salim instead. When confronted with his own contradictory contemporaneous statement disclosing to SI Fadli what appeared to be a (Thai-registered) handphone number with a +66 country code as “Pekboon”’s number, he was caught flat-footed; he could only say in response that he could not “think of anything at [that] moment”.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Additionally, it was doubtful whether the accused did receive the “D” drugs from “Bob” as he claimed, in view of objective evidence in the POLCAM footages alongside the obvious shifts in the accused’s evidence where “Bob” was concerned. These included his implausible account of “Bob” allegedly having called him using a Malaysian phone on 9 December 2020 and his prevarications over whether “Bob” was Chinese or Malay and whether the colour of the car that “Bob” allegedly drove was white or blue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 The upshot of the extensive inconsistencies and contradictions in the accused’s defence was that his evidence in many areas was vague, random and virtually impossible to pin down. I note that when pressed to explain the numerous inconsistent responses, the accused’s repeated excuse was that he was either “confused” or could not remember. To my mind, these convenient but feeble responses showed that he had exhausted his attempts to explain away his own fabrications.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 The fact that the accused’s DNA was not found on the “D” drug packaging was neither here nor there. It might have indicated that he had not repacked or interfered with the drugs, but it did not thereby also constitute objective evidence in support of his “courier” defence. Similarly, the fact that the “D” drugs had not been repacked and were kept separately from the “A” and “B” drugs was of no assistance to his defence. I was unable to discern any semblance of a method or system to how the accused had chosen to place the drugs in various different random locations within the flat. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 Finally, I accept that “Ah Kwang” and “Pekboon” might not have been fictitious characters, assuming that Salim was truthful (or accurate) in his evidence about them. However, this also did not assist the accused. Even assuming they did exist, their existence did not necessarily point towards their purported roles as characterised by the accused. Bearing in mind the accused’s admission that he had falsely implicated Salim, I had serious doubts as to whether his evidence pertaining to “Ah Kwang” and “Pekboon” could be relied upon.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 It was also submitted that the Prosecution had failed to adduce any direct evidence to disprove the accused’s claims that he was holding on to the drugs for someone else.

</div> With respect, this submission was misconceived. As the Prosecution rightly pointed out, it was the accused who bore the burden of proving on the balance of probabilities what he asserted, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that he was a mere courier. Even if there was no evidence of any payment made (or to be made) to “Ah Kwang” for the “D” drugs, this would neither weaken the Prosecution’s case nor strengthen the “courier” defence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 I note that the accused had let slip in his evidence-in-chief that he had “ordered” the “D” drugs from “Ah Kwang”,

</div> even while claiming that the “D” drugs were not his. This was starkly telling of the highly dubious and unreliable nature of his defence. In addition, drug trafficking-related paraphernalia including empty plastic packets, masking tape and digital weighing scales were found in his possession, and he had admitted that the “A” and “D” drugs were intended for trafficking. The presence of such paraphernalia may not have been determinative of whether he was indeed a courier in respect of the “D” drugs, but it would increase the likelihood that all the drugs mentioned in the charge were intended for trafficking.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 The multiple material inconsistencies and contradictions in the accused’s evidence demonstrated that he had lied on numerous matters. By his own admission, he had falsely implicated Salim to lend credence to his story. More importantly, the accused had offered no credible explanation for his involvement with the “D” drugs. He could not account for why the “D” drugs were all in his possession. He also could not provide a consistent narrative of what he was supposed to do as a courier for “Ah Kwang”. On his own evidence, he did not pay anyone to obtain the “D” drugs, and he would not be paid to deliver them to anyone either. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 It was absolutely incredible that such a large quantity of drugs would simply have been sent to the accused on “Ah Kwang”’s instructions, purportedly for him to safekeep and deliver them without any expectation of payment. There was no clear benefit for the accused himself, such as in being entitled to a share of the “D” drugs for his own use, since he had claimed that “Pekboon” might end up taking all five “stones”. Conversely, it would also have been incredible for “Ah Kwang” to have entrusted him, through a cold call, for such a large quantity of drugs for delivery, and to make him responsible for collecting very substantial payments from Salim and “Pekboon”, when the accused and “Ah Kwang” had never even contacted or met each other before.

</div> Bearing in mind the accused’s undisputed status as a drug trafficker who would repack and sell the “A” drugs, the irresistible inference to be drawn from the totality of the evidence was that he had “ordered” the drugs from a supplier (who may or may not have been “Ah Kwang”) and had similarly intended to repack and sell the “D” drugs. Having carefully examined the main facets of the accused’s “courier” defence, I found that this was the most reasonable and obvious inference to be drawn. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 In sum, I concluded that the accused did not discharge his burden of showing that he was a courier in respect of the “D” drugs. Having regard to the accused’s evasive and sometimes incoherent answers, I was drawn to conclude that the truth of the matter was simply not what the accused had claimed. It would indeed appear that his evidence was erratic and confused, but this would only have been so because he had repeatedly lied in so many areas that he could no longer keep track of exactly which of his claims were fact and which of those were fiction. His perennially shifting evidence meant that it was virtually impossible to discern the whole truth from his tangled web of lies and embellishments, which were intermingled with selective admissions on his part.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 Having carefully considered the evidence in totality, I found that the accused’s “consumption” defence in relation to the “B” drugs and his “courier” defence in relation to the “D” drugs were both not credible. I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proven the charge beyond reasonable doubt. I found therefore that the accused was in possession of the “A”, “B” and “D” drugs for the purpose of trafficking. In relation to the “D” drugs, he had not shown on the balance of probabilities that he was merely a courier.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 The accused was found guilty as charged and convicted accordingly. While the Prosecution informed me that a certificate of substantive assistance would be issued given that the accused was deemed to have co-operated in disrupting drug activities, the alternative sentencing regime was not available to him in view of my finding that he was not a courier. Accordingly, I sentenced the accused to the mandatory death penalty.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 I should add that even if I had erred in finding that the “B” drugs were in his possession for the purpose of trafficking, the combined weight of the “A” and “D” drugs, being 24.4g, would far exceed the 15g threshold beyond which capital punishment was prescribed. The mandatory death penalty would still have to be imposed upon conviction.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">See Kee Oon<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Chin Jincheng, Heershan Kaur and Ng Jun Kai </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">(Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the Prosecution;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Mahesh Rai s/o Vedprakash Rai (Drew &amp; Napier LLC) and </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Subir Singh Grewal (Aequitas Law LLP) for the accused. </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
