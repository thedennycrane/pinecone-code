In criminal law, sentencing benchmarks and guidelines help to ensure consistency in the court’s exercise of its wide sentencing discretion. They also simplify the judicial task of coming to a just sentence. However, as the present case demonstrates, sentencing benchmarks and guidelines must be applied with care and sensitivity to the facts of each case. As much as consistency in sentencing is an important aspect of fairness, the court must never exercise its sentencing discretion in a purely formulaic manner. Sentencing is always fact-sensitive. The court plays the important role of tempering justice with mercy, and of making a well-rounded assessment of what would be a fair sentence on the facts of <span class="font-italic">each </span>case. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The appellant in the present appeal, Ms Tan Wei (“the Appellant”), pleaded guilty to 11 charges under s 49(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Trade Marks Act (Cap 332, 2005 Rev Ed) (“TMA”) in the court below.

The actual sentence meted out for each s 49(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) TMA charge should be determined only after the following factors, among others, have been taken into account as well:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the size of the offender’s business;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the number of employees in the offender’s business; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the financial figures relating to the offender’s business (in terms of both revenue and profits);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) whether a syndicate was involved;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) the number of infringing articles involved; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) the nature and value of the infringing articles;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) the duration of the infringement;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(h) the manner of infringement and the degree of permanence in the offender’s dealings with the infringing articles (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, whether the offender had a shopfront); and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(i) whether compensation was made to the affected trade mark owners.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 These factors were mentioned and discussed in <span class="font-italic">Goik</span><span class="font-italic"> Soon Guan</span>, and I reiterate what I stated there. I would also add that particularly in the context of a s 49(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) TMA offence, which typically involves a significant number of variables, the court must be especially careful not to be overly formulaic in its approach. Having considered the facts and the issues arising in the present appeal, I would make several additional observations to supplement the sentencing framework outlined in <span class="font-italic">Goik</span><span class="font-italic"> Soon Guan</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 First, Mr Tan has pointed out to this court that looking purely at the <span class="font-italic">number of infringing articles </span>involved may not accurately reflect the scale of the offender’s operations or the gravity of his wrongdoing. I find some merit in this submission. It would be inaccurate to assess the gravity of a s 49(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) TMA offence by looking at the <span class="font-italic">number</span> of infringing articles in isolation, without also taking into account their <span class="font-italic">nature</span> (including their value). For example, as the learned deputy public prosecutor, Ms Tan Si En (“Ms Tan”), has confirmed, a pair of earrings or a pair of shoes would count as <span class="font-italic">two</span> items (by virtue of the fact that a pair consists of two articles), whereas a single article such as a hair-clip or a hair-tie would count as <span class="font-italic">one</span> item, and likewise for single items of a larger size and/or a higher value such as a bag or a play-station. It is therefore important that the court does not simply compare the total number of infringing articles with past precedents without taking into account the nature of the infringing articles involved. As an illustration, it would probably be fair to say that an offender who is found selling 500 hair-clips or 500 pairs of earrings is guilty of a less serious offence than another offender selling 100 counterfeit play-stations, in that the value of the infringing articles in the former scenario would, in all likelihood, be significantly lower. Yet, if the court were to simply compare the number of infringing articles involved, the scale of the operations in the former scenario would seem to be much larger. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 Second, caution must be exercised when assessing the gravity of a s 49(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) TMA offence based on the <span class="font-italic">number</span><span class="font-italic"> of charges</span> which the offender faces. In this regard, Ms Tan has informed the court that the number of charges brought against an offender depends on the class of goods involved and the number of trade mark proprietors affected. A separate charge is brought for each class of goods, as well as for each instance of infringing a different trade mark proprietor’s intellectual property rights. In other words, the more diverse the trade marks falsely applied and the wider the range of goods sold by an offender, the higher the number of charges he will face. In my view, the court should not automatically treat the totality of an offender’s wrongdoing as being more serious merely because a greater number of charges are brought against him. The point I wish to underscore here is that the wrongful use of a wider range of trade marks and/or the sale of a wider range of infringing goods does not <span class="font-italic">ipso facto</span> mean that greater harm is therefore caused. Equally pertinent factors in this regard are (among others) the <span class="font-italic">number</span> and the <span class="font-italic">nature</span> of the infringing articles, as well as their value – items of modest value cannot be treated in the same way as big-ticket items. Therefore, care must be exercised when comparing the number of charges in a case with sentencing precedents. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 A further point should be made in this regard. The sentencing guidelines articulated in <span class="font-italic">Goik</span><span class="font-italic"> Soon Guan </span>(and cited at [13] above) operate on a <span class="font-italic">per charge</span> basis. Where three or more charges are preferred against an offender, the sentences of at least two of the charges (and normally, it would not be more than two charges) would be ordered to run consecutively (see s 307(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) and <span class="font-italic">Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v Public Prosecutor </span>[2014] 2 SLR 998 (“<span class="font-italic">Mohamed Shouffee</span>”) at [80]). Therefore, the number of charges brought against an offender could affect the harshness of his total sentence. Take, for example, an offender who sets up a business selling solely counterfeit Prada bags, as compared to an offender who sells an equal number of bags bearing a greater variety of counterfeit trade marks. The offender in the latter scenario would face many more charges due to his false application of a wider range of trade marks. All things being equal, however, the sentence received by the offender in each of these scenarios should not differ too greatly. The court should ensure that an offender facing three or more charges is not punished <span class="font-italic">significantly </span><span class="font-italic">more harshly</span> than an offender facing less than three charges. In such situations, the court should scrutinise the facts carefully and calibrate the sentence appropriately, so that where an offender’s culpability is broadly the same as that of another offender, there should not be <span class="font-italic">great disparity</span> in their sentences even if the number of charges brought against them is different. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 As new fact patterns come before the court, further refinements to the application of the sentencing principles and guidelines discussed above will need to be made. What is important to bear in mind in this regard is that as much as these benchmark sentences and guidelines are helpful, the court must ultimately ensure that in each case, the overall sentence matches the gravity of the offence(s) committed.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Was the sentence imposed by the DJ manifestly excessive?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 In the course of the submissions before this court, the sentence imposed on the Appellant was compared primarily with three sentencing precedents, namely, <span class="font-italic">Goik</span><span class="font-italic"> Soon Guan</span>, <span class="font-italic">PP</span><span class="font-italic"> v Li Na</span> and <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v </span><span class="font-italic">Goh Chor Guan</span> [2010] SGDC 336 (“<span class="font-italic">Goh Chor Guan</span>”). Having considered these precedents and the relevant sentencing principles set out above, I find the aggregate sentence of 14 months’ imprisonment which the DJ imposed manifestly excessive. In my view, having regard to the Appellant’s role in the entire counterfeit operation, her aggregate sentence should be reduced to nine months’ imprisonment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 As explained in <span class="font-italic">Goik</span><span class="font-italic"> Soon Guan</span> at [32], a good starting point is to consider the offender’s <span class="font-italic">level of involvement</span> in the entire counterfeit operation. In the present case, the DJ held that the Appellant’s involvement in the business was “at the very least in the ‘moderate’ category” (see the Judgment at [34]). In making this finding, the DJ took into account the fact that the Appellant: (a) ran the #02-25 City Plaza shop single-handedly from mid-November 2012 to November 2013; (b) employed two shop assistants; (c) went to China a few times on her own to procure further counterfeit goods; and (d) was responsible for collecting the sales proceeds from the shops (see the Judgment at [33]; see also [7(b)] above). On behalf of the Appellant, Mr Tan submits that the Appellant, at the worst, falls within the “lower end of the moderate spectrum” rather than the “moderate” category <span class="font-italic">simpliciter</span> because Chiu was the real person in charge, whereas the Appellant was essentially a “glorified employee” receiving a fixed salary as opposed to a share of the business’s profits.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify"> Appellant’s submissions at paras 2.2 and 2.3</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> In response, Ms Tan submits, on behalf of the Prosecution, that the fact that the Appellant was receiving a fixed salary does not in itself mean that she was simply an employee; the question remains as to what her role in the business was.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 I accept Mr Tan’s submission that the Appellant’s involvement was at the lower end of the moderate category. In my view, it is clear that from August to mid-November 2012, prior to Chiu’s incarceration, the Appellant was a mere employee and her involvement fell within the “low” category. Things <span class="font-italic">did</span> change after Chiu’s incarceration. The three shops continued in operation (until early 2013 for two of the shops), and the Appellant appears to have assumed a more managerial role, which involved tasks such as collecting the sales proceeds from the shops and travelling to China to source for more counterfeit goods on her own. It seems to me, however, that the Appellant never became the owner or completely in charge of the business even after Chiu was incarcerated. In particular, it is significant that in early 2013, she consulted Chiu about whether to close the three shops and did exactly as Chiu instructed her to. This suggests that even after Chiu’s incarceration, the Appellant never fully assumed the role of the boss or the owner of the business. She simply continued to assist Chiu in keeping his business afloat while he served his prison sentence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Although the Appellant was undeniably the <span class="font-italic">de facto</span> person running the business while Chiu was in prison, it is fair to say that she only had operational control, but never had the power to direct the scale or the development of the business. She still deferred to Chiu in those regards. Indeed, while I agree with the Prosecution that the mere fact that the Appellant was receiving a fixed salary did not necessarily reduce her <span class="font-italic">level of involvement</span> in the business to that of a mere employee, the fact that she treated the business’s profits as belonging to Chiu (and only obtained a salary from the business without sharing in the profits) shows that she did not own the business; nor was she totally in charge. Therefore, although the Appellant was certainly not a mere employee so as to fall into the “low” involvement category, she was not the typical business owner running her own small business selling counterfeit goods either. I therefore find that the DJ erred in classifying the Appellant’s involvement as simply falling within the “moderate” category, and instead accept Mr Tan’s submission that her level of involvement fell within the <span class="font-italic">lower end</span> of the “moderate” category.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Moving on to consider the sentencing precedents cited, I find it difficult to accept the DJ’s ruling that the present case is “similar but slightly more serious” than <span class="font-italic">Goh Chor Guan</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(see the Judgment at [36]–[37]).

</div>
</div> In <span class="font-italic">Goh Chor Guan</span>, the offender was charged and convicted under s 49(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the TMA for possessing counterfeit apparel and bags for the purpose of trade, and was sentenced to 13 months’ imprisonment. The offender and his wife ran a business selling counterfeit apparel and bags sourced from Guangzhou, China. They set up makeshift stalls at various housing estates to sell the goods, and also appeared to have operated two shops. Furthermore, they used their residence to store the counterfeit goods shipped from China. A total of 4,073 infringing goods were involved, taking into account both the five charges proceeded with and the ten charges which were taken into consideration. I would add that the judge in <span class="font-italic">Goh Chor Guan</span> found that the offences were “premeditated and well organized” (at [9]). He also held that the offender was “the prime mover in importing and selling [the] counterfeit goods”, and was “assisted by his wife” (at [9]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 The number of infringing items involved in <span class="font-italic">Goh Chor Guan</span> is quite comparable to that in the present case. While it is arguable that the initial scale of the business in the present case was not dissimilar to that in <span class="font-italic">Goh Chor Guan</span>, that was no longer so after the Appellant closed two of the three shops in early 2013. Moreover, there is one key point of difference. Unlike the offender in <span class="font-italic">Goh Chor Guan</span>, the Appellant was not in charge of the entire business and did not own it; she was only the temporary manager. Furthermore, the duration of the infringement in <span class="font-italic">Goh Chor Guan</span> was close to two years (from February 2008 to January 2010), unlike the infringement in the present case, which was for about a year from mid-November 2012 to November 2013 (<span class="font-italic">viz</span>, the period during which the Appellant ran the business single-handedly following Chiu’s incarceration). Bearing all these factors in mind, I am of the view that the offender’s wrongdoing in <span class="font-italic">Goh Chor </span><span class="font-italic">Guan</span> was more serious than the Appellant’s wrongdoing in the present case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Mr Tan has sought to persuade me that the present case is less serious than <span class="font-italic">PP v Li Na</span>, where the offender was sentenced to an aggregate imprisonment term of only six months and two weeks. The key facts of <span class="font-italic">PP v Li Na</span> were described at [10] above and do not have to be repeated here. It suffices to say that I have some difficulties in accepting Mr Tan’s submissions on this point. In my view, the present case is <span class="font-italic">more</span> serious than <span class="font-italic">PP v Li Na</span> because the duration of the infringement is far longer (about a year, compared to approximately three months in <span class="font-italic">PP v Li Na</span>), and the scale of the business is also significantly larger. In <span class="font-italic">PP v Li Na</span>, the offender operated only one shop and was found with less than a thousand infringing articles in her possession. In the present case, the Appellant, for a few months at least, operated three shops. Further, more than 3,000 infringing articles are involved in the present case even if I take into account only the 11 charges which the Appellant pleaded guilty to; more than 6,000 infringing articles are involved if the charges taken into consideration are included (see [18] of the Judgment). Of course, I recognise that in <span class="font-italic">PP v </span><span class="font-italic">Li Na</span>, the offender was the owner of the business, whereas the Appellant here was only the temporary manager of the business; I also note that the offender in <span class="font-italic">PP v </span><span class="font-italic">Li Na</span> had two prior similar convictions (for both of which she only received fines). Still, weighing up all the pertinent factors, I find that the Appellant deserves a heavier aggregate sentence than that meted out in <span class="font-italic">PP v Li Na</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Turning now to <span class="font-italic">Goik</span><span class="font-italic"> Soon Guan</span>, the Prosecution submits that the aggregate sentence of nine months’ imprisonment which this court imposed in that case, on appeal by the offender, was justified because the offender had voluntarily made compensation of $100,000 to the affected trade mark proprietors. In <span class="font-italic">Goik</span><span class="font-italic"> Soon Guan</span>, the offender sold bedding products on which trade marks of well-known brands such as Disney, Hello Kitty, Doraemon, Thomas and Friends as well as Manchester United Football Club had been falsely applied. The products were sourced from Guangzhou, China. The offender rented a shop, and also operated out of temporary makeshift stalls located at night markets and outside shops in heartland areas. At the trial, the Prosecution proceeded with four charges: one under s 49(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the TMA, which involved a total of 3,015 infringing products, and three under s 136(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Copyright Act (Cap 63, 2006 Rev Ed) (“CA”), which involved approximately 3,400 infringing articles. (For present purposes, the s 136(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) CA offence can be taken to be the copyright equivalent of the s 49(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) TMA offence as the two offences are, in essence, very much the same and also carry the same sentence.) At first instance, the district judge sentenced the offender to an aggregate sentence of 15 months’ imprisonment. On appeal to the High Court, that aggregate sentence was reduced to nine months’ imprisonment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The scale of the operations in <span class="font-italic">Goik</span><span class="font-italic"> Soon Guan</span> is quite similar to that in the present case: approximately 3,000 infringing articles were involved in the TMA charge(s) proceeded with in both cases, and the offenders in both cases ran relatively small-scale businesses, but owned or operated more than one shop (by which I include the temporary makeshift stalls operated in <span class="font-italic">Goik</span><span class="font-italic"> Soon Guan</span>) during the period of the infringement. Certain factual aspects of <span class="font-italic">Goik</span><span class="font-italic"> Soon Guan </span>tend to make the offender’s wrongdoing in that case <span class="font-italic">more</span> serious than the Appellant’s wrongdoing in the present case, namely: (a) the offender in <span class="font-italic">Goik</span><span class="font-italic"> Soon Guan</span> was still operating more than one shop at the time of his arrest, whereas the Appellant operated only one shop (<span class="font-italic">viz</span>, the #02-25 City Plaza shop) at the time she was arrested in November 2013, having, much earlier that year, closed the other two shops originally set up by Chiu (see [5] above); (b) the profit margins of the offender in <span class="font-italic">Goik</span><span class="font-italic"> Soon Guan</span> were far higher in percentage terms (up to 90%) than the Appellant’s profit margins; (c) the offender in <span class="font-italic">Goik</span><span class="font-italic"> Soon Guan</span> owned the business concerned, whereas the Appellant did not; and (d) a far greater number of infringing items were involved in the charges proceeded with in <span class="font-italic">Goik</span><span class="font-italic"> Soon Guan</span> (this does not, however, detract from what I said earlier at [16] above about the importance of not looking at the number of infringing articles involved <span class="font-italic">in isolation</span>). At the same time, however, the following factors in <span class="font-italic">Goik</span><span class="font-italic"> Soon Guan</span> tend to make the offender’s wrongdoing in that case <span class="font-italic">less</span> serious than the Appellant’s wrongdoing: (a) the offender in <span class="font-italic">Goik</span><span class="font-italic"> Soon Guan</span> sold only bedding products, whereas the Appellant sold many types of luxury goods (see [2] above); (b) the profit margins of the offender in <span class="font-italic">Goik</span><span class="font-italic"> Soon Guan</span> amounted, in absolute terms, to only $9 (see <span class="font-italic">Goik</span><span class="font-italic"> Soon Guan</span> at [41]), whereas the Appellant’s profit margins in absolute terms, although only a few dollars for smaller items such as earrings, were as high as $60 for larger items such as bags; and (c) the offender in <span class="font-italic">Goik</span><span class="font-italic"> Soon Guan</span> voluntarily made compensation of $100,000 to the trade mark owners concerned. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 All things considered, I find, on balance, that the Appellant’s s 49(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) TMA offences can be said to be of similar gravity to the offences in <span class="font-italic">Goik</span><span class="font-italic"> Soon Guan</span> (<span class="font-italic">viz</span>, one s 49(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) TMA offence and three s 136(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) CA offences). However, while I categorised the offender’s level of involvement in <span class="font-italic">Goik</span><span class="font-italic"> Soon Guan </span>as being “somewhere in the moderate to high involvement band” (at [40]) due to his ownership of the business concerned, I find, in contrast, that the Appellant’s level of involvement in the present case falls within the<span class="font-italic"> lower end</span> of the moderate category (see [22]–[23] above). This is because the Appellant was, in essence, an employee, albeit one who, owing to the circumstances, also temporarily managed the business on behalf of Chiu, the owner, while the latter was incarcerated.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 At this juncture, I should explain why, in <span class="font-italic">Goik</span><span class="font-italic"> Soon Guan</span>, an aggregate imprisonment term of only nine months – the same length as that which I am imposing in the present appeal – was meted out despite the offender’s higher level of involvement and the far greater number of infringing articles in the former. This was because of the offender’s voluntary payment of compensation of $100,000 to the affected trade mark owners. In this regard, it is important to note – and I emphasise this point – that while the payment of compensation is a mitigating factor, it <span class="font-italic">does not</span> follow that the non-payment of compensation amounts to an aggravating factor. As I mentioned earlier in this judgment, sentencing is invariably a fact-sensitive exercise which requires careful judgment, and does not lend itself to an excessively formulaic approach. The remorse of an offender must be assessed holistically, with any compensation paid being but one factor in that holistic assessment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Mr Tan submits that the absence of compensation by the Appellant in the present case should not be held against her because she does not have the means to offer compensation to the trade mark proprietors concerned. I agree. Although there is slim evidence on the Appellant’s means, what evidence there is before this court shows that the Appellant earned only $2,000 per month at the time she was managing the business; she also has a young child to support. Furthermore, as mentioned at [29] above, the Appellant was essentially an employee, albeit one who was temporarily managing the business due to the circumstances. (Indeed, this factor also accounts for my decision to classify the Appellant’s involvement as being at the <span class="font-italic">lower end</span> of the moderate spectrum; if the Appellant had in fact been the <span class="font-italic">owner</span>-cum-manager of the business, I would have put her level of involvement in the clear moderate category.) On the facts before me, I do not think that the Appellant’s non-payment of compensation similar to that made in <span class="font-italic">Goik</span><span class="font-italic"> Soon Guan</span> warrants imposing a stiffer sentence on her; she should be sentenced appropriately <span class="font-italic">without</span> treating her non-payment of compensation as an aggravating factor. I reiterate that the length of the aggregate imprisonment sentence imposed in <span class="font-italic">Goik</span><span class="font-italic"> Soon Guan</span> is, as explained at [30] above, due to the mitigating effect of the offender’s voluntary payment of compensation in that case. As the appellate judge who decided <span class="font-italic">Goik</span><span class="font-italic"> Soon Guan</span>, I am in a position to say that if not for this factor, the aggregate imprisonment sentence which I would have imposed on the offender would have been longer than that which I am imposing on the Appellant in the present appeal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Given my ruling that the Appellant’s involvement in the business was at the lower end of the moderate category, and that her s 49(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) TMA offences were less serious than those in <span class="font-italic">Goh Chor Guan</span>, but more serious than those in <span class="font-italic">PP v Li Na</span> and of similar gravity to the s 49(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) TMA and the s 136(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) CA offences in <span class="font-italic">Goik</span><span class="font-italic"> Soon Guan </span>(after giving credit for the compensation made by the offender in that case), I find that the aggregate sentence of 14 months’ imprisonment which the DJ imposed is manifestly excessive, and that a total imprisonment term of nine months is more appropriate. Accordingly, I would reduce the sentences meted out by the DJ for the Appellant’s offences as follows:</div><table class="table table-sm table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Case No.</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">No. of goods</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">DJ’s sentence</span><div class="font-weight-bold"><br/>(No. of months)</div></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">My sentence</span><div class="font-weight-bold"><br/>(No. of months)</div></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-center">DAC 916389/2014</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center">13</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center">3</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center">2</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-center">DAC 916468/2014</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center">44</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center">3</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center">2</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">DAC 916470/2014</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">124</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">6</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">4</span></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">DAC 916473/2014</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">2,711</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">7</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">5</span></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-center">DAC 916478/2014</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center">16</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center">3</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center">2</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-center">DAC 916483/2014</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center">297</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center">6</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center">4</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-center">DAC 916486/2014</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center">425</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center">6</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center">4</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-center">DAC 916492/2014</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center">22</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center">3</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center">2</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-center">DAC 916496/2014</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center">17</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center">3</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center">2</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-center">DAC 916497/2014</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center">3</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center">1</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center">1</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-center">DAC 916498/2014</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center">24</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center">3</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center">2</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 In addition, unlike the DJ, who ordered the sentences for three of the Appellant’s offences to run consecutively, I am ordering only two of the sentences – <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, those for the offences in DAC 916470/2014 and DAC 916473/2014 (as highlighted in bold in the table above) – to run consecutively. The rest of the sentences are to run concurrently. This is because all of the Appellant’s offences arose, in essence, from the same business operation, and there are no exceptional circumstances which warrant ordering more than two of the sentences to run consecutively (see <span class="font-italic">Mohamed Shouffee </span>at [80]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 In conclusion, for the reasons set out above, I allow the Appellant’s appeal against her sentence.
