As part of the terms of the sale, CNAV was to repay an intercompany loan due to the Company. An SGD bank account was being opened in Vietnam to enable remittance of the balance amount that was outstanding.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The Dubai Proceedings and Qatar Proceedings were not yet resolved.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d)  The Company had entered into an Implementation Agreement dated 29 April 2016 with an investor, SCR International Holdings Pte Ltd (“SCR”) for the proposed transfer of the Company’s listing status to SCR or a related corporation. The judicial managers required time to review and consider key deliverables expected to be made available by SCR, and to ascertain if the conditions precedent for the transfer of the Company’s listing status were likely to be fulfilled by SCR in time. In this connection, the Singapore Exchange (“SGX-ST”) had given the Company up to 15 July 2016 to submit a proposal with a view to resuming trading of its shares (“the Resumption Proposal”). Trading of the Company’s shares had been suspended as a result of the JM Order.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 On 9 March 2017, I granted the judicial managers’ application to extend the JM Order for a further six months until 12 September 2017.

</div> The reasons for this third extension were as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The shares in Urbanise.com had not been sold because of the low price and low trading volume of the shares.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The repayment by CNAV of the intercompany loan was pending approval from the State Bank of Vietnam for remittance to the Company.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The Dubai Proceedings were still pending.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The Company had reached a settlement in relation to the Qatar Proceedings but the benefits of the settlement had not been received.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) The Implementation Agreement with SCR had been terminated by mutual agreement because it was unlikely that SCR could satisfy the conditions precedent within the intended timeline.

However, in April and May 2017, the judicial managers had received expressions of interest in the Company’s listing status, from De Run International Resources (“De Run”) and Treasure Capital Group (“Treasure”). Treasure represented a group of Malaysian investors. In early July 2017, De Run withdrew as it was unable to meet the judicial manager’s deadline of 15 July 2017 (which was the deadline for the Company to submit the Resumption Proposal). On 13 July 2017, the Company entered into an Implementation Agreement with the Malaysian investors. On 14 July 2017, the judicial managers submitted an application to SGX-ST to further extend the deadline for submission of the Resumption Proposal, to 15 July 2018.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 By order of court dated 26 January 2018, one of the judicial managers was given leave to resign.

</div>
</div> The reasons for this fifth extension were that one of the Malaysian investors had withdrawn and the remaining investors had procured funding from a third party and were working out the conditions for the drawdown of the loan. It was estimated that they could draw down on the loan by late March or early April 2018. In the meantime, the SGX-ST had extended the deadline for the submission of the Resumption Proposal to 15 July 2018.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 On 19 September 2018, I granted the judicial manager’s application to further extend the JM Order for a further six months until 12 March 2019.

</div>
</div> The reasons for this sixth extension were that the funding arrangements for the Malaysian investors were formalised in April 2018, the Company had shortlisted PrimePartners Corporate Finance Pte Ltd (“PPCF”) to act as financial adviser and full sponsor for the listing Assets, and PPCF had shortlisted a number of valuers. The judicial manager had also applied to SGX-ST for a further extension of one year until 15 July 2019 for submission of the Resumption Proposal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 By way of SUM 655/2019, the Company applied to extend the JM Order for a further six months until 12 September 2019. The supporting affidavit stated that this seventh extension was necessary because the Implementation Agreement with the Malaysian investors had lapsed and been terminated. The reason for this was that the investors could not satisfy the conditions precedent by the long-stop date of 28 November 2018. However, the judicial manager had entered into a non-binding term sheet with another potential investor, Berlitz Marine Pte Ltd (“Berlitz”), pursuant to which the transfer of the listing status of the Company would be effected by way of a scheme of arrangement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 On 5 March 2019, I heard the Company’s application. The Company’s solicitor informed me that on 22 February 2019, Berlitz had also withdrawn from proceeding further. According to the Company’s solicitor, the judicial manager was now following up with two other potential investors.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 Section 227B(1) of the Act emphatically states that the court may make a judicial management order if, and only if, </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) it is satisfied that the company is or will be unable to pay its debts; <span class="font-italic">and </span></div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) it considers that the making of the order would be likely to achieve one or more of the purposes set out in s 227B(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">A judicial management order should therefore not be extended unless the extension would be likely to achieve one or more of the purposes for which the order had been made. I noted as well that the judicial manager has an obligation to apply to court for the JM Order to be discharged if it appears to him that the remaining purpose specified in the order is incapable of achievement: s 227Q(1) of the Act.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 In the present case, the JM Order was made because it was considered that the making of the order would be likely to achieve one or more of the purposes set out in s 227B(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>): see [3] above. However, by 12 March 2018, the only purpose remaining for the JM Order, was to achieve a more advantageous realisation of the Company’s assets than would be effected on a winding up. The only asset left was the Company’s listing status. It was incumbent on the judicial manager to satisfy this court that extending the JM Order was likely to achieve a more advantageous realisation of the Company’s listing status. However, all that was placed before me was the Company’s solicitor’s statement that the judicial manager was following up on two other potential investors. At best, this was no more than an expression of hope. In my view, it was insufficient basis to justify an extension of the JM Order. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 In addition, the judicial manager(s) has had more than ample opportunity during the last three and a half years to try to sell the Company’s listing status. The Company was placed under judicial management in September 2015. Since then, the JM Order has been extended six times. The judicial manager(s) has courted no less than six potential suitors (from SCR to Berlitz) for the Company’s listing status. Each of these courtships have failed, the last at a very early stage. The Company cannot expect to keep extending the JM Order based on nothing more than hope. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 In my judgment, there was no reason for me to conclude that further extending the JM Order in this case would be likely to achieve a more advantageous realisation of the Company’s listing status than on a winding up. In the circumstances, the right thing to do, in my view, was to bring the judicial management to an end. Accordingly, I dismissed the Company’s application to further extend the JM Order.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Chua Lee Ming  <br/>Judge  </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Lim Hui Li Debby, Goh Keng Huang and Jason Leong<br/>(Shook Lin &amp; Bok LLP) for the applicant.<br/></div><div class="Judg-Quote-List text-justify"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
