These costs and the Brothers’ own legal fees for OS 1241 were charged to the Estate. Thereafter, the half-siblings were each paid their entitlement of $500,000 on 19 October 2004.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Before we set out the terms of the April 2017 Order and of the Main Order, it is important to distinguish between:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) an account of administration on a general or common basis;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) an account of administration on a wilful default basis; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) an account of profits. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 The former two are procedures for the accounting of funds. As Vinodh Coomaraswamy J explained in <span class="font-italic">Cheong Soh Chin and others </span><span class="font-italic">v Eng Chiet Shoong and others</span> [2019] 4 SLR 714 (“<span class="font-italic">Cheong Soh Chin</span>”):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">72   A common account, otherwise known as the general account, or the account in common form, does not depend on wrongdoing. The practical significance of this is that the beneficiary is entitled ‘as of right’ to be given an account in common form of the trustee’s stewardship of the trust assets, without the beneficiary having to show that the trustee has committed a breach of trust (see the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Foo </span><span class="font-italic">Jee Seng v Foo Jhee Tuang</span> [2012] 4 SLR 339 at [87]; Lord Millett NPJ’s judgment in <span class="font-italic">Libertarian Investments Ltd v Hall</span> (2013) 16 HKCFAR 681 (‘<span class="font-italic">Libertarian</span> <span class="font-italic">Investments</span>’) at [167]).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">74   The claim for a common account is divided into three phases ([<span class="font-italic">Chng</span><span class="font-italic"> Weng Wah v Goh Bak Heng</span> [2016] 2 SLR 464] at [22]). First, the question is asked whether the claimant has a right to an account. Second, the taking of the account. Third, the court grants consequential relief. It can thus be observed that the taking of an account is a <span class="font-italic">process</span>. It is not, in itself, a remedy (see also [<span class="font-italic">Lalwani</span><span class="font-italic"> Shalini Gobind v Lalwani Ashok Bherumal </span>[2017] SGHC 90] at [26]).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">77   A trustee’s account, once furnished, may disclose discrepancies. The beneficiary can then decide whether he wishes to falsify a discrepant entry, or to surcharge the account. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 In contrast, an account on the footing of wilful default is distinguishable from a common account in <span class="font-italic">at least</span> two ways. First, an account on the footing of wilful default is premised on misconduct by the trustee and is not available to a beneficiary as of right. The beneficiary must allege and prove at least one act of wilful neglect or default: see<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Ong Jane Rebecca v Lim Lie Hoa and Others </span>[2005] SGCA 4 (“<span class="font-italic">Ong Jane Rebecca</span>”) at [61]; <span class="font-italic">Cheong Soh Chin </span>at [80] and [81]. Second, the scope of an account on a wilful default basis is wider than that of an account on a common basis. As we held in <span class="font-italic">Ong Jane Rebecca </span>at [55]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… In a common or standard account, … the trustee need only account for what was actually received and his disbursement and distribution of it. In an account on the basis of wilful default, the trustee is not only required to account for what he has received, but also for what he might have received had it not been for the default. In the latter case, the accounting party also carries a much more substantial burden of proof than that which applies to him in the case of a common account: see <span class="font-italic">Glazier v Australian Men’s Health </span><span class="font-italic">(No 2) </span>[2001] NSWSC 6.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The scope of an account taken on the basis of wilful default is also broader in that the judge or registrar taking the account is entitled to look into all aspects of the trustee’s management of the trust property and require the trustee to explain any suspect transaction, even if that particular transaction has not been complained of by the beneficiary: <span class="font-italic">Cheong Soh Chin </span>at [83]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 We emphasise two further points. First, that following the taking of an account, the beneficiary is entitled to ask for an inquiry to discover what the trustee did with any money that was misappropriated. The taking of an account is merely a step in the process. Second, that while the beneficiary may elect whether to call for an account or further inquiry, it is the court which always has the last word. As Lord Millett NPJ explained in <span class="font-italic">Libertarian Investments Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Thomas Alexej Hall</span> (2013) 16 HKCFAR 681 (“<span class="font-italic">Libertarian Investments</span>”):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">167.   It is often said that the primary remedy for breach of trust or fiduciary duty is an order for an account, but this is an abbreviated and potentially misleading statement of the true position. In the first place an account is not a remedy for wrong. Trustees and most fiduciaries are accounting parties, and their beneficiaries or principals do not have to prove that there has been a breach of trust or fiduciary duty in order to obtain an order for account. Once the trust or fiduciary relationship is established or conceded the beneficiary or principal is entitled to an account as of right. Although like all equitable remedies an order for an account is discretionary, in making the order the court is not granting a remedy for wrong but enforcing performance of an obligation. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">168.   In the second place an order for an account does not in itself provide the plaintiff with a remedy; it is merely the first step in a process which enables him to identify and quantify any deficit in the trust fund and seek the appropriate means by which it may be made good. Once the plaintiff has been provided with an account he can falsify and surcharge it. If the account discloses an unauthorised disbursement the plaintiff may falsify it, that is to say ask for the disbursement to be disallowed. … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">169.   <span class="font-italic">But the plaintiff is not bound to ask for the disbursement to be disallowed. He is entitled to ask for an inquiry to discover what the defendant did with the trust money which he misappropriated and whether he dissipated it or invested it, and if he invested it whether he did so at a profit or a loss.</span> If he dissipated it or invested it at a loss, the plaintiff will naturally have the disbursement disallowed and disclaim any interest in the property in which it was invested by treating it as bought with the defendant’s own money. If, however, the defendant invested the money at a profit, the plaintiff is not bound to ask for the disbursement to be disallowed. He can treat it as an authorised disbursement, treat the property in which it has been invested as acquired with trust money, and follow or trace the property and demand that it or its traceable proceeds be restored to the trust <span class="font-italic">in specie</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">170.   If on the other hand the account is shown to be defective because it does not include property which the defendant in breach of his duty failed to obtain for the benefit of the trust, the plaintiff can surcharge the account by asking for it to be taken on the basis of ‘wilful default’, that is to say on the basis that the property should be treated as if the defendant had performed his duty and obtained it for the benefit of the trust. Since <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">hypothesi</span> the property has not been acquired, the defendant will be ordered to make good the deficiency by the payment of money, and in this case the payment of ‘equitable compensation’ is akin to the payment of damages as compensation for loss.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">172.   At every stage the plaintiff can elect whether or not to seek a further account or inquiry. The amount of any unauthorised disbursement is often established by evidence at the trial, so that the plaintiff does not need an account but can ask for an award of the appropriate amount of compensation. Or he may be content with a monetary award rather than attempt to follow or trace the money, in which case he will not ask for an inquiry as to what has become of the trust property. <span class="font-italic">In short, he may elect not to call for an account or further inquiry if it is unnecessary or unlikely to be fruitful, though the court will always have the last word</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Upon the taking of an account, whether on a wilful default or common basis, discrepancies may be discovered and consequential orders made. For example, a beneficiary may decide to falsify a wrongful expense or loss charged to the account. In simple terms, this means that the beneficiary may require that that entry in the account be deleted or disallowed so that the expense or loss is no longer charged to the account. The trustee has to reconstitute the trust fund <span class="font-italic">in specie </span>or in monetary terms (<span class="font-italic">Sim </span><span class="font-italic">Poh Ping v Winsta Holding Pte Ltd and another and other appeals </span>[2020] SGCA 35 (“<span class="font-italic">Winsta</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [112]). On the other hand, the beneficiary may seek to have the account surcharged, for example, where the beneficiary can show that the trustee received more than the account records indicate: <span class="font-italic">Cheong Soh Chin </span>at [79]. In the context of an account taken on the basis of wilful default, this extends to treating the assets which the trustee failed to obtain for the benefit of the trust in breach of his duties as having been obtained (see <span class="font-italic">Winsta</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [120]). In simple terms, the benefit is added to the account. A surcharge would ordinarily be the remedy sought following the taking of an account on the basis of wilful default (see <span class="font-italic">Winsta</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [120] and <span class="font-italic">Libertarian Investments </span>at [170]), although this is not to say that it is the <span class="font-italic">only </span>remedy that can be ordered. We emphasise that an account of profits is conceptually <span class="font-italic">distinct </span>from a surcharge, with the focus of the former being on the gain to the fiduciary (see below at [30]), and the latter being focused on the <span class="font-italic">loss </span>to the trust fund (<span class="font-italic">Winsta</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [120]–[121]). In our respectful view, some confusion was caused in the present case by the conflation of these two distinct remedies.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The taking of accounts may also <span class="font-italic">reveal</span> breaches of fiduciary duty for which an account of profits may be ordered. Unlike the taking of accounts, an account of profits is a <span class="font-italic">remedy</span> as opposed to a process. In <span class="font-italic">Lalwani</span><span class="font-italic"> Shalini Gobind and another v Lalwani Ashok Bherumal </span>[2017] SGHC 90 at [26], Aedit Abdullah JC explained that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the taking of accounts on either [a common basis or a wilful default basis] should not be conflated with an account of profits. While there is a common aspect between the taking of accounts and the accounting of profits in that they both attempt to quantify the deficit, if any, in the trust fund that must be made good by the defendant to the claimant, the taking of accounts is a process, while <span class="font-italic">accounting of profit is a remedy. Thus, an account of profits is usually the very relief sought by claimants, whereas the taking of accounts may only be the first step, to be followed by the beneficiary’s objections to the accounts presented and his claim for specific reliefs</span> ([<span class="font-italic">Snell’s</span> <span class="font-italic">Equity</span> (John McGhee gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 33rd Ed, 2015] at para 20-017; Lord Millett NPJ, <span class="font-italic">Libertarian Investments Ltd v Hall</span> (2013) 16 HKCFAR 681 at [168]). There are other nuanced differences.

The Sisters had in the Notice of Objection filed in response to the account provided by the Brothers, pursuant to the April 2017 Order, specifically included a “surcharge” by which they meant an account of profits, for “[u]nauthorised profits made” by the Brothers: the Judgment at [20]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The Sisters also argued that in an order for an account to be taken on a wilful default basis, the court is granted “a roving commission” to inquire into all aspects of the fiduciary’s administration.

</div>
</div> In <span class="font-italic">Cheong Soh Chin</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([24] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), the High Court also referred, at [83], to a “roving commission” citing <span class="font-italic">Bartlett v Barclays Bank Trust</span> <span class="font-italic">Co Ltd (No 2)</span> [1980] 1 Ch 515 at 546. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 We agree with the Brothers that the Judge had erred on the scope of the April 2017 Order in holding that paras 1 and 2 of the order sufficiently dealt with all remedies arising out of the taking of the account. Paragraphs 1 and 2 of that Order merely state that an account would be taken of the Estate’s assets on a wilful default basis. They do not deal with any remedy after the account is taken. That is dealt with in para 3 under which the Brothers are to make restitution to the Estate of any sums “misapplied, misappropriated or wrongly incurred”. However, any remuneration or profit which the Brothers received from the three companies by reason of their fiduciary position as executors of the Estate would not be a sum which they had misapplied or misappropriated from or wrongly incurred on behalf of the Estate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Furthermore, para 3, read in context with paras 1 and 2, does not include the remedy of an account of profits. Paragraph 3 is consistent with paras 1 and 2 which are only for an account on a wilful default basis. It does not limit or expand the width of paras 1 and 2 which do not themselves provide for an account of profits.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The Judge did not rely on para 4 of the April 2017 Order. In any event, para 4 pertains only to payments to be made from the Brothers to the Sisters “in the taking of such account”. To be clear, the reference to an “account” in para 4, read in context, refers to the taking of an account on a wilful default basis and not an account of profits as such.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 As for the Notice of Objection and Outline of Quantum, that is a separate point. They did not extend the scope of the April 2017 Order although they would have given notice to the Brothers of further remedies which the Sisters were seeking over and above those stated in the April 2017 Order. Notice is relevant to the question of whether any prejudice was caused to the Brothers by having the orders made at that particular point in time, instead of in a separate application or reverting to trial, a point which we return to at [48] below.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the Judge erred in requiring an account of profits and ordering the Brothers to make payment without another hearing </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 As stated in <span class="font-italic">Chng</span><span class="font-italic"> Weng Wah v Goh Bak Heng </span>[2016] 2 SLR 464 (“<span class="font-italic">Chng</span><span class="font-italic"> Weng Wah</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [22], cited in <span class="font-italic">Cheong Soh Chin </span>([24] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [74], the taking of an account is merely the second step in a three-step process, and is not a remedy for a wrong.

</div>
</div> The Brothers implicitly accepted this but argued that, given the manner in which the April 2017 Order was framed, the reliefs sought could only have been granted if a separate application was made or if the breaches of fiduciary duty were proven at trial, presumably, the main trial of HCF/S 6.

</div> They submitted that the February 2019 hearing was only in respect of the taking of an account pursuant to the April 2017 Order and not the hearing of the underlying action in HCF/S 6. The Judge had directed that the Brothers give oral evidence first even though they were the defendants in the action and the Sisters eventually decided not to give oral evidence. There was also a suggestion that the Sisters would have had to give evidence first at a trial.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 On the other hand, the Sisters argued that the February 2019 hearing was a hearing of the main action in HCF/S 6 as well. This was in addition to their argument that they had adequately prayed for an account of profits in the SOC, and that they had given sufficient notice of this in documents such as the Notice of Objection and the Outline of Quantum.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 We do not accept the Sisters’ contention that the February 2019 hearing was also a hearing of the main action. We note that the various probate case and pre-trial conferences between the date of the April 2017 Order and the February 2019 hearing suggest that there was often no clear distinction drawn by the court or the parties between the taking of an account pursuant to the April 2017 Order and the trial. Often, the two were dealt with together. For example, in determining that a category of documents sought by way of specific discovery was relevant, the Assistant Registrar hearing the application referred <span class="font-italic">both</span> to the April 2017 Order for the accounts to be taken <span class="font-italic">and </span>the assertions in the SOC.

This suggests that the February 2019 hearing was in respect of the taking of an account pursuant to the April 2017 Order only. The substance of the Judgment supports this view. For example, [19] of the Judgment states that at various junctures (of the February 2019 hearing), the Brothers’ counsel had suggested that the matter (regarding an account of profits) be listed again for trial or that a new statement of claim be filed, but no authorities were tendered in aid of this proposition.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Indeed the oral arguments on 4 April 2019, after the February 2019 hearing, show that the Judge was aware that the Brothers’ counsel was contending that the question of an account of profits be dealt with, for example, at a trial.

</div> While the Judge considered the extent to which the relief sought had been sufficiently prayed for in the SOC, she also went on to consider whether the remedies sought could be ordered notwithstanding the manner in which the April 2017 Order had been framed. It is significant that the Judge did not say that the terms of the April 2017 order were <span class="font-italic">irrelevant</span> because she was hearing the trial contemporaneously in any event. It seems that she instead concluded that the continuation of the trial was unnecessary in the light of the evidence that had already been adduced and she then proceeded to make final orders. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In the circumstances, we agree with the Brothers that the February 2019 hearing was the hearing for the taking of an account on a wilful default basis and not the trial. However, that is not the end of the matter. We accept that the Judge was entitled, in taking the account on the basis of wilful default, to consider and hear evidence on the Brothers’ remuneration and benefits-in-kind received. The court is granted a “roving commission” to inquire into all aspects of the fiduciary’s management of the trust property when an account is taken on a wilful default basis. In doing so, further breaches may be uncovered and established, as in the present case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 In any event, the Judge at [25] of the Judgment held that the “issue must be one of proper notice and opportunity to address any necessary points”. In essence, this was to ask whether any prejudice resulted to the Brothers from the Judge’s decision to make the orders at that point in time, as opposed to following, for example, a separate summons or trial. The Judge found that the Brothers had had sufficient notice and time to address all the allegations thoroughly and to make all arguments in their own favour. This consideration was rightly taken into account. It is not disputed that the Brothers knew that the Sisters were also seeking an account of profits from the Brothers in respect of the directors’ remuneration and benefits-in-kind. An account of profits in respect of the directors’ remuneration was expressly sought in the Sisters’ opening statement for the taking of accounts and before the Judge on 15 February 2019.

</div> That is not necessarily the case. Even if a separate trial had been held later or if the main trial had been heard together with the taking of the accounts, it would have been for the Judge to decide which party is to give evidence first, although this would ordinarily be the plaintiffs. Further, the Brothers appear to have assumed that the Sisters must give evidence but that is not the case. The Sisters could have elected to stand or fall by the evidence already available. Indeed, it appears that this is what transpired in the February 2019 hearing. They made their case, for better or worse, on the evidence already available. Furthermore, the Brothers had given their evidence by way of an affidavit and at the February 2019 hearing with knowledge of the Sisters’ allegations against them. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the Judge erred in removing the Brothers as executors of the Estate without a further hearing</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The Brothers also contended on appeal that their removal as executors of the Estate pursuant to s 32 of the Probate and Administration Act (Cap 251, 2000 Rev Ed) could not be ordered in the course of the taking of an account, and must instead be the subject of a separate application.

</div> At the hearing before us, Mr Philip Jeyaretnam SC (“Mr Jeyaretnam”), counsel for the Sisters, focused on the non-distribution of the Estate, because this allowed the Brothers to act without interference, for example, by remaining as directors and receiving the remuneration. Accordingly, Mr Jeyaretnam stated that the Sisters’ concern was with what he referred to as fundamental breaches of the core duty of loyalty, by intentionally failing to distribute the shares to further their own interests. The latter was said to be a breach of the no-conflict rule. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 We turn now to examine these alleged breaches.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Not informing the Sisters of their interest in the Estate</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The Sisters alleged that the Brothers did not inform them of their interests in the Estate and of the Estate’s interest in the companies in question for over 19 years after the Patriarch passed away.

However, given the manner in which the Brothers’ non-disclosure was characterised by the Judge, the Brothers would be in breach of their fiduciary duties if the Judge’s factual finding is upheld. On the facts of this particular case, our view is that the Judge’s inference that the Brothers had intentionally kept the Sisters uninformed does not warrant appellate intervention. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Non-distribution of the Estate’s assets, including its shares</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 The Brothers gave various reasons for their failure thus far to distribute the Estate’s assets, including the shares held in the three companies and HS. The material question here is whether the Brothers had good reason for their delay in distributing the assets held: see <span class="font-italic">Lim Heng How v Lim Meu </span><span class="font-italic">Beo </span>[2020] SGHC 49 at [42]. The Judge did not accept the reasons offered by the Brothers. She stated at [74] of the Judgment that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">74   The taking of accounts has also now established further breaches. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Ignoring their core duty of loyalty and fidelity, the Brothers have omitted to distribute dividends and the shares held by the Estate without any reasonable justification.</span> At the time of the summary hearing, the Brothers contended that the market had not recovered from the financial crisis until 2004, which was when they distributed the pecuniary bequests to their Half-Siblings. Nonetheless, their obligation commenced with the grant of probate in 2000, and during cross-examination at the taking of accounts, they were unable to furnish any good reason why they had not distributed the Estate shares <span class="font-italic">in specie</span>. <span class="font-italic">Doing so would not have required cash.</span> The Sisters’ component of the Estate shares was also small: they could have valued and then purchased the Sisters’ shares. Despite the small number of the shares, the substantial real estate portfolios the Companies held would have made the shares valuable. But whether in cash or <span class="font-italic">in specie</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> no distribution was contemplated up to the time this suit was filed. Their contention was that of oversight because they were not professional executors. This contention is disingenuous considering that [B1] has held multiple senior corporate positions. The executors would well have known that it was incumbent on them to seek and follow legal advice, as they had for [OS 1241]. Excuses proffered ranged from needing funds to maintain the JB Land, to requiring money to develop the JB Land, to engaging in a joint venture with a third party in respect of the JB Land. <span class="font-italic">In truth, attempt at either form of distribution of the shares, whether in cash or </span><span class="font-italic">in specie, would have alerted the Sisters to their share in a valuable stable of companies.</span> <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Brothers’ purpose was to keep their Sisters uninformed, in order to continue to extract value from the Companies in their capacity as directors.</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>In so doing, they have acted in conflict with, and to the detriment of, their Sisters’ interest. A new executor, or executors, as the case may be, are appropriate to ensure a timely and proper realisation and distribution of the assets. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 We accepted at [64] above that the Brothers had intentionally kept the Sisters uninformed of the Estate’s shareholding in the three companies and HS for their own benefit. One of the ways they did so was by omitting to distribute dividends and the shares held by the Estate. It would follow from this that they did not have good reason for the delay in distributing the Estate’s assets. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Voting the Estate’s shares in favour of the directors’ remuneration</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 The Brothers appeared to accept that they ought not to have voted the Estate’s shares in favour of the directors’ remuneration without the informed consent of the Sisters.

It was not in dispute that the Brothers did not inform the Sisters that they were receiving remuneration from the three companies in which the Estate held shares and that the Estate’s shares were used to vote in favour of the resolutions approving such remuneration. The Brothers also appeared to accept that a conflict of interest arose from the fact that the Brothers’ remuneration drew on the funds that might otherwise have been distributed to shareholders as dividends: the Judgment at [41] and [42].

</div> As we understand it, this was in essence an argument that the remuneration was not profit that was attributable to their position as executors of the Estate. This was allegedly so since the Brothers had been shareholders of the three companies and HS prior to the Patriarch’s death. Further, B2 and B3 had been appointed directors of the three companies and HS before the Patriarch’s death. B1 was appointed a director of HS before the Patriarch passed away and he was appointed a director of the three companies after the Patriarch’s demise.

They argued that the use of the Estate’s shares was immaterial to the approval of the directors’ remuneration as the resolutions would have been passed in any event since the Estate only held a very small minority shareholding in the three companies and was also a small minority shareholder in HS. Further, even if the Sisters had been told about the Estate’s shares in the three companies and HS, this would not have had any practical effect as the Brothers would still have obtained the remuneration they received.

The cases cited to us by the Sisters did not concern a similar factual matrix, although the general principles espoused therein may still be applicable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 We begin with the case of <span class="font-italic">Mona Computer</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([30] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), which the Sisters also relied on. In <span class="font-italic">Mona Computer, </span>the respondent-fiduciary was an officer of Mona Computer Systems (S) Pte Ltd (“Mona Computer”) and was found to have breached his fiduciary duties by diverting business opportunities from Mona Computer to his newly-incorporated company, MN Computer Systems (S) Pte Ltd (“MN”): see <span class="font-italic">Mona Computer</span> at [1], [4] and [6]. MN’s business was in direct competition with that of Mona Computer, and it paid commissions to the fiduciary at the same rate and on the same basis as Mona Computer had done. Before the High Court judge hearing the assessment of account of profits, one argument made was therefore that, had the fiduciary not breached his obligations to Mona Computer, the latter would have had to pay those commissions to him anyway (at [8]). The High Court judge set aside the order requiring the fiduciary to account for the commissions he obtained from MN. He found that had the fiduciary not set up MN and diverted the contracts, he would have continued his employment with Mona Computer and continued to receive commissions for his services. Therefore, the account of profits should take into account the commissions which Mona Computer would have had to pay to the fiduciary had he not breached his fiduciary duties. He held that, otherwise, Mona Computer would enjoy a windfall (at [9]). On appeal, this court said (at [13]–[14]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the account of profits should exclude sums which the principal would have had to pay the fiduciary, had the fiduciary not breached his duties</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">13   Where an individual has illegitimately profited by exploiting his fiduciary position, the claimant may elect between an account of profits and compensation for loss.

</div> This appears to have been because, in <span class="font-italic">Mona Computer</span>, this court held that it was irrelevant that it was likely the employee would have continued to receive commissions from Mona Computer had he not breached his fiduciary duties (at [16]–[18]): see Yip &amp; Goh at para 68. The authors in Yip &amp; Goh assert that this court in <span class="font-italic">Mona Computer </span>favoured the stricter approach under which a fiduciary is held accountable for the entire business which had been set up in breach of his fiduciary duties and its profits. This was as opposed to only holding the fiduciary liable for the particular benefits which flowed to him in breach of his duty. The authors opine that this court in <span class="font-italic">Mona Computer </span>“clearly preferred” the stricter approach, referring to the court’s citation of <span class="font-italic">Regal (Hastings) Ltd v Gulliver </span>[1967] 2 AC 134<span class="font-italic"> </span>(“<span class="font-italic">Regal</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">Industrial Development Consultants Ltd v Cooley </span>[1972] 1 WLR 443 (“<span class="font-italic">IDC</span>”): Yip &amp; Goh at paras 66–67.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 This court’s holding at [16]–[18] of <span class="font-italic">Mona Computer </span>that it was irrelevant that the employee would likely have continued to receive commissions from Mona Computer had he not breached his fiduciary duties should be understood in context. In that judgment, we had been addressing the question of whether any <span class="font-italic">loss </span>to the beneficiary is relevant. This can be seen from [16] and [17] of <span class="font-italic">Mona Computer</span>, in which we stated that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">16   <span class="font-italic">Because this is a gains-based and not a </span><span class="font-italic">restitutionary remedy, it is possible that the beneficiary will gain a ‘windfall’ – </span>ie<span class="font-italic">, benefits it might not otherwise have earned itself. The cases are well known.</span> In <span class="font-italic">Regal</span>, the plaintiff company’s directors were held liable to account for profits earned from the sale of shares in a subsidiary company, which they had purchased when the plaintiff company did not have the funds to subscribe for it. Lord Porter stated (at 157) that this ‘may be an unexpected windfall [for the plaintiff company], but whether it be so or not, the principle that a person occupying a fiduciary relationship shall not make a profit by reason thereof is of such vital importance that the possible consequence in the present case is in fact as it is in law an immaterial consideration’. Similarly in [<span class="font-italic">IDC</span>], the director was liable to account for all the profits derived from a contract which he obtained for himself, and which he had previously unsuccessfully tried to obtain for his company. Roskill J explained that as long as the director was still a director of the company, he ‘had one capacity and one capacity only in which he was carrying on business at that time’, and he ought not retain profits obtained solely by reason of placing himself in a position of conflict, even if this meant that the company would receive a benefit which it was unlikely to have gotten for itself (at 451 and 453).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">17   The thrust of these decisions is that the fiduciary should not be allowed to retain any of the profit derived from his breach of duty. <span class="font-italic">A deduction for what the company would have had to pay the defendant had he dutifully secured the benefits for the </span><span class="font-italic">company instead is out of place given the gains-based basis for disgorgement. </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 It was in this context that we went on to state that whether it was likely that the fiduciary would have continued in the appellant’s employment and received commissions from it was not a relevant consideration in the fashioning of an account (at [18]). This was also why we then went on to say that the High Court judge in that case had erred when he reasoned that the accounting of profits should not result in Mona Computer enjoying a windfall. As such, while we held that the commissions earned were attributable to the breach in that case, we do not think that the decision in <span class="font-italic">Mona Computer</span> should be read as indicating that but-for causation is not necessary. We also note that while loss to the beneficiary and gain to the fiduciary are often two sides of the same coin, this is not necessarily true of all cases. One need not follow the other.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 Indeed, part of <span class="font-italic">Mona Computer </span>was in fact <span class="font-italic">suggestive</span> of but-for causation.

Moreover, the <span class="font-italic">passage cited</span> from <span class="font-italic">Regal </span>(see <span class="font-italic">Mona Computer </span>at [14], reproduced above at [79]) does not <span class="font-italic">incontrovertibly</span> state that causation in the sense we are presently concerned with is not relevant. While the passage states at the last sentence that, “[t]he liability arises from the mere fact of a profit having, in the stated circumstances, been made”, this must be read in context. The stated circumstances referred to are that the trustee’s fiduciary position was <span class="font-italic">used</span> to make a profit. In our view, the language of these judgments are in fact consistent with the view that <span class="font-italic">some form</span> of a causal element between the breaches of fiduciary duty and the profits to be accounted for must be found, although we acknowledge that these cases do not go so far as to say <span class="font-italic">but-for </span>causation in the strict sense must be established. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 <span class="font-italic">Murad and another v Al-Saraj</span> <span class="font-italic">and another </span>[2005] All ER (D) 503 (Jul) (“<span class="font-italic">Murad</span>”) is a case which would appear to support the proposition that causation is not necessary. In <span class="font-italic">Murad</span>, the majority held that the fiduciary was liable to account for the whole profit he had made as a result of a joint venture, even though some profit might still have been made had the fiduciary not breached his fiduciary duties (see [47] and [67] of <span class="font-italic">Murad</span>). Arden LJ said:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">61.   The position is no different in Australia: see [<span class="font-italic">Warman</span>], where the High Court [of Australia] specifically rejected the notion of unjust enrichment: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">‘It has been suggested that the liability of the fiduciary to account for a profit made in breach of the fiduciary duty should be determined by reference to the concept of unjust enrichment, namely, whether the profit is made at the expense of the person to whom the fiduciary duty is owed, and to the honesty and bona fides of the fiduciary (23). <span class="font-italic">But the authorities in Australia and England deny that the liability of a fiduciary to account depends upon detriment to the plaintiff or the dishonesty and lack of bona fides of the fiduciary.” </span>(page 557)</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">62.   <span class="font-italic">The High Court went on to say that (in a context such as this) the fiduciary will be liable to account (only) </span><span class="font-italic">‘for a profit or benefit if it was obtained ... by reason of his taking advantage of [an] opportunity or knowledge derived from his fiduciary position’ (page 557). It must of course be the case that no fiduciary is liable for all the profits he ever made from any source. However, it is clear that the High Court contemplated that the relevant profits would be ascertained through the process of the account. The court held: ‘Ordinarily a fiduciary will be ordered to render an account of the profits made </span><span class="font-italic font-underline">within the scope and ambit of his duty</span><span class="font-italic">.</span><span class="font-italic">’ </span>(page 559)</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">67.   The fact that the fiduciary can show that that party would not have made a loss is, on the authority of the <span class="font-italic">Regal</span> case, an irrelevant consideration so far as an account of profits is concerned. <span class="font-italic">Likewise, it follows in my judgment from the </span>Regal<span class="font-italic"> case that it is no defence for a fiduciary to say that he would have made the profit even if there had been no breach of fiduciary duty.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">75.   I accept that any rule that makes a wrongdoer liable for all the consequences of his wrongful conduct or for actions which did not cause the injured party any loss needs to be justified by some special policy. But the authorities just cited show that in the field of fiduciaries there are policy reasons which have for a long time been accepted by the courts.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">76.<span class="font-italic">   </span><span class="font-italic">For policy reasons, the courts decline to investigate hypothetical situations as to what would have happened if the fiduciary had performed his duty. In [the] </span>Regal<span class="font-italic"> case at page 154G, Lord Wright made the following point, to which I shall have to return below:</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">‘Nor can the court adequately investigate the matter in most cases. The facts are generally difficult to ascertain or are solely in the knowledge of the person being charged. They are matters of surmise; they are hypothetical because the inquiry is as to what would have been the position if that party had not acted as he did, or what he might have done if there had not been the temptation to seek his own advantage, if, in short, interest had not conflicted with duty.’</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">77.<span class="font-italic">   </span><span class="font-italic">Again, for the policy reasons, on the taking of an account, the court lays the burden on the defaulting fiduciary to show that the profit is not one for which he should account: see, for example, </span>Manley v Sartori<span class="font-italic"> [1927] Ch 157. This shifting of the onus of proof is consistent with the deterrent nature of the fiduciary's liability. The liability of the fiduciary becomes the default rule.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">78.   This principle was applied by the High Court of Australia in the <span class="font-italic">Warman</span> case:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">‘It is for the defendant to establish that it is inequitable to order an account of the entire profits. If the defendant does not establish that that would be so, then the defendant must bear the consequences of mingling the profits attributable to those earned by the defendant's efforts and investment, in the same way that a trustee of a mixed fund bears the onus of distinguishing what is his own.’</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 While there are passages in <span class="font-italic">Murad</span> which conclude that causation is not relevant in ordering an account of profits, most notably, <span class="font-italic">Murad </span>at [67], which is reproduced above, we ask whether this is a position that we should adopt. In so far as <span class="font-italic">Murad </span>relied on “long-standing” authority in England (<span class="font-italic">Murad</span> at [100]), such authority does not bind this court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 One concern raised in the judgment of Arden LJ is that, for policy reasons, the courts decline to investigate hypothetical situations as to what would have happened if the fiduciary had performed his duty (see <span class="font-italic">Murad </span>at [75] to [77] cited above). We see the intuitive force in this argument, particularly since the rules on fiduciary duties, particularly the no-conflict rule, are undergirded by considerations of deterrence, and have been said to play a prophylactic role. However, courts routinely have to consider the question of what might have happened but for a wrongful act – this is not an unfamiliar question to most areas of law. The recent judgment of <span class="font-italic">Winsta</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([28] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) in fact held at [240] and [254(c)] that no equitable compensation for non-custodial breaches of fiduciary duty can be claimed in respect of loss which the fiduciary can show would have been sustained in spite of the breach. If this investigation can be carried out in situations involving equitable compensation, there is no reason why it cannot be similarly done for an account of profits (see Graham Virgo QC, <span class="font-italic">The Principles of Equity &amp; Trusts</span> (Oxford University Press, 3rd Ed, 2018) at pp 528-529). It is also no answer as to why, in situations where the counterfactual can be determined, this should not be a limit on the scope of the fiduciary’s liability to account. Deterrence should not be a password to avoid causation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 Further, Arden LJ appears to have been influenced by the irrelevance of the beneficiary’s loss to an account of profits in holding that it is no defence for a fiduciary to say that he would have made the profit even if there had been no breach of fiduciary duty, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that there was no but-for causation (see [59]–[67] of <span class="font-italic">Murad</span>). As we have explained above, we do not think that this would be the correct approach. The reason why a beneficiary’s loss is irrelevant is that an account of profits, as a gains-based remedy, is concerned with the gain of the fiduciary. This would not explain why causation between the fiduciary’s gain and his breach of duty would be irrelevant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 The Brothers rely primarily on <span class="font-italic">In Re Gee</span> [1948] 1 Ch 284 (“<span class="font-italic">Re Gee</span>”). There, some beneficiaries of an estate brought a claim for the benefit of an estate against one of the executors for all remuneration received by him as director or managing director of a company since the death of the testator. As in the present case, the estate in that case held shares in the company. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendant had made use of his position of trust under the testator’s will to obtain his remuneration which was accordingly recoverable by the estate (at 293). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Harman J found as a fact that no use was made of the trust shares in the appointment of the defendant as director. The other shareholders voted in favour of the resolutions and, even if it had been the defendant’s duty to vote against his own interest, the resolutions would still have been passed. As such, the defendant’s appointment was not procured by the use of estate’s shares (at 296). He therefore dismissed the claim. It is true that he also observed that there was no suggestion that the remuneration was excessive or that the defendant had acted in bad faith (at 296). Nevertheless, the observations he made are wide enough to apply to the facts before us even though there is evidence in the case before us that the Brothers’ remuneration was excessive and that they did not act in good faith when they voted in favour of the relevant resolutions. The latter was considered by the Judge at, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, [74] of the Judgment and it is not necessary for us to reiterate her reasoning here. It may be that the Brothers are liable to the three companies and to HS for breach of duty or liable to the Estate for oppression but, in our view, these are separate issues.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 At 295, Harman J said:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I conclude from this review [of the authorities] that a trustee who either uses a power vested in him as such to obtain a benefit (as in <span class="font-italic">In re</span> <span class="font-italic">Macadam</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[[1946] Ch 73]) or who (as in <span class="font-italic">Williams v. Barton</span> [[1927] 2 Ch 9]) procures his co-trustees to give him, or those associated with him, remunerative employment must account for the benefit obtained. Further, it appears to me that a trustee who has <span class="font-italic">the power, </span><span class="font-italic">by the use of trust votes, to </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">control</span><span class="font-italic"> his own appointment</span> to a remunerative position, and refrains from using them with the result that he is elected to the position of profit, would also be accountable. <span class="font-italic">On the other hand, it appears not to be the law that every man who becomes a trustee holding as such shares in a limited company is made ipso facto accountable for remuneration received from that company independently of any use by him of the trust holding, whether by voting or refraining from so doing. For instance, A who holds the majority of the shares in a limited company becomes the trustee of the estate of B, a holder of a minority interest; </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">this cannot, I think, disentitle A to use his own shares to procure his appointment as an officer of the company, nor compel him to disgorge the remuneration he so receives, for he cannot be disentitled to the use of his own voting powers, nor could the use of the trust votes in a contrary sense prevent the majority prevailing</span><span class="font-italic">.</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 At 296, he added:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… If, then, the shares in which the testator's estate was interested had all been used against the resolutions, they would still have been carried, and therefore the appointment was not procured by the use of the trust interest vested in the defendant executors or any of them by the will of the testator in which alone the plaintiffs are interested.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 Both the Sisters and Brothers relied on the High Court decision in <span class="font-italic">Cheong Soh Chin</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([24] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>),

</div> which referred to <span class="font-italic">Re Gee</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 The Sisters relied on [218]–[219] of <span class="font-italic">Cheong Soh Chin </span>where the High Court cited the decision of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Goh Chan Peng and others v </span><span class="font-italic">Beyonics Technology Ltd and another and another appeal </span>[2017] 2 SLR 592 (“<span class="font-italic">Goh Chan Peng</span>”) at [51] and [54]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">218   … In the recent decision of [<span class="font-italic">Goh Chan Peng</span>], the Court of Appeal made the following observations as to the operation of the no-profit rule at [51]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The no-profit rule obliges a director not to retain any profit which he has <span class="font-italic">made </span><span class="font-italic">through the use </span>of the company’s property, information or opportunities to which he has access by virtue of being a director, unless he has the fully informed consent of the company. The rule is a strict one and liability to account arises simply because profits are made … The no-profit rule can be seen as a particular application of the no-conflict rule, that a fiduciary may not obtain profit in connection with his position without the informed consent of the person he is duty-bound to protect … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">219   The Court of Appeal further observed at [54] that the rule captures profits obtained by the fiduciary so long as they were obtained in connection with his position as fiduciary:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… payments that flout the no-profit rule need not strictly flow to the fiduciary <span class="font-italic">qua</span> director. Instead, the profit merely has to be obtained in connection with his position as a director … or by ‘reason or in virtue of his fiduciary office’ (S<span class="font-italic">nell’s </span><span class="font-italic">Equity </span>… at para 7-041).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 We do not think [219] of <span class="font-italic">Cheong Soh Chin</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>which cites [54] of <span class="font-italic">Goh</span> <span class="font-italic">Chan Peng</span> indicates clearly one way or another whether causation is relevant, although the use of the phrase “by <span class="font-italic">reason </span>of” [emphasis added] would seem to be suggestive of a form of causation. Furthermore, at [225] of <span class="font-italic">Cheong Soh Chin,</span> the High Court cited Harman J’s observation in <span class="font-italic">Re Gee</span> (at 295) that a fiduciary is not disentitled from using his majority shares to procure his appointment as an officer of the company, nor will he be compelled to disgorge the remuneration he receives as a result. In <span class="font-italic">Cheong Soh Chin</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>the High Court found that a structuring fee was not obtained as a result of the defendants’ fiduciary position. This was because the latter were not in a position to award themselves fees by virtue of their position as fiduciaries, and could not have exploited their control over the principals’ shareholding to vote themselves the fees. Accordingly, the fees were not obtained as a result of their fiduciary position (at [224]–[226]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 Thus, <span class="font-italic">Cheong Soh Chin </span>reinforces the proposition that causation is necessary although, on the facts in that case, the court concluded that the fiduciaries had given sufficient disclosure and obtained informed consent (at [227]–[228]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 For the above reasons, it is our opinion that the profits sought to be disgorged via an account of profits must be caused by the breaches of fiduciary duty, whether this be that the trustee acted in conflict of interest or was guilty of some other breach. To find otherwise would be for equity to become an unruly horse where any breach by a fiduciary can be used to recover a profit however unconnected the two may be, and even if the profits would have been earned by the fiduciary in the absence of the breach. We do not take a position, in this judgment, as to which party would bear the burden of proof in showing that causation can be established where a claim is made for an account of profits. The parties did not address us on the burden of proof and, for reasons we explain below, it is not necessary to decide the point in the present case. We therefore leave it open for another occasion where we will have the benefit of full submissions on that issue. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether causation is established</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 The next question is whether causation has been established.

Their interest is as beneficiaries of the Estate and also as beneficiaries of the Mother’s estate. Together, they hold 20% of the remainder of the Estate (after the specific legacies to the half-siblings) and they hold 33.33% of the Mother’s residuary estate.

</div>
</div> The Mother did not give any of her own shares in any of the three companies or HS to the Sisters under her will. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 As we have indicated above, the Brothers’ main argument was that the remuneration which they received as directors of the three companies could not be attributed to any breach of duty on their part as executors, including any breach arising from their use of the Estate’s shares. This was because the Estate held a very small minority interest in the three companies and the resolutions would have been carried whether the Estate’s shares were used to vote in favour of or against the resolutions. Indeed, even if the Estate’s shares were used to vote against the resolutions, the resolutions would still have been carried. The initial impression given by the Brothers was that their own shareholding exceeded that of the Estate but, as can be seen from the information on the shareholdings, they themselves, even as a group of three of them, hold a small percentage of the shares directly. It is HS, the family company, which holds a substantial stake in each of A Trading and B Development, and A Trading which in turn holds 97.56% in T Investments. We do not think it matters whether the Brothers hold a substantive shareholding in each of the three companies directly in their own names or through HS. The more important point is that the Estate holds a very small minority interest in the three companies and is also a minority shareholder in HS. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 We add that there are other shareholders who together hold more than 50% of the shares in A Trading and B Development (see Annex A). Indeed, the three companies were set up by the Patriarch with members of two other unrelated families. Some of these other shareholders also approved the directors’ remuneration and a few also received directors’ remuneration over the years after the demise of the Patriarch.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 It is clear from the facts that the Brothers’ use of the Estate’s shares made no difference to the outcome. Even if the Estate’s shares had been used to vote against the resolutions re-appointing the Brothers as directors and approving their remuneration, the outcome would have been the same. The Judge said that the Estate’s shares were not instrumental in procuring the passing of the resolutions which approved the directors’ remuneration (see the Judgment at [42]). We agree. The Judge also said that shareholder approval was a foregone conclusion because those voting were receiving the remuneration voted upon (at [43]). We add that it was a foregone conclusion also because HS’s stake in each of A Trading and B Development was much larger that the Estate’s. We do not have details as to which of the other shareholders attending each of the general meetings voted in favour of the resolutions, although it would seem that some shareholders, who were not directors and not personally invested in the approval of the remuneration, may have voted in favour of the resolutions. In any event, the parties proceeded on the basis that the Estate’s shares would not have made a difference. The arguments by the Sisters would otherwise have been presented differently. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 Although the Brothers’ direct shareholding in each of A Trading and B Development was small and HS was the one that held a more substantial shareholding in these two companies, the Brothers were majority shareholders in HS. The Estate held only 12.5% of the shares in HS. The Brothers were entitled to use their shares in HS to remain as directors in HS and thereafter to use the votes of HS in the resolutions of A Trading and B Development to remain as directors of these two companies and to vote on the directors’ remuneration. They were also entitled to use the votes of A Trading in T Investments to remain as directors in T Investments and vote on the directors’ remuneration. Whether they acted in breach of duty <span class="font-italic">qua</span> directors of the respective companies or had acted oppressively in the affairs of the companies are separate issues. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 In other words, the position remains the same whether the Brothers themselves had a more substantial shareholding in the three companies or not. The fact remains that the Brothers’ use of the Estate’s shares did not make a difference.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 However, the Judge also concluded at [43] of the Judgment that it was the non-disclosure by the Brothers that allowed continuation of the remuneration for many years. This was the focus of the Sisters’ arguments on appeal. It is not entirely clear what non-disclosure the Judge was referring to. She was perhaps referring to non-disclosure of the Estate’s shares in the three companies and HS, and non-disclosure of the fact that the Estate’s shares were used to vote for the directors’ remuneration. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 The Judge was of the view that had disclosure been made, the Sisters would not have been without remedy if they did not agree with the manner in which the Estate’s shares were being used: see the Judgment at [43]. For instance, the Judge observed that the Sisters could have brought a claim in minority oppression, presumably if the disclosure was accompanied by a distribution <span class="font-italic">in specie</span> of the Estate’s shares to the beneficiaries. We note as an aside that the Judge’s approach would in fact seem to suggest that she too was of the view that causation was relevant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 In so far as the Judge’s view suggested that the Sisters would have taken steps to stop the continuation of the directors’ remuneration, this is speculative. The Sisters did not give evidence. Furthermore, while there is insufficient evidence for the court to determine what might have happened if disclosure (and distribution) had been made, it is undisputed that the Sisters only sought an account from the Brothers in March 2016 (see [9] above), a few months after the Mother passed away in November 2015. This delay cannot be attributed to their ignorance of the fact that they were beneficiaries of the Estate. After all, they had received distributions from the Estate in 2006 and 2011 (see [6] and [7] above). Moreover, as the Brothers argued, the Sisters had signed formal documents as beneficiaries pertaining to the transfer of the Eastern Mansion unit and the sale of the JB Land.

</div>
</div> It appears that they chose to refrain from taking any steps until after the Mother had passed away. It is unnecessary for us to say whether this was because they were afraid of being cut off from her will, as the Brothers alleged. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 In any event, even if the Sisters would have taken steps to stop the remuneration, that is not the same as saying that the Brothers’ breaches of non-disclosure and non-distribution had caused the remuneration. The Judge essentially held that, if not for these breaches, the Sisters could have taken steps to put a stop to the remuneration received by the Brothers. We are not persuaded that this suffices to show that the Brothers’ remuneration were caused by their non-disclosure and non-distribution. First, this would assume that the Sisters would have been able to establish a good case of, for example, minority oppression. Second, even if the Sisters could establish minority oppression and demand that the remuneration be distributed as dividends instead, the Brothers would still have received a significant portion of the dividends by virtue of the shareholding structure we have outlined above and their own interest as beneficiaries of the Estate. Third, while we note that the timely administration of the Estate and distribution of shares <span class="font-italic">in specie </span>to the Sisters would certainly have prevented the Brothers from acting in conflict by voting on the Estate’s shares as the voting rights of some shares would then have been exercisable by the Sisters, we have said above that the voting of the Estate’s shares did not cause the profits to be earned. We are therefore of the view that the situation envisaged by the Judge does not constitute causation which would entitle the Sisters to claim the remuneration from the Brothers.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 Therefore, the Sisters’ claim for the Brothers to account for the directors’ remuneration from the three companies fails. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 We note that before the Judge, the Sisters had an alternative claim for equitable compensation. However, no such alternative claim was advanced before us and we need not say any more about it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 We come now to the liability of the Brothers to pay the benefits-in-kind being the difference between the rent that B1 and B2 respectively paid for staying in two properties at Shelford Road and the annual value of those properties. As mentioned, these properties belong to HS. There was no evidence that these brothers used the Estate’s shares in HS to fix the rent which they paid. While HS’s financial statements make reference to the rental of properties by directors, which were then approved by the directors and the annual general meeting, it would seem that no specific resolution was tabled to approve the rentals.

</div> It appears that B1 and B2 simply paid whatever rent that they thought was appropriate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 The Sisters’ position in respect of these benefits-in-kind is no better than their position <span class="font-italic">vis-a-vis</span> the directors’ remuneration. As we pointed out at the hearing of the appeal, issues such as rental of the properties owned by a company would not, in most cases, be approved by the shareholders. Mr Jeyaretnam asserted that the Sisters would have known of the properties, and been entitled to ask what was happening with them. This is plainly insufficient. It follows that the Sisters’ claim for the Brothers to account for the benefits-in-kind also fails. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">$1m sum allegedly owing to the Mother’s estate</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 After the Brothers sold the JB Land in 2011, they distributed $1m to the Siblings. As mentioned, the $1m comprised the proceeds from the sale of the JB Land and some dividends from companies that had been accumulated in the Estate’s account. The Mother did not receive any portion of this $1m before she passed away on 7 November 2015.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 The Brothers’ position was that as the Mother was entitled under P’s Will to 50% of his residuary estate, she was entitled to receive $1m as her 50% share since the Siblings had received $1m as their 50% share. The Brothers contended that one of the Sisters had refused to sign the relevant transfer documents for the JB Land unless the Mother’s share of the sale proceeds was divided among the five of them and the Mother had agreed to defer receipt of her share: the Judgment at [54].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 The Sisters’ position was that the Mother had waived her entitlement to her 50% share: see the Judgment at [58].

Since the documents were signed by all the beneficiaries of the Estate, this would mean that the Sisters were led to believe that the Mother had waived her entitlement as demanded. There would otherwise have been no substantive benefit to the Sisters if the Mother had agreed only to defer receiving her share. Indeed, there was no suggestion that the Sisters were informed that the Mother had only agreed to defer payment of her share.

</div> This meant that the only basis for the Brothers’ assertion was their own evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 Second, there was no document to corroborate the assertion that the Mother was to be paid the $1m later. The accounts of the Estate kept by a clerk at HS did not reflect that this amount was to be paid to the Mother at a later date. The Brothers argued that the initial accounts produced was not a balance sheet showing assets and liabilities, and therefore that the absence of such an entry does not mean that the S$1m was not owing to the Mother.

</div> Yet there was no mention of any shortfall in distribution to her. The question of the $1m debt would seem to be an afterthought that only arose after the commencement of action by the Sisters.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">$5,500.65 costs and legal fees in OS 1241</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 The Judge found that a sum of $5,500.65 being legal costs paid to the plaintiffs in OS 1241 (the action commenced by the half-siblings) and the Brother’s legal fees for that action, should not have been charged to the Estate: the Judgment at [68].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 While the Brothers appealed against the Judge’s decision to falsify the legal expenses incurred, this was not the focus of their appeal before us, in which the emphasis was on the account of profits ordered. In any event, we agree with the Judge for the reasons she gave that this sum should be falsified. OS 1241 was filed because the Brothers had not informed the half-siblings as to what steps had been taken to realise their interest in the Estate or provided the Estate’s accounts (see [4] above). It follows from this that these expenses were not reasonably incurred. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Removal of the Brothers as Executors</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 The Judge found that the Brothers had failed to provide any account to the Sisters for many years until the Sisters began to ask for accounts in March 2016 (the Supp GD at [5]). The Brothers also failed to distribute the assets except for the distributions already mentioned. In her view, the taking of accounts established further breaches pertaining to, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the directors’ remuneration and the benefits-in-kind. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 While we have found that the Sisters have failed to establish causation in respect of the directors’ remuneration and the benefits-in-kind, this does not mean that we approve of the Brothers’ conduct.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 In addition to their intentional failure to inform and to distribute, the Brothers’ attempt to belatedly include a claim for the Mother’s estate for the sum of $1m and their inclusion of the $5,500.65 as an expense of the Estate were particularly egregious since the latter sum was incurred because of their omission to provide reasonable information to the half-siblings of their entitlement and to pay them accordingly. Their conduct suggested a want of probity even if the latter sum is a small one.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 Furthermore, as it would seem that there may have been breaches of the duties the Brothers owed <span class="font-italic">qua </span>directors of the three companies and HS, there is also a possibility that there may be valid claims that can be brought on behalf of the Estate, as a shareholder, against the Brothers in their capacity as directors. This is a further consequence of the Brothers’ improper administration of the Estate and their disregard for the Sisters’ interests, and an additional reason in favour of the appointment of replacement executors. Replacement executors should be appointed to consider these courses of action although we hope that good sense will prevail and further legal action will be avoided. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 We agree with the Judge that the Brothers ought to be removed and replaced as executors of the Estate. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Interest</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 As for the Sisters’ appeal for interest to be imposed before the date of the Writ, this carries less significance as we have held that the Brothers are not liable to pay the directors’ remuneration and the benefits-in-kind to the Estate. Only their reimbursement of the legal costs and fees in OS 1241 remain.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 In any event, we agree with the Judge’s reasons for not allowing interest before the Writ.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Decision of the Court of Appeal (delivered by Justice Woo Bih Li):</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Outcome:<em> </em>CoA sets out the law relating to account of profits and causation, and allows the executors’ appeal in part. </span></p>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">CoA addresses the requirement of causation in an account of profits. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>1<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>Civil Appeals Nos 127 of 2019 and 172 of 2019 were appeals against the decision of the High Court in <em>UVH and another v UVH and others</em> [2019] SGHCF 14 and <em>UVH and another v UVJ and others </em>[2019] SGHCF 22. </p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Facts</span></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>2<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>The two plaintiffs (“the Sisters”) and the three defendants (individually referred to as “B1”, “B2”, and “B3”, and collectively as “the Brothers”) are five children of the patriarch of the family (“the Patriarch”). After the Patriarch’s death on 30 May 1997, the grant of probate was issued and the Brothers were appointed the executors and trustees of the Patriarch’s will (“P’s Will”). Under P’s Will, each of the Siblings received 10% of the Estate, while their mother (“the Mother”) received 50%. The Mother passed away in November 2015 and the Brothers were also appointed executors and trustees under her will. The parties were also beneficiaries under the Mother’s will.</p>
<p><span>3<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>On 17 March 2016, the Sisters sent a letter to the Brothers seeking a statement of account of the Patriarch’s estate (“the Estate”). The Sisters were not satisfied with the account that was subsequently provided and commenced HCF/S 6/2016. Subsequently, the Sisters filed a summary application for an account to be taken of the Estate on a wilful default basis. The judge below (“the Judge”) granted an order for an account to be taken on a wilful default basis, substantially on the terms of the application (“the April 2017 Order”). The Brothers provided an account pursuant to this order and a further hearing was held in February 2019. After the hearing, the Judge made a number of orders which formed the subject of the cross-appeals:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Directors’ remuneration:</span> The Estate held shares in four companies: “A Trading”, “B Development” and “T Investments” (collectively, “the three companies”) and “HS”. The Estate’s shareholding in each of the three companies was between 0.19% to 2.22%. However, the Estate owned 12.5% of the shares in HS, which in turn held 34% of the shares in A Trading and 37.92% of the shares in B Development. A Trading in turn held 97.56% of the shares in T Investments. While the Brothers also owned shares in each of the three companies (save that B1 did not own shares in T Investment), these were insubstantial (between 0.10%-0.14% each). In contrast, they owned 29.17% of HS’s shares each. The Brothers had voted the Estate’s shares in favour of the directors’ remuneration from the three companies without the informed consent of the Sisters. The Judge found that the Brothers had intentionally kept the Sisters uninformed for their own benefit, and that this placed them in a position of conflict. She ordered that the Brothers account for the profits they received as directors’ remuneration over the 20-year period from the three companies and to pay the sum of $20,978,689.90 to the Estate. </li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Benefits-in-kind:</span> Further, B1 and B2 rented two properties at Shelford Road owned by HS below annual value. The Judge ordered that the Brothers pay to the Estate $174,000 and $360,000 being benefits-in-kind enjoyed by B1 and B2 from these rentals. </li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sale of land in Johor Bahru, Malaysia:</span> The Estate held a piece of land in Johor Bahru, Malaysia (the “JB Land”), which was sold in 2011 for $879,800. The Brothers distributed $1m (comprising the sale proceeds of the JB Land and some dividends received by the Estate from shares in various companies) to the Siblings but nothing to the Mother. The reason why this was done was disputed. The Judge did not accept the Brothers’ claim that the sum of $1m was owing to the Mother’s estate, and ordered that this debt be falsified.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Legal fees and costs:</span> Under P’s Will, there was a pecuniary legacy to two other individuals (“the half-siblings”). On 4 September 2002, the half-siblings filed an originating summons to compel the Brothers to provide copies of the most recent accounts of the Estate and to state on affidavit what steps, if any, had been taken in administering the Patriarch’s estate (“the Estate”). This originating summons was subsequently resolved with no substantive orders, although costs were ordered against the Brothers on the basis that it was the lack of information from the Brothers that had led to the application. The Brothers charged these costs and their own legal fees to the Estate. The Judge found that these should not have been charged to the Estate and ordered that they be falsified. </li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Interest:</span> the Judge ordered that the Brothers pay to the Estate interest on the sums representing the directors’ remuneration, the benefits-in-kind and the legal fees and costs charged to the Estate at 5.33% per annum from the date of the Writ until payment. This was the subject of the Sisters’ appeal in CA/CA 172/2019 as the Sisters wanted interest to accrue from an earlier date.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Decision on appeal</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Procedural challenge</em></strong></p>
<p><span>4<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>The Brothers contended that the Judge had gone beyond the scope of the April 2017 Order when she decided that they were liable to render an account of profits, as well as to remove them as executors of the Estate (at <strong>[21]</strong>). The court held that the Judge had erred on the scope of the April 2017 Order when she held that it sufficiently dealt with all the remedies arising out of the taking of the account. The paragraphs of the April 2017 Order referred to by the Judge merely stated that an account would be taken of the Estate’s assets on a wilful default basis and did not deal with any remedy thereafter (at <strong>[37]</strong>). The February 2019 hearing was not a hearing of the main action. Instead, it seemed that the Judge had concluded that the continuation of the trial was unnecessary in light of the evidence that had already been adduced and had then proceeded to make final orders (at <strong>[45]</strong> to <strong>[47]</strong>). The court accepted that the Judge was entitled to consider and hear evidence on the Brothers’ remuneration and benefits-in-kind (at <strong>[47]</strong>). The Brothers had been given sufficient notice, time and opportunity to make all relevant arguments and there was no good reason to require a discrete summons or to revert to the trial (at <strong>[49] </strong>and<strong> [52]</strong>). While the Brothers appeared to suggest that the Sisters would have to give evidence first at the trial, that was not necessarily the case and the Sisters could have elected to stand or fall by the evidence already available (at <strong>[50] </strong>and<strong> [52]</strong>). The court therefore concluded that the Judge was entitled to proceed as she did (at <strong>[53]</strong>).</p>
<p><strong><em>Breach of fiduciary duties</em></strong></p>
<p><span>5<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>The Judge found that the Brothers had intentionally kept the Sisters uninformed for their own benefit, and that this was in breach of their core duties of loyalty and fidelity and placed them in a position of conflict. This inference by the Judge did not warrant appellate intervention (at <strong>[64]</strong>).It followed from this that the Brothers did not have good reason for their delay in distributing the assets held by the Estate (at <strong>[66]</strong>).The Brothers appeared to accept that they ought not to have voted the Estate’s shares in favour of the directors’ remuneration without the informed consent of the Sisters and that a conflict of interest arose from the fact that the Brothers’ remuneration drew on funds that might otherwise have been distributed to shareholders as dividends (at <strong>[67] </strong>and <strong>[68]</strong>). In the circumstances, the court held that the Brothers ought to have disclosed to the Sisters the Estate’s shares in the three companies, distributed the Estate’s assets in a timely manner, and in the interim, ought not to have voted the Estate’s shares to approve the remuneration (at <strong>[69]</strong>). </p>
<p><span>6<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>The court therefore held that the Brothers had breached their duties in three ways, specifically in (at <strong>[69]</strong>):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>intentionally keeping the Sisters uninformed of the Estate’s shares in the three companies and HS for their own gain;</li>
<li>not distributing the shares to the Sisters in a timely manner; and</li>
<li>using the Estate’s shares to vote in favour of the directors’ remuneration. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><em>Whether profits were made by the Brothers</em></strong></p>
<p><span>7<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>Any appointment of the Brothers as directors of the companies prior to the Patriarch’s death did not exculpate them from their responsibilities as executors of the Estate. This only meant that the remuneration or profits earned before they became executors would not be subject to an account of profits. The re-appointment and remuneration of directors had also been approved at general meetings subsequent to the Patriarch’s demise (at <strong>[71]</strong>).The material question raised by the Brothers was whether the profits the Judge ordered to be repaid to the Estate were attributable to any breach. This was a question of “causation” (at <strong>[72]</strong>).</p>
<p><strong><em>Whether causation is necessary</em></strong></p>
<p><span>8<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>There was no question that there had to be some relationship between the profits for which the fiduciary is ordered to account and the breaches of fiduciary duty. Instead, the question was whether the relationship needs to be one of but-for causation. Put in another way, the question was whether the profits would have been made by the fiduciary in any event without the breach (at <strong>[75]</strong>). This was a distinct question from whether any loss to the beneficiaries needs to be caused before a fiduciary is obliged to account for unauthorised profits (at <strong>[73]</strong>). The case of <em>Mona Computer Systems (S) Pte Ltd v Singaravelu Murugan </em>[2014] 1 SLR 847 held that the order for an account of profits is unrelated to whether the fiduciary’s conduct caused loss to the principal. However, on a correct reading of the case, it did not say that causation was irrelevant to the question of the fiduciary’s profit, <em>ie</em>, that it did not matter if the breach did not cause the profit (at <strong>[80]</strong>). While loss to the beneficiary and gain to the fiduciary are often two sides of the same coin, this is not necessarily true of all cases. Indeed, part of <em>Mona Computer </em>was suggestive of but-for causation (at <strong>[83]</strong> and <strong>[84]</strong>).</p>
<p><span>9<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>The concern that, for policy reasons, courts decline to investigate hypothetical situations as to what would have happened if the fiduciary had performed his duty had intuitive force. However, courts routinely consider the question as to what might have happened but for a wrongful act, <em>eg</em>, in ordering equitable compensation. There is no reason why this investigation cannot be carried out in situations involving an account of profits and is also no answer as to why, in situations where the counterfactual can be determined, this should not be a limit on the scope of the fiduciary’s liability to account. Deterrence should not be a password to avoid causation (at <strong>[88]</strong>). </p>
<p><span>10<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>The court therefore held that the profits sought to be disgorged via an account of profits must be caused by the breaches of fiduciary duty, whether this be that the trustee acted in conflict of interest or otherwise (at <strong>[98]</strong>).</p>
<p><strong><em>Orders made</em></strong></p>
<p><span>11<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Directors’ remuneration:</span> The Brothers’ use of the Estate’s shares made no difference to the outcome. Even if the Estate’s shares had been used to vote against the resolutions re-appointing the Brothers as directors and approving their remuneration, the outcome would have been the same. Shareholder approval was a foregone conclusion because those voting were receiving the remuneration voted upon, and because HS’s stake in A Trading and B Development was much larger than the Estate’s (at <strong>[108]</strong>). The Brothers were majority shareholders in HS and were entitled to use their shares to remain as directors in HS, and thereafter to use the votes of HS in the resolutions of A Trading and B Development to remain as directors of those two companies and to vote on the directors’ remuneration. They were also entitled to use the votes of A Trading in T Investments to remain as directors in T Investments and vote on the directors’ remuneration. Whether they acted in breach of duty <em>qua </em>directors of the respective companies or had acted oppressively in the affairs of the companies are separate issues (at <strong>[109]</strong>).</p>
<p><span>12<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>While the Judge concluded that it was the non-disclosure by the Brothers that allowed the continuation of the remuneration for many years, it was speculative to suggest that the Sisters would have taken steps to stop the continuation of the directors’ remuneration since the Sisters did not give evidence. The Sisters also only made inquiries from March 2016 despite the fact that they had known that they were beneficiaries of the Estate, having received distributions in 2006 and 2011 (at <strong>[111]</strong> and <strong>[113]</strong>). In any event, the court was not persuaded that even if the Sisters would have taken steps to stop the remuneration received by the Brothers, that would be the same as saying that the Brothers’ breaches of non-disclosure and non-distribution had caused the remuneration. This would assume that the Sisters would have been able to establish a good case of, for example, minority oppression. Further, even if the remuneration had been distributed as dividends instead, the Brothers would still have received a significant portion of the latter (at <strong>[114]</strong>). </p>
<p><span>13<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Benefits-in-kind</span>: there was no evidence that B1 and B2 used the Estate’s shares in HS to fix the rent which they paid. It appeared that they simply paid whatever rent that they thought would be appropriate. Issues such as the rental of the properties owned by a company would not, in most cases, be approved by the shareholders. The fact that the Sisters would have known of the properties and been entitled to ask what was happening with them was plainly insufficient. The court therefore held that the Sisters’ claim for the Brothers to account for the benefits-in-kind also fails (at <strong>[117]</strong> and <strong>[118]</strong>).</p>
<p><span>14<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">$1m allegedly owing to the Mother’s estate</span>: The court upheld the Judge’s finding that the sum of $1m is not owing to the Mother’s estate and that the alleged $1m debt should be falsified (at <strong>[122]</strong>). The only basis for the Brothers’ assertion that the Mother had agreed only to defer receiving her share was their own evidence (at <strong>[123]</strong>). This was not corroborated by any documentary evidence, and the accounts of the Estate did not reflect that this amount was to be paid to the Mother at a later date (at <strong>[124]</strong>).</p>
<p><span>15<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Legal fees and costs</span>: The court held that the sum of $5,500.65 should be falsified as the expenses were not reasonably incurred; OS 1241 was filed because of the lack of information from the Brothers (at <strong>[126]</strong>).</p>
<p><span>16<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Removal of the Brothers as executors:</span> The court agreed that the Brothers ought to be removed and replaced as executors of the Estate. In addition to their intentional failure to inform and to distribute, their attempt to belatedly include a claim for the Mother’s estate and their inclusion of the $5,500.65 as an expense of the Estate suggested a want of probity. There may also be valid claims that can be brought on behalf of the Estate, as a shareholder, against the Brothers in their capacity as directors. Replacement executors should be appointed to consider these courses of action (at <strong>[129]</strong>-<strong>[131]</strong>).</p>
<p><span>17<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Interest:</span> the court observed that the Sisters’ appeal for interest to be imposed before the date of the Writ carried less significance given its decisions on the directors’ remuneration and the benefits-in-kind. The court agreed with the Judge’s reasons for not allowing interest before the Writ, and noted that the Sisters had delayed making inquiries and taking action (at <strong>[132]</strong> and <strong>[133]</strong>).</p>
