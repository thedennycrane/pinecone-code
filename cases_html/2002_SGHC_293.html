        The plaintiffs commenced these proceedings

against the defendants on 28 August 2002. Under these proceedings, the High Court is asked

to decide whether the defendants were entitled to call on a Bond and an Advance Payment

Guarantee both dated 20 March 2001 and an Advance Payment Guarantee both 3 April 2002 (and

the three instruments are referred to hereafter as the Bond and Advance Payment

Guarantees) on the terms and language thereof and in the circumstances to which I will

briefly refer presently and whether they were entitled to receive the money under the Bond

and Advance Payment Guarantees. Two days later, the plaintiffs obtained an Order of Court

for leave to serve the Originating Summons out of jurisdiction on the defendants in the

Netherlands. </font>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">2

        By Summons in Chambers entered No. 3621 of 2002

the defendants applied for the following orders, namely: (a) to set aside the Order of

Court of 30 August 2002 which granted leave to serve the Originating Summons out of

jurisdiction; (b) alternatively, to stay the proceedings pursuant to Section 6(1) of the

International Arbitration Act (Cap. 143A); (c) alternatively, to stay the proceedings

herein under the inherent powers of the Court to prevent injustice and/or abuse of process

under Order 92 Rule 4 of the Rules of Court (1997 Ed); and/or alternatively, to declare

that this Court has no jurisdiction over the defendants under Order 12 Rule 7(g) of the

Rules of Court.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">3

        On 2 October 2002, an Assistant Registrar

ordered that the Order of Court dated 30 August 2002 which granted leave to serve the

Originating Summons out of jurisdiction be set aside. Being dissatisfied with the

decision, the plaintiffs appealed to the Judge in Chambers. At the conclusion of the

hearing, I allowed the appeal. I ruled that leave to serve the Originating Summons out of

jurisdiction ought to have been granted, as was ordered initially. I set aside the orders

of the Assistant Registrar of 2 October 2002 and ordered the defendants to pay the

plaintiffs costs here and below fixed at $7,500. I now set out the background and the

reasons.</font></p>

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">4

        In the amended Originating Summons the claim is

for the following reliefs:-</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(i)    a declaration that the

    defendants shall not be entitled to call or demand payment or otherwise receive payment in

    respect of the Bond and Advance Payment Guarantees until the final outcome of the

    arbitration proceedings; and</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(ii)    the defendants be

    restrained from taking any steps to demand or receive payment under the said Bond and

    Advance Payment Guarantees or otherwise receiving, encumbering or otherwise dealing with

    the monies or any part thereof under the Bond and Advance Payment Guarantees.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">5

        The Bond was issued by American Home Assurance

Company ("AHA"), a corporation of the State of New York, out of their branch

office in Singapore to secure its performance of a sub-contract which I will describe

later. The Bond expressly stated that it was "made in accordance with the laws of

Singapore and <i>subject to the decision of the courts of Singapore"</i>. (emphasis

added). The Advance Payment Guarantee of 20 March 2001, which was also furnished by AHA,

also expressly provided thus: "This Guarantee is made in accordance with the laws of

Singapore and <i>subject to the decision of the Courts of Singapore". </i>As security

for AHA, the plaintiffs, a Singapore company, had in turn signed counter-indemnities in

favour of AHA.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">6

        The purpose of the Bond and Advance Payment

Guarantees arose in the following circumstances in relation to a turnkey project awarded

by Petronet LNG Ltd for the engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning of a

liquefied natural gas receiving, storage and re-gasification terminal at Dahej, State of

Gujarat, India ("the project)". Petronet LNG Ltd is a limited company

incorporated under the laws of India and the defendants is a Dutch company. Together with

four other internationally well-known construction companies the defendants were awarded

the Main Contract for the Project. The Main Contract provided for inter laia the

completion of a detached breakwater to protect the LNG terminal. The deadline for

completion was 27 December 2003. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">7

        On 26 January 2001, the defendants

sub-contracted to the plaintiffs the construction of the detached breakwater. The

sub-contract, as usual, provided that the defendants may give notice to the plaintiffs to

proceed with the Subcontract works with due diligence, failing which the Subcontract may

be terminated. By sub-clause 21.1 it was provided that any dispute arising between the

plaintiffs and the defendants arising out of the execution of the Subcontract works shall

be finally settled by arbitration in accordance with the rules of arbitration as laid down

in the Main Contract. The place of arbitration, the procedural law applicable to the

arbitration, the law applicable to the substance of the dispute, the language of the

arbitral proceedings and the number of arbitrators shall be as specified in the Main

Contract. Under the Main Contract, any dispute arising out of or relating to the contract

or with respect to the breach, termination or invalidity thereof shall be settled

exclusively and finally by arbitration. Arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with

the Indian Arbitration and Conciliation Act. It was provided that the place of arbitration

shall be in New Delhi, India and that the governing law of the Main Contract shall be the

laws of the Republic of India. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">8

        The plaintiffs’ application for leave to

serve the Amended Originating Summons out of jurisdiction was based on Order 11 r 1(b),

(c), (d)(iii) and (iv) and (r) of the Rules of Court. Rule 11 r 1(c) was not relied on a

the hearing before me.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">9

        Order 11 r 1(b) of the Rules of Court permits

service out of jurisdiction with leave where in an action "an injunction is sought

ordering the defendant to do or refrain from doing anything in Singapore (whether or not

damages are also claimed in respect of a failure to do or the doing of that thing)."

Under Order 11 r 1 (d)(iii) and (iv) such service out of jurisdiction is permitted where

the claim is brought to enforce, rescind, dissolve, annul or otherwise affect a contract,

or to recover damages or obtain other relief in respect of the breach of a contract, being

(in either case) a contract which under paragraph (iii) is by its terms, or by

implication, governed by the law of Singapore or under paragraph (iv) the contract

contains a term to the effect that that Court shall have jurisdiction to hear and

determine any action in respect of the contract. Under Order 11 r 1(r) such service out of

jurisdiction is also permitted with leave where ‘the claim is in respect of matters

in which the defendants has submitted or agreed to submit to the jurisdiction of the

court."</font></p>

<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Principles governing leave to

serve out of jurisdiction</font></p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">12

        A court in granting leave to serve a writ or

originating process out of jurisdiction has to consider, first, whether jurisdiction under

Order 11 rule 1 of the Rules of Court has been sufficiently established on the basis of a

good and arguable case: <i>Bradley Lomas Electrolok Ltd &amp; Another v Colt Ventilation

East Asia Pte Ltd &amp; Ors</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=50950&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[2000] 1 SLR 673</a>. A mere statement by a deponent that he

believed the matter fell within a particular limb was insufficient. On the other hand, it

was noted by the Court of Appeal in the same case that a court on such an application was

not called upon to try the action or express a premature opinion on its merits. The Court

of Appeal further ruled that it was only when jurisdiction was so shown to exist that the

court would proceed to determine whether it should exercise its discretion to grant leave

and for this purpose the plaintiff need only show merits on the claim up to the level of a

serious issue to be tried. In these principles <i>Seaconsar Far East Ltd v Bank Markazi

Jomhouri Islami Iran</i> [1994] 1 AC 438 was followed. </font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The Circumstances in this case</font></p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">13

        In the present case, the plaintiffs alleged

that the defendants have been in breach in many respects and that it would be conscionable

for them to call upon the Bond and the Advance Payment Guarantees. These were denied by

the defendants who asserted counter allegations in extenso. Both sides relied on a

substantial body of contemporaneous documents. Suffice it to say that the plaintiffs have

established a good arguable case to ground jurisdiction. By this Originating Summons they

seek for an interim preservation order pending the arbitration. Further, the court has

power to grant interim injunctions as provided by section 12(1)(g) and (6) of the

International Arbitration Act ("the IAA"). As set out in Article 9 of the Model

Law in the First Schedule of the IAA, it is "not incompatible with an arbitration

agreement for a party to request, before or during arbitral proceedings, from a court an

interim measure of protection and for the court to grant such measure": see <i>PT

Garuda Indonesia v Bergen Air</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=62910&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[2002] 1 SLR 393</a>, 398 at para 21. The plaintiffs are not

asking the court to finally determine the rights of the parties in respect of the

Subcontract or in respect of the termination of the appointment of the plaintiffs under

the Subcontract. In my view, that would not be possible in view of the reliefs sought by

the plaintiffs which are set out above. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">14

        It was pointed out at the appeal that the

plaintiffs had given notice of arbitration on 10 September 2002 and the matters included

in the arbitral reference included disputes regarding the call on the Bond and Advance

Payment Guarantees. But counsel for the plaintiffs stressed that there was some urgency in

the matter because under clause 21.2 of the Subcontract it was provided that "no

recourse to arbitration shall be made unless and until an attempt has first been made to

settle amicably" and that "a period of 90 days after either party has served

written notice on the other of their intention to refer the dispute to arbitration shall

be allowed for amicable settlement." Without the interim injunctive relief, it was

pointed out that payment might be made and it was not likely that the monies would be

destined for India to meet any arbitral award in favour of the plaintiffs.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">15

        The central argument of the defendants in the

appeal was that the dispute between the parties was whether the defendants were entitled

to terminate the Subcontract and that the subject-matter of the dispute is in substance

the Subcontract and not the Bond and the Advance Payment Guarantees. The governing laws of

the Subcontract is the law of India and the defendants did not agree to the law of

Singapore nor submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of Singapore. In my view, this

argument does not address the unalterable fact that so far as the Bond and the Advance

Payment Guarantees are concerned, the parties thereto, namely the AHA and the defendants

had expressly agreed that the governing law of it is the law of Singapore and that they

submit to the jurisdiction of our courts. A third party like the plaintiffs, having given

the counter indemnities, is interested in the dispute in respect of the enforceability of

those documents. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">16

        It was argued by the defendants that <i>Mercedes-Benz

AG v Leiduck</i> [1995] 3 All ER 803 is against the grant of leave to serve out of

jurisdiction under Order 11 rule 1 (b) of the Rules of Court. It was argued that there is

no substantive relief sought in these proceedings. Para 11/1/10 of Supreme Court Practice

1997 Vol. 1 summarised the case thus: "Even though proceedings may technically fall

within this sub-rule, the discretion to grant leave will not be exercised unless: (i) an

injunction is a genuine part of the relief sought and has not been claimed merely to bring

the case within the rule…and (ii) there is a reasonable prospect of an injunction

(itself a discretionary remedy) being granted." A mareva injunction was obtained and

served on the defendant pursuant to the leave granted to serve the writ out of

jurisdiction. Only the relief of mareva injunction was prayed in the action. The majority

of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Couincil, with Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead

dissenting, ruled that a mareva injunction was <i>sui generis</i> in that, unlike other

forms of injunction, it did not decide any substantive rights, and did not call into

existence any process upon which they could work. Counsel for the plaintiffs argued that

in <i>Mercedes-Benz AG</i> the relief prayed for was not anything like the injunction

prayed for in this case. It was more in the nature of an attachment of the assets of the

defendant pending the determination of proceedings in another jurisdiction, which came to

past, and on the basis of that judgment the plaintiffs obtained attachment orders against

shares of the defendant held in a Hong Kong company. I agreed with counsel in this case

the injunction sought by the plaintiffs is a substantive relief and it determines the

rights of the defendants under the Bond and the Advance Payment Guarantees as to his

entitlement to monies thereunder and the amount payable. Further, I also agreed that in

Singapore we have the IAA and Article 9 of Model Law. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">17

        On the evidence, I concluded that the

plaintiffs had made out a good arguable case as to why it would be unconscionable on the

part of the defendants to receive monies under the Bond and the Advance Payments

Guarantees. I further concluded that there were serious questions to be tried on the

various claims and counterclaims of the parties. As parties had agreed that Singapore law

govern the three instruments and had submitted to the jurisdiction of the Singapore Courts

in relation to any disputes arising out of those instruments I came to the view that

Singapore was the more appropriate forum, bearing in mind that the proper law of the Bond

and the Advance Payment Guarantee being Singapore law was "the predominating

factor" as explained by Kerr J (as he then was) in <i>B.P. Exploration v Hunt</i>

[1976] 1 Q.B. (Com. Ct) 471, 482 lhc. There were not present in this case other

considerations of overwhelming weight which militate against the Singapore Courts. I

therefore concluded that the appropriate forum for deciding the rights of the plaintiffs

and the defendants under the Bond and the Advance Payment Guarantees were the Courts of

Singapore.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">18

        For these reasons I allowed the appeal and

affirmed the leave granted to serve the Originating Summons out of jurisdiction.</font></p>
