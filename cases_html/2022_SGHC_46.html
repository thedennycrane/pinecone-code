These records are stored in publicly available ledgers that provide a digital record of every BTC or ETH transaction that has taken place. The records, in a form known as blockchain, provide an accurate, verifiable, and permanent audit trail with which one can track the transmission of cryptocurrencies.

</div> The following explanation in Kelvin F K Low and Ernie G S Teo, “Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies as property?” (2017) 9(2) Law, Innovation and Technology 235 (available at <span class="font-underline" style="color: rgba(0,0,255,1)">https://ink.library.smu.edu.sg/sol_research/2806</span>) is helpful:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Bitcoin was conceived by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto in his seminal white paper first published in 1 November 2008. … Bitcoin was envisaged as “an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party.” As a result of the central role played by cryptography in the system, bitcoin and its derivatives are known as cryptocurrencies. Once properly validated, bitcoin transactions are irreversible, or in the parlance of the bitcoin community, immutable.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Unlike most prior forms of “electronic money”, the system is neither derived from nor backed by any fiat currency. Instead, individual bitcoins are first created in the system through a process called mining. This process is intimately connected to the verification process by which transfers are tracked within the system. Instead of a centralised ledger (or register), the bitcoin system employs a decentralised system of ledgers known as the blockchain. The blockchain is essentially a register containing information tracking the creation and transfer of bitcoins much like a bank ledger tracks payments between bank accounts. Unlike bank accounts, however, the blockchain is not maintained by a central authority but instead resides in thousands of computers throughout the world. These computers are connected over the Internet to other computers running the same software, creating a network. When the holder of a bitcoin wishes to make a payment in bitcoin, an instruction is sent to this network and the computers on the network (nodes) validate the transaction before it is added to the blockchain files sitting on all the computers in the network. The process of validation involves the solution of a complex mathematical puzzle by nodes operated by users known as miners. Although the puzzles are described as complex, “[i]n fact there is nothing complex about this process, and you can do this by hand without a calculator; it just deliberately takes many computational steps without shortcuts.” In essence, this involves the miners’ computers engaging in a guessing game and the odds of winning are dependent on how quickly a miner’s computer can perform calculations as compared to those of other miners. Such users are described as miners because, in order to incentivise participants to engage in this process of validation, the system rewards the first to solve the puzzle with a preset quantity of new bitcoins. This did not require very much computational power in the beginning and anyone with a computer could mine bitcoin. However, as a result of the design of the bitcoin protocol, the level of difficulty increases with increased computational power participating in the network, and mining progressed from the use ordinary computers to dedicated ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) chips that are designed to do nothing except mine for bitcoin. Although computationally difficult to solve, the solutions are easily verifiable by other nodes, who may or may not be miners, on the network. Once verified, the transaction is added to the blockchain. This verification process requires a consensus of a majority of nodes in the network so that the likelihood of fraud is dramatically reduced.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A holder of bitcoins possesses a public bitcoin address and a private cryptographic key. The bitcoin address is often regarded as a serving a similar function to a bank account number. All that is needed to receive bitcoins is this public bitcoin address. Like a bank account, it is possible to have as many bitcoin addresses as one can be bothered to create. In order to transfer bitcoins out of the address, however, one requires both the address and the private cryptographic key. Whilst sometimes considered the equivalent of a password, the private cryptographic key is mathematically linked to the public address so that it is not possible to change the private key unlike a conventional password. One of the attractions of bitcoins is its relative anonymity compared with other payment systems. … However, bitcoin addresses are not completely anonymous but only pseudo-anonymous. While the identity of the address holder is not known, all transactions related to the address are in fact transparent and tracked in the blockchain. With the appropriate information, including publicly available information, it is possible to track some bitcoin transactions. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 BTC and ETH are sent between users electronically by sharing public “wallet” addresses on the blockchain. These wallets are represented by a string of numbers and letters, and loosely function like an account number. Unlike traditional bank accounts, however, all transactions to and from a given wallet can be viewed on the public blockchain.

The private key functions like a signature that confirms that any given transaction is authorised by the wallet owner. Private keys are represented by a string of 64 numbers and alphabets. Thus, anyone in possession of the private key can access the linked wallet and transfer BTC and ETH out. Likewise, losing the private key means that the funds held in the wallet cannot be accessed. As there are more than a billion permutations for what a private key may be, it is virtually impossible for one to guess the private key of a digital wallet.

On the night of 7 January 2021, the plaintiff and one acquaintance went out while the rest of the group remained at his apartment. As he needed some money, the plaintiff called one member of the group at his apartment, [E], and requested that [E] retrieve some cash that the plaintiff had kept in the safe in the master bedroom of his apartment. The plaintiff read the safe combination to [E] and [E] repeated the combination to the plaintiff to confirm that he had gotten it right. According to the plaintiff, during the call, some members of the group were in the same room as [E], while two other members were in a nearby bedroom. The plaintiff therefore claimed that anyone in the apartment could have heard the safe combination being said out loud. [E] later brought to the plaintiff the requested cash, and the three of them returned to the apartment at around 2.00am on 8 January 2021.

The first defendants entered the plaintiff’s recovery seeds into the BRD and Exodus applications via a separate mobile device to access the plaintiff’s private keys, which they then used to transfer the Stolen Cryptocurrency Assets.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 In the UK, the jurisdiction to grant orders against persons unknown was recognised in <span class="font-italic">Bloomsbury Publishing Group </span><span class="font-italic">Ltd and another v News Group Newspapers Ltd and others</span> [2003] 1 WLR 1633 (“<span class="font-italic">Bloomsbury</span>”). There, the court granted the plaintiff’s application for an interlocutory injunction against unknown persons who had taken copies of an unpublished book, enjoining such persons to deliver up the copies of the book and restraining them from disclosing to any person any information derived from the book (at 1634). The court noted that the UK Civil Procedure Rules (“CPR”) Practice Directions para 4.1(1) merely required that the title of the proceedings “<span class="font-italic">should</span> state … the full name of each party” [emphasis added] and not that a defendant <span class="font-italic">must</span> be named (at [16] and [19]). Moreover, the court considered CPR 3.10, which states as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">General power of the court to rectify matters where there has been an error of procedure</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">3.10 </span>Where there has been an error of procedure such as a failure to comply with a rule or practice direction —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) The error does not invalidate any step taken in the proceedings unless the court so orders; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) the court may make an order to remedy the error.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The court noted that “[CPR] 3.10 confers on the court a general power of dispensation where there has been a procedural error and provides that such error does not invalidate any step taken in the proceedings unless the court so orders” (at [15]). From this premise, the court distinguished the pre-CPR case of <span class="font-italic">Friern Barnet </span><span class="font-italic">Urban District Council v Adams and others </span>[1927] 2 Ch 25, where it was held <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span> that the prescribed form of writ required the defendant to be named. Because of the different regime introduced by the CPR, the court held (at [19]) that “[t]he proper application of [CPR] 3.10 is incompatible with a conclusion that the joinder of a defendant by description rather than by name is for that reason alone impermissible”. Importantly, the court set out the appropriate test as follows (at [21]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The crucial point, as it seems to me, is that the description used must be sufficiently certain as to identify both those who are included and those who are not. If that test is satisfied then it does not seem to me to matter that the description may apply to no one or to more than one person nor that there is no further element of subsequent identification whether by service or otherwise.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 In <span class="font-italic">CMOC v Persons Unknown</span> [2017] EWHC 3599 (Comm) (“<span class="font-italic">CMOC</span>”), the plaintiffs claimed against unidentified defendants who misappropriated £6.3m by infiltrating the email account of the plaintiff’s senior management and issuing payment instructions without the plaintiff’s authorisation (at [1]). The court recognised <span class="font-italic">Bloomsbury</span> as authority for the proposition that the courts have jurisdiction to grant interlocutory injunctions against persons unknown and held that there was “no reason in principle against, and indeed a good arguable case for, saying that this should extend to a freezing injunction” (at [4]). The court thereby granted the plaintiff’s application for a worldwide freezing injunction against persons unknown, and ancillary disclosure orders against certain banks who had received the stolen proceeds (at [9]–[10]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 In <span class="font-italic">Zschimmer</span><span class="font-italic"> &amp; Schwarz GmbH &amp; Co KG Chemische Fabriken v Persons Unknown &amp; Anor</span> [2021] 7 MLJ 178 (“<span class="font-italic">Zschimmer</span>”), the plaintiff, a German company, was defrauded by unidentified persons to make payments to a bank account in Malaysia, which the plaintiff thought were genuine commission payments to a South Korean business partner. In granting a proprietary injunction and a freezing injunction against persons unknown, the Malaysian High Court considered <span class="font-italic">CMOC</span>, and noted that it was affirmed by the UK Supreme Court in <span class="font-italic">Cameron v Liverpool Victoria Insurance Co Ltd</span> [2019] 3 All ER 1 and applied in at least two other English decisions (at [44]–[48]). Importantly, the court reasoned as follows (at [40] and [49]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">40 It is not usually the case that a defendant is described as ‘persons unknown’. Nevertheless, the court can grant interlocutory orders against the first defendant — being persons unknown. In cases like the present which involve cyber fraud and fake email addresses, the fraudster or fraudsters are unknown. English case law have allowed for similar injunctive orders against ‘persons unknown’. There is nothing in our Rules of Court 2012 that would prevent the writ of summons and applications from being filed against persons unknown.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">49 As stated above, <span class="font-italic">there is nothing in our Rules of Court 2012 prohibiting the making of an order against persons unknown</span>.

In so holding, the court reasoned that cryptocurrencies meet the four requirements set out in <span class="font-italic">Ainsworth</span> and “have the fundamental characteristic of intangible property as being an identifiable thing of value” (at [142]). However, it should be noted that since this point was undisputed by the parties, the court was satisfied that cryptocurrencies could be created as property in a generic sense and left open the question of what the precise nature of this property right was.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 On appeal however, the parties disputed the issue of whether cryptocurrencies were a species of property that was capable of being held on trust: see <span class="font-italic">Quoine</span><span class="font-italic"> Pte Ltd v B2C2 Ltd </span>[2020] 2 SLR 20 at [137]. The Court of Appeal reasoned that it was unnecessary to consider this issue because even if it was answered affirmatively, there was no certainty of intention to create a trust on the facts (at [144]). Nevertheless, the court canvassed in detail the authorities in support of treating cryptocurrencies as property (at [139]–[143]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">139 There have been some other cases in the Commonwealth that have implicitly accepted that cryptocurrency may be regarded as property, although we are not aware of any court that has attempted to identify the precise nature of the property right if any.

The action was brought by Copytrack Pte Ltd (“Copytrack”), a company engaged in the business of digital content management and automated copyright enforcement. Copytrack created its own cryptocurrency, Copytrack tokens, and mistakenly transferred a more valuable cryptocurrency, ETH, to the defendant investor instead of Copytrack tokens. The ETH was then transferred by the defendant to third parties. Copytrack sought to trace and recover the ETH. The court characterised the issue of whether the property law doctrines of conversion and wrongful detention could apply to cryptocurrencies as a “critical issue’” and the “real issue on this application”. While the court did not go so far as to rule on whether cryptocurrencies could, in fact, be subject to specific property law claims, the court held that it would be unreasonable and unjust in the circumstances to deny Copytrack a remedy, and so allowed Copytrack to trace and recover the wrongfully transferred ETH.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">141 Academic commentators broadly agree that BTC may be regarded as a property right, although they disagree as to the precise nature of this right.

This interest is identifiable through entries on the blockchain, can be transferred by entries of the blockchain, and has a high degree of permanence and stability.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">142 To similar effect is Kelvin F K Low and Ernie G S Teo, “Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies as property?” (2017) 9(2) <span class="font-italic">Law, Innovation and</span><span class="font-italic"> Technology</span> 235 (available at <span class="font-underline" style="color: rgba(0,0,255,1)">https://ink.library.smu.edu.sg/sol_research/2806</span>), where the authors argue that the property right relating to BTC is the right to have one’s public BTC address appear as the last entry in the blockchain in relation to a particular BTC. Such a right provides exclusive control to the holder in the form of universal exigibility and can be seen as involving a true property transfer when one transfers BTC from one’s public BTC address to another’s BTC address.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">143 Most recently, the UK Jurisdiction Taskforce (‘UKJT’) chaired by Sir Geoffrey Vos released its “Legal Statement on Cryptoassets and Smart Contracts” (November 2019), where it considered the question of whether English law would treat a particular cryptoasset as property. The UKJT defined cryptoassets as generally having the following characteristics (at para 31): (a) intangibility; (b) cryptographic authentication; (c) use of a distributed transaction ledger; (d) decentralisation; and (e) rule by consensus. The UKJT stated (at para 85) that cryptoassets have all the indicia of property, and that their novel or distinctive features as aforementioned do not disqualify them from being property. The UKJT also stated that cryptoassets are not disqualified from being property simply because they might not be classifiable either as things in possession or as things in action. The UKJT therefore concluded that cryptoassets could be treated, in principle, as property.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Ultimately, the court observed (at [144]) that “[t]here may be much to commend the view that cryptocurrencies should be capable of assimilation into the general concepts of property”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 The plaintiff referred me to the New Zealand case of <span class="font-italic">Ruscoe</span><span class="font-italic"> v Cryptopia Ltd (in liq)</span> [2020] 2 NZLR 809 (“<span class="font-italic">Ruscoe</span>”), where the High Court held, following a comprehensive discussion (at [102]–[120]), that (at [120]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[C]ryptocurrencies meet the standard criteria outlined by Lord Wilberforce [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the four requirements set out in <span class="font-italic">Ainsworth</span>] to be considered a species of “property”.

</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The first requirement is that the right must be “definable” – the asset must hence be capable of being isolated from other assets whether of the same type or of other types and thereby identified (<span class="font-italic">Ruscoe</span> at [104]). To this end, cryptocurrencies are computer-readable strings of characters which are recorded on networks of computers established for the purpose of recording those strings, and are sufficiently distinct to be capable of then being allocated to an account holder on that particular network (<span class="font-italic">Ruscoe</span> at [105]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The second requirement is that the right must be “identifiable by third parties”, which requires that the asset must have an owner being capable of being recognised as such by third parties (<span class="font-italic">Ruscoe</span> at [109]). An important indicator is whether the owner has the power to exclude others from using or benefiting from the asset (<span class="font-italic">Ruscoe</span> at [110]). In this vein, excludability is achieved in respect of cryptocurrencies by the computer software allocating the owner with a private key, which is required to record a transfer of the cryptocurrency from one account to another (<span class="font-italic">Ruscoe</span> at [112]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The third requirement is that the right must be “capable of assumption by third parties”, which in turn involves two aspects: that third parties must respect the rights of the owner in that asset, and that the asset must be potentially desirable (<span class="font-italic">Ruscoe</span> at [114]). The fact that these two aspects are met by cryptocurrencies, is evidenced by the fact that many cryptocurrencies, certainly BTC and ETH, are the subject of active trading markets (<span class="font-italic">Ruscoe</span> at [116]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The fourth requirement is that the right and in turn, the asset, must have “some degree of permanence or stability”, although this is a low threshold since a “ticket to a football match which can have a very short life yet unquestionably it is regarded as property” (<span class="font-italic">Ruscoe</span> at [117]). In this respect, the blockchain methodology which cryptocurrency systems deploy provides stability to cryptocurrencies, and a particular cryptocurrency token stays fully recognised, in existence and stable unless and until it is spent through the use of the private key, which may never happen (<span class="font-italic">Ruscoe</span> at [118]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Having considered the extant case law and especially the analysis in <span class="font-italic">Ruscoe</span>, I was of the view that cryptocurrencies satisfied the definition of a property right in <span class="font-italic">Ainsworth</span>. The plaintiff was therefore able to prove a serious arguable case that the Stolen Cryptocurrency Assets were capable of giving rise to proprietary rights, which could be protected via a proprietary injunction. I reiterate that the court does not engage in complex questions of law or fact at the interlocutory stage (see [39] above). Hence, the first requirement of showing that there is a serious question to be tried was satisfied.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Balance of convenience</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 The balance of convenience is assessed by considering the potential prejudice that the applicant may suffer if the injunction is not granted, against the prejudice to the respondent in the event that the injunction is granted and the applicant’s hypothesis is refuted at the trial (<span class="font-italic">Bouvier</span> at [161]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 In my view, the balance clearly lay in favour of granting the proprietary injunction. If it were not granted, there would be a real risk that the first defendants would dissipate the Stolen Cryptocurrency Assets, which would prevent the plaintiff from recovering those assets even if he successfully obtained a judgment in his favour. Conversely, even if the plaintiff’s case were later refuted, the first defendants would only suffer losses arising from their inability to deal with the Stolen Cryptocurrency Assets, which could be compensated by way of damages.

However, the circumstances that will have to be established in order to cross the threshold of necessity will likely be more exacting where a worldwide freezing injunction is concerned (<span class="font-italic">Bouvier </span>at [36]–[37]). There is also a further consideration of whether the defendant has sufficient assets within the jurisdiction to satisfy the prospective judgment: generally, the fewer the assets within the jurisdiction, the greater the necessity for taking protective measures in relation to those outside it (<span class="font-italic">Guan Chong Cocoa Manufacturer </span><span class="font-italic">Sdn Bhd v Pratiwi Shipping SA</span> [2003] 1 SLR(R) 157 at [29]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 A good arguable case is one which is “more than barely capable of serious argument, but not necessarily one which the judge considers would have a better than 50 per cent chance of success” (<span class="font-italic">Bouvier</span> at [36]). The plaintiff has two claims against the first defendants. First, that the first defendants hold the Stolen Cryptocurrency Assets on a constructive trust for the plaintiff. Second, that the first defendants were enriched at the expense of the plaintiff in circumstances that were unjust, because the first defendants obtained the plaintiff’s assets without his consent or authority.

</div>
</div> In respect of the first claim, it is hornbook law that where a person misappropriates the property of another without consent, a constructive trust arises by operation of law over the stolen assets, as it would be unconscionable for the misappropriating party to assert any beneficial interest in the property or their traceable proceeds (<span class="font-italic">Yuanta</span><span class="font-italic"> Asset Management International Ltd and another v Telemedia Pacific Group Ltd and another and another appeal</span> [2018] 2 SLR 21 at [113]). In my view, this alone was sufficient to show that the plaintiff had a good arguable case against the defendants.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 As for proving a real risk of dissipation, there must be some “solid evidence” to demonstrate the risk, and not just bare assertions to that effect (<span class="font-italic">Bouvier</span> at [36]). Importantly, a well-substantiated allegation that a defendant has acted dishonestly can and often will be relevant to whether there is a real risk that the defendant may dissipate his assets (<span class="font-italic">Bouvier</span> at [94]). In this regard, the plaintiff rightly submitted that the first defendants had acted dishonestly in misappropriating the Stolen Cryptocurrency Assets. Having examined the evidence, I found that the first defendants dissipated the stolen assets through a series of digital wallets that appear to have been created solely for the purpose of frustrating the plaintiff’s tracing and recovery efforts, and which had either no or negligible transactions other than the deposit and withdrawal of the Stolen Cryptocurrency Assets.

</div>
</div> Moreover, the risk of dissipation in the present case is heightened by the nature of the cryptocurrency: the Stolen Cryptocurrency Assets are susceptible to being transferred by the click of a button, through digital wallets that may be completely anonymous and untraceable to the owner, and can be easily dissipated and hidden in cyberspace.

Primarily, this was because the value of the plaintiff’s claim is in excess of US$7m, while less than US$1m worth of the Stolen Cryptocurrency Assets are known to have been transferred to digital wallets owned by the second and third defendants, which have operations in Singapore. Moreover, it was also unlikely that the first defendants would hold all of their remaining ill-gotten gains in Singapore.

</div> In my decision, it was unnecessary to consider such principles given that the second and third defendants <span class="font-italic">are</span> parties to the present dispute. The court was therefore empowered by s 4(10) of the Civil Law Act to grant interlocutory relief “either unconditionally or upon such terms and conditions as the court thinks just, in all cases in which it appears to the court to be just or convenient that such order should be made”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 In the present case, I was of the view that the disclosure orders sought were just and convenient. The plaintiff required the information sought to understand what remained of the stolen assets that were transferred to the second and third defendants, the extent that they have been transferred to other persons or accounts, as well as the whereabouts of such assets. The information sought would also facilitate the identification of the first defendants, or any persons that may have assisted or acted in concert with them.

</div> Hence, the requirement under O 11 r 1(a) of the ROC that the person is domiciled, ordinarily resident, carrying on business or has property in Singapore is satisfied. As for the fourth and fifth defendants, O 11 r 1(c) provides that service out of jurisdiction is permissible where “the claim is brought against a person duly served in or out of Singapore and a person out of Singapore is a necessary or proper party thereto”. In this regard, a person is a “proper party” if, had he been within the jurisdiction, he would have been properly joined as a defendant pursuant to O 15 of the ROC (<span class="font-italic">J H Rayner (Mincing Lane) Ltd v Teck Hock and Co (Pte) Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> and others </span>[1989] 2 SLR(R) 683 at [17]–[19]; <span class="font-italic">White Book</span> at para 11/1/19). This was the case here (see [65]–[68] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 With regard to the second requirement, the plaintiff has to show that there is a serious question to be tried on the merits of the claim (<span class="font-italic">Bradley Lomas </span><span class="font-italic">Electrolok Ltd and another v Colt Ventilation East Asia Pte Ltd</span> <span class="font-italic">and others</span> [1999] 3 SLR(R) 1156 at [19]–[20]). In my view, this threshold was met. The documents disclosed by the second and third defendants reveal that the accounts registered by the fourth and fifth defendants were likely created for the sole purposes of dissipating the stolen assets, which suggests that the fourth and fifth defendants were likely to have been amongst the conspirators who had planned to and did indeed steal the Stolen Cryptocurrency Assets from the plaintiff.

</div> As for the sixth and seventh defendants, which are a cryptocurrency exchange and a digital payment services company respectively, the plaintiff would have a meritorious claim in seeking disclosure of relevant information against them, just as they did against the second and third defendants (see [57]–[60] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 As for the last requirement, the plaintiff bears the burden of proving that Singapore is the proper forum (<span class="font-italic">Zoom Communications</span> at [71]–[75]). In this regard, as set out in <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span><span class="font-italic"> Maritime Corporation v Cansulex Ltd</span> [1987] AC 460 (affirmed in <span class="font-italic">Siemens AG v </span><span class="font-italic">Holdrich Investment Ltd</span> [2010] 3 SLR 1007 (“<span class="font-italic">Siemens </span><span class="font-italic">AG</span>”) at [5]–[6]), the courts will assess whether Singapore is the most appropriate forum to hear the substantive dispute, by considering what factors there are which point in the direction of Singapore as the appropriate forum. The following statements by the Court of Appeal were instructive (<span class="font-italic">Siemens AG</span> at [4], [7] and [8]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">4 … The purpose of the <span class="font-italic">forum </span><span class="font-italic">conveniens</span> analysis is to identify the most appropriate forum in which to try the substantive dispute. It is wrong to say that Singapore is <span class="font-italic">forum non </span><span class="font-italic">conveniens</span> simply because the connecting factors which point to Singapore are outweighed by all the connecting factors which point away from Singapore. The connecting factors which point away from Singapore must point to a more appropriate forum than Singapore, and they might not do so if those connections are dispersed amongst several jurisdictions. Quite simply, Singapore is <span class="font-italic">forum non </span><span class="font-italic">conveniens</span> only if there is a more appropriate forum than Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">7 However, in recognition of the primarily territorial nature of the court’s jurisdiction, the court begins with the location of the defendant when it decides whether it has jurisdiction over a dispute – thus, jurisdiction over a defendant who is within the territory is as of right, while jurisdiction over a defendant who is outside the territory is discretionary. In this sense, there is a burden – <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, the burden of displacing the <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> weight given to the location of the defendant. But, despite the use of the term, the burden is not strictly one of proof. Instead, the burden is one of demonstrating the normative weight to be given to each connecting factor in the light of all the circumstances of the case. The ease of discharging the burden would similarly depend on the facts of each case – again, as Lord Goff himself noted in <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> (at 481), the circumstances described in the English equivalent of our O 11 r 1 are “of great variety, ranging from cases where … the discretion would normally be exercised in favour of granting leave … to cases where the grant of leave is far more problematical”. In the same vein, Lord Goff also remarked (at 481) that the importance to be attached to any particular ground invoked by the plaintiff in seeking leave for service out of jurisdiction might vary from case to case.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">8 Separately, we do not think that it is necessary for a plaintiff who seeks leave for service out of jurisdiction to show that Singapore is “clearly” the <span class="font-italic">forum </span><span class="font-italic">conveniens</span> if, by this, it is meant that Singapore must be not only the most appropriate forum in the final analysis, but also the most appropriate forum by far. No doubt, there will be cases where the <span class="font-italic">forum </span><span class="font-italic">conveniens</span> is clear beyond contest. But, in the case of an international dispute where the connecting factors are finely balanced, a requirement that there must be a forum which is clearly the most appropriate forum would necessarily condemn the dispute to jurisdictional limbo. Such a result does the doctrine of <span class="font-italic">forum non </span><span class="font-italic">conveniens</span> no credit. In our view, therefore, <span class="font-italic">it is sufficient for</span><span class="font-italic"> a plaintiff seeking leave for service out of jurisdiction to show that Singapore is, on balance and in the final analysis, the most appropriate forum to try the dispute, and it matters not whether Singapore is the most appropriate forum by a hair or by a mile</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original omitted; emphasis added in italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 In my decision, I placed much weight on: (a) the fact that the second and third defendants are based in Singapore and have complied with disclosure orders; and (b) the fact that the sixth and seventh defendants have wholly owned subsidiaries in Singapore and were likely to comply with disclosure orders.

</div> Moreover, it was unlikely that they would agree to come forward to accept service willingly. The plaintiff had previously served the injunction and disclosure order on the first defendants via the fourth and fifth defendants (who were unnamed and part of the first defendants prior to this application). However, the fourth and fifth defendants did not respond to the emails effecting service. Also, both the fourth and fifth defendants had used Virtual Private Network services to obscure the locations from which they had accessed their accounts in the second and third defendants, seemingly to avoid being located physically in the event that their identities are uncovered.
