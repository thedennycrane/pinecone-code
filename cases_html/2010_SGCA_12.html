        V K Rajah JA (delivering the judgment of the
                court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an appeal against the decision of the
                    High Court judge (“the Judge”) setting aside
                    Assistant Registrar Chew Chin Yee’s assessment of the damages that
                    arose from the appellant’s failure to deliver to the respondent a vessel
                    (“the <em>Asia Star</em>”) in accordance with
                    the terms of a voyage charterparty (“the Charterparty”). The
                    assistant registrar (“the AR”) found that the respondent failed to
                    act reasonably to mitigate its loss in that it did not hire an alternative
                    vessel which was available at the material time –
                    <em>viz</em>, the <em>Puma</em>
                    – to carry the intended cargo. He awarded the respondent the sum of
                    US$302,000, which represented the additional expense that the respondent would
                    have been put to had it hired the <em>Puma</em> and thereby
                    fulfilled its duty to mitigate its loss (see <em>The “Asia
                        Star”</em> [2008] SGHC 92 (“the AR’s
                    judgment”)). On appeal to the High Court, the AR’s factual findings
                    on mitigation were reversed by the Judge and the award of damages increased
                    nearly fivefold (see <em>The “Asia Star”</em>
                    [2009] SGHC 91 (“the Judge’s judgment”), which is also
                    reported as <em>The “Asia Star”</em> [2009]
                    2 Lloyd’s Rep 387).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The issue of mitigation lies at the heart of
                    this appeal. Specifically, the question which we have to decide is this: did the
                    respondent act reasonably to mitigate its loss after it learnt that the
                    appellant would not be able to supply the <em>Asia
                        Star</em> as promised? After carefully considering the parties’
                    submissions and the evidence, we have decided to allow the appeal and restore
                    the decision of the AR – albeit with an arithmetical correction to the
                    quantum of damages due to the respondent. We will give our detailed reasons
                    after outlining the factual setting and the decisions made below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The appellant is the owner of the <em>Asia Star</em>. The respondent is a Malaysian company which,
                    amongst other businesses, trades in refined oil products. It claims to be one of
                    the largest traders of palm oil in Malaysia and Indonesia, and charters up to
                    five ships a month to carry the 800,000mt to 900,000mt of palm oil products that
                    it trades in annually. The respondent may be said to be a sophisticated player
                    in the palm oil trade, and one which is familiar with shipping practices and
                    issues to boot.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       In November 2003, the respondent entered into
                    the Charterparty with the appellant for the hire of the <em>Asia
                        Star</em> at a basic freight rate of US$32.00 per metric tonne
                    (“pmt”) based on one load port, with a further US$1.00 pmt to
                    be paid for each additional load port. The vessel had a tonnage of 22,756mt and
                    a capacity to carry up to 24,581mt of cargo.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> It was agreed that a minimum of
                    21,500mt of palm oil would be loaded onto the vessel for carriage to and
                    delivery at ports in the Middle East, Turkey and the Black Sea.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The shipment of 21,500mt of palm oil was
                    intended to fulfil the respondent’s contractual obligations to sell palm
                    oil to a Turkish company, Agrima Ic Ve Dis Ticaret Pazarlama Ltd
                    (“Agrima”), under a series of contracts entered into between
                    September and December 2003 (“the Agrima contracts”). Pursuant to
                    the Agrima contracts, the respondent had to ship 21,500mt of palm oil between
                    15 December 2003 and 15 January 2004 (“the original Agrima
                    shipment period”), with the cargo to be delivered by the middle of
                    February 2004. Whilst the Agrima contracts were being concluded, the respondent
                    entered into another series of contracts (collectively, “the purchase
                    contracts”) to purchase 24,500mt of palm oil from three suppliers
                    (collectively, “the Suppliers”) – namely, PT Pacific
                    Indomas (“Indomas”), PT Pacific Medan Industri
                    (“Pamin”) and Pacific Oil and Fats Industries Sdn Bhd
                    (“Pacoil”). The palm oil purchased under these contracts was later
                    nominated as the cargo to be loaded onto and carried on board the <em>Asia Star</em> (“the Cargo”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       We should at this juncture point out that the
                    respondent did not enter into the purchase contracts with the specific intention
                    of using the palm oil purchased thereunder (<em>ie</em>,
                    the Cargo) to fulfil its obligations under the Agrima contracts. The respondent
                    – being a large trader in edible oils (such as palm oil) – bought
                    and sold a vast quantity of such oils every month. What it bought would
                    subsequently be allocated to various purchasers depending on trade requirements
                    and vessel availability. It also bears mentioning that the respondent and the
                    Suppliers appear to be related to one another, and share some common directors.
                    Further, Agrima has a close relationship with the respondent and has been the
                    latter’s sole agent in Turkey since 2004.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       By agreement between the appellant and the
                    respondent, the loading period for the <em>Asia Star</em>
                    was to be between 27 December 2003 and 4 January 2004 (“the
                    original loading period”). The appellant was obliged to present the
                    vessel at the respondent’s nominated load ports in Belawan, Indonesia, and
                    Pasir Gudang, Malaysia, within that period, whereupon the Cargo would be loaded
                    on board by the supplier concerned (specifically, loading at Belawan would be
                    carried out by Indomas and Pamin, while loading at Pasir Gudang would be carried
                    out by Pacoil). The vessel was to call at Belawan first.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Unfortunately, the <em>Asia
                        Star</em> was unable to reach the nominated load ports within the
                    original loading period. The vessel was initially delayed for a few days in
                    South Korea due to bad weather and a change in her discharge schedule.
                    Subsequently, on 5 January 2004, the appellant notified the respondent of a
                    further delay when the vessel was unable to discharge her cargo in China due to
                    the sudden imposition of a ban on beef tallow originating from the United
                    States. The appellant asked for loading to commence only on 15 January
                    2004, a request which the respondent acceded to. In turn, the respondent asked
                    the Suppliers for an extension of time to load the Cargo. Where Indomas was
                    concerned, it had earlier agreed, when the <em>Asia
                        Star</em> was delayed in South Korea, to extend the date for
                    completion of loading until 15 January 2004. After it was notified by the
                    respondent about the further delay of the vessel in China, it agreed to extend
                    the date for completion of loading again, this time, until 21 January 2004.
                    Pamin and Pacoil, on their part, did not expressly agree to an extension of time
                    for loading, and reserved their rights to charge any penalty, storage charges
                    and other charges that they might incur as a result of the delay in loading.
                    Where Agrima was concerned, it agreed to extend the original Agrima shipment
                    period until 21 January 2004.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On 19 January 2004, the <em>Asia Star</em> finally berthed at Belawan. Upon arrival, however, the
                    vessel’s cargo tanks were found by the respondent’s surveyors to be
                    unfit for receiving the Cargo. According to the surveyors’ report, the
                    coating of the cargo tanks had rusted as well as blistered and the cargo tanks
                    were generally in poor condition, giving rise to a risk of contamination. The
                    respondent promptly sent the appellant a solicitor’s notice on the same
                    day (<em>ie</em>, 19 January 2004) asserting that the
                    appellant was in breach of the Charterparty. At the same time, the respondent
                    suggested that the appellant could discharge its obligations under the
                    Charterparty by substituting the <em>Asia Star</em> with
                    another more acceptable vessel to carry out the voyage. The appellant responded,
                    likewise on 19 January 2004, to say that no substitute vessel was
                    available. On 20 January 2004, it informed the respondent that it had made
                    efforts to improve the condition of the <em>Asia
                    Star</em>’s cargo tanks by cleaning them and invited the respondent
                    to re-inspect the tanks in order to determine their suitability. The respondent
                    did not respond to the offer and the <em>Asia Star</em>
                    left Belawan on 21 January 2004. No cargo was ever loaded onto the
                    vessel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     During this period, the respondent was not
                    inactive. It attempted to secure an alternative vessel to carry the Cargo. Its
                    inquiries began on 19 January 2004, even before the <em>Asia
                        Star</em> was found to be unfit to receive the cargo. That same day,
                    the respondent’s shipbroker found a substitute vessel –
                    <em>viz</em>, the <em>Puma</em>,
                    which, with a maximum cargo capacity of 40,000mt, was a much larger vessel than
                    the <em>Asia Star</em>. The owners of the <em>Puma</em> indicated that loading of the Cargo at Belawan
                    could commence by 27 or 28 January 2004, based on the estimation that the
                    vessel would arrive at Pasir Gudang on 26 or 27 January 2004. However, the
                    respondent was unable to reach an agreement with the owners of the <em>Puma</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     On 20 January 2004, several exchanges
                    took place between the owners of the <em>Puma</em> and the
                    respondent. The offers made by the owners of the <em>Puma</em> and the counter-offers made by the respondent may be
                    summarised as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The negotiations between the owners of the
                        <em>Puma</em> and the respondent broke off abruptly
                    following the respondent’s last counter-offer, which was made at 5.32pm on
                    20 January 2004. The owners of the <em>Puma</em> did
                    not respond to that counter-offer and the respondent did not attempt to engage
                    in further negotiations thereafter. From the picture sketched above, it seems
                    that the discussions broke down as a result of the respondent’s
                    unwillingness to accept a difference in freight rate of just US$2.00 pmt
                    (which was the difference between the highest freight rate demanded by the
                    owners of the <em>Puma</em> (<em>viz</em>, US$27.50 pmt) and the highest freight rate which the
                    respondent was willing to pay (<em>viz</em>,
                    US$25.50 pmt)) – this, despite the willingness shown by the owners of
                    the <em>Puma</em> to treat the vessel as having a total
                    cargo capacity which was less than her actual total cargo capacity so that the
                    dead freight payable by the respondent would be reduced.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     On 21 January 2004, the respondent
                    instructed its shipbroker to look afresh for a replacement vessel. It is
                    pertinent to note that, by that time, the respondent had a different
                    requirement. Specifically, it sought a vessel to carry 20,000mt of palm oil to
                    the eastern part of the Mediterranean Sea <em>and
                        another</em> 20,000mt of palm oil to the Red Sea on an urgent basis
                    (see below at <a href="#p1_69">[69]</a>). In other words,
                    although the respondent had decided not to hire the <em>Puma</em>, it apparently still needed a vessel with the same total
                    cargo capacity (<em>ie</em>, 40,000mt); it also required
                    the vessel to call at other ports in addition to the original ports of discharge
                    mentioned at <a href="#p1_4">[4]</a> above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Following the departure of the <em>Asia Star</em>, Indomas cancelled all of its contracts with
                    the respondent on 22 January 2004 on the basis that the latter had not
                    complied with the original loading period (as extended by Indomas in the manner
                    outlined at <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> above). Agrima also cancelled
                    the bulk of the Agrima contracts on 23 January 2004, but agreed to allow
                    5,750mt of palm oil (<em>cf</em> the 21,500mt originally
                    ordered) to be shipped on the <em>Chembulk Barcelona</em>,
                    a vessel which the respondent had earlier chartered on 30 December 2003,
                    with loading to begin in February 2004. Pamin and Pacoil agreed to an extension
                    of the original loading period so as to allow shipment on the <em>Chembulk Barcelona</em>. However, they also sought to penalise the
                    respondent and charged consequential expenses for (<em>inter
                        alia</em>) extended storage and heating in order to restore the
                    quality of the Cargo, which had deteriorated due to the delay.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     We pause here to draw attention to two
                    findings made by the AR, which pertain to the facts set out above (see
                    [34]–[35] of the AR’s judgment). The first is the finding that both
                    the Suppliers and Agrima were not informed of the difficulties which the
                    respondent encountered in relation to the <em>Asia
                        Star</em> during the material period. Although the respondent asked
                    the Suppliers and Agrima for an extension of time to load and ship the Cargo, it
                    did not inform them that the <em>Asia Star</em> had been
                    rejected, and that a substitute vessel was available within the appropriate
                    laycan period. The respondent also did not ask Agrima for a further extension of
                    the original Agrima shipment period (see, in this regard, <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> above), and notified Agrima of the <em>Asia Star</em>’s cancellation only on 23 January
                    2004. The second finding to note is “the urgency of the matter at the
                    material time” (see [35] of the AR’s judgment) if one were to take
                    the various contracts involved at face value. Originally, loading of the Cargo
                    was to have been completed by 4 January 2004. Two extensions of time had
                    already been granted to the respondent by Indomas to present the <em>Asia Star</em> for loading: first, up to 15 January
                    2004, and then up to 21 January 2004 (see <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> above). As for Agrima, it had agreed to extend the original
                    Agrima shipment period up to 21 January 2004 (see, likewise, <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> above). If the respondent were not able to
                    secure further extensions of time, it would be in breach of its obligations.
                    From this perspective, the respondent’s contractual position at the
                    material time was, as aptly described at [36] of the AR’s judgment,
                    “precarious”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     On 13 February 2004, the respondent
                    commenced Admiralty in Rem No 30 of 2004 (<em>viz</em>, the action from which this appeal stems) against the appellant
                    for damages arising from the latter’s breach of the Charterparty. The
                    question of liability was tried, and the High Court held that the appellant had
                    indeed breached the Charterparty (see <em>The “Asia
                        Star”</em> [2006] 3 SLR(R) 612). The appeal against the
                    High Court’s decision on liability was dismissed by this court (see
                        <em>The “Asia Star”</em> [2007]
                    3 SLR(R) 1). When the matter went before the AR for assessment of damages,
                    the respondent’s claim comprised the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_a"></a>(a)     US$698,889.88 for loss incurred on
                        account of the cancellation of the respondent’s contracts with
                        Indomas;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_b"></a>(b)     US$823,800 for sums paid in settlement of Agrima’s claim against the
                        respondent as a result of the respondent’s failure to deliver the palm
                        oil promised under the Agrima contracts;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_c"></a>(c)     US$357,000 for penalty charges imposed by Pamin
                        for the delay in loading; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_d"></a>(d)     RM558,467.31 for various charges such as interest,
                        storage, reprocessing, transportation and heating charges imposed by
                        Pacoil.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In all, the total value of the respondent’s
                    various heads of claim amounted to about US$2m.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The judgments below</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The AR’s decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The AR did not hesitate in dismissing the
                    appellant’s submission that the respondent had not suffered any
                    identifiable damage as a result of the appellant’s breach of the
                    Charterparty. However, the AR found that the respondent had failed to act
                    reasonably to mitigate its loss since the <em>Puma</em> had
                    been available as a possible substitute vessel. He held that it was
                    unreasonable, given the dire situation which the respondent was in, for the
                    respondent to have pressed for a lower freight rate for the <em>Puma</em>. The respondent, the AR commented, was “<em>simply trying to maximise the revenue which could be generated from
                        chartering the</em> Puma” [emphasis added] (see [33] of the
                    AR’s judgment). He found that “the larger capacity of the <em>Puma</em>, as compared to [the] <em>Asia
                        Star</em>, was not a major consideration for [the respondent] in
                    deciding whether to charter it [<em>ie</em>, the <em>Puma</em>] in substitution” (see, likewise, [33] of
                    the AR’s judgment). He was of the view that, when the owners of the
                        <em>Puma</em> did not respond to the respondent’s
                    last counter-offer (<em>ie</em>, the counter-offer made at
                    5.32pm on 20 January 2004), the respondent should have chartered the
                        <em>Puma</em> at the freight rate offered by her
                    owners, instead of abandoning the option of chartering that vessel altogether
                    (see the AR’s judgment at [43]). Implicit in this ruling is the AR’s
                    recognition that the freight rate of US$27.50 pmt which the owners of the
                        <em>Puma</em> insisted on was actually lower than the
                    freight rate for the <em>Asia Star</em> (which was
                    US$32.00 pmt), with the result that any costs incurred by the respondent on
                    dead freight as a result of chartering the <em>Puma</em>
                    would be offset by savings arising from the lower freight rate (see the
                    AR’s judgment at [43]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The AR took a commonsensical approach in
                    coming to his decision. After carefully analysing the evidence, he determined
                    that “both Agrima and Indomas would, on a balance of probabilities, have
                    accepted the substitution of the <em>Puma</em> to load and
                    deliver the cargo” (see the AR’s judgment at [51]). In addition, he
                    found that the respondent acted unreasonably in not informing the Suppliers and
                    Agrima immediately of the <em>Puma</em>’s
                    availability (albeit at a higher freight rate) and in not requesting for further
                    extensions of time (see the AR’s judgment at [36]). As the respondent knew
                    at the material time that the market for palm oil was a rising one, it was
                    inexplicable for the respondent not to have made strenuous efforts to avoid any
                    cancellation of the purchase contracts since it would, in the event of such
                    cancellation, have been exposed to “potentially ruinous damages”
                    (see the AR’s judgment at [38]). The AR therefore held that the proper
                    measure of damages was the total amount of freight that the respondent would
                    have paid if it had chartered the <em>Puma</em> as a
                    substitute vessel less the amount of freight that it was originally bound to pay
                    for the <em>Asia Star</em>. He calculated the difference
                    between these two amounts to be US$302,000. Both parties now accept that the
                    correct amount should be US$399,500 if the AR’s decision is
                upheld.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Judge’s decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Both the respondent and the appellant appealed
                    against the AR’s decision. The respondent appealed on the grounds that
                        (<em>inter alia</em>) the AR erred in finding that it
                    had not acted reasonably to mitigate its loss, while the appellant appealed on
                    the basis that the respondent had not suffered any damage at all from the
                    appellant’s breach of contract. There were three main questions before the
                    Judge: first, whether the loss suffered by the respondent was indeed caused by
                    the appellant’s breach; second, whether the respondent had acted
                    reasonably to mitigate its loss; and, third, what the appropriate measure of
                    damages should be if the respondent were found to have acted reasonably to
                    mitigate its loss.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The Judge upheld the AR’s finding on the
                    first question (see the Judge’s judgment at [49]). She also held that the
                    respondent’s duty to mitigate arose on 20 January 2004 (see the
                    Judge’s judgment at [57]) – the same day on which the
                    respondent’s negotiations with the owners of the <em>Puma</em> took place. However, she disagreed with the AR’s
                    findings on the second question and ruled that the respondent had acted
                    reasonably to mitigate its loss (see the Judge’s judgment at [78]). As a
                    result, the respondent’s appeal against the AR’s decision was
                    allowed while the appellant’s appeal was dismissed. The detailed reasons
                    for the Judge’s disagreement with the AR will be examined below at
                        <a href="#p1_35">[35]</a>–<a href="#p1_37">[37]</a>. For now, it suffices to say that the Judge found that:
                    (a) the respondent had acted reasonably even though it failed to charter
                    the <em>Puma</em> on the terms offered to it on
                    20 January 2004; and (b) consequently, the respondent was not limited
                    to claiming as damages the difference between the freight which it would have
                    paid had it chartered the <em>Puma</em> and the freight
                    payable for the <em>Asia Star</em>. The final sums awarded
                    to the respondent in respect of its various heads of damages were assessed by
                    the Judge at US$1,485,140.55 and RM449,086.90 respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">General principles applicable to appeals against assessments of
                damages </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Before dealing with the issues at hand in the
                    present appeal, it is important to briefly set out the basis upon which this
                    court may review a High Court judge’s decision on an appeal from an
                    assistant registrar’s award of damages. The present appeal concerns the
                    Judge’s ruling on the appellant’s appeal against the decision of the
                    AR, who was the original finder of fact. Here, it was <em>the AR
                        – and not the Judge</em> – who had the benefit of seeing
                    and hearing the witnesses first-hand as they gave evidence. Even though this
                    court will give proper deference to an appellate decision of a High Court judge
                    apropos an assistant registrar’s assessment of damages, the High Court
                    judge will ordinarily be in no better a position than this court when it comes
                    to evaluating the evidence. We note that, in this case, the Judge drew her own
                    inferences from the documents tendered to the court, the affidavits filed by the
                    respective parties and the notes of evidence of the hearing before the AR in
                    determining whether the respondent had acted reasonably to mitigate its loss.
                    This court, too, stands in a similar position and may draw the appropriate
                    inferences from the same record of proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The key issue in this appeal: Mitigation</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Overview of the law on mitigation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     We turn now to the key issue in this appeal
                    –
                    <em>viz</em>, the question of mitigation; specifically,
                    whether the respondent acted reasonably to discharge its duty to mitigate its
                    loss. For ease of reference, we will in the rest of this judgment use the term
                    “defaulting party” to denote the party who breaches a contract and
                    the term “aggrieved party” to denote the party in respect of whom
                    the contract in question is breached.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     We begin with a brief overview of the law
                    relating to mitigation. In a claim for damages for breach of contract, the
                    failure of the aggrieved party to act reasonably to mitigate its loss is a
                    standard defence which the defaulting party usually invokes to reduce the
                    damages payable. It is important, however, to point out that the so-called
                    “duty” to mitigate is not strictly speaking a legal duty which the
                    aggrieved party owes to the defaulting party, in that the latter cannot bring an
                    action against the former for failing to mitigate its loss. The term
                    “duty” as employed repeatedly in the authorities is actually no
                    more than a convenient term of reference for the legal requirement imposed on an
                    aggrieved party to take prophylactic measures to minimise avoidable loss if it
                    wishes to recover all of the loss sustained as a result of the defaulting
                    party’s breach of contract. A breach of the “duty” to
                    mitigate <em>prima facie</em> disentitles the aggrieved
                    party from claiming that part of its loss which, in the court’s view,
                    could have been avoided if reasonable mitigation measures had been taken. From
                    this perspective, the “duty” to mitigate may give rise to an
                    indirect legal “liability” in so far as a breach of this
                    “duty” operates as a legal bar, <em>pro
                        tanto</em>, to recovery of damages. The long-standing characterisation
                    of the legal obligation of an aggrieved party to act reasonably to mitigate its
                    loss as a “duty” is now too entrenched in legal discourse to be
                    dropped. Subject to the clarification which we have just made, therefore, we
                    will employ the terms “the duty to mitigate” and “the
                    principle of mitigation” interchangeably in this judgment to denote this
                    legal obligation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The basic rules relating to mitigation are
                    well settled. First, the aggrieved party must take all reasonable steps to
                    mitigate the loss consequent on the defaulting party’s breach, and cannot
                    recover damages for any loss which it could have avoided but failed to avoid due
                    to its own unreasonable action or inaction (see Harvey McGregor, <em>McGregor on Damages</em> (Thomson Reuters (Legal) Limited,
                    18th Ed, 2009) at para 7-004 and <em>British
                        Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company, Limited v Underground
                        Electric Railways Company of London, Limited</em> [1912] AC 673
                        (“<em>British Westinghouse
                    Electric</em>”) at 689). Second, the aggrieved party who goes
                    beyond what the law requires of it and avoids incurring any loss at all will not
                    be entitled to recover any damages (see <em>McGregor on
                        Damages</em> at para 7-097 and <em>British
                        Westinghouse Electric</em> at 689–690). In such a case, the
                    aggrieved party’s efforts will in effect confer a gratuitous benefit on
                    the defaulting party. Third, the aggrieved party may recover any expenses
                    incurred in the course of taking reasonable steps to mitigate its loss (see
                        <em>McGregor on Damages</em> at para 7-091). In
                    short, the aggrieved party cannot recover avoidable or avoided loss; it may,
                    however, recover expenses reasonably incurred in the course of taking mitigation
                    measures. The evaluation of the aggrieved party’s conduct in mitigation
                    ought to start from the date of the defaulting party’s breach, and the
                    burden of proving that the aggrieved party has failed to fulfil its duty to
                    mitigate falls on the defaulting party (see <em>McGregor on
                        Damages</em> at para 7-019 and <em>Garnac Grain
                        Company Incorporated v H M F Faure &amp; Fairclough Ltd and
                        Others</em> [1968] AC 1130 at 1140). This burden is ordinarily one
                    which is not easily discharged.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The above-mentioned general rules have evolved
                    over the last two centuries without any coherent overarching legal framework. No
                    clear distinction has been drawn in applying these rules to the incapable, the
                    unwilling and (in some cases even) the cynical defaulting party. Many of the
                    early authorities that led to the crystallisation of these rules featured
                    findings made by juries. These findings were neither judicially explained nor
                    capable of being justified by legal reasoning. One can therefore readily
                    understand why Prof Michael G Bridge
                    (“Prof Bridge”) described the principle of mitigation in a
                    tone of despair as being “to a surprising degree theoretically
                    undernourished and underwritten, and subject to hardly any critical examination
                    in the leading texts” (see Michael G Bridge, “Mitigation of
                    Damages in Contract and The Meaning of Avoidable Loss” (1989)
                    105 LQR 398 (“Prof Bridge’s article”) at
                    p 399).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In Prof Bridge’s article, various
                    theoretical justifications which have been advanced in support of the principle
                    of mitigation are examined. Of these various rationales (which include factual
                    causation, remoteness of damage, contributory negligence, promises and
                    expectations and self-help), what we shall call “the ‘economic
                    efficiency’ theory” is the most attractive and most popular school
                    of thought. This theory suggests that the duty to mitigate seeks to encourage
                    economic efficiency by discouraging waste. It rests on the premise that no legal
                    system should sanction economic waste by allowing an aggrieved party to
                    accumulate loss arising from the defaulting party’s breach of contract
                    when it was within the aggrieved party’s power to curb such loss. While
                    this approach is <em>prima facie</em> attractive, it is, in
                    our view, not entirely convincing for two reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     First, it is simply not possible to explain
                    certain aspects of the principle of mitigation by reference to the
                    “economic efficiency” theory alone. As Prof Bridge astutely
                    pointed out, “adverse market movement, to the profit of some actors and
                    to the correlative disadvantage of others, is not in itself [economically]
                    wasteful” (see Prof Bridge’s article at p 405). If the
                    principle of mitigation were justifiable solely by the importance of avoiding or
                    minimising economic waste, then, in a case where the defaulting party’s
                    breach of contract consists of a failure to supply or deliver goods, the
                    aggrieved party ought not to be penalised for its lack of agility in entering a
                    falling market to purchase replacement goods in order to mitigate its loss. The
                    reality, however, is that, where the aggrieved party’s delay in entering a
                    falling market in such a scenario is unreasonable, the principle of mitigation
                    does operate to penalise the aggrieved party even though its delay has caused no
                    loss in the literal sense of the word (see <em>Patel and Another
                        v Hooper &amp; Jackson (a firm)</em> [1999] 1 WLR
                1792).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The second reason why we are unconvinced by
                    the “economic efficiency” theory is that, if the law on mitigation
                    were indeed solely underpinned by concerns about economic efficiency, then an
                    aggrieved party whose attempts at mitigation generate even greater loss than the
                    loss which would have arisen had it done nothing at all should not be allowed to
                    recover the additional loss. Yet, the prevailing legal position is that, subject
                    to the reasonableness of the actions of the aggrieved party and the
                    foreseeability of its additional loss, recovery of such additional loss is
                    allowed (see the <em>dicta</em> of Browne-Wilkinson LJ
                    in <em>Gebruder Metelmann GmbH &amp; Co KG v NBR (London)
                        Ltd</em> [1984] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 614 at 633; see also
                        <em>The “Sivand”</em> [1998]
                    2 Lloyd’s Rep 97).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Prof Bridge concluded, after analysing
                    all the relevant authorities, that “[n]o single [factor] sufficiently
                    explains the requirement of mitigation as a general rule” (see
                    Prof Bridge’s article at p 410). Instead, it would be more
                    accurate to see the principle of mitigation as the product of a complex amalgam
                    of competing sensibilities – one that reflects “several impulses
                    that mollify the strictness of contractual obligation and that are hard, perhaps
                    impossible, to rationalise in their totality” (see
                    Prof Bridge’s article at pp 407–408). We
                agree.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     We should at the same time point out that the
                    complexity involved in identifying a single theoretical justification for the
                    principle of mitigation belies the singular practical focus of the central
                    inquiry which lies at the heart of this principle – namely, the inquiry
                    into whether or not the aggrieved party acted reasonably to mitigate its loss
                    (“the reasonableness inquiry”). Reasonableness forms the one
                    identifiable foundation on which this inquiry – and, in turn, the
                    principle of mitigation – rests. The central question which underpins the
                    reasonableness inquiry is what a reasonable and prudent man in the trade would
                    have done in the ordinary course of his business if he had been in the aggrieved
                    party’s shoes (<em>per</em> James LJ in
                        <em>Dunkirk Colliery Company v Lever</em> (1878)
                    9 Ch D 20 at 25). Naturally, any answer to the question “What
                    would the reasonable businessman have done?” can, will and may reflect a
                    wide range of values and concerns, some of which may compete with and/or
                    contradict others. For instance, while the principle of mitigation does not
                    require an aggrieved party to nurse the defaulting party’s interests at
                    the expense of its own interests (see <em>Harlow &amp; Jones, Ltd
                        v Panex (International), Ltd</em> [1967] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 509
                    at 530 <em>per</em> Roskill J), it has also long been
                    said that the aggrieved party must act with both the defaulting party’s
                    interests as well as its own interests in mind (see <em>Smailes
                        and Son v Hans Dessen and Co</em> (1906) 94 LT 492 at 493
                        <em>per</em> Channell J).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The existence of the duty to mitigate may also
                    appear to be an unfair obligation to impose on the aggrieved party as it is the
                    innocent party in relation to a breach of contract (in that the defaulting party
                    is to blame for the breach of contract). To minimise any potential unfairness to
                    the aggrieved party in this regard, the courts have sought to ensure that the
                    standard of reasonableness required of the aggrieved party will not be too
                    difficult to meet (see, <em>eg</em>, <em>OCBC Securities Pte Ltd v Phang Yul Cher Yeow and another action</em>
                    [1997] 3 SLR(R) 906 at [86]). For instance, the aggrieved party is not
                    required to act in a way which exposes it to financial or moral hazard, such as
                    taking steps which might jeopardise its commercial reputation or partaking in
                    hazardous litigation against a third party to reduce its loss (see <em>Goode on Commercial Law</em> (Ewan McKendrick ed)
                    (LexisNexis, 4th Ed, 2009) at p 136 as well as <em>McGregor on Damages</em> at paras 7-081 and 7-087). The
                    requisite standard of reasonableness is said to be an objective one; yet, it
                    clearly also takes into account subjective circumstances such as the aggrieved
                    party’s financial position (see below at <a href="#p1_58">[58]</a>). The reasonableness inquiry, therefore, falls short of
                    being purely objective.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The many sub-rules, qualifications and nuances
                    that have built up around the reasonableness inquiry may not infrequently appear
                    to be confusing and unwieldy. Nevertheless, when one takes a step back to look
                    at the object of this inquiry as a whole, it becomes clear that the inquiry
                    amounts to nothing more than the common law’s attempt to reflect <em>commercial and fact-sensitive fairness</em> at the remedial
                    stage of a legal inquiry into the extent of liability on the defaulting
                    party’s part. The concept of reasonableness in the context of mitigation
                    is a flexible one. In essence, it bars an aggrieved party from profiting or
                    behaving unreasonably at the expense of the defaulting party, and encapsulates
                    complex interplaying notions of responsibility and fairness. As with any
                    principle of law that encapsulates notions of fairness, the principle of
                    mitigation confers on the courts considerable discretion in evaluating the facts
                    of the case at hand in order to arrive at a commercially just determination. The
                    principle embodies a fact-centric flexibility which, whilst remaining in harmony
                    with sound business practice, stands in vivid contrast to the strictness with
                    which rules in other areas of contract law are applied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Turning specifically to the situation where a
                    contract for the carriage of goods by sea is breached due to the
                    shipowner’s failure to provide the charterer with the promised vessel, the
                    usual mitigation measures involve the charterer (which is the aggrieved party in
                    this scenario) either engaging an alternative vessel to carry the same goods or
                    obtaining substitute goods at the intended place of delivery. The charterer need
                    only act reasonably in deciding which of these alternative measures to adopt. It
                    will usually, however, be bound to adopt the least costly option (see <em>McGregor on Damages</em> at para 27-049). Ordinarily
                    speaking, if a substitute vessel is available on reasonable terms, the charterer
                    ought to mitigate its loss by engaging that vessel (see the <em>dicta</em> of Moore-Bick J in <em>Fyffes Group
                        Ltd and Caribbean Gold Ltd v Reefer Express Lines Pty Ltd and Reefkrit
                        Shipping Inc (The “Kriti Rex”)</em> [1996]
                    2 Lloyd’s Rep 171 at 193). If the charterer cannot get a ship of the
                    same size as that which it originally chartered, it is entitled to take the next
                    best reasonable option that is available, which may include chartering a larger
                    vessel if a failure to do so will cause greater loss to the defaulting party
                    (see Raoul Colinvaux, <em>Carver’s Carriage by
                        Sea</em> (Stevens &amp; Sons, 13th Ed, 1982) at vol 2,
                    para 2178). In this regard, it should be noted that <em>Carver’s Carriage by Sea</em> cautions at the same time (at
                    vol 2, para 2142) that the charterer must not act in “an
                    imprudent or extravagant manner”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The reasonableness inquiry, therefore, is very
                    much a factual one (see Andrew Phang Boon Leong, <em>Cheshire,
                        Fifoot and Furmston’s Law of Contract: Second Singapore and Malaysian
                        Edition</em> (Butterworths Asia, 1998) at p 1029). For this
                    reason, case precedents are of limited guidance as they are specific to their
                    particular factual matrices. Indeed, the dispute in this case essentially boils
                    down to the proper application of the settled principles outlined above to the
                    facts. Ultimately, the questions that need to be asked (and determined)
                    are:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether – having regard to the
                        potential damages which the respondent would have to pay Agrima if, as a
                        result of the appellant’s default, it failed to deliver the palm oil
                        due under the Agrima contracts – it was reasonable of the respondent
                        to persist in seeking ever lower rates of freight for the <em>Puma</em> when chartering that vessel on the terms offered by her
                        owners would have allowed the respondent to both mitigate its own loss as
                        well as reduce the damages payable by the appellant; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_b"></a>(b)     whether the reasons that caused the
                        respondent to reject the terms offered for the charter of the <em>Puma</em> could justify the Judge’s decision to
                        increase the damages claimable by the respondent from the
                    appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The basis for the Judge’s decision </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The Judge gave several reasons why she found
                    the respondent’s failure to charter the <em>Puma</em>
                    reasonable. These included the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_a"></a>(a)     Negotiating over the cost of hire
                        was not <em>per se</em> an unreasonable act, and the AR
                        erred in holding that the respondent was merely trying to maximise the
                        profits which could be made from chartering the <em>Puma</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_b"></a>(b)     It was prudent of the respondent to avoid conveying information of
                        the <em>Asia Star</em>’s rejection to Agrima and
                        the Suppliers until a viable alternative vessel had been
                    found.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_c"></a>(c)     It was not
                        clear that both Indomas and Agrima would not have cancelled their respective
                        contracts with the respondent (and would instead have agreed to further
                        extensions of the relevant deadlines) if they had been informed of the
                            <em>Puma</em>’s
                availability.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The Judge’s most significant finding,
                    however, concerned the failure of the respondent to commit itself to the final
                    freight rate offered by the owners of the <em>Puma</em>.
                    The appellant, both before the AR and before the Judge, made much of the fact
                    that the negotiations between the respondent and the owners of the <em>Puma</em> appeared to have abruptly broken down solely over
                    the relatively paltry difference of just US$2.00 pmt in the proposed
                    freight rate. The Judge found the appellant’s arguments overly simplistic.
                    She pointed out that the difference between the amount payable for chartering
                    the <em>Puma</em> based on the respondent’s proposal
                    and the amount payable based on the proposal of the <em>Puma</em>’s owners was significant once two factors were taken
                    into account, namely: (a) the dead freight payable in respect of at least
                    14,500 mt of unutilised cargo space on board the <em>Puma</em> (due to her larger capacity), taking the difference between
                    the maximum cargo capacity of the <em>Puma</em> (which her
                    owners were willing to peg at 36,000mt) and the minimum quantity of cargo to be
                    carried on board the <em>Asia Star</em> (<em>viz</em>, 21,500mt of palm oil (see <a href="#p1_4">[4]</a> above)); and (b) the lump sum payments which the
                    respondent proposed to make (in place of rateable charges) for each additional
                    load port and each additional discharge port (see the Judge’s judgment at
                    [64]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The additional cost which the respondent would
                    have incurred if it had chartered the <em>Puma</em> was a
                    critical consideration for the Judge in two ways. First, she was of the view
                    that this factor justified her finding that the respondent’s conduct in
                    negotiating with the owners of the <em>Puma</em> in order
                    to reduce the quantum of the additional sum payable could not, without more,
                    amount to unreasonable conduct. Second, and more crucially, she regarded the
                    additional cost to the respondent as being substantial enough to make it
                    unreasonable to expect the respondent to incur that additional expenditure. It
                    would, according to the Judge, have amounted to requiring the respondent to risk
                    its money, which was not part and parcel of the obligation imposed by the
                    principle of mitigation on an aggrieved party.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The parties’ arguments on appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     On appeal, the respondent supported the
                    Judge’s reasoning by arguing that a defaulting party must take an
                    impecunious aggrieved party as it found the latter. It pointed to the oral
                    testimony of its head of chartering/operations, Mr Sheik Abdul Malik
                    Mohamed Kassim (“Mr Malik”), to support its contention that
                    the additional payment of US$399,500 which it would have had to make had it
                    hired the <em>Puma</em> did amount, both objectively and
                    subjectively, to a big drain on its resources.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The appellant, on its part, criticised the
                    Judge’s reasoning and argued that a reasonable person in the
                    respondent’s shoes would have chartered the <em>Puma</em> (or would at least have arranged to charter it on a
                    “subject to” basis) for the following reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_a"></a>(a)     The failure by the respondent to
                        deliver the promised 21,500mt of palm oil to Agrima and to take delivery of
                        the 24,500mt of palm oil purchased from the Suppliers could have exposed it
                        to potentially large (or “ruinous” (see [38] of the AR’s
                        judgment)) claims from the respective parties concerned.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_b"></a>(b)     The cost of hiring the <em>Puma</em> as a replacement vessel was neither objectively
                        prohibitive nor a large drain on the respondent’s
                    resources.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_c"></a>(c)     The
                        potential additional expenses that would have been incurred by the
                        respondent if it had chartered the <em>Puma</em> (which
                        would have worked out to US$399,500 at most) were not nearly as prohibitive
                        as the potential loss which the respondent would have faced if it had failed
                        to deliver the Cargo (the potential loss worked out in the end to over
                        US$1m).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_d"></a>(d)     The
                        issue of having to pay dead freight if the <em>Puma</em> were chartered was not an obstacle in reality as the
                        real reason for the respondent’s reluctance to accept the terms
                        proposed by the owners of the <em>Puma</em> was the
                        respondent’s desire to earn a larger profit by driving the freight
                        rate down.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The appellant submitted that, while it was not
                    unreasonable of the respondent to have negotiated with the owners of the
                        <em>Puma</em> for a better freight rate, it <em>was</em> unreasonable of the respondent to fail to continue
                    those negotiations when it knew that it was unlikely to find another ship and
                    would be exposed to even greater loss if it failed to deliver the Cargo. The
                    appellant also argued that the Judge erred in substituting her own judgment for
                    the AR’s finding that it was unreasonable of the respondent to have failed
                    to notify Agrima and the Suppliers of the availability of the <em>Puma</em> and to have failed to ask for further extensions of time.
                    The Judge, it was submitted, should have respected the AR’s decision as it
                    was made with the AR having had the benefit of seeing and hearing the witnesses
                    in person as they gave evidence in court. Consequently, the appellant contended,
                    the failure by the respondent to act reasonably to mitigate its loss meant that
                    the damages which it could recover should be limited to the additional cost
                    which it would have incurred if it had chartered the <em>Puma</em> as reasonably required. This additional sum would amount to
                    US$399,500 at most. The appellant submitted alternatively that, if dead freight
                    were left out of the equation (as it suggested), the respondent would not incur
                    any additional cost at all in chartering the <em>Puma</em>
                    as a replacement vessel as the freight rate for the <em>Puma</em> was actually lower than that for the <em>Asia Star</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the respondent acted reasonably to mitigate its
                loss</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Overview</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     We accept the Judge’s ruling that the
                    mere act of negotiating for a more advantageous deal cannot in itself be
                    regarded as unreasonable. The duty to mitigate requires the respondent to do
                    what is reasonable in the ordinary course of business and, in the present case,
                    no reasonable or prudent businessman would undertake to charter a replacement
                    ship without attempting to reduce the cost of doing so. In our view, the lack of
                    other available replacement vessels at the material time (apart from the
                        <em>Puma</em>) only affected the respondent’s
                    bargaining power and the likelihood of the negotiations between the respondent
                    and the <em>Puma</em>’s owners concluding on terms
                    favourable to the former. In other words, the reasonableness or otherwise of the
                    act of negotiating <em>per se</em> cannot be called into
                    question in the present case. The issue of reasonableness does not, therefore,
                    turn on the respondent’s conduct in negotiating with the <em>Puma’s</em> owners; it turns instead on the question of
                    whether the sum of US$399,500 which the respondent would have had to pay if it
                    had chartered the <em>Puma</em> was really, proportionately
                    speaking, so large an additional upfront cost as to ultimately warrant the
                    respondent’s decision <em>not</em> to charter that
                    vessel – even on a provisional “subject to contract” basis.
                    We should add that, in our view, the Judge was correct in determining that the
                    Charterparty terminated on the evening of 19 January 2004 and that the duty
                    to mitigate arose the next day (see the Judge’s judgment at
                [57]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The appropriate level of judicial scrutiny in assessing whether an
                aggrieved party’s conduct in mitigation was reasonable</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     At the outset, the respondent contended that
                    this court should not evaluate the reasonableness or otherwise of its (the
                    respondent’s) conduct in mitigation by combining the unsympathetic vision
                    of hindsight with the use of a fine-toothed legal comb. Ultimately, the
                    respondent’s contentions on this issue boiled down to a single
                    proposition, namely: the court should not subject the mitigation actions taken
                    by an aggrieved party to a minute-by-minute, day-by-day scrutiny with the
                    benefit of hindsight, which form of scrutiny would benefit the defaulting
                    party.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     There is certainly support for the view that
                    the court should adopt a generous approach in assessing the aggrieved
                    party’s conduct in mitigation. The respondent relied in particular upon
                    Lord Macmillan’s oft-cited observations in <em>Banco
                        de Portugal v Waterlow and Sons, Limited</em> [1932] AC 452
                        (“<em>Banco de Portugal</em>”) at 506 as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where the sufferer from a breach of contract finds himself in consequence
                        of that breach placed in a position of embarrassment[,] the measures which
                        he may be driven to adopt in order to extricate himself ought not to be
                        weighed in nice scales at the instance of the party whose breach of contract
                        has occasioned the difficulty. It is often easy after an emergency has
                        passed to criticize the steps which have been taken to meet it, but
                            <em>such criticism does not come well from those who have
                            themselves created the emergency. The law is satisfied if the party
                            placed in a difficult situation by reason of the breach of a duty owed
                            to him has acted reasonably in the adoption of remedial measures, and he
                            will not be held [to be] disentitled to recover the cost of such
                            measures merely because the party in breach can suggest that other
                            measures less burdensome to him might have been taken</em>.
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In a similar vein, the High Court in <em>Jia Min
                        Building Construction Pte Ltd v Ann Lee Pte Ltd</em> [2004]
                    3 SLR(R) 288 (“<em>Jia Min Building
                        Construction</em>”) noted at [73] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Mitigation is neither an exact science nor a mathematical exercise. It
                        must be viewed through a commercial lens and measured by commercial common
                        sense. The court will not audit every decision made in the turmoil of a
                        difficult and fluid commercial situation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     While we certainly agree with the foregoing
                    observations, we must also emphasise that they must be understood in their
                    proper context. In <em>Banco de Portugal</em>, the
                    aggrieved party had in fact taken <em>some</em> action to
                    mitigate the situation which it found itself in, <em>viz</em>, it had withdrawn the entire series of compromised notes and
                    had undertaken to exchange all such notes which were presented to it within a
                    limited time. Lord Macmillan’s comments (at 506) were made in
                    response to the defaulting party’s invitation to the court to find that
                    the aggrieved party should have taken some <em>other</em>
                    action which would have reduced its loss even further. There were good reasons
                    for Lord Macmillan to caution that the court should not adopt too stringent
                    a standard in enforcing the duty to mitigate <em>vis-à-vis</em> an aggrieved party – the court is not, after
                    all, the best-equipped arbiter of economic efficiency and the options available
                    to the aggrieved party at the material time. Thus, in cases such as <em>Banco de Portugal</em>, the correct approach for the court to
                    take would be to refrain from engaging in an exacting scrutiny of the aggrieved
                    party’s every act and/or omission. In this regard, it is important to bear
                    in mind that the question which the principle of mitigation requires the court
                    to determine is whether the mitigation measures taken by the aggrieved party
                    were reasonable, and not whether the aggrieved party took the best possible
                    measures to reduce its loss.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Having said that, we are of the view that
                    Lord Macmillan’s observations (at 506 of <em>Banco de
                        Portugal</em>) apply less strongly in a case where the aggrieved party
                    rejected a reasonable opportunity to reduce its own loss. In other words, while
                    it may be a general principle of the law on mitigation that the court will not
                    nicely weigh on sensitive scales the measures taken by an aggrieved party to
                    mitigate its loss, this principle will ordinarily apply more strongly in cases
                    where the question before the court is whether the aggrieved party engaged in
                    unreasonable <em>action</em> as opposed to unreasonable
                        <em>inaction</em>. Once the defaulting party
                    establishes that the aggrieved party had reasonable options before it, greater
                    justification will usually be needed from the aggrieved party which, despite
                    knowing that it must act reasonably to mitigate its loss, does nothing at all.
                    After all, the duty to mitigate encapsulates a policy consideration of the law
                    that, once a civil wrong has occurred, the aggrieved party should be encouraged
                    to be self-reliant or proactive in attempting to reduce its loss, instead of
                    pinning all its loss on the defaulting party (see Andrew Burrows, <em>Remedies for Torts and Breach of Contract</em> (Oxford
                    University Press, 3rd Ed, 2004) at p 122). Doing nothing at all will
                    only infrequently be the most efficient, the most reasonable or the least costly
                    option available to an aggrieved party. In the final analysis, both
                    Lord Macmillan’s comments in <em>Banco de
                        Portugal</em> and the High Court’s remarks in <em>Jia Min Building Construction</em> merely suggest that the standard
                    of reasonableness is to be applied in a practical and commonsensical way, with
                    particular sympathy for the aggrieved party. These cautionary remarks do no more
                    than colourfully reiterate what has already been factored into the subjective
                    element inherent in the reasonableness inquiry.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether it would have been reasonable for the respondent to pay an
                additional US$399,500 to charter the <span class="ToggleRoman" style="font-style:normal">Puma</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     We now return to the question posed at
                        <a href="#p1_41">[41]</a> above, namely: was the sum of
                    US$399,500 which the respondent would have had to pay if it had chartered the
                        <em>Puma</em> really so large an additional upfront
                    cost as to justify the respondent’s failure to charter that vessel? The
                    Judge clearly thought that this sum was objectively substantial enough to invoke
                    the rule that an aggrieved party “<em>need not risk [its]
                        money too far</em>” [emphasis in original] (see <em>McGregor on Damages</em> at para 7-078).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     It is, of course, axiomatic that the duty to
                    mitigate has its limits. It cannot oblige an aggrieved party to incur great
                    expense or put itself to great inconvenience in stemming the loss resulting from
                    the defaulting party’s breach. Thus, in <em>Lesters Leather
                        &amp; Skin Company, Ltd v Home &amp; Overseas Brokers, Ltd</em> (1948)
                    82 Ll L Rep 202 at 205, Lord Goddard CJ observed that, where
                    a contract for the sale of goods was breached by the seller failing to deliver
                    the promised goods, the prospective purchaser was not:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… bound to go hunting [all over] the globe to find out where he can
                        get [replacement goods] and then have them shipped, months after the
                        contract time, so that they will arrive [at their intended destination] many
                        months after the date [on] which, had they been shipped in accordance with
                        the contract, they would have arrived.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In this regard, it is important to bear in mind that it is always a
                    question of fact as to what amounts to too great an expense for the aggrieved
                    party to incur or too great a risk of its money.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     We note that the Judge found the Canadian case
                    of <em>Elizabeth Jean Costello and Mary Ann Dickhoff v The City
                        of Calgary</em> (1995) 163 AR 241 (“<em>Costello v Calgary (No 1)</em>”) particularly instructive
                    and made a lengthy reference to it (see [71]–[72] of the Judge’s
                    judgment). In <em>Costello v Calgary (No 1)</em>, the
                    plaintiffs applied for permission to build a 40-room motel on their land (known
                    as “Ranch Site”), but any possible development was frozen as a
                    result of the defendant city authority’s wrongful expropriation of the
                    land. After the expropriation of Ranch Site was ruled to be illegal by the
                    Supreme Court of Canada, the plaintiffs sued the defendant for damages for
                    trespass. The defendant argued that the damages should be reduced to reflect the
                    failure by the plaintiffs to mitigate their loss by acquiring or developing a
                    similar motel on a different parcel of land. The Judge set out the ruling of the
                    Alberta Court of Queen’s Bench on this argument as follows (see [71] of
                    the Judge’s judgment, quoting from <em>Costello v Calgary
                        (No 1)</em> at 285–286):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The court made the following observations in relation to the
                        [plaintiffs’] duty to mitigate:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">… the evidence also established that the [plaintiffs] had
                            sufficient credit capability to make such a purchase [<em>ie</em>, to purchase another plot of land as a replacement
                            for Ranch Site] had they so wished. However, the point is that the
                            argument of the [defendant] must be rejected because it has failed to
                            establish that other comparable property was available at [the]
                            equivalent compensation [which] the [defendant] was offering, and the
                            law is clear that the plaintiffs need not incur unreasonable expenses to
                            mitigate a loss caused by the [d]efendant. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     We pause to note that the Judge felt that the
                    present case was (see [72] of the Judge’s judgment):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… similar to <em>Costello v Calgary
                            [(No 1)]</em> in the sense that the expenditure required to
                        avoid the loss was a substantial amount and it would have been unreasonable
                        to require the [respondent] to undertake it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Curiously, this observation was made despite the fact that the
                    plaintiffs in <em>Costello v Calgary (No 1)</em>
                    could, on the facts of that case, have afforded to purchase an alternative plot
                    of land –
                    <em>ie</em>, in <em>Costello v Calgary
                        (No 1)</em>, there was no issue of the aggrieved party being
                    impecunious or being unable to afford the cost of adopting the particular
                    mitigation measure which, according to the defaulting party, should have been
                    taken.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Having carefully read the above extract from
                        <em>Costello v Calgary (No 1)</em> at
                    285–286 which was cited in the Judge’s judgment at [71], we find
                    that we are unable to derive any guidance from it. The Judge cited only a
                    portion of what Rooke J said at 285–286 of <em>Costello v Calgary (No 1)</em>. The following is a more complete
                    version of what Rooke J held (see <em>Costello v Calgary
                        (No 1)</em> at 285–286):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[T]here is a further reason for rejecting this argument [that
                        the plaintiffs should have mitigated their loss by purchasing a replacement
                        property]. Even if there had been such a duty (and I have found in law there
                        was not), the evidence does not support the [defendant’s] argument.
                        The evidence of the [plaintiffs], which I accept as fact, is that they were
                        unable to acquire a comparable property for the value that the [defendant]
                        was offering at the time of the purported expropriation. … As at the
                        time of the purported expropriation (November 20, 1972), [the
                        defendant’s expert appraiser] could point … to no comparable
                        property on MacLeod Trail [where Ranch Site was located] as low as the
                        [defendant’s] offered value. … I note that, in [<em>Marsan v Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Co</em> (1912)
                        1 DLR 850], the plaintiff endeavoured to secure other suitable
                        property, but was unable to do so, and the court held (headnote and at
                        695):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">“If other suitable premises were in fact available for [the
                            plaintiff] for his purpose I think it was incumbent upon the defendant
                            to show that these could have been secured without unreasonable expense
                            and trouble.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Here the evidence, which I accept, is to the contrary, namely that the
                        [plaintiffs] could not acquire other comparable property at the price the
                        [defendant] was offering for … Ranch Site, and the [d]efendant
                        … has not met the onus placed upon it – indeed, even at trial
                        it could not identify one such truly comparable property, and only one at
                        any location in Calgary. Furthermore, while it was under no statutory duty
                        to do so under the then existing [expropriation legislation], it is relevant
                        to note that at no time did the [defendant] tender any compensation to
                        assist in that purpose …
                        <em>although the evidence also established that the
                            [plaintiffs] had sufficient credit capability to make such a purchase
                            had they so wished. However, the point is that the argument of the
                            [defendant] must be rejected because it has failed to establish that
                            other comparable property was available at [the] equivalent compensation
                            [which] the [defendant] was offering, and the law is clear … that
                            the plaintiffs need not incur unreasonable expenses to mitigate a loss
                            caused by the [d]efendant</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     It appears to us that, in <em>Costello v Calgary (No 1)</em>, the argument that the plaintiffs
                    were not obliged to incur unreasonable expenses in mitigating their loss was
                    never applied to the facts of that case and was, on the face of what
                    Rooke J said at 285–286, added merely for completeness. The <em>dicta</em> cited from <em>Costello v Calgary
                        (No 1)</em> are not, in the ultimate analysis, really helpful
                    here. In the present case, there was an alternative ship available for charter
                        (<em>viz</em>, the <em>Puma</em>),
                    and the only issue was whether it was reasonable to expect the respondent to pay
                    upfront the additional US$399,500 needed to charter that replacement
                    vessel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     There is also a second dimension to
                    Rooke J’s analysis in <em>Costello v Calgary
                        (No 1)</em>. In a passage preceding the extract reproduced at
                        <a href="#p1_50">[50]</a> above, Rooke J emphatically
                    stated that the plaintiffs were not required in law to seek an alternative
                    property (see <em>Costello v Calgary (No 1)</em> at
                    285). Land is regarded as physically and commercially unique. It is not easily
                    replaced with another plot of land or with money <em>per
                        se</em> – a fact recognised by the courts through (<em>inter alia</em>) the remedy of specific performance of
                    contracts relating to land (see, <em>eg</em>, <em>Hexter v Pearce</em> [1900] 1 Ch 341 at 346 and
                        <em>Rudd v Lascelles</em> [1900] 1 Ch 815 at 819).
                    Thus, in <em>Costello v Calgary (No 1)</em>,
                    Rooke J was rightly sceptical of the defendant’s submissions that the
                    plaintiffs should have mitigated their loss by simply acquiring <em>some other</em> plot of land. His statement that an aggrieved
                    party should not be put to “unreasonable expenses” (see <em>Costello v Calgary (No 1)</em> at 286) should be read in
                    that light: almost any expense to replace something which is irreplaceable or
                    extremely difficult to replace (such as land) would be unreasonable. Cases
                    concerning carriage of goods by sea are, however, quite different from cases
                    concerning land. Ships may differ in terms of suitability and availability for
                    use, but they are generally not unique objects. The expenses incurred in hiring
                    a substitute vessel, therefore, can hardly be described as unreasonable by
                    reference to the arguments which apply in cases concerning land.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     We observe further that <em>Costello v Calgary (No 1)</em> was a decision of the Alberta
                    Court of Queen’s Bench. There was, in fact, a subsequent decision by the
                    Alberta Court of Appeal which the Judge did not consider, <em>viz</em>, <em>Costello et al v City of
                        Calgary</em> (1997) 152 DLR (4th) 453 (“<em>Costello v Calgary (No 2)</em>”). Picard JA, in
                    delivering the judgment of the Alberta Court of Appeal, employed a rather more
                    sophisticated analysis in rejecting the defendant’s submission that the
                    plaintiffs should have mitigated their loss by purchasing an alternative plot of
                    land as a replacement for Ranch Site. He reasoned at 482:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is important to appreciate the significance of those figures [<em>ie</em>, the figures indicating the estimated market
                        value of Ranch Site at the material time]. As noted above, the duty to
                        mitigate essentially is an obligation to act reasonably in the
                        circumstances. During the period in question (1972–1983), the
                        [plaintiffs] received appraisals as high as $226,570 and as low as $112,410
                        [for Ranch Site]. They also knew that the [defendant] offered to pay only
                        $74,000 as a purchase price or $91,700 as compensation for an expropriation.
                        Moreover, while the [plaintiffs] suspected the invalidity of the purported
                        expropriation by February of 1976, the issue by no means was clear. Indeed,
                        while their argument eventually found favour with the Supreme Court of
                        Canada in January of 1983 …, the Court of Queen’s Bench
                        … and the Court of Appeal … both had held for the
                        [defendant].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As viewed at the time in question, then, it was entirely possible that the
                        [defendant] was correct and that the [plaintiffs] eventually would receive
                        something in the order of $91,700 as compensation for the purported taking.
                        Certainly, that was the [defendant’s] position prior to the Supreme
                        Court of Canada’s decision. And yet, during oral argument in this
                        appeal, counsel for the [defendant] suggested that it would have been
                        reasonable for the [plaintiffs] to spend as much as $375,000 in mitigation
                        of their losses. …
                        <em>[I]t would have been extremely speculative for the
                            [plaintiffs] to have spent $375,000 when there was a very real
                            possibility that they ultimately would recover from the [defendant] less
                            than a third of that amount</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Picard JA made it clear that hindsight
                    should play no part in the evaluation of the plaintiffs’ conduct. He
                    reasoned that, as a matter of commercial common sense, the court ought to look
                    at the difference between the amount which the plaintiffs would have had to
                    expend in mitigation and the amount which they could, at the material time, have
                    expected to be able to recover. Having compared the two figures, which indicated
                    that the amount which the plaintiffs would have had to spend in mitigation was
                    nearly three times the amount which they could have expected to receive as
                    compensation, Picard JA held that it would have been “extremely
                    speculative” (see <em>Costello v Calgary
                        (No 2)</em> at 482) for the plaintiffs to have risked such a
                    large sum of money.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Returning to the facts before us, the issue to
                    be addressed is this: was the sum of US$399,500 too great an expense to
                    reasonably expect the respondent to incur upfront in order to mitigate the loss
                    flowing from the appellant’s breach of the Charterparty? The Judge
                    certainly felt that a global sum of nearly US$0.5m was too much for the
                    respondent to pay for a replacement ship. She found some support for this
                    conclusion in the testimony of Mr Malik, who stated during
                    cross-examination that the additional expenditure of US$399,500 was “too
                        huge”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> and would amount to a “big
                        drain”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> on the respondent’s
                    finances. It should be noted that this was a bare assertion by Mr Malik and
                    was, furthermore, made for the first time only in the course of
                    cross-examination.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     In our view, the sum of US$399,500 must be
                    assessed in its proper objective context. The Agrima contracts had a total value
                    of US$11,691,300, while the purchase contracts had a combined value of
                    US$10,137,500. Based on a rough calculation of the difference between these two
                    figures, the respondent would have expected to make a profit of approximately
                    US$1,553,800 from the prospective sale of palm oil to Agrima. Rather than being
                    similar to <em>Costello v Calgary (No 1)</em>, the
                    facts of this case appear to be quite the opposite. In <em>Costello v Calgary (No 1)</em>, the expense to which the
                    plaintiffs would have been put had they bought an alternative piece of land as a
                    mitigation measure was nearly three times the amount which they could, at the
                    material time, have realistically expected to have recovered as compensation for
                    their loss. In contrast, in the present case, the potential expected loss
                    – even if it is viewed from the respondent’s perspective at the time
                    of the appellant’s breach – would have been far greater than the
                    additional outlay required of the respondent if it had chartered the <em>Puma</em> as a mitigation measure. Indeed, the
                    respondent’s various heads of claim at the assessment of damages before
                    the AR amounted to nearly US$2m (see <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a>
                    above) – in comparison, the additional cost which the respondent would
                    have incurred had it hired the <em>Puma</em> was less than
                    a third of that sum. For this reason, the additional sum of US$399,500 would
                    not, proportionately speaking, have been too great an outlay to expect the
                    respondent to incur, considering the “potentially ruinous damages”
                    (see the AR’s judgment at [38]) which it faced if it did nothing. After
                    taking into account the prevailing circumstances, we are not at all convinced
                    that the respondent was ever seriously concerned that expending an additional
                    US$399,500 would put a severe strain on its financial resources (<em>contra</em> the Judge’s view at [67] of the
                    Judge’s judgment).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The alleged impecuniosity of the respondent</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Our conclusion in the preceding paragraph also
                    disposes of what we will refer to as “the respondent’s
                    impecuniosity argument” –
                    <em>viz</em>, the argument that spending an additional
                    US$399,500 to charter the <em>Puma</em> would have been a
                    huge drain on the respondent’s resources. This was an entirely new
                    argument which counsel for the respondent raised before this court in support of
                    the Judge’s decision. It appears to us that it may have been the
                    Judge’s reliance on Mr Malik’s assertion that the additional
                    sum of US$399,500 would have been a “big drain”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>
                    on the respondent’s resources (see <a href="#p1_55">[55]</a> above) which encouraged counsel for the respondent to
                    pursue this new argument on appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     The respondent’s impecuniosity argument
                    is based on the principle set out in para 7-088 of <em>McGregor on Damages</em> that “<em>[an
                        aggrieved party] will not be prejudiced by [its] financial inability to take
                        steps in mitigation</em>” [emphasis in original]. This
                    principle appears to be a corollary of the eggshell-skull rule that the
                    defaulting party must take the aggrieved party as it finds the latter. If the
                    position of the aggrieved party is aggravated because it lacks the means to
                    mitigate the loss suffered, the defaulting party nevertheless remains answerable
                    for the consequences flowing from its wrongful act (see <em>The
                        Clippens Oil Company, Limited v The Edinburgh and District Water
                        Trustees</em> [1907] AC 291 at 303). Applied in the context of a claim
                    for damages for breach of contract, this rule entails that, so long as the
                    aggrieved party acts reasonably to mitigate its loss, it will not be disbarred
                    from pursuing its claim for the actual loss suffered simply because it was
                    unable to take certain mitigation measures which it could otherwise have taken
                    had it had the requisite financial resources.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     In support of its contention that the
                    additional outlay of US$399,500 needed for the charter of the <em>Puma</em> would have put a severe strain on its financial resources,
                    the respondent relied entirely on Mr Malik’s <em>bare
                        assertion</em> as outlined at <a href="#p1_55">[55]</a>
                    above. Counsel for the respondent was keen to point out that
                    Mr Malik’s assertion was never directly challenged by the appellant.
                    It was also brought to our attention that the words “big
                        drain”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> were first used by
                    counsel for the appellant herself when she cross-examined Mr Malik; the
                    latter merely agreed to the use of those words to describe the additional
                    expenditure needed to charter the <em>Puma</em>. Relying,
                    in addition, on this court’s decision in <em>Ho Soo Fong
                        and another v Standard Chartered Bank</em> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 181,
                    counsel for the respondent argued that, since an aggrieved party was not obliged
                    to take measures which it could not afford or which were financially prohibitive
                    and onerous, the respondent’s refusal to charter the <em>Puma</em> as a replacement vessel at the freight rate quoted by her
                    owners was reasonable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     In our view, the respondent’s
                    impecuniosity argument is not supported by the facts before the court. The rule
                    referred to in <em>McGregor on Damages</em> at
                    para 7-088 (see above at <a href="#p1_58">[58]</a>) is meant
                    to protect an aggrieved party which is handicapped by financial <em>inability</em> from being compelled to take measures that
                    would be financially prohibitive. In the present case, there was no objective
                    evidence adduced by the respondent that the sum of US$399,500 <em>was</em> indeed financially prohibitive. If the respondent intended
                    to rely on such an assertion, it had to adduce concrete evidence to establish
                    that point – this, it did not do.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     In this regard, we should mention that the
                    appellant relied on the case of <em>Ho Pak Kim Realty Co Pte Ltd
                        v Revitech Pte Ltd</em> [2008] SGHC 230 as authority for the
                    proposition that a party which seeks to rely on its financial position bears the
                    burden of proving its own financial position. That case, we note, addressed the
                    specific question of what would constitute proof of impecuniosity where a
                    defendant applies for security for costs from a plaintiff company on the basis
                    that “there is reason to believe that the [plaintiff company] will be
                    unable to pay the costs of the defendant if successful in his defence”
                        (<em>per</em> s 388(1) of the Companies Act
                    (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     In our view, a more pertinent statute to refer
                    to would be the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed), which states as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-Heading1">
<b>Burden of proof as to
                            particular fact</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>105</b>.    The burden of proof
                            as to any particular fact lies on that person who wishes the court to
                            believe in its existence, unless it is provided by any law that the
                            proof of that fact shall lie on any particular person.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-Heading1">
<b>Burden of proving fact
                            especially within knowledge</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>108</b>.    When any fact is
                            especially within the knowledge of any person, the burden of proving
                            that fact is upon him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     In the present case, the respondent wished to
                    rely on the alleged fact that the additional US$399,500 which it would have had
                    to pay if it had chartered the <em>Puma</em> was a
                    financially prohibitive sum that it could not afford –
                    <em>ie</em>, it wanted the court to believe in the
                    existence of this fact (see s 105 of the Evidence Act). This fact was
                    “especially within the knowledge of [the respondent]” for the
                    purposes of s 108 of the Evidence Act since only the respondent could be
                    fully aware of all the relevant particulars of its own financial position at the
                    material time. Thus, in order to take advantage of the principle set out in
                    para 7-088 of <em>McGregor on Damages</em>, the
                    respondent must satisfactorily establish with cogent evidence that it <em>was</em> indeed unable to afford to spend an additional
                    US$399,500 at the material point in time. As we mentioned earlier (at <a href="#p1_60">[60]</a> above), the respondent failed to adduce such
                    evidence. <em>The only evidence raised by the respondent in its
                        favour (apropos its alleged impecuniosity) consisted of the bare assertion
                        of Mr Malik – which was an assertion made for the first time in
                        the heat of cross-examination</em>. The claim by the respondent that
                    the sum of US$399,500 amounted to a “big drain”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>
                    on its resources was never made prior to Mr Malik’s cross-examination
                    and no objective evidence was ever adduced to support it. The only
                    “proof” cited by the respondent was “negative proof”
                    in the form of the appellant’s failure to query further
                    Mr Malik’s testimony. Given these circumstances, such
                    “proof” is simply not a sufficient basis for this court to regard
                    the respondent’s alleged impecuniosity as having been
                proved.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     We should also point out that
                    Mr Malik’s testimony as to the respondent’s alleged
                    impecuniosity is particularly unconvincing in the light of two additional
                    factors. The first is that the respondent is a large company which has been in
                    the business of trading for some time, and currently trades in about 800,000mt
                    to 900,000mt of palm oil products a year (see <a href="#p1_3">[3]</a> above). While there is no evidence before the court of the
                    respondent’s profitability, some sense of this may be had from a rough
                    calculation of the respondent’s expected profit from the sale of palm oil
                    to Agrima under the Agrima contracts. That transaction alone would have resulted
                    in an expected profit of approximately US$1,553,800 (see <a href="#p1_56">[56]</a> above). It is hard to believe that a company
                    which trades in such large volumes and which expects such a large profit from a
                    single transaction would find paying the relatively small sum of US$399,500 a
                    particular hardship. Second, while the Judge was right to point out that the
                    freight rate set out in the respondent’s final counter-offer to the owners
                    of the <em>Puma</em> on 20 January 2004 (<em>ie</em>, the counter-offer made by the respondent at 5.32pm
                    on that day) was lower overall than the freight rate offered by the <em>Puma</em>’s owners, the total freight charges payable
                    for the <em>Puma</em> based on that counter-offer would
                    still have amounted to at least US$231,500 more than the freight charges payable
                    in respect of the <em>Asia Star</em>. <em>Given that the respondent was clearly willing to consider paying over
                        US$200,000 for an alternative vessel, it is difficult to see why increasing
                        that sum by just a further US$168,000 (taking the difference between
                        US$399,500 and US$231,500) would suddenly make the additional cost involved
                        in hiring the</em> Puma <em>onerous or, to
                        paraphrase</em> McGregor on Damages <em>at
                        para 7-078 (see</em><a href="#p1_46">[46]</a> <em>above), too far an amount to risk from the respondent’s
                        point of view</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The respondent’s alleged concerns about dead freight</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     We now turn to the issue of dead freight,
                    which was said to be another reason underlying the respondent’s decision
                    not to charter the <em>Puma</em> as a replacement vessel.
                    At [68] of the Judge’s judgment, the Judge elaborated on her reasons for
                    finding that the respondent acted reasonably in not accepting the last offer
                    made by the owners of the <em>Puma vis-à-vis</em> the
                    charter of the vessel as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It turned out that the [respondent] would have lost less had its chartered
                        the <em>Puma</em> and paid the dead freight on the
                        basis of the rates quoted by the [<em>Puma</em>’s] owners. This result cannot mean that the
                        [respondent] was unreasonable in putting forward a counteroffer. On
                        20 January 2004, the [respondent] knew that it was faced with a
                        substantial additional expenditure for the <em>Puma</em> but did not know what the reaction of [the Suppliers]
                        and [Agrima] would be. … If it had chartered the vessel [<em>ie</em>, the <em>Puma</em>], the
                        [respondent] would have been exposed to very substantial dead freight and
                        would have had to risk expense in buying additional cargo at spot prices in
                        the hope that it would be able to sell that cargo at its destination. Such a
                        sub-sale might not have made a profit for it because, as the
                        [appellant’s] expert on palm oil trade testified, back-to-back
                        buying/selling on the spot market usually did not give a trader any profit
                        margin due to the fact that [the palm oil market] was a very open market. In
                        order to make a profit, most companies would take a position in that they
                        would either buy in advance if they thought the market was going up or they
                        would sell in advance if they thought the market was going down. Spot
                        trading was not a desirable activity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     The above passage, when read alongside the
                    comments at [69]–[70] of the Judge’s judgment, creates the
                    impression that the respondent was, at the time of its negotiations with the
                    owners of the <em>Puma</em>, concerned about the problems
                    posed by dead freight. This, however, is not borne out by the facts. The Judge
                    also entered into a detailed analysis (see [64] of the Judge’s judgment)
                    of the difference between the last offer made by the <em>Puma</em>’s owners (<em>ie</em>, the offer
                    made at 5.06pm on 20 January 2004) and the last counter-offer made by the
                    respondent (<em>ie</em>, the counter-offer made at 5.32pm
                    on the same day). The effect of this was to magnify the problem of dead freight
                    supposedly faced by the respondent at the material time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     With respect, we do not find the Judge’s
                    analysis on dead freight persuasive. We note that the respondent, in its
                    affidavit evidence and in its witnesses’ testimony in court, did not
                    assert that dead freight was a critical factor in its decision not to hire the
                        <em>Puma</em>. Whilst the respondent did claim in its
                    written submissions that it had been concerned about the additional cost arising
                    from dead freight as well as the difficulties of obtaining extra cargo to carry

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     The contents of the 21 January 2004
                    e-mail indicate that, even though the respondent was supposedly reluctant to
                    charter the <em>Puma</em> due to the additional costs (in
                    terms of dead freight) flowing from her larger capacity, it was still willing to
                    charter and make a <em>firm offer</em> for an equally large
                    vessel – albeit with the flexibility of having that vessel call at other
                    ports in addition to the original ports of discharge mentioned at <a href="#p1_4">[4]</a> above. It would appear that the respondent must
                    have expected to make a profit from this alternative charter. Thus, contrary to
                    the Judge’s <em>ex post facto</em> rationalisation,
                    the evidence indicates that the problem of minimising the dead freight payable
                    did not vex the respondent. We do not, therefore, find that the issue of dead
                    freight and the purported difficulties of securing and then selling off
                    additional cargo in a disadvantageous spot market so as to reduce the dead
                    freight payable played any part in the respondent’s failure to charter the
                        <em>Puma</em>. The respondent cannot be said to have
                    reasonably believed that it would be assuming not only the risk of dead freight,
                    but also the risk of ending up with unsaleable cargo on its hands – the
                    contemporaneous facts simply do not support this.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Our decision on whether the respondent acted reasonably to mitigate
                its loss</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     In the final analysis, it seems to us that the
                    respondent could, with relative ease, have afforded the additional US$399,500
                    which it would have had to pay had it chartered the <em>Puma</em>. The respondent knew that, ultimately, it would be the
                    appellant which would bear the burden of paying for the additional cost of
                    securing alternative transport. Counsel for the respondent made the point that
                    it would be a brave or foolhardy businessman who would incur additional costs in
                    mitigation in the face of uncertainty as to whether those costs could be
                    recovered later through legal recourse. While such a fear may be reasonable
                    where an inexperienced businessman is concerned, it bears emphasis here that the
                    respondent – whether viewed as a corporate entity as a whole or in terms
                    of the individuals who represent its directing mind and will – cannot in
                    any sense be said to be inexperienced in the ways of commerce. The respondent
                    has been in the business of importing and exporting raw materials, commodities,
                    consumer goods, timber products and building materials since its incorporation
                    in 1988. Mr Malik, its head of chartering/operations, also considered
                    himself to be experienced in ship chartering. While claiming that this was the
                    first breach of charterparty case which he had actually come across himself, he
                    affirmed during cross-examination that, based on his understanding and knowledge
                    of the market as he knew it, where a charterparty was breached as a result of
                    the shipowner failing to provide the promised vessel, the first duty of the
                    charterer (the aggrieved party in this scenario) was to obtain a replacement
                    vessel and then claim from the shipowner any loss in terms of the freight
                    payable for the replacement vessel. We also note that, crucially, the respondent
                    did not at the material time evince any concerns about the appellant’s
                    ability to reimburse it for the additional sum payable if it hired the <em>Puma</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     In our view, one important issue which the
                    Judge should have considered was whether, in the circumstances, the respondent
                    should have notified the appellant of the option of chartering the <em>Puma</em> at the freight rate offered by her owners. This
                    would have given the appellant the opportunity to object to this option if it
                    did not deem it reasonable. The essence of the respondent’s submissions on
                    this point was this: where additional expense had to be incurred in mitigating
                    loss, it was reasonable for an aggrieved party which was experienced in the ways
                    of business to simply unilaterally evaluate whether the additional sum was an
                    amount which it was willing to pay, and then decide whether or not to proceed
                    with the mitigation measure in question. There is, according to the respondent,
                        <em>no obligation whatsoever</em> on the aggrieved
                    party’s part to notify or consult the defaulting party <em>vis-à-vis</em> the available options for mitigating
                losses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     We find ourselves unable to agree with the
                    respondent’s contention as an absolute proposition. The more reasonable
                    position appears to us to be that encapsulated in <em>Mitchell
                        and Another v Kahl and Others</em> (1862) 175 ER 1250;
                    2 F&amp;F 709 (“<em>Mitchell v
                    Kahl</em>”). In that case, the plaintiffs entered into a contract,
                    through the defendants, with the defendants’ principal for the charter of
                    a vessel. The charterparty was entered into on the basis of the warranty by the
                    defendants that they had the requisite authority to enter into the contract on
                    their principal’s behalf. In fact, the defendants had no such authority
                    and their principal subsequently objected to the charterparty. The plaintiffs
                    thus had to procure a larger replacement ship at a higher rate of freight in
                    order to transport their cargo. Several other pertinent facts are stated in the
                    (very short) judgment: first, there was positive evidence on the part of the
                    plaintiffs that they could not have obtained a smaller vessel as a substitute;
                    second, the plaintiffs did not give the defendants any notice of the replacement
                    vessel which had been chartered until after all the cargo in question had been
                    delivered by that vessel; and, third, it was not shown whether or not the
                    defendants could or would have used the surplus space on board the replacement
                    ship for their own purposes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     The issue before the court in <em>Mitchell v Kahl</em> was the extent of the defendants’
                    liability – specifically, whether the defendants should be liable for the
                    difference in freight based on only the tonnage of the original ship or on the
                    larger capacity of the replacement vessel. The plaintiffs, naturally, claimed
                    damages based on the latter measure. Cockburn CJ, in giving his directions
                    to the jury, made it clear at 1251; 711 that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If you think either that the plaintiffs <em>might</em> have got a smaller vessel, <em>or</em> that <em>they improperly neglected to give
                            the defendants notice of the substituted charter, so as to give [them]
                            the option of using the surplus space</em>, you may find for the
                        defendants; otherwise, for the plaintiffs, for the sum claimed. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The report goes on to note, without further elaboration, that judgment
                    was given in favour of the defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     It appears to us that the point which can be
                    gleaned from Cockburn CJ’s statement of the law (apropos the
                    situation where the breach of a charterparty takes on the form of a failure to
                    provide the chartered vessel) is this: where the aggrieved party has to incur
                    substantial additional expenditure in chartering a replacement vessel so as to
                    mitigate its loss, it should ordinarily notify the defaulting party of both the
                    alternative vessel or vessels available for charter as well as the particular
                    course of action which it (<em>ie</em>, the aggrieved
                    party) proposes to take. This would give both parties an opportunity to
                    consider, holistically, how their respective losses could be
                minimised.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     It seems to us that encouraging communication
                    between the aggrieved party and the defaulting party as regards the various
                    mitigation measures available accords with the notion of fairness, particularly
                    where the aggrieved party expends large sums on mitigation with a view to
                    subsequently recovering those sums from the defaulting party. From the wider
                    policy perspective, such communication will also help to minimise avoidable
                    economic wastage. This is not to say, however, that the aggrieved party must in
                    every case invariably give the defaulting party notice of the available
                    mitigation options and the particular option which it proposes to take. For
                    example, there will not infrequently be situations where the grave urgency of
                    making a decision renders such communication impractical. Absent such cases of
                    urgency, however, when an aggrieved party is required to come up with additional
                    outlay in order to mitigate its loss, it ought to inform the defaulting party of
                    this and ask the latter if it is willing to bear (or, in an appropriate case, to
                    share) the additional cost. It seems to us that this is what the objective
                    standard of reasonableness requires in the area of mitigation; indeed, this is
                    no more than what an experienced fair-minded businessman would ordinarily do in
                    the course of his business.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     The approach outlined in the preceding
                    paragraph will assist an aggrieved party in fulfilling its duty to mitigate in
                    more than one way. In <em>Remedies for Torts and Breach of
                        Contract</em>, Prof Andrew Burrows suggests (at p 122) that
                    the duty to mitigate is best regarded as comprising two principles: the first
                    focuses on unreasonable inaction and the second, on unreasonable action. The
                    requirement that the aggrieved party notify the defaulting party of the
                    mitigation options available and of the particular option which it proposes to
                    take addresses the first of these principles by setting a standard <em>vis-à-vis</em> the type of action which the aggrieved party
                    should take. It also addresses the second principle, which was raised as a
                    concern by counsel for the respondent in his oral submissions. Emphasising the
                    uncertainty which the respondent faced in the days immediately following the
                    appellant’s breach, counsel pointed out that, if the respondent had
                    chartered the <em>Puma</em> as a replacement vessel, the
                    likelihood was that the same parties would still be before the court today,
                    albeit arguing that the additional cost incurred in hiring the <em>Puma</em> was unreasonably incurred. In our view, that
                    possibility might have been avoided if the respondent had notified the appellant
                    of the intended additional expenditure and offered the appellant a choice to pay
                    for that sum or even use the surplus space on board the <em>Puma</em> for its (the appellant’s) own purposes. Had the
                    appellant agreed to pay the additional freight, the respondent might have
                    avoided incurring any loss at all. On the other hand, had the appellant opted
                    not to pay the additional freight, it would have faced an uphill task in
                    convincing the court that the respondent acted unreasonably in incurring the
                    additional expense of chartering the <em>Puma</em>,
                    especially when (in the hypothetical scenario discussed here) the respondent
                    had, quite reasonably, informed the appellant that the <em>Puma</em> was the only available replacement vessel and had offered
                    it the opportunity to either pay the additional freight involved or participate
                    in the charter of that vessel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     In summary, therefore, the respondent ought to
                    have notified the appellant of the availability of the <em>Puma</em> and of the additional cost involved in chartering her. Had
                    the respondent done so and had the appellant been unwilling to pay the
                    additional cost, the respondent could have chartered the <em>Puma</em>, secure in the knowledge that it had acted reasonably and
                    that the court’s scrutiny would be focused instead on the
                    appellant’s conduct. However, as no notice was given in this case before
                    the respondent’s abrupt decision to forego the opportunity of hiring the
                        <em>Puma</em>, this is another ground for concluding
                    that the respondent failed to act reasonably to mitigate its loss. It is thus
                    limited to recovering only the sum of US$399,500 which it would have incurred in
                    additional costs if it had chartered the <em>Puma</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     To summarise, we find that the respondent did
                    not take reasonable steps to contain the loss which it knew it would incur by
                    inaction. Having decided the question of mitigation in the appellant’s
                    favour, it is not necessary for us to consider the third question before the
                    Judge, which concerned the appropriate measure of damages to adopt (see
                        <a href="#p1_19">[19]</a> above), even though it appears to
                    us that certain aspects of the Judge’s quantification may be
                    questionable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     We therefore allow this appeal (with the usual
                    consequential orders) on the basis that the respondent failed to take reasonable
                    steps to mitigate its loss. As a result, it is <em>not</em>
                    entitled to recover the full extent of the loss which it allegedly suffered as a
                    result of the appellant’s breach of the Charterparty. In our view, the
                    Judge was not justified in overruling the AR’s well-reasoned findings of
                    fact on the issue of mitigation (see above at <a href="#p1_17">[17]</a>–<a href="#p1_18">[18]</a>). The
                    respondent is thus entitled to recover only the sum of US$399,500, which is the
                    additional expense that it would have been put to had it chartered the <em>Puma</em>, together with interest on that sum fixed at 3% per
                    annum from the date on which the writ in the present action was filed until
                    payment. With regard to costs, the appellant is entitled to both the costs of
                    this appeal and the costs of the hearing before the Judge. As for the costs of
                    the hearing before the AR, we make no order as to those costs since each party
                    failed in several of the contentions which it canvassed at that
                hearing.</p>
