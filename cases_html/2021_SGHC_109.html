This statement underscores the importance of distribution channels used by insurance companies to sell their products. An insurance company may sell its insurance products through the following distribution channels:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) a tied agency, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, agents who sell only its policies; and/or</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) banks (often referred to as bancassurance); </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) financial advisory (“FA”) firms, which may sell insurance products from different insurance companies subject to any restrictions in their agreements with the insurance companies; and/or</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) online platforms. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 At all material times, the plaintiff, Prudential Assurance Company Singapore (Pte) Ltd (“PACS”), sold its products primarily through a tied agency although it also sold through banks. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 Between 15 and 17 June 2016, 195 agents of PACS gave notice of termination of their agency agreements with PACS <span class="font-italic">en masse</span>. By the end of June 2016, another 31 agents had done the same. This was followed by another 12 agents in July 2016, and another six agents between August 2016 and 27 February 2017. Of the total of 244 agents, 241 had belonged to what was known as the Peter Tan Organisation (“PTO”) which was run by the first defendant, Mr Peter Tan Shou Yi (“Peter”). PTO was the biggest and most successful group of agents selling insurance products for PACS. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 Peter himself gave notice of termination of his agency agreement with PACS on 8 July 2016. PACS responded by summarily terminating Peter’s Agency Agreement for breach of the same. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 In this action, PACS alleges that Peter breached his agency agreement and/or his fiduciary duties by soliciting the 244 agents to leave PACS to join a competitor of PACS, Aviva Limited (“Aviva”), and/or its subsidiary financial advisory firm, Aviva Financial Advisors Pte Ltd (“AFA”). PACS claims damages, alternatively, equitable compensation, in the form of loss of profits which range from about $2.4m to $2.5 billion. Alternatively, PACS claims an account of profits by Peter. PACS also claims damages against the second defendant, PTO Management and Consultancy Pte Ltd (“PTOMC”), for dishonest assistance in relation to Peter’s breach of fiduciary duties. Alternatively, PACS claims an account of the benefits received by PTOMC. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 Peter counterclaims against PACS for damages for (a) wrongful termination of his agency agreement, (b) inducing certain agents to breach their confidential obligations owed to Peter, (c) breach of confidential obligations owed to Peter, and (d) conspiracy to injure Peter by unlawful means. Peter’s counterclaims for inducement of breach, breach of confidential obligations and conspiracy to injure relate to alleged confidential information obtained by certain agents from Peter during several meetings with him between April and early June 2016. PACS claims that Peter carried out his acts of solicitation during these meetings.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Regulation of the insurance business </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 The Monetary Authority of Singapore (“MAS”) is the regulatory authority of the insurance business in Singapore.

</div> LIA MU 65/15 repealed LIA MU 31/11 in totality and set out Guidelines on Span of Control (“Span of Control Guidelines”). In summary, the Span of Control Guidelines prescribe a maximum of 176 persons within an agency unit comprising three tiers: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) one Tier 3 Agency Manager; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) ten Tier 2 Agency Supervisors (an Agency Manager can have up to ten Agency Supervisors); and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) 165 Tier 1 Agents (the Agency Manager and Agency Supervisors can each have up to 15 Tier 1 Agents).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Subject to the approval of the insurer, deviations in the mix are permissible (whilst keeping within the limit of 176 persons overall) but a Tier 2 Agency Supervisor cannot in any event have more than 20 Tier 1 agents under him and a Tier 3 Manager cannot have more than 20 Tier 1 Agents or 15 direct Tier 2 Supervisors under him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 Thus, MAS 306 (see [9(a)] above) sets a limit of three tiers in any structure in which overriding commissions (“overrides” or “OR”) are paid, and the Span of Control Guidelines (see [12] above) limited the total number of agents within such structures to 176.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 The obligations set out in LIA MU 59/15 and LIA MU 65/15 are referred to generally as “CEDLI obligations”.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Terminology in this judgment</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 The term “agent” is sometimes used to refer to a Tier 1 agent.

Instead, each agent was an independent contractor. The role of the agent was to “sell” insurance policies for PACS. Technically, the agent only canvassed for insurance policies on behalf of PACS. He could not commit PACS to sell the policy. The agent would submit a proposal from a potential insured to PACS. PACS had the final say as to whether to accept the proposal and enter into an insurance agreement with the potential insured.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 Another role of the agent was to “recruit” new agents for PACS. Again, the agent had no authority to commit PACS. If PACS accepted the new agent, it then entered into an agency agreement with the new agent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Agents could be promoted to a supervisory or leadership role in which he supervised other agents. In this leadership role, the agent may or may not also continue to sell policies for PACS.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Consistent with MAS 306 and the Span of Control Guidelines, PACS’ agents worked within a group structure which comprised three tiers with payment of overriding benefits:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Tier 1 agents – Tier 1 agents generally worked under the supervision of a Tier 2 agency leader (“AL”) but may also work under the supervision of a Tier 3 AL. These Tier 1 agents held different ranks – Financial Consultant (“FC”), Senior FC, Executive FC, and Master FC. They earned commissions from selling insurance policies. They also recruited new agents to join PACS. These new agents would then join the group of Tier 1 agents working under the supervision of the recruiting agent’s AL.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Tier 2 ALs – Tier 2 ALs had supervisory responsibilities for Tier 1 agents working under them. These Tier 2 ALs also held different ranks – Financial Services Supervisor (“FSS”), FS Manager (“FSM”), Senior FSM, FS Director (“FSD”), Senior FSD/Group FSD. They earned commissions from the insurance policies that they sold, as well as ORs from the policies sold by their Tier 1 agents. Tier 2 ALs usually worked under a Tier 3 AL. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c)  Tier 3 ALs – PACS had two types of Tier 3 ALs – Group Agency Leader (“GAL”) and Group Agency Manager (“GAM”). A GAL had Tier 2 ALs and Tier 1 agents under his direct supervision whereas a GAM had only Tier 2 ALs under his direct supervision. Both GALs and GAMs also had supervisory responsibilities for the agents in their GAL/GAM units. Both GALs and GAMs earned commissions from insurance policies that they sold (if any) and overrides from sales by their Tier 2 ALs’ units. GALs also earned overrides from sales by the Tier 1 agents under their direct supervision. Payments by PACS to Tier 3 ALs differed according to whether they were GALs or GAMs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 A percentage of the premiums paid by the insured is paid (a) as commission to the agent who sold the policy, typically over a period of six years (on a reducing scale), and (b) as overrides to that agent’s Tier 2 AL and GAL/GAM. The combined override paid to a Tier 2 AL and GAL/GAM in respect of a policy sold by a Tier 1 agent could be as much as 48% of the premiums paid.

When a Tier 1 agent was promoted to become a Tier 2 AL, the Tier 2 AL that he was under automatically became a GAL with his own separate GAL unit. The GAL that the newly promoted GAL was previously under would cease to receive overrides from the newly promoted GAL’s unit. A GAL therefore had no incentive to help his Tier 2 ALs advance their careers. On the other hand, the Tier 2 AL may not wish to be promoted to a GAL. As a Tier 2 AL, he enjoyed structural and administrative support from his GAL. As a GAL, he would be the one providing the structural and administrative support to his team. If his team is small, he would not achieve economies of scale. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 To address the above issues, the GAM scheme was introduced in 2006 to (a) provide “selected top agency groups with a new agency structure that promotes growth and greater autonomy”, and (b) ensure that PACS’ agency force “remains competitive and relevant”.

</div> Under the GAM scheme, when a Tier 1 agent was promoted to a Tier 2 AL, he would become a Tier 2 AL under the same GAM. His former Tier 2 AL could remain a Tier 2 AL. The GAM would continue to earn overrides from the Tier 2 ALs’ units and the Tier 2 ALs continued to enjoy the GAM’s structural and administrative support. A GAM did not have any Tier 1 agents directly under him, so that he could focus on supervising and managing the ALs under him. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 To be eligible to participate in the GAM scheme, a Tier 3 AL’s group had to meet certain performance criteria.

</div> The 2011 MOU was entered into between PACS and Peter Tan. It was clear that the Master GAM scheme was created for Peter. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Pursuant to the 2011 MOU, as subsequently amended:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Two Tier 2 ALs in PTO, Mr Darren Tan (“Darren”) and Ms Cynthia Tan (“Cynthia”), were promoted to become Tier 3 GAMs. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) PTO was restructured and became a Master GAM unit, comprising three separate GAM units headed by Peter, Darren and Cynthia respectively.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Another Tier 2 AL, Mr Steven Peh (“Steven”) was also promoted as a Tier 3 GAM. However, unlike Darren and Cynthia who remained within PTO, Steven’s unit was spun off and became a GAM unit that operated independently of PTO.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Peter became the Master GAM of PTO. Concurrently, he was also a GAM within PTO.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 As a Master GAM, Peter could no longer receive ORs from sales generated by each of the GAM units in PTO (other than his own GAM unit). Peter negotiated for and PACS agreed to pay him the following:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) special sell-out payments amounting to about $7m from PACS;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) a Master GAM growth bonus for the growth of PTO; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) a Master GAM super bonus of up to $1m if PTO achieved certain sales targets set by PACS.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The Master GAM growth and super bonuses were over and above what Peter was entitled to be paid as a GAM. It was at least unclear whether the Master GAM super bonus breached MAS 306 since arguably, it could be seen as payments of overriding benefits from sales generated by agents under the other GAMs in PTO. As these payments were to be made to Peter as the Master GAM, arguably the payment of overrides involved four tiers. However, this was not an issue that I had to decide.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 The sell-out payments that Peter negotiated for included sell-out payments in respect of Darren’s and Cynthia’s GAM units. These payments were meant to compensate Peter for his loss of overrides from Darren’s and Cynthia’s units following their promotion to GAMs. The amounts had been fixed in 2011 with no further revisions to the amount (whether upwards or downwards) to take into account the actual performance of these units. In January 2013, Peter asked for an increase in the sell-out payments because Darren’s and Cynthia’s GAM units had performed much better than expected. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 By way of a letter dated 31 January 2013,

In my judgment, the answer to this question is a clear “Yes”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 The facts relating to Peter’s discussions with Aviva are not in dispute. On 21 April 2016, Aviva sent Peter draft documents relating to the appointment of (a) a President, (b) Advisors, and (c) Advisor Managers, of Aviva’s subsidiary (see [56]–[58] above). Peter testified that he had not discussed details of how his involvement with Aviva will be like, and that Aviva had simply sent him the draft documents for his consideration and to “keep the conversation going”.

</div> However, the clawback provision was watered down. If Aviva terminated the agreement on the ground that AFA’s performance failed to meet the agreed targets, Peter merely had to agree not to participate in the financial service industry from the time of termination of the agreement until 31 July 2020, and there would be no clawback. This revised clawback provision remained unchanged in the DAA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 PACS submitted that the reason for the difference in the clawback provisions was the exodus of more than 200 agents in PTO from PACS to AFA which took place after the 31 May 2016 draft agreement and before the 27 June 2016 draft agreement. I agree with PACS. The inference is irresistible. I reject Peter’s denial that there was such a link between the sign-on bonus and the exodus of agents from PACS to AFA. Peter claimed that the sign-on bonus was tied to the services that he would provide, the restrictions to be imposed on him, the value that he would bring to Aviva and the income he could have earned if he had stayed on in PACS.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 Peter argued that the September 2010 AI did not fall within the scope of cl 7 of his Field Manager Agreement because the scope of cl 7 was limited to statutory guidelines and requirements. Peter submitted that the word “otherwise” in cl 7 should be construed <span class="font-italic">ejusdem generis</span>. Peter also referred to the fact that the header for cl 7 was “Statutory Requirements”. I agree with Peter. The language in cl 7 showed that it was intended to apply to statutory guidelines and requirements. This conclusion is also supported by the fact that cl 5 of the Field Manager Agreement had expressly required Peter to comply with “agency instructions”. There was no reason for cl 7 to also apply to agency instructions. In my view, the September 2010 AI did not fall within the scope of cl 7. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 It cannot be disputed that the September 2010 AI was an instruction that fell within the scope of cll 3(c) and 5 of Peter’s Field Manager Agreement. However, that is not the end of the matter. Clearly, the September 2010 AI purported to amend the terms of Peter’s Field Manager Agreement by adding the Non-Solicitation Clause to the Agreement. It is doubtful that cl 3 can be said to permit of such an amendment. Clause 3 refers to Peter’s duty to manage the agents under him in a manner consistent with instructions given by PACS. His own obligation to comply with PACS’ instructions is governed by cl 5.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 In any event, the more important question is whether cll 3(c) and/or 5 permit PACS to make such an amendment unilaterally. Understandably, Peter submitted cll 3(c) and 5 did not permit PACS to do so, and I agree.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 First, cl 13(a) of Peter’s Field Manager Agreement expressly required any variation or modification of any of the terms of the Agreement to be in writing and signed by the parties to the Agreement.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 There was nothing in the Agreement that permitted PACS to amend the terms of the Agreement other than in the manner provided in cl 13(a). Nothing in cll 3(c) or 5 detracted from the requirement in cl 13(a) that any amendment to the terms of the Agreement had to be in writing and signed by the parties. It is also significant that cl 13(a) drew a clear distinction between the amendment of “rules, regulations and agency instructions pursuant to Clause 5” (which PACS could amend unilaterally) and “variations or modifications of any of the terms” of the Agreement (which had to be in writing and signed by PACS and Peter). In my judgment, cll 3(c) and 5 must be read in a manner that is consistent with cl 13(a), <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that cll 3(c) and 5 do not permit<span class="font-italic"> </span>PACS to unilaterally amend the terms of Peter’s Field Manager Agreement via the September 2010 AI in contravention of cl 13(a). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 It may have been convenient to PACS to use the September 2010 AI to unilaterally amend the terms of its agreements with its numerous agents, including Peter’s Field Manager Agreement. However, PACS’ convenience could not override the clear requirements in cl 13(a). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 Second, I agree with Peter that he did not accept or agree to the Non-Solicitation Clause. The agency force in PACS (including Peter) had objected to the September 2010 AI, describing the contents as “unreasonable and something we cannot adhere to”.

</div> The “other items” included the Non-Solicitation Clause. Peter’s Field Manager Agreement did not have any non-solicitation clause. I agree with Peter that PACS’ response shows that PACS did not intend the Non-Solicitation Clause to apply to agents whose agreements did not already contain any such clause. This conclusion is also supported by the fact that the terms and conditions in the September 2010 AI expressly stated that the AI “applies to all Prudential Financial Consultants” and that “Prudential Financial Consultants shall refer to all person who have signed the Adviser/Financial Agreement”.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) PACS structured its agency force to emphasise flexibility, not stability, pointing to the fact that an agent needs to give only 14-days’ notice of termination of his agreement, regardless of seniority;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) PACS’ agency force experienced high churn; there was no stability to maintain;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) PACS’ employees and agency force had completely different benefits and responsibilities; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) PACS had already protected its interests by (i) paying its agents only when sales are generated, and (ii) having a commission structure that was payable over six years such that agents who leave would forfeit any unpaid commissions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 I disagree with Peter’s submissions. There is no good reason to restrict the proprietary interest in maintaining a stable workforce to an employed workforce. In my view, it matters not whether the workforce comprises employees or independent contractors such as agents. What matters is the reliance on the workforce and the disruption that an unstable workforce would cause to the business. Here, PACS relied primarily on its agency force to sell its policies. Clearly, allowing Peter to solicit agents in PTO to defect to a competitor could adversely impact PACS’ business. The reasons relied on by Peter (as set out above) cannot mean that PACS therefore has no proprietary interest in maintaining a stable, trained agency force.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the Non-Solicitation Clause satisfied the twin tests of reasonableness</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 The Non-Solicitation Clause must satisfy the twin tests of reasonableness, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, it must be reasonable by reference to the interest of the parties and the interest of the public. In this regard, the protection that PACS sought by way of the non-solicitation clause must go no further than necessary to protect its legitimate proprietary interest.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Interest of the public</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 Peter’s first submission was that the Non-Solicitation Clause was unreasonable by reference to the interest of the public because it restricted PACS’ entire agency force regardless of the seniority of the agents. Peter relied on <span class="font-italic">Powerdrive Pte Ltd v Loh Kin Yong Philip and others</span> [2019] 3 SLR 399 (“<span class="font-italic">Powerdrive</span>”), which concerned a clause restraining employees from working for a rival company and/or direct competitor for two years after termination of employment. The High Court found the clause to be unreasonable in the interest of the public because it applied to all employees regardless of seniority and was therefore too wide (at [25]–[38]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 I disagree with Peter. In my view, it was not unreasonable for PACS to seek to restrict all agents, regardless of seniority, from soliciting other agents to leave PACS. After all, every agent (regardless of his seniority) is capable of soliciting other agents to leave PACS. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 Peter also argued that the Non-Solicitation Clause goes beyond what the industry considers necessary in the public’s interest. Peter argued that the LIA Guidelines on the Use of Sign-on Incentives in the recruitment of Financial Advisory Representatives dated 14 March 2018 (“LIA MU 72/18”)

</div> recognised mass recruitments, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the recruitment of 30 or more representatives from the same insurer or FA firm within a 60-day period tracked on a rolling basis. In my view, Peter’s reliance on LIA MU 72/18 is incorrect. LIA MU 71/18 recognised that insurers may offer migration packages to recruit agents and set out principles to be followed so that the offer of migration packages is done in a reasonable manner that does not undermine the professionalism of the industry or adversely affect the interests of consumers. This is an entirely different scenario from the present case. An insurer owes no duty not to solicit agents from another insurer. This does not mean that an insurer cannot contractually bind its senior agents to not solicit its other agents to join a competitor.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 Finally, Peter argued that the Non-Solicitation Clause is unreasonable because it is not limited to mass solicitation; the loss of one new agent would breach the clause even though it would have no impact on the stability of PACS’ agency force. I do not think the Non-Solicitation Clause is unreasonable for this reason alone. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Interest of the parties</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 Under the Non-Solicitation Clause, Peter could not “employ or endeavour to entice away from [PACS] any person who is an employee, officer, Financial Consultant or manager” of PACS during the currency of his agreements with PACS and for a period of 24 months after the termination of the agreements (see [39] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 Peter’s first submission was that the restriction for the period of 24 months after termination of Peter’s agreements with PACS was unreasonable. Peter pointed out that, as shown in the minutes of PACS’ CEO Council Meeting on 12 October 2010, PACS itself had acknowledged that the 24-month period was too long and would be shortened to one year.

</div> However, I agree with PACS that since its case against Peter is that Peter breached the Non-Solicitation Clause during the currency of his agreements with PACS, the question of the reasonableness of the 24-month period does not arise (see <span class="font-italic">Salomon Alliance Management Pte Ltd v Pang Chee Kuan</span> [2019] 4 SLR 577 at [110]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 Peter’s second submission was that the restriction that Peter shall not “endeavour to entice” was unreasonable. Peter relied on <span class="font-italic">Austin Knight (UK) Ltd v Hinds</span> [1994] FSR 52 (“<span class="font-italic">Austin Knight</span>”). In that case, the defendant (an ex-employee of the plaintiff) was subject to a covenant that she “will not …. solicit, interfere with or endeavour to entice away … from the company … [any] customer of … the company …”. Peter submitted that the UK High Court held that the covenant not to “endeavour to entice away” was unreasonably wide as it could apply to situations outside the “usual meaning of soliciting”.

</div>
</div> In my view, Peter’s submission is an inaccurate representation of what was decided in <span class="font-italic">Austin Knight</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 In <span class="font-italic">Austin Knight</span>, the defendant found a post with another company operating in the same field as the plaintiff. Former customers of the plaintiff approached the defendant and asked if she could continue to handle their accounts. The relevant passage from Vinelott J’s judgment is as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [The plaintiff’s lawyer] nonetheless submitted that by submitting an offer or making a presentation to a former customer, even one who had approached her or her employers, or who put out work for tender, amounted either to soliciting or endeavouring to entice away the customer. <span class="font-italic">That is not I think, comprehended in the usual meaning of soliciting</span>, and as regards endeavouring to entice a customer away, if [the plaintiff’s lawyer’s] submission were well founded the covenant would amount to a covenant not to deal with customers of [the plaintiff], even customers with whom [the defendant] had never dealt with while an employee of [the plaintiff] and with whose relationship with [the plaintiff] she was wholly unaware. On that construction, the covenant would amount in substance to a contract without territorial limit not to take employment in the field in which she had been previously employed and would plainly be an unreasonable restraint. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 What Vinelott J said was that the <span class="font-italic">plaintiff’s lawyer’s </span><span class="font-italic">submission </span>(which suggested that responding to a former customer, who approached the defendant, amounted to either soliciting or endeavouring to entice away the customer) was “not … comprehended in the usual meaning of soliciting”. Vinelott J went on to hold that if <span class="font-italic">the plaintiff’s lawyer’s submission</span> was correct, the covenant against endeavouring to entice a customer away would be an unreasonable restraint because it would amount in substance to a “contract without territorial limit not to take employment in the filed in which [the defendant] had been previously employed”. Clearly, Vinelott J did not decide that the phrase “endeavour to entice away” was unreasonably wide as it could apply to situations outside the “usual meaning of soliciting”, as Peter has submitted. In my judgment, the mere use of the phrase “endeavour to entice away” in the Non-Solicitation Clause could not be said to be unreasonable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 Peter’s third submission was that the Non-Solicitation Clause was unreasonable because it restrained solicitation of <span class="font-italic">all</span> employees, officers, agents, Financial Consultants or managers regardless of seniority or Peter’s influence over the individuals.

</div>
</div> Peter referred to four cases – <span class="font-italic">Lek Gwee Noi v Humming Flowers &amp; Gifts Pte Ltd </span>[2014] 3 SLR 27 (“<span class="font-italic">Lek Gwee Noi</span>”), <span class="font-italic">TSC Europe (UK) Ltd v Massey</span> [1999] IRLR 22 (“<span class="font-italic">TSC Europe</span>”), <span class="font-italic">Kearney v Crepaldi &amp; Ors </span>[2006] NSWSC 23 (“<span class="font-italic">Kearney</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">Aussie Home Loans Ltd v X Inc Services Pty Ltd</span> [2005] NSWSC 285 (“<span class="font-italic">Aussie Home Loans</span>”).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In <span class="font-italic">Lek Gwee Noi</span>, a non-solicitation covenant was held to be unreasonable because it prohibited the plaintiff from taking away from the defendant the business of <span class="font-italic">any</span> customer of the defendant, including those who became customers of the defendant <span class="font-italic">after</span> the plaintiff’s employment had ended (at [110]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) In <span class="font-italic">TSC Europe</span>, the non-solicitation clause prohibited solicitation of any employee without reference to his or her importance to the business and whether or not he or she has any knowledge or experience in relation to the plaintiff’s technical fields of activity <span class="font-italic">and</span> applied to employees who commenced their employment with the plaintiff after the defendant (ex-employee) had left the company. The court found that it was the “combined effect of these two vices” that was critical and that the consequence was that the restrictive covenant was more than was reasonably necessary to protect the legitimate interests of the plaintiff (at [50] and [58]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) In <span class="font-italic">Kearney</span>, the non-solicitation clause was held to be unreasonable because it encompassed all employees regardless of seniority or duration of their employment, and also all employees who had left the company before the defendants’ employment ceased (at [83]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) <span class="font-italic">Aussie Home Loans</span> concerned a prohibition against solicitation of the employees or contractors of the first plaintiff. The court found that the restraint against solicitation of employees of any description was too wide to be enforceable (at [31]). As for the solicitation of contractors, the court found that the restraint was not reasonable because (i) it applied to persons who became contractors after the third defendant’s employment was terminated (at [32]), and (ii) in any event, it applied to contractors in other states and territories with whom the third defendant could not be expected to have had dealings and for whose supervision he could not be expected to have been responsible (at [35]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 In <span class="font-italic">Lek Gwee Noi </span>and <span class="font-italic">TSC Europe</span>, a key factor was the fact that the restrictions extended to the solicitation of persons who became customers/employees of the company after the defendant had left the company. In <span class="font-italic">Kearney</span>, a key factor was the fact that the restriction against soliciting extended to employees of the company who had left before the defendant’s employment ceased. In the present case, the Non-Solicitation Clause restrained solicitation of persons who were employees/agents of PACS as at the date that Peter’s agreements with PACS were terminated. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 The decision in <span class="font-italic">Aussie Home Loans</span> has to be looked at in context. There, the interest that the first plaintiff was said to be entitled to protect by way of the non-solicitation clause was the confidential information which the ex-employee was said to have about the relations between the first plaintiff (which was in the business of providing and arranging retail and business mortgage finance) and its loan writing employees/contractors (see [26], [32]–[33] and [35] of the judgment). In the present case, the relevant interest that PACS seeks to protect through the Non-Solicitation Clause is its interest to maintain a stable, trained workforce. The reasonableness of the Non-Solicitation Clause has to be tested against the protection of this interest.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 The four cases that Peter referred to are distinguishable on the facts. The question whether the Non-Solicitation Clause is unreasonable (because it applies to all employees/agents) has to be determined based on the facts in the present case. In my view, PACS’ interest in maintaining a stable, trained workforce relates primarily to its agency force. In this regard, it is in my view not unreasonable for the Non-Solicitation Clause to prohibit the solicitation of all agents regardless of seniority. Surely, the loss of its agents (regardless of seniority) to a competitor will adversely affect PACS’ business. The protection of PACS’ interest must include the need to protect against solicitation of all its agents.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 That said, the Non-Solicitation Clause also applies to the solicitation of any “employee” or “officer” of PACS. In my view, the Non-Solicitation Clause is too wide in so far as it applies to any employee or officer of PACS. Such a restraint goes further than necessary to protect PACS’ interest which is primarily the protection of its agency force. However, I agree with PACS that the Non-Solicitation Clause can be saved by applying the doctrine of severance and running a “blue pencil” through the words “employee” and “officer”. The following three prerequisites for severance (<span class="font-italic">Lek Gwee Noi </span>at [155]) are satisfied in this case:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The unenforceable provision must be capable of being removed without adding to or modifying the wording of what remains with the remainder continuing to make grammatical sense.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The remaining contractual terms must continue to be supported by adequate consideration.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The severance must not change the fundamental character of the contract between the parties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 Finally, in his defence, Peter also pleaded that the Non-Solicitation Clause (see [39] above) only prohibits him from soliciting any person who is “an employee, officer, agent, Financial Consultant or manager of [PACS] as at the date [Peter’s Agency Agreement] is terminated”.

A literal reading of the Non-Solicitation Clause supports Peter’s interpretation. However, PACS’ interpretation makes better commercial sense. The Non-Solicitation Clause seeks to restrain Peter from soliciting both before and after his Agency Agreement is terminated. Peter’s interpretation is illogical because it means that an existing agent can solicit other agents without breaching the Non-Solicitation Clause so long as the agents who are solicited terminate their Agency Agreements before the soliciting agent terminates his Agency Agreement. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion regarding the Non-Solicitation Clause</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 In my judgment, the Non-Solicitation Clause was reasonable and enforceable, at least in so far as it prohibited solicitation during the currency of Peter’s Agency Agreement.

Peter submitted that therefore the only question for the Court is whether the proposed term can be implied into Peter’s Field Manager Agreement; otherwise, he would be prejudiced because he has not led evidence on facts relevant to the construction of any other agreements (apart from the Field Manager Agreement) since they were not identified by PACS. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">163 I agree with Peter.

</div> The test for the implication of terms <span class="font-italic">in fact</span> is well established: <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp Marine Ltd v PPL Holdings Pte Ltd and another and another appeal </span>[2013] 4 SLR 193 (“<span class="font-italic">Sembcorp Marine</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [101]. First, a gap in the contract must have arisen because both parties did not contemplate the gap. Second, it must be necessary in the business or commercial sense to imply a term in order to give the contract efficacy. Third, the proposed term must be one which the parties, recognising the need for business efficacy, would have responded “Oh, of course!” had the proposed term been put to them at the time of the contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">165 The reference point for the implication of a term is at the time of contracting; the parties’ subsequent conduct is only relevant if waiver or estoppel are relied on: <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp Marine</span> at [127].

Essentially, the facts relied on by PACS to support the implication of the proposed term relate to Peter’s obligations as an AL under his Field Manager Agreement. These include the obligations to recruit new agents for PACS, manage the agents, take all reasonable action to ensure that the agents comply with the terms of their respective agency agreements (which include exclusively promoting the sales of PACS’ products).

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">166 The proposed term is pleaded as a duty not to destroy or seriously damage the relationship of confidence and trust between PACS and Peter. PACS has pleaded the non-solicitation obligation as an “example” of the proposed term. It is therefore clear that the proposed term that PACS seeks to imply is one that encompasses a non-solicitation obligation. It is important to bear this in mind when applying the <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp Marine </span>test to the proposed term. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">167 I agree with Peter that the proposed term does not satisfy the <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp Marine </span>test. First, I agree with Peter that the existence of a non-compete clause in Peter’s Agency Agreement showed that PACS had restraint of trade clauses in mind when it entered into the Field Manager Agreement with Peter. The proposed term, as pleaded, was in substance a restraint of trade clause since it encompassed a non-solicitation obligation. In my view, it is unlikely that PACS would have contemplated non-compete obligations but not non-solicitation obligations. It is more likely that PACS contemplated but chose not to deal with the issue of non-solicitation obligations in Peter’s Agency Agreement. This meant that PACS would also have had non-solicitation obligations in mind when it subsequently entered into the Field Manager Agreement with Peter.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">168 I also agreed with Peter that it was not necessary to imply the proposed term in order to give the Field Manager Agreement efficacy.

This is amply supported by the strong objections by the agency force to the non-solicitation clause in the September 2010 AI, which sought to impose a non-solicitation obligation; the agency force had described the contents of the September 2010 AI as “unreasonable and something we cannot adhere to”.

</div> Peter relied on <span class="font-italic">Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Citigroup Global Markets Australia Pty Limited</span> [2007] FCA 963 (“<span class="font-italic">Citigroup</span>”). The central issue in that case was whether the terms of a letter of engagement, under which an investment bank was retained by a large public company to advise on a proposed takeover, excluded the existence of any fiduciary relationship between the investment bank and its client. The engagement letter expressly provided that Citigroup was engaged “as an independent contractor and not in any other capacity including as a fiduciary”. The Federal Court of Australia held (at [324]) that the plain meaning was that Citigroup was retained solely as an independent contractor and not as a fiduciary. The court went on to state that the engagement of Citigroup as “an independent contractor and not in any other capacity” suggested that the parties “had in mind the distinction between independent contractors and employees or agents” and that these words also “point against the assumption of any fiduciary capacity”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">177 It is clear that the focus of the provision found in the engagement letter in <span class="font-italic">Citigroup</span> was that the Citigroup was engaged as “an independent contractor and not in any other capacity”. It is also clear that the words “and not in any other capacity” influenced the Federal Court’s view in <span class="font-italic">Citigroup</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">178 The relevant clauses in Peter’s Agency Agreement and Field Manager Agreement have a different focus.

</div> PACS relied on <span class="font-italic">AXA China</span> (discussed at [155]–[156] above). In my view, <span class="font-italic">AXA China</span> is not authority for the general proposition that the relationship of an insurance agent and the insurer is a legal relationship of agent and principal. As stated earlier, in <span class="font-italic">AXA China</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>AXA (the insurer) sought an injunction order against the individual defendants based on a duty of fidelity in respect of their agency with AXA. The court concluded (at [85]) that there was a serious legal issue to be tried as to whether the individual defendants would be in breach of their duty of fidelity to AXA. This conclusion rested on the court’s view that the duty of fidelity was an <span class="font-italic">implied term</span> in the agents’ contracts and that this implied term meant that they were to serve AXA “with good faith and undivided interest and should not do anything which may harm AXA, not at least during the currency of the agency” (at [69] and [79]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">180 With respect, the judgment in <span class="font-italic">AXA China</span> did not analyse whether or to what extent the relationship between the insurance agents and the insurers could be said to give rise to a legal relationship of agent and principal. It was also not necessary for the court to do so given the court’s view that the duty of fidelity was an implied term of the agents’ contracts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">181 I agree with Peter that his role as tied agent and AL did not give rise to any legal relationship of agent and principal with PACS. Each agent in PACS operates his own business for his own account, subject to the terms of his agreements with PACS. As an AL, Peter too operated his own business and managed the agents in PTO for his own account. He was not managing the agents in PTO on behalf of PACS. Peter controlled how he managed and trained the agents in PTO, subject of course to his CEDLI obligations, which arose from guidelines issued by LIA, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>LIA MU 59/15 (guidelines on competency requirements for agents and supervisors) and LIA MU 65/15 (Span of Control Guidelines) (see [11]–[14] above). PACS gave incentives to its ALs to improve the performance of their respective units. However, this did not make Peter an agent of PACS for the purposes of managing the agents in Peter’s group. The fact that Peter was a tied agent did not affect how Peter managed the agents in PTO. The relationship between Peter (as AL) and PACS was one between two principals.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">182 There is one aspect of the relationship between an insurance agent and PACS, which gives rise to a legal agent-principal relationship. In my view, when explaining PACS’ policies to potential clients and assessing the suitability of the policies for the client, the insurance agent would be acting as PACS’ agent in the legal sense. His representations to the client could bind PACS. However, this aspect of the relationship is not relevant in the instant case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the facts give rise to a fiduciary relationship</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">183 PACS submitted that a fiduciary relationship between Peter and PACS arose on the specific facts and circumstances.

</div>
</div> PACS argued that this gave rise to a relationship of mutual trust and confidence and a legitimate expectation on the part of PACS that Peter will not utilise his position in such a way which is adverse to Prudential’s interests. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">184 Peter and PTOMC submitted that the court should be extremely slow to find a fiduciary relationship outside the established categories of such relationships. They argued that the facts do not give rise to a fiduciary relationship because Peter’s relationship with PACS was a commercial, arm’s length and equal relationship and that he did not undertake to act solely in the interests of PACS, to the exclusion of his own. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">185 As the Court of Appeal held in <span class="font-italic">Turf Club</span> (see [171] above), whether the parties are in a fiduciary relationship depends, ultimately, on the nature of their relationship – a fiduciary relationship arises when someone has undertaken to act for or on behalf of another in a particular matter in circumstances which give rise to a relationship of trust and confidence, or where the relationship gives rise to a legitimate expectation, which equity will recognise, that the fiduciary will not utilise his or her position in such a way which is adverse to the interests of the principal. It is therefore crucial to understand the nature of Peter’s relationship (as a Master GAM) with PACS.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">186 It is clear that PTO was important to PACS. PTO was the largest agency group in PACS, contributing approximately 10% of PACS’ entire agency force sales production measured in APE. Agents in PTO were also generally more productive in terms of the amount of APE generated per agent as compared to PACS’ overall agency force. PACS came up with the Master GAM scheme in 2011 so that Tier 2 ALs in PTO who had to be promoted to Tier 3 GALs or GAMS (because the size of PTO had exceeded the Span of Control Guidelines) did not have to move out of PTO after they were promoted and could remain in PTO (see [40] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">187 PACS regarded Peter as being central to the growth of PTO. At the material time, Peter was a (in fact, the only) Master GAM in PACS. The importance of Peter and PTO to PACS was confirmed again in 2015 when PACS entered into the Pegasus Agreement with Peter. The Pegasus Agreement was meant specifically for Peter and was intended to incentivise him to remain with PACS and grow PTO (see [51] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">188 However, it is important to bear in mind that each agent and each agency group or unit operated as an independent business. An agent or AL could choose to work as little or as hard as he wanted to. At the material time, PTO was an alliance comprising Peter (in his capacity as a Master GAM and a GAM) and other GAMs. Each of these other GAMs could have operated independently. They opted to remain as part of PTO for business reasons. There was synergy in being part of a larger group, they were able to use Peter’s Professional Advisory Management System (“PAMS”) and they benefited from Peter’s training and leadership. PAMS was a franchise system that provided “a platform to recruit, supervise and train professional financial services advisers from rookie to management level”.

</div>
</div> Peter had developed a recruitment selection process (which he called BASE Camp) and it appears that he was very successful with recruiting agents. Having the various GAMs remain as part of PTO under Peter’s leadership did benefit PACS because the agents under Peter’s leadership performed better. However, whether the other GAMs remained in PTO was a decision that each GAM made for himself for business reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">189 PTO too operated as an independent business. As Master GAM, Peter continued to manage the other GAMs in PTO, but without CEDLI responsibility. PACS had little involvement in the management of PTO. Peter decided how he would run and manage PTO, including how to conduct recruitment drives, how he would train the agents in PTO and how roadshows should be organised. As a Master GAM, Peter was free to buy, or lease from a third party, his own office space for PTO. As a Master GAM, Peter was also paid a business allowance by PACS and he had complete discretion as to the allocation of the funds to the other GAMs in PTO. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">190 In my judgment, the nature of Peter’s relationship with PACS under the above circumstances does not call for the imposition of fiduciary duties. The GAMs chose to join PTO and Peter managed PTO as an independent business.  I agree with Peter that PACS did not entrust him with the management and control of the agents in PTO. Peter’s relationship with PACS did not rise beyond that of a purely commercial relationship. They were not in a relationship of mutual trust and confidence that would give rise to a legitimate expectation on PACS’ part that Peter would not utilise his position as Master GAM to act in a way adverse to PACS’ interests. As the Court of Appeal cautioned in <span class="font-italic">Turf Club</span> (at [45]), courts “will, and should, be slow in imposing fiduciary obligations on parties to a purely commercial relationship because it is normally inappropriate to expect a commercial party to subordinate its own interests to those of another commercial party”. Both Peter and PACS were “commercial parties capable of advancing and protecting their own business” (see <span class="font-italic">Turf Club</span>, at [45]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on Peter’s fiduciary duties</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">191 I find that Peter did not owe any fiduciary duties as pleaded by PACS. First, the relationship between Peter (as tied agent and AL) and PACS was not a legal relationship of agent-principal. Therefore, it did not fall within an established category of fiduciary relationships. Second, the circumstances surrounding Peter’s role as Master GAM of PTO did not give rise to a relationship of mutual trust and confidence such as to give rise to fiduciary obligations. Peter’s relationship with PACS was a purely commercial relationship, entered into between two experienced parties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">192 PACS’ claim against Peter for breach of fiduciary duties therefore fails.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the Preparatory Steps and/or Acts of Solicitation breached Peter’s contractual obligations and/or fiduciary duties</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">193 I have found that Peter did carry out the Preparatory Steps and Acts of Solicitations (see [89] and [92] above). I have also found that Peter owed a <span class="font-italic">contractual </span>obligation to conduct his insurance business with integrity and honesty pursuant to cl 18(a)(i) of his Agency Agreement, which required him to serve PACS with good faith and undivided interest and that the duty included a duty not to solicit PACS’ agents (during the currency of Peter’s Agency Agreement) to join a competitor (see [157] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">194 In my judgment, the Preparatory Steps and Acts of Solicitation breached Peter’s contractual obligation under cl 18(a)(i) of his Agency Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">195 In his defence, Peter pleaded that PACS had waived his breaches of contract.

</div> I reject Peter’s claim. I find that Peter incorporated PTOMC on 1 June 2016 for the purpose of entering into the DAA and that therefore, after its incorporation, PTOMC would have participated (through Peter, as its sole shareholder and director) in discussions with Aviva. The evidence is compelling:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Peter’s evidence that Aviva spoke to him about using a company to sign the DAA, in the first week of June 2016, cannot be correct. A draft consultancy agreement that Aviva sent to Peter on 31 May 2016 contemplated that Peter would be providing his services to Aviva through a private limited company that was to be incorporated.

The joint venture agreement, which was never executed formally, referred to the parties’ intention “to enter into a joint venture”. Subsequently, the 1st defendant became a joint venture partner of the plaintiff, with a 50% share in the proceeds of the project. The 1st defendant also became a 50% shareholder and director of the plaintiff.

He also resigned as a director of the plaintiff. The plaintiff sued the 1st defendant for breach of director’s duties by diverting the maturing business opportunity from the plaintiff, and for inducing a breach of the contract between FYTA and the plaintiff. The plaintiff sued the 2nd defendant for knowing receipt of the diverted opportunity and for dishonestly assisting the 1st defendant in the breach of his duties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">209 The Court found that project was a maturing business opportunity and that the 1st defendant breached his fiduciary duties by acquiring the corporate opportunity of the plaintiff for himself and thus became a constructive trustee for the plaintiff in respect of the fruits of the opportunity to participate in the project (at [93], [123] and [129]).

The Court also found that the 2nd defendant possessed actual knowledge of matters that made its assistance dishonest by imputing the knowledge of the 1st defendant (who was the controlling mind and will of the 2nd defendant) to the 2nd defendant (at [133]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">211 PACS submitted that the present case is analogous to <span class="font-italic">Innovative</span> and that Peter’s purpose for incorporating PTOMC and getting PTOMC to sign the DAA was to facilitate Peter’s receipt of payments from Aviva for services rendered by him personally and in an attempt to distance himself from Aviva.

</div> By entering into the DAA and being the corporate vehicle through which Peter received the Aviva Payments and/or the Aviva Long-term Business Partnership, PTOMC assisted in Peter’s breach by enabling him to receive the fruits of his breach of fiduciary duties without him being directly linked to Aviva.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">212 I agree with PTOMC that <span class="font-italic">Innovative </span>is distinguishable and that the facts of the present case do not support PACS’ case that PTOMC assisted Peter in the Acts of Solicitation.

Understandably, the Court found that the 2nd defendant had assisted in the continuing diversion of the opportunity by carrying on with the project. In the present case, all that can be said is that the Acts of Solicitation led to the exodus of agents leaving PACS to join AFA and culminated in the DAA.

</div> I disagree with PACS’ submissions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">224 “Solicitation” in the context of the prohibition of the solicitation of either employees or clients, simply means “to ask”, “to call for”, “to make a request”, “to petition”, “to entreat”, “to persuade”, or “to prefer a request”: <span class="font-italic">Tan Wee Fong v Denieru Tatsu F&amp;B Hold</span><span class="font-italic">ings (S) Pte Ltd </span>[2010] 2 SLR 298 at [24]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">225 However, solicitation requires some positive act. Merely creating the opportunity (no matter how enticing) cannot amount to solicitation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">226 In the present case, the Acts of Solicitation were positive acts taken by Peter. I have found that through these acts, Peter did solicit the Attendee ALs and, through them, PACS’ other agents in PTO to leave PACS to join AFA (see [92] above). That said, the number of agents who left PACS, as a result of the Acts of Solicitation, has a direct bearing on the amount of damages that PACS can claim. Peter is correct in his submission that PACS must still show that the Acts of Solicitation caused each of the Departed ALs and Agents to leave PACS.

</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">227 PACS submitted that there is no explanation for the mass exodus other than the Acts of Solicitation. PACS relied on <span class="font-italic">QBE Management Services (UK) Ltd v Dymoke</span> [2012] EWHC 80 (“<span class="font-italic">QBE</span>”). In that case, the 1st to 3rd defendants resigned from employment with the claimant to commence a start-up business with the 4th defendant. Over the next three months, another eight employees of the claimant resigned to join the 4th defendant. It was unusual for the claimant to lose so many employees in such a short space of time. On the question of proof of causation, the court held (at [273]) that the “correct approach is not to look simply at the individual breaches seriatim or in isolation, but to have regard to the totality of conduct complained of and ask whether the cumulative effect there is such as to have caused loss, damage or disadvantage to the Claimant”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">228 I agree that the court has to consider the whole matter holistically. However, PACS’ submission merely draws a causative link between the Acts of Solicitation and the “mass exodus”. It glosses over and begs the question as to whether each of the 244 of Departed ALs and Agents should be treated as part of the “mass exodus”. PACS has to show some causative link between the Acts of Solicitation and each of the Departed ALs and Agents.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">229 Peter negotiated with Aviva for the transition packages for the agents in PTO to join him at AFA. In addition, Peter, as PACS described it, orchestrated the mass exodus. In my judgment, these facts support a very strong inference that the Departed ALs and Agents left PACS as a result of the Acts of Solicitation if: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) they were part of PTO;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) they left PACS to join AFA; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) they gave notice of termination between 15 June 2015 and 8 July 2016. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">With respect to any of the Departed AL and Agents who do not satisfy these three criterion, PACS would need to adduce other evidence to prove that they left because of the Acts of Solicitation </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">230 The date 15 June 2015 is relevant because Peter testified that the plan was for the agents who were leaving PACS to do so on or around the same day; Peter referred to this date as the “press button” date.

PACS has not even pleaded the Pegasus Agreement, which PACS relies upon for its counterfactual. On the pleadings, Peter had left PACS. PACS’ counterfactual asserts a different fact (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that Peter would have remained with PACS). I agree with Peter that it was necessary for PACS to plead this factual assertion so that Peter would know the case that he had to meet and not be taken by surprise. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">240 In my view, Peter’s counterfactual is the appropriate counterfactual that applies in this case.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">241 Given the conclusion above, it is unnecessary for me to deal with the question as to whether, on the evidence, Peter would have remained with PACS if he had not carried out the Acts of Solicitation, and if so, for how long. However, I would add that, in my view, PACS’ claim for loss of profits beyond the initial six-year term of the Pegasus Agreement was too speculative. The central plank in PACS’ submission that Peter would have stayed with PACS was that he would have been incentivised, financially, to do so, and the Pegasus Agreement played a prominent role in this regard. However, the Pegasus Agreement was subject to renewal<span class="font-italic"> </span>after the first six years and any such renewal was to be on terms <span class="font-italic">to be agreed</span>. PACS has the burden of proving, on a balance of probabilities, that Peter and PACS would have reached agreement on the terms for the renewal of the Pegasus Agreement. On the evidence before me, PACS has not discharged its burden of proof. It is true that Peter would have lost any deferred amounts under the Pegasus Agreement if it was not renewed after the initial six-year term unless Peter “retired” (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, not participate in any kind of business for a year). Even so, whether Peter would have agreed to a renewal would still depend on the terms that PACS would have been prepared to offer. Peter also had the option of receiving payment of the deferred amount by “retiring” instead of renewing the Pegasus Agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">242  PACS’ scenario in which PTO persists in perpetuity is even more speculative. Again, PACS bears the burden of proving that Peter would have groomed a new generation of leaders capable of replacing him in PTO, before his retirement. Peter was clearly central to the success of PTO. Even leaving aside the question as to when Peter would have retired, nothing in the evidence before me gives any indication of the likelihood that Peter could have groomed a new generation of leaders capable of replacing him in PTO, before his retirement. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Computation of damages for PACS’ loss of profits claim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">243 The appropriate counterfactual in this case (see [238] above) means that the 23 Departed ALs and 204 Departed Agents would still have given their notices of termination and left PACS to join Peter. The difference in this counterfactual (compared to what actually happened) is that the 23 Departed ALs and 204 Departed Agents would have given their notices of termination at a later time, after 22 July 2016.

</div> Boulton computed the 2016 sales for this cohort based on the individual AL’s average full year sales since promotion. Peter’s quantum expert, Mr Chris Osborne (“Osborne”), took the view that the 2015 sales were the best estimator of the likely 2016 sales, based on his back-testing analysis. Boulton found that Osborne’s back testing analysis did not establish that, historically, prior sales were an accurate predictor of subsequent year’s sales; there were flaws and variances. In my view, Boulton’s approach of using the AL’s average full year sales since promotion should be adopted; I see no reason why it cannot provide a reliable estimate for the 2016 sales.  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) <span class="font-underline">ALs who were promoted in 2016</span>:

</div> Boulton computed the 2016 sales for this cohort based on 45% of the individual AL’s average full year sales as Tier 1 Agents. The pre-2016 sales for this cohort of ALs comprises sales made when they were Tier 1 Agents. It is common ground that ALs’ direct sales after promotion are lower than when they were Tier 1 Agents. Thus, it is necessary to discount the sales that were made as Tier 1 Agents. Boulton applied a 55% reduction based on the average reduction in sales by <span class="font-italic">all</span> ALs in PTO who were promoted from 2012 to 2015. Osborne proposed a 67% reduction based on the average reduction in sales by ten Departed ALs who were promoted in the period from 2012 to 2015. I accept Boulton’s 55% reduction.

It is not sufficient that the resulting breach was a mere natural consequence of the defendant’s conduct. The contract in question must also be a valid one.

</div>
</div>
</div> I reject this submission; I have found that Peter did owe PACS contractual obligations and that the Acts of Solicitation breached these obligations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">276 I agree with PACS that the evidence shows that the NDAs were entered into for the purpose of deceiving PACS and concealing Peter’s breaches of contractual obligations that were owed to PACS. Peter made the Attendee ALs sign the NDAs and threatened them that they would suffer the consequences if they leaked information about the move to AFA (see [104] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">277 I also agree with PACS that the NDAs fall within the category of contracts that are illegal at common law because they were entered into for an unlawful purpose. Allowing Peter to enforce the NDAs would be tantamount to condoning his breaches of contract. As the Court of Appeal said in <span class="font-italic">Ting Siew May</span> (at [46]) “the court will not permit the “guilty party” to benefit from his own (here, legal) wrong as this would be an affront to public policy. As a matter of public interest, the court should not appear to reward or condone a breach of the law…”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">278 With respect to the balancing exercise based on proportionality, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Ting Siew May </span>stated as follows (at [70]–[71]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">70  We would summarise the general factors which the courts should look at in assessing proportionality in the context of contracts entered into with the object of committing an illegal act as including the following: (a) whether allowing the claim would undermine the purpose of the prohibiting rule; (b) the nature and gravity of the illegality; (c) the remoteness or centrality of the illegality to the contract; (d) the object, intent, and conduct of the parties; and (e) the consequences of denying the claim.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">71  It should be emphasised that this is not necessarily a conclusive list of factors and, more importantly, that these factors should not be applied in a rigid or mechanistic fashion. Rather, these factors should be applied to each individual case, and weighed and considered by the court in the context of the particular facts of that case itself. All this underscores the very <span class="font-italic">fact-centric</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>nature of the inquiry that has to be undertaken by the court in this regard. This is not perhaps entirely satisfactory when viewed from a strictly theoretical perspective but is, in our view, only to be expected in the <span class="font-italic">practical</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>context in which the <span class="font-italic">application </span>of the law to the relevant <span class="font-italic">facts </span>is involved (and in which the inherently difficult concept of public policy (see above at [33]–[35]) is also involved). [emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">279 It is clear that striking down the NDAs for illegality in this case does not lead to a disproportionate result. Peter should not be permitted to use the NDAs to conceal his wrongful acts. In fact, upholding the NDAs would (a) stifle whistleblowing, (b) undermine the principle that the court will permit a guilty party to benefit from his own wrong, and (c) lead to Royston and Wendy (and other Attendee ALs) not being able to perform their own contractual obligations of integrity and honesty under their respective Agency Agreements. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">280 It cannot be the law that Peter should be allowed to bring a claim against PACS that is founded on the NDAs the purpose of which was to conceal his very own breaches of duties owed to PACS. Allowing such a claim would make a mockery of the law.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">PACS’ knowledge of the NDAs and PACS’ acts of inducement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">281 PACS, through Philip, would have known of the NDAs, or had reason to believe that the NDAs existed, by 2 June 2016. Philip admitted that by then, he had “heard unverified rumours that Peter had made the agents and ALs in PTO sign some kind of confidentiality agreement and they were all afraid to speak to anyone else in PACS”.

That was why Royston and Wendy were afraid to speak to Philip or share their recordings with PACS. Further, the fact that Philip wanted to take legal advice on whether Royston’s NDA was valid shows that Philip was aware that the NDA purported to prohibit whistleblowing. The fact that Philip did not know then who “Venus” was, did not matter; it was sufficient that he knew she was an agent in PTO. In my view, Philip (and therefore, PACS) was aware of the nature of the NDA. As was held in <span class="font-italic">Tribune</span>, knowledge of the precise terms is not necessary (see [270] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">284 It is also clear that PACS did ask Royston for his recordings of the meetings that he attended with the other Attendee ALs. Philip’s evidence is that on 16 June 2016, he asked Royston if Royston was willing to share his audio recordings with PACS; Royston sent the audio file to Philip by way of a google drive link.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">289 In <span class="font-italic">Edwin Hill &amp; Partners v First National Finance Corp plc</span> [1998] 3 All ER 801, the defendants provided a loan, secured by a legal charge, to a property developer to enable him to develop a property. The developer engaged the plaintiffs as architects but was unable to get the development started. The developer was unable to repay the loan. The defendant agreed to finance the development themselves instead of exercising their power of sale but as a condition of their becoming involved in the development, they insisted that the developer should dismiss the plaintiffs as architects for the development. The defendants considered that this was necessary if the development was to be successfully marketed. The developer terminated his contract with the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs sued the defendants alleging that they had unlawfully procured the developer to breach his contract with the plaintiffs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">290 The plaintiffs claim was dismissed at first instance on the ground that the defendants’ interference with the plaintiffs’ contract with the developer was justified. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, holding that if a defendant had an equal or superior legal right which would justify him in interfering with the plaintiff’s contractual rights with a third party, he would not be liable to the plaintiff if instead of exercising his strict legal rights he reached an accommodation with the third party which had the effect of interfering with the contract between the plaintiff and the third party. The Court of Appeal found that on the facts, the defendants’ right to receive payment of principal and interest on the loan to the developer was a superior right which justified their interference with the plaintiff’ contract with the developer. The Court noted that had the defendants exercised their rights as legal mortgagees to sell the property to appoint a receiver, the plaintiffs’ contract with the developer would necessarily have come to an end.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">291 PACS submitted that PACS had a legal right to be informed by Royston and Wendy of Peter’s misconduct because Royston and Wendy owed duties to PACS (under their respective Agency Agreements) to engage in honest conduct. PACS submitted that this right is equal or superior to any right that Peter may have against Royston and Wendy. I agree with PACS. Royston and Wendy would be in breach of their Agency Agreements with PACS if they did not inform PACS about Peter’s wrongful acts. In my view, PACS’ rights under its Agency Agreements with Royston and Wendy were at least equal to Peter’s rights against them under their NDAs.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on Peter’s counterclaim </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">292 Peter’s counterclaim for inducement of breach of contract is therefore dismissed. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Peter’s counterclaim against PACS for breach of confidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">293 Peter claims that PACS was aware or ought reasonably to have known that the Confidential Information that it obtained from Royston and Wendy was confidential and proprietary to Peter, and that PACS breached its equitable duty of confidence owed to Peter by using the Confidential Information to “contrive a version of events, which it published and continue to publish at paragraphs 15 to 19 of the [statement of claim] …”.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">307 PACS relied on <span class="font-italic">Singapore Shooting Association and others v Singapore Rifle Association </span>[2020] 1 SLR 395 (“<span class="font-italic">Singapore Shooting Association</span>”). In that case, the Court of Appeal held that legal fees incurred in investigating, detecting, unravelling and/or mitigating a conspiracy cannot constitute actionable loss or damage in the tort of unlawful means conspiracy if they are in substance the sort of expenses that would be incurred in preparation for litigation, and so would be recoverable as costs in any action that may be brought: at [92]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">308 I agree with PACS that <span class="font-italic">Singapore Shooting Association </span>applies to the present case. The legal costs incurred by Peter and any additional legal costs that he may have incurred in investigating, detecting, unravelling and/or mitigating the alleged conspiracy do not constitute actionable loss or damage for purposes of Peter’s counterclaim for conspiracy to injure. Peter has not shown that he incurred any legal costs that were not incurred in preparation for the litigation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">309 I also agree with PACS that the time that Peter spent fighting this action does not constitute actionable loss or damage for purposes of his counterclaim for conspiracy to injure. No authority to the contrary has been cited to me. Peter’s pleaded case is that the conspiracy involved PACS using the Confidential Information “to contrive a version of events … in support of its claim against [Peter]”. In other words, the alleged conspiracy only served to support PACS’ claim against Peter. Peter would necessarily have had to spend time defending the claim against him in any event, no different from any defendant to an action.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">310 Finally, with respect to Peter’s claim that he suffered losses including reputational loss, Peter has not identified any other loss except for reputational loss. Peter cannot claim for damages for injury to reputation under his claim for conspiracy to injure. Claims for injury to reputation should be made by way of an action for defamation: <span class="font-italic">McGregor on Damages </span>(James Edelman, Jason Varuhas &amp; Simon Colton gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 20th Ed, 2019) at para 48-025. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">311  I therefore dismiss Peter’s counterclaim for conspiracy to injure. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">312 Peter carried out the Preparatory Steps and Acts of Solicitation. However, </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Peter was, and is, not bound by the Non-Solicitation Clause (see [153] above);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) there was no implied term in his Field Manager Agreement that includes a duty not to entice or attempt to entice PACS’ ALs and agents in PTO to leave PACS and join a competitor firm (see [170] above);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Peter’s role as a tied agent and AL did not give rise to any legal relationship of agent and principal with PACS that is relevant in this case and therefore did not fall within an established category of fiduciary relationship (see [191] above); and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Peter’s role as Master GAM of PTO did not give rise to fiduciary obligations in connection with the management of the agents in PTO (see [191]) above. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">313 PACS’ claims for breach of the Non-Solicitation Clause, breach of the implied term in Peter’s Field Manager Agreement and breach of fiduciary duties are therefore dismissed (see [153], [170] and [192] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">314 As PACS has failed in its claim against Peter for breach of fiduciary duties, PACS’ claim against PTOMC for dishonest assistance is also dismissed (see [202] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">315 Peter had a contractual obligation under his Agency Agreement to conduct his insurance business with integrity and honesty. This obligation required Peter to serve PACS with good faith and undivided interest; Peter should not do anything, during the currency of the agency, which may harm PACS. This duty included a duty not to solicit PACS’ agents (during the currency of Peter’s Agency Agreement) to join a competitor (see [157] above). The Preparatory Steps and Acts of Solicitation breached Peter’s contractual obligation under his Agency Agreement (see [194] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">316 Twenty-three Departed ALs and 204 Departed Agents left PACS as a result of the Acts of Solicitation (see [234] above). PACS’ claims for loss suffered in respect of the remaining 17 Departed Agents are dismissed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">317 The appropriate counterfactual for the purposes of assessing PACS’ loss is one in which (a) Peter would have negotiated with Aviva and given his notice of termination on 8 July 2016, (b) he would have solicitated the Departed ALs and Agents to join him as soon as it was legally permissible for him to do so (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, after 22 July 2016), (c) the 23 Departed ALs and 204 Departed Agents would have left PACS to join him, and (d) PTO would have ceased to exist after Peter’s departure (see [238] and [240] above).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">318 Peter is liable to PACS for the profits that PACS could have earned from the 23 Departed ALs and 204 Departed Agents for the Loss Period (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, between 9 May 2016 and 23 July 2016) (see [246] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">319 Boulton is to compute the amount of PACS’ loss using (a) his approach in computing the sales that the 23 Departed ALs and 204 Departed Agents could have made in 2016 and pro rating the sales to the Loss Period, (b) his weighted average approach, and (c) the NBP calculated by Rubin (see [261] above).

<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Decision of General Division of the High Court (delivered by Justice Chua Lee Ming):</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Outcome:<em> </em>High Court holds that the first defendant is liable for breach of his contractual obligation to conduct his insurance business with integrity and honesty. The other claims against the first and second defendants are dismissed. The first defendant’s counterclaims are also dismissed.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Pertinent and significant points of the judgment</span></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">A contractual duty of integrity and honesty requires a contracting party to serve the other contractual party with good faith and undivided interest: at <strong>[157]</strong>.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The relationship between an insurance agent (who acts as an independent contractor to an insurance company) and the insurance company is not a legal relationship of agent and principal, except when explaining the insurance company’s policies to potential clients and assessing the suitability of the policies for the client: at <strong>[181] </strong>and <strong>[182]</strong>.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Where insurance agents (who are all independent contractors) decide to operate as a group under the leadership of one agent, the agent who is managing the other agents in the group does not, in doing so, owe fiduciary duties to the insurance company: at <strong>[188] </strong>to<strong> [190]</strong>. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">A non-disclosure agreement entered into for the purpose of deceiving others and to conceal breaches of contract is entered into for an unlawful purpose.

</ul>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><strong>Background</strong></font> </p>
<p><span>1<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>The first defendant, Peter Tan Shou Yi (“Peter”) became an agent of the plaintiff, <span>Prudential Assurance Co Singapore (Pte) Ltd</span> (“PACS”) in 1997 when he signed an Agency Agreement with PACS. In 2001, he was promoted and signed a Field Manager Agreement. He rose through the ranks and eventually became a Group Agency Manager (“GAM”) in 2006 and subsequently a Master GAM in 2011.</p>
<p><span>2<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>As a Master GAM, Peter ran Peter Tan Organisation (“PTO”), which was the biggest and most successful group of agents selling insurance products for PACS. PTO contributed approximately 10% of PACS’ entire agency force sales production. As of 2016, there were about 500 agents in PTO.</p>
<p><span>3<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>Around mid-April 2016, Peter met with representatives from Aviva Limited (“Aviva”) and explored the idea of him being a consultant with Aviva. Thereafter, several documents, including letters of appointment were sent to Peter. Peter met with Aviva again in early May 2016 to discuss transition packages to be given to any agents who also wished to join Aviva. Aviva subsequently sent Peter draft contracts for agents.</p>
<p><span>4<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>At the relevant time, rumours were circulating around the insurance industry that Peter was leaving with agents of PTO to join another insurance company. In late May 2016, Peter assured PACS’ Chief Agency Officer that the rumours were not true. Peter also informed PACS’ Chief Executive Officer that he had no intention to leave PACS.</p>
<p><span>5<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>Subsequently, in May and June 2016, Peter met with several of his Agency Leaders (“ALs”) on a few occasions. Peter spoke to these ALs about, among other things, a potential move to Aviva’s subsidiary financial advisory firm, Aviva Financial Advisors Pte Ltd (“AFA”). He also spoke to them about the advantages of joining AFA, the financial package offered by AFA and what the ALs should say to the agents under them. Non-disclosure agreements were signed by the ALs who attended these meetings.</p>
<p><span>6<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>On 1 June 2016, Peter incorporated the second defendant, PTO Management and Consultancy Pte Ltd (“PTOMC”). Peter was the sole shareholder and director of PTOMC.</p>
<p><span>7<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>On 15 June 2016, 140 agents from PTO gave notices of termination of their agreements with PACS. More agents started giving notices of termination thereafter and by the end of February 2017, a total of 244 agents had terminated their agreements with PACS. Of the 244 agents, 241 of them were from PTO. Peter himself gave his 14-days’ notice of termination on 8 July 2016. On 12 July 2016, PACS terminated Peter’s agreement with the plaintiff for breach of the agreements.</p>
<p><span>8<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>On 23 July 2016, Aviva, Peter and PTOMC entered into a Distribution Advisory Agreement under which PTOMC was to be the exclusive provider of certain services to AFA for a period of ten years. These services included, among other things, (a) providing strategic direction and assisting in the development of business plans to grow AFA; (b) providing group training sessions to AFA’s representatives; (c) providing strategic advice and know-how to Aviva on recruitment; and (d) providing strategic advice to Aviva on how to increase Aviva’s market share through AFA and to improve its competitiveness in the market. PTOMC was to engage Peter to perform these services.</p>
<p><span>9<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>PACS claimed that Peter took preparatory steps to leave PACS and to bring with him other agents in PTO to join a competitor of PACS, Aviva and/or AFA (“Preparatory Steps”) and solicited agents in PTO to leave PACS and join AFA (“Acts of Solicitation”). PACS submitted that the Preparatory Steps and Acts of Solicitation breached Peter’s express and implied contractual obligations and also fiduciary duties owed to PACS. PACS thus claimed that Peter is liable for damages suffered for these breaches and alternatively, liable for account of all profits made by him and PTOMC (as his alter ego) in breach of his fiduciary duties.</p>
<p><span>10<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>PACS also claimed against PTOMC for dishonestly assisting Peter to breach his fiduciary duties and is thus liable to PACS for damages and alternatively, an account of all benefits received by PTOMC as of result of its dishonest assistance.</p>
<p><span>11<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>Peter counterclaimed against PACS for (a) wrongful termination of his Agency Agreement with PACS; (b) wrongfully inducing one or more of the ALs who attended the meetings with him to breach their non-disclosure agreements with him; (c) breach of its equitable duty of confidence to him by disclosing the confidential information obtained from one or more of the ALs; and (d) conspiring with one or more of the ALs to cause loss to Peter by unlawful means.</p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><strong>The court's decision</strong></font></p>
<p><span>12<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>The court found that Peter did carry out the Preparatory Steps and Acts of Solicitation. Peter did discuss with Aviva an arrangement involving him (a) procuring agents in PTO to leave PACS to join Aviva and/or AFA; and (b) joining Aviva and/or AFA to train and manage these agents. Peter also solicited his ALs to leave PACS to join AFA and/or asked them to persuade other agents in PTO to do so: at <strong>[89] </strong>and<strong> [106]</strong>.</p>
<p><span>13<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>The High Court found that by undertaking the Preparatory Steps and Acts of Solicitation, Peter had breached his contractual obligation under clause 18(a)(i) of his Agency Agreement (at <strong>[194]</strong>). However, the court dismissed all other claims by PACS against Peter and PTOMC (at <strong>[153]</strong>,<strong> [170]</strong>,<strong> [192]</strong>,<strong> [202]</strong>). The court also dismissed all of Peter’s counterclaims: at <strong>[267]</strong>,<strong> [292]</strong>,<strong> [295] </strong>and<strong> [311]</strong>.</p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><strong><em>Peter's contractual obligations</em></strong></font></p>
<p><span>14<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>The court found that Peter had breached his contractual obligation under clause 18(a)(i) of his Agency Agreement,<span> which provided that he shall “conduct his insurance business with integrity and honesty”.</span> This clause required him <span>to serve PACS with good faith and undivided interest. Peter should also not do anything, during the currency of the Agency Agreement, which may harm PACS, including not soliciting PACS’ agents to join a competitor: at </span><strong>[157]</strong>.</p>
<p><span>15<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>The court found that a non-solicitation clause in an Agency Instruction sent out by PACS in September 2010 (“September 2010 AI”) was reasonable and enforceable at least in so far as it prohibited solicitation during the currency of Peter’s Agency Agreement (at <strong>[153]</strong>). However, the court found that the September 2010 AI was not effective to incorporate the non-solicitation clause into Peter’s Agency Agreement and Field Manager Agreement. According to the terms of Peter’s Agency Agreement and Field Manager Agreement, PACS cannot unilaterally vary or modify these agreements. Since Peter had not agreed to the non-solicitation clause in the September 2010 AI, he was not bound by it: at <strong>[108] </strong>to <strong>[120] </strong>and<strong> [122] </strong>to<strong> [127]</strong>.</p>
<p><span>16<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>The court rejected PACS’ argument that there was an implied term in Peter’s Field Manager Agreement that Peter shall not conduct himself in a manner that would likely destroy or seriously damage the relationship of confidence and trust between him and PACS. <span>PACS pleaded the non-solicitation obligation as an example of an obligation under this term. </span>The court found that the three requirements for implication of a term are not satisfied. <span>First, it is unlikely that PACS did not contemplate non-solicitation obligations when it entered into the Field Manager Agreement with Peter. Secondly, it was not necessary to imply the proposed term in order to give the Field Manager Agreement efficacy. Finally, the parties would not have responded “Oh, of course!” had the proposed term been put to them at the time of the contract: at <strong>[166] </strong>to <strong>[170]</strong>.</span></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><strong><em>Peter's fiduciary duties</em></strong></font></p>
<p><span>17<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span><span>The court found that the facts do not call for the imposition of fiduciary duties. PACS did not entrust Peter with the management and control of the agents in PTO. His relationship with PACS did not rise beyond that of a purely commercial relationship. They were not in a relationship of mutual trust and confidence that would give rise to a legitimate expectation on PACS’ part that Peter would not utilise his position as Master GAM to act in a way adverse to PACS’ interests: at </span><strong>[190]</strong>.</p>
<p><span>18<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>Since Peter did not owe PACS any fiduciary duty, PACS’ claim against PTOMC for dishonestly assisting Peter in breaching his fiduciary duties was dismissed: at <strong>[202]</strong>.</p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><strong><em>Peter's counterclaims</em></strong></font></p>
<p><span>19<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>The court found that PACS was entitled to rely on Peter’s breach of clause 18(a)(i) of his Agency Agreement as a defence against Peter’s counterclaim for wrongful termination of the Agency Agreement: at <strong>[267]</strong>.</p>
<p><span>20<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>Peter’s counterclaim against PACS for inducing breaches of the non-disclosure agreements was also dismissed. The court found that the non-disclosure agreements were entered into for the illegal purpose of deceiving PACS and to conceal Peter’s breach of contract. The court also found that striking down the non-disclosure agreements for illegality would not be disproportionate. Further, to allow Peter to bring a claim against PACS founded upon such an agreement would make a mockery of the law: at <strong>[277] </strong>to<strong> [280]</strong>.</p>
<p><span>21<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>In any event, even if the non-disclosure agreements were valid, PACS’ conduct was justified in the circumstances of the case. Since Peter owed PACS a duty to engage in honest conduct, PACS had a right that is equal or superior to any right that Peter may have against the ALs who had allegedly breached the non-disclosure agreements: at <strong>[291]</strong>.</p>
<p><span>22<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>Given the court’s finding that the non-disclosure agreements are illegal and unenforceable, Peter's counterclaim for breach of confidence was dismissed: at <strong>[295]</strong>.</p>
<p><span>23<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>The court also dismissed Peter’s counterclaim for unlawful means conspiracy because he had failed to prove an agreement between PACS and the relevant ALs to use the confidential information to “contrive a version of events”, which PACS had set out in its statement of claim. He had also failed to prove any unlawful acts carried out by PACS: at <strong>[300] </strong>to<strong> [302]</strong>.</p>
<p><span>24<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>Further, Peter had not suffered any loss as a result of the alleged conspiracy. Legal costs incurred <span>do not constitute actionable loss or damage for purposes of Peter’s counterclaim for conspiracy to injure. Peter’s claim for reputational losses should also be recovered by way of an action for defamation instead: at <strong>[308] </strong>to<strong> [310]</strong>.</span></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><strong><em>Losses suffered by PACS</em></strong></font></p>
<p><span>25<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span><span>The court found that out of the 244 ALs and agents who left PACS, Peter was only liable for the profits that PACS could have earned for 227 of them (23 ALs and 204 agents). PACS’ claims for loss suffered for the remaining 17 agents were dismissed: at </span><strong>[234]</strong>.</p>
<p><span>26<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>For the purposes of calculating the loss of profits that PACS suffered, PACS submitted that the appropriate counterfactual is one in which </p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>(a) Peter would have remained with PACS and continued to manage and operate PTO; and </p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>(b) Peter would have left PACS </p>
<p><span><span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>(i)</span>In 2019 (after which PTO would have ceased to exist); or</p>
<p><span><span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>(ii)</span>In 2025 (after which PTO would have ceased to exist); or</p>
<p><span><span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>(iii)</span>Upon his retirement (after which PTO would have continued to persist into perpetuity). In this context, Peter would be considered to have retired if he terminated his agency agreement with PACS and did not join a competitor or otherwise compete with PACS for one year: at <strong>[235]</strong>.</p>
<p><span>27<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>The court rejected PACS' counterfactual and instead agreed with Peter that the appropriate counterfactual is one in which (a) <span>Peter would have negotiated with Aviva and given his notice of termination on 8 July 2016; (b) he would have solicited the ALs and agents to join him as soon as it was legally permissible for him to do so, <em>ie</em>, after his two-weeks’ notice; (c) the ALs and agents would have left PACS to join him; and (d) PTO would have ceased to exist after Peter’s departure: at <strong>[240]</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>28<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span><span>The court directed the plaintiff’s quantum expert to re-compute PACS’ loss based on the above counterfactual: at <strong>[261]</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>29<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span><span>The court dismissed PACS’ claim for loss of productivity of the 23 ALs and 204 agents who left and the ALs and agents in PTO who did not leave PACS. Under the counterfactual adopted by the court, Peter would have left PACS anyway and would have been free to solicit the 23 ALs and 204 agents after the expiry of his two-weeks’ notice. This meant that PACS would have suffered such losses anyway: at <strong>[263] </strong>and<strong> [266]</strong>. </span></p>
