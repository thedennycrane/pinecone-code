<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an application taken
                    out by the second defendant, Gleneagles Hospital
                    (“Gleneagles”), asking for the following
                    prayers in respect of the plaintiff, Li Siu Lun
                    (“Li”):</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">that Li submit himself for an
                            examination by a psychiatric expert to be appointed

<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">that leave be given for

                            (“AEIC”) on behalf of Gleneagles;
                            and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">that the action be stayed

                            clinical examinations on Li which are reasonably
                            required by Gleneagles’ appointed
                            experts.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The issue of when a medical
                    examination can be ordered against an unwilling party
                    appears to be a novel issue before the Singapore courts.
                    This judgment will thus examine whether the court has the
                    power to order a medical examination; and if so, what the
                    test should be.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The background facts
                    relevant to the present application will be briefly stated.
                    Li is a British citizen, resident in Hong Kong. He is self
                    employed as a property and stock trader.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The first defendant, Dr Looi
                    Kok Poh (“Dr Looi”), is a consultant hand
                    surgeon who was at all material times running a private
                    practice at the Pacific Hand, Wrist and Microsurgical
                    Centre, Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Gleneagles maintains and
                    manages a private hospital which employs and engages
                    doctors, nurses and other staff for the purposes of
                    hospitalisation/surgical services for
                patients.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Li had suffered an injury to
                    his right hand (his “Hand”) in 1989, and had
                    this treated by a surgical procedure (the “First
                    Surgery”) at the Prince of Wales Hospital in Hong
                    Kong. While Li had good general function and use of his Hand
                    after the First Surgery, he suffered from certain
                    complications (the
                “Complications”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       On a business trip to
                    Singapore in 2006, Li consulted Dr Looi regarding the
                    Complications. Subsequently, Dr Looi performed a surgery on
                    Li on 26 April 2006 at Gleneagles (the “Second
                    Surgery”). Li’s case is that the condition of
                    his Hand worsened after the Second Surgery. Li then brought
                    a claim against Dr Looi for the personal injury allegedly
                    caused by Dr Looi, alleging, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, breach of contract and/or duty of care;
                    and/or battery. Li’s case against Dr Looi has since
                    been settled, and in any case, it is not relevant to the
                    present application which only involves Li and
                    Gleneagles.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Li also brought a claim
                    against Gleneagles, alleging that Gleneagles had conspired
                    with Dr Looi to cause Li’s consent form for the Second
                    Surgery and other medical records to be altered in a bid to
                    assist Dr Looi to cover up his negligence, alleging,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, breach of
                    contract and/or statutory duty and/or duty of care and/or
                    fiduciary duty. It will be observed that Li’s claim
                    against Gleneagles was <em>not</em> for
                    personal injury. Damages, including aggravated damages and
                    punitive/exemplary damages were sought for the loss of
                    Li’s right to an accurate and proper set of medical
                    records and financial loss and damages incurred in having to
                    commence legal proceedings against parties other than Dr
                    Looi and Gleneagles (Li had sought interrogatories from a
                    nurse who was working at Gleneagles to establish his case
                    that the medical records had been <em>inter
                        alia</em> altered/amended). In support of the
                    claim for aggravated damages, Li pleaded in his Statement of
                    Claim (“SOC”) that as a result of
                    Gleneagles’ acts, he had “suffered and
                    continues to suffer considerable anger, outrage and
                        distress”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       An interlocutory judgment on
                    liability has been entered for Li against Gleneagles. The
                    matter is now approaching the stage of the assessment of
                    Li’s damages against Gleneagles
                    (“AD”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The present proceedings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The present proceedings
                    concern Li’s allegation that he was depressed as a
                    result of Gleneagles’ acts. In Li’s AEIC
                    affirmed on 17 February 2012, he claimed that he
                    suffered “grave mental anguish and/or distress ...
                    [and] depression”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Gleneagles’ case is
                    that the court should exercise its powers under s 18 read
                    with para 19 of the First Schedule of the Supreme Court of
                    Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) (“SCJA”)
                    to order the medical examination of a person who is a party
                    to any proceedings where the physical or mental condition of
                    the person is relevant to any matter in question in the
                    proceedings. As Li had alleged depression in support of an
                    award of aggravated damages, counsel for Gleneagles argues
                    that Li’s mental condition is thus in issue and is a
                    matter relevant to the proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Li’s case is that
                    the court should <em>not</em> exercise
                    its power under s 18 read with para 19 of the First Schedule
                    of the SCJA as (i) Gleneagles’ request for medical
                    examination was not reasonable as the medical examination
                    was not required for Gleneagles to properly prepare its
                    defence; and (ii) Li had a reasonable apprehension that any
                    examiner proposed by Gleneagles would not make a just
                    determination of the cause.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Analysis and decision </p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Jurisdictional issues </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     There are two related but
                    distinct issues to be determined under the heading of
                    “jurisdictional issues”. Firstly, whether the
                    court has a power to make a <em>direct
                        order</em> for a plaintiff to submit himself to a
                    medical examination (“Direct Order”), or
                    whether the court’s power is confined to ordering a
                        <em>stay</em> of proceedings unless
                    and until the plaintiff submit himself to a medical
                    examination (“Stay”). Secondly, whether an
                    Assistant Registrar (“AR”), as opposed to a
                    High Court Judge, has the power to grant either a Direct
                    Order and/or a Stay.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     In English law, there is
                    no statutory power enabling the court to order a medical
                    examination “but the common law has found a
                    solution”, <em>viz</em>, that
                    the court has inherent jurisdiction to order a Stay in
                    appropriate circumstances (Steyn LJ, as he then was,
                    concurring in <em>Jackson v Mirror Group
                        Newspapers Ltd and Another</em> (The Times,
                    17 March 1994) (“<em>Jackson</em>”)). The presence of this
                    inherent jurisdiction was first observed in <em>Edmeades v Thames Board Mills Ltd</em>
                    [1969] 2 QB 67 (“<em>Edmeades</em>”) at 71, where Lord Denning,
                    noting that there was no legislation on whether the court
                    had power to grant a Stay, stated that he “[did] not
                    think legislation [was] necessary” as the court has
                    “ample jurisdiction to grant a stay whenever it is
                    just and reasonable to do so”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     By contrast, in Singapore,
                    the power order a medical examination has been codified in
                    statutory form. Section 18 of the SCJA provides as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">Powers of High Court </p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">18.—(1) The High Court shall have such powers as
                        are vested in it by any written law for the time being
                        in force in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    Without prejudice to the
                            generality of subsection (1), the High Court shall
                            have the powers set out in the First
                            Schedule.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3)    The powers referred to in
                            subsection (2) shall be exercised in accordance with
                            any written law or Rules of Court related to
                            them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Pursuant to s 18(2) of the
                    SCJA, the High Court has the powers set out in the First
                    Schedule. Paragraph 19 of the First Schedule of the SCJA
                    provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">Ordering medical
                        examination</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">19. Power to order medical examination of a person who
                        is a party to any proceedings where the physical or
                        mental condition of the person is relevant to any matter
                        in question in the proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Before going on to examine
                    whether the power to order a medical examination extends to
                    a Direct Order, I will first consider whether, as an AR, I
                    have the power to grant an order for medical examination.
                    Counsel for Gleneagles directed me to s 2 of the SCJA, where
                    a Judge is defined as:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">a Judge of the High Court and includes the Chief
                        Justice and <em>any person appointed to
                            exercise the powers of a Judge</em> [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Section 62(1) of the SCJA
                    provides that an AR shall have the “jurisdiction,
                    powers and duties as may be prescribed by Rules of
                    Court”. Pursuant to O 32 r 9(1) read with O 1
                    r 4(1) of the Rules, an AR has the <em>same powers and jurisdiction</em> as
                    a Judge in Chambers. As a matter of practice, ARs routinely
                    hear certain applications and have the power to grant
                    certain orders which also fall under the First Schedule of
                    the SCJA, <em>inter alia</em>,
                    discovery and interrogatories, and costs (paras 12 and 13 of
                    the First Schedule). I thus find that I have the power to
                    order a medical examination. For completeness, it is noted
                    that the District Courts and Magistrates’ Courts have
                    the corresponding power and may order a medical examination
                    of a person who is a party to any proceedings in both civil
                    and criminal matters where the physical or mental condition
                    of the person is “relevant to any matter in question
                    in the proceedings” (see ss 31(2)(<em>c</em>); 50(1)(<em>b</em>);
                        51(1)(<em>b</em>) and
                        52(1B)(<em>b</em>)(iii) of the
                    Subordinate Courts Act (Cap 321, 2007 Rev
                Ed)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Having decided that I have
                    the power to order a medical examination, I will now return
                    to the issue of the scope of the power to order a medical
                    examination, <em>ie</em>, whether it
                    extends to a Direct Order or only comprises a Stay. While
                    para 19 of the First Schedule of the SCJA provides that the
                    High Court has the “[p]ower to order medical
                    examination”, the express wording is not conclusive,
                    as the “order” in question is not defined as
                    either a Direct Order or as a Stay. While <em>Singapore Court Practice 2009</em> (Jeffrey
                    Pinsler, gen ed) (LexisNexis, 2009) (“<em>Singapore Court Practice
                    2009</em>”) notes at para 25/3/11 that the
                    court is “specifically empowered to order a medical
                    examination”, the learned editor goes on to discuss
                    principles governing the court’s exercise of its
                    discretion to grant a Stay. This is perhaps unsurprising, as
                    the cases referred to at para 25/3/11 are English cases
                    where the courts have only granted a Stay rather than a
                    Direct Order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The guiding principle
                    behind the English cases is that to require a claimant to
                    submit to a medical examination is, “to an extent,
                    intrusive and must be justified as necessary”
                        (<em>Edwards-Tubb v J D Wetherspoon
                        plc</em> [2011] 1 WLR 1373 at [18]). In the case of a
                    Direct Order, this concern is heightened as a Direct Order
                    leaves the plaintiff caught between the Scylla of a
                    potentially intrusive medical examination and the Charybdis
                    of contempt of court proceedings being initiated against
                    him. The reason for this is that a Direct Order is an order
                    of court, thus its breach will presumably amount to contempt
                    of court, as noted by Widgery LJ in <em>Edmeades</em> (at p72):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… I can see the objections that would be raised
                        if it were sought to give the court power to make a
                        direct order for medical examination with, <em>presumably power to commit the plaintiff
                            for contempt if he refused</em>. …
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     However, it might be
                    argued that a Stay also leaves the plaintiff with the hard
                    choice of being “[shut] out ... from the seat of
                    justice” or compelled “against his will to
                    submit to a medical examination; ... an invasion of his
                    personal liberty” (<em>Lane v Willis
                        &amp; anor appeal</em> [1972] 1 WLR 326
                        (“<em>Lane v
                    Willis</em>”) at 68). It might then be further
                    argued that the invasion of the plaintiff’s personal
                    liberty in such a case is justified, as the issue of a
                    medical examination only arises where it is relevant to the
                    proceedings before the court. As the argument would go,
                    where the plaintiff has <em>himself chosen to
                        put his mental or physical condition in
                    issue</em>, thus causing it to become relevant to the
                    court proceedings, it behoves the plaintiff to agree to a
                    reasonable request by the defendant for a medical
                    examination. This view was stated by Millett LJ (as he then
                    was) in <em>Hookham v Wiggins Teape Fine
                        Papers Limited</em> [1995] PIQR p392 at
                    p400:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... A plaintiff chooses to sue; a defendant has no
                        choice whether to be sued or not. A plaintiff who sues
                        for damages for personal injury must afford the
                        defendant a reasonable opportunity to have
                        him medically examined. By choosing to
                        sue <em>he forgoes his right to protest
                            at the invasion of his privacy which
                            a medical examination involves</em>.
                        If he refuses such an examination his action
                        may be stayed. ... [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">I am in full agreement with Millett LJ that the
                    rationale behind the court’s power to order a medical
                    examination is that a plaintiff who chooses to sue for
                    damages based on his medical condition must afford the
                    defendant a reasonable opportunity to have him medically
                    examined, and thus foregoes the right to protest the
                    invasion of his privacy which a medical examination
                    involves.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Even so, I note that this
                    rationale was used by Millett LJ to justify the grant of
                        <em>a Stay </em><em>and not a Direct Order</em>. While a Stay may
                    deny the plaintiff from pursuing his claim, a Direct Order
                    goes further as it adds potential contempt of court
                    proceedings on top of denying the plaintiff from pursuing
                    his claim; a consequence I find to be disproportionately
                    adverse. The court has the power under O 52 of the Rules to
                    make an order of committal in the appropriate case to punish
                    for contempt of court (for the rationale and test for the
                    court’s power to punish for contempt see <em>Sembcorp Marine Ltd v Aurol Anthony
                        Sabastian</em> [2012] SGHC 52 at
                        [33] –
                    [34]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The reason why I find the
                    consequence to be disproportionately adverse is that an
                    order of a medical examination involves <em>two competing sets of rights</em> and a Direct
                    Order creates an imbalance between the two rights. In
                        <em>Starr v National Coal
                        Board</em> [1977] 1 WLR 63 (“<em>Starr</em>”) at 70 – 71,
                    Scarman LJ framed this as a balance between the
                    plaintiff’s right to personal liberty and the
                    defendant’s right to defend himself in litigation as
                    he thinks fit (which includes the right to choose expert
                    witnesses). The only gloss that I would add to this analysis
                    is that the term “personal liberty” might not
                    be apposite in the local context (given the interpretation
                    of the term in <em>Lo Pui Sang and others v
                        Mamata </em><em>Kapildev Dave and
                        others (Horizon Partners Pte Ltd, intervener) and other
                        appeals</em> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 754 at [6]) and the term
                    “bodily integrity” might be a better
                    formulation of the plaintiff’s right. To my mind, the
                    defendant’s right to defend himself in litigation as
                    he thinks fit is <em>sufficiently protected
                        </em><em>by a Stay</em>. If
                    the plaintiff chooses not to submit to a medical examination
                    upon the order of a Stay, he will be unable to pursue his
                    claim any further, and the defendant’s right to defend
                    himself will <em>no longer be
                        engaged</em> as there will be no claim left to
                    defend. With the defendant’s right to defend himself
                    lifted off the balancing scales by the effect of a Stay, the
                    plaintiff’s right to bodily integrity becomes
                    weightier and the plaintiff ought not to be put in the
                    position of having to choose between an unwanted and
                    potentially invasive medical examination and having
                    committal proceedings initiated against him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     I am thus of the view that
                    the court’s power to order a medical examination only
                    comprises the power to order a Stay and not a Direct Order.
                    Having considered parties’ arguments, I am of the view
                    that a Stay is justified in the present case. I will now
                    give my reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether Li’s mental condition is relevant
                to any matter in question in the proceedings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Before I exercise the
                    power to order a medical examination, I must first be
                    satisfied that Li’s mental condition is
                    “relevant to any matter in question in the
                    proceedings” (para 19 of the First Schedule for the
                    SCJA).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     I find that this
                    precondition is met, as Li had raised the issue of his
                    mental condition (be it mental distress and/or depression),
                    in support of his claim for aggravated damages (see above at
                        <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> and <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a>). Therefore, Li’s
                    mental condition is relevant to the issue of aggravated
                    damages in the proceedings before the court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The test for a medical examination to be
                ordered</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     As noted earlier (at
                        <a href="#p1_2">[2]</a>), the issue of
                    when a medical examination can be ordered against an
                    unwilling party is a novel issue before the Singapore
                    courts. Before me, parties have relied on English cases, and
                    I will examine these decisions to see if the principles
                    expounded therein are applicable in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The “reasonableness” test</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The
                    “reasonableness” test was elucidated in
                        <em>Edmeades</em> and affirmed in
                        <em>Lane v Willis</em>, two
                    decisions of the English Court of Appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     In <em>Edmeades</em> at 71, Lord Denning held that the
                    test for the order of a medical examination was <em>whether the defendant’s request that the
                        plaintiff submit to medical examination was
                        reasonable</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In <em>Lane
                        v Willis</em> at 330, Davies LJ affirmed the test
                    was one of “reasonableness” and framed the
                    test in the following manner:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... In the circumstances, was the defendant’s
                        request for a further psychiatric examination
                        reasonable; or was the plaintiff’s refusal to
                        submit himself to it reasonable?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     It can thus be seen that
                    the court will balance the reasonableness of the
                    defendant’s request against the reasonableness of the
                    plaintiff’s refusal (the “balance of
                    reasonableness test”). The reason for the balancing
                    exercise is that there are two competing rights involved in
                    an order for medical examination, <em>viz</em>, the plaintiff’s right to bodily
                    integrity and the defendant’s right to defend himself
                    in litigation as he thinks fit (see above at <a href="#p1_22">[22]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     As our statutory
                    provisions are silent on the applicable test, it appears to
                    me that the balance of reasonableness test is one which is
                    open to the Singapore courts to adopt. In fact, it is almost
                    trite to say that whenever the court has a discretion, it
                    should exercise it reasonably. I will now turn to apply the
                    test.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Reasonableness of Gleneagles’ request </p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Whether Gleneagles requires its own
                medical examination of Li in order to properly conduct its
                defence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Li’s case is that a
                    defendant’s request for medical examination will only
                    be reasonable if it is unable to properly conduct its
                    defence without its own medical examination of the
                    plaintiff, <em>eg</em>, where the
                    entire liability of the defendant rests on the sufficient
                    establishment of an injury in the plaintiff’s cause of
                    action. In the present case, as Li’s depression was
                    not claimed as a separate head of damages but only pleaded
                    in support of his claim for aggravated damages, counsel for
                    Li argues that Gleneagles would not require its own medical
                    examination of Li in order to properly conduct its defence.
                    Counsel for Li further submits that if Gleneagles wanted to
                    challenge the expert evidence in Li’s expert’s
                    AEIC, this could be done in cross-examination.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Gleneagles’ case is
                    that depression is an important element of Li’s claim
                    for aggravated damages and that Gleneagles would be severely
                    prejudiced if it was unable to get its own psychiatric
                    expert. Counsel for Gleneagles submits that to rebut
                    Li’s allegation of depression, Gleneagles would need
                    to adduce evidence in the form of its own psychiatric report
                    and not merely rely on cross-examination of Li’s
                    psychiatric expert.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     I am unable to agree with
                    counsel for Li that a defendant’s request for medical
                    examination will only be reasonable where the <em>entire </em><em>liability</em> of the defendant rests on the
                    sufficient establishment of an injury in the
                    plaintiff’s cause of action. To my mind, it is clear
                    that even where liability is not in issue, where the quantum
                    of damages is dependent on sufficient establishment of a
                    medical condition, this suffices. In <em>Edmeades</em>, the issue of liability had been
                    settled at the time of the request for medical examination,
                    and the only remaining issue had been that of damages (see
                        <em>Edmeades</em> at 69). In the
                    present case, as I have found that depression is a relevant
                    issue to the assessment of damages (see above at <a href="#p1_26">[26]</a>), this goes towards a
                    finding that Gleneagles’ request for medical
                    examination is reasonable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     I am also unable to agree
                    with the argument that Gleneagles does not have to conduct a
                    medical examination as it can cross-examine Li’s
                    expert witness at trial. In <em>Edmeades</em> at 73, Widgery LJ opined that if
                    the defendant was deprived of medical advice and the only
                    evidence on that aspect was given by the plaintiff’s
                    doctors, there would be “no way by which the balance
                    [between the plaintiff and the defendant could] be
                    adjusted”, for if the trial judge found the
                    plaintiff’s doctors credible, he would have to follow
                    their evidence. It appears that the same position regarding
                    the evaluation of uncontroverted expert evidence will be
                    taken in Singapore. In <em>Saeng-Un Udom v
                        Public Prosecutor</em> [2001]
                    2 SLR(R) 1, the Court of Appeal accepted the
                    following principle at [26]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>The court should not, when
                            confronted with expert evidence which is unopposed
                            and appears not to be obviously lacking in
                            defensibility, reject it nevertheless and prefer to
                            draw its own inferences. While the court is not
                            obliged to accept expert evidence by reason only
                            that it is unchallenged (Sek Kim Wah v
                            PP </em>[1987] SLR 107<em>), if the court finds that the evidence is
                            based on sound grounds and supported by the basic
                            facts, it can do little else than to accept the
                            evidence. </em>[emphasis in
                        original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Therefore, I find that Gleneagles’ request
                    that Li submit to an examination by a psychiatrist to be
                    appointed by Gleneagles is reasonable, as Gleneagles might
                    otherwise be unfairly disadvantaged.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Whether the alleged depression is a new
                allegation </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     It is established in case
                    law that whether the alleged medical condition is a new
                    allegation is a factor to be taken into account in
                    determining the reasonableness of the defendant’s
                    conduct. In <em>Edmeades</em> at 71,
                    Lord Denning found that the defendant’s request that
                    the plaintiff submit to medical examination was reasonable
                    given that they were faced with “a new allegation
                    which had not been made in the statement of
                    claim”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     There is a dispute between
                    Li and Gleneagles as to whether Li’s allegation of
                    depression was a new allegation. As noted earlier at
                        <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a>, it was pleaded
                    in Li’s SOC that Gleneagles’ actions had caused
                    him “considerable anger, outrage and
                    distress”. In Li’s AEIC affirmed on
                    22 August 2011, he prayed that aggravated damages be
                    awarded to him as he was “extremely distressed and
                    underwent much suffering”; and suffered
                    “mental distress and pain” when he found out
                    that his medical records were falsified.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Subsequently, as noted
                    above at <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a>,
                    depression was alleged in addition to distress in Li’s
                    AEIC affirmed on 17 February 2012. This was supported
                    by an AEIC by a psychiatric expert on behalf of Li
                    (“Li’s expert”) affirmed on
                    20 February 2012 (“Li’s expert’s
                    AEIC”), which provided an expert opinion that Li
                    exhibited symptoms in the “severe range of Depression
                    [sic]” which had evolved into a “chronic
                    unremitting course”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> Li’s
                    expert also noted that Li’s depression had origins
                    “beyond the physical disability” suffered by
                        Li,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span><em>ie</em>, his depression was not
                    just caused by Dr Looi but was caused in part by
                    Gleneagles’ acts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     According to Gleneagles,
                    it was “taken by surprise” by Li’s
                    allegation of depression as Li had not previously pleaded
                    that he had suffered depression as a result of
                    Gleneagles’ conduct.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>
                    While Gleneagles concedes that Li had pleaded that he was
                    depressed as a result of Dr Looi’s conduct, its case
                    is that Li had only hitherto pleaded that he was <em>distressed</em> as a result of
                    Gleneagles’ conduct. Counsel for Gleneagles argues
                    that “distress” is not synonymous with
                    “depression” in the clinical sense of the word
                    and that the allegation of depression against Gleneagles was
                    thus a new allegation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The facts of the present
                    case are similar to that of <em>Lane v
                        Willis</em>, where the plaintiff’s statement
                    of claim had particularised minor physical injuries and
                    “nervous shock, depressive anxiety state”.
                    Subsequently, the plaintiff applied to amend the statement
                    of claim to include particulars of severe depression. Davies
                    LJ noted at 329 that while some of the added particulars in
                    the statement of claim had been referred to in an earlier
                    doctor’s report, the allegations contained in the
                    statement of claim were nevertheless “very
                    considerably expanded by the amendment”. As there was
                    a “substantial difference” between the
                    injuries as originally pleaded and the injuries pleaded
                    after the amendment, it was found reasonable for the
                    defendant to ask for a psychiatric examination (<em>Lane v Willis</em> at 332). It can thus
                    be seen that though the allegation of depression was not
                    “new”
                    <em>per se</em> as some form of
                    depression had been originally pleaded in the statement of
                    claim, this did not bar a finding that the defendant’s
                    request was reasonable given the subsequent expansion on the
                    severity of depression suffered.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Turning back to the
                    present case, in my view, even if distress is a symptom of
                    depression, a claim of distress nonetheless substantially
                    differs from a claim of severe depression, which suffices
                    for a finding of a new allegation. Therefore, on this
                    factor, the request for Li to be examined by a psychiatrist
                    to be appointed by Gleneagles is reasonable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(3)   Delay</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     This concerns the time
                    lapse between the discovery of the allegation of a new
                    medical condition and the request for a medical examination
                    on the new medical condition.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     In the present case,
                    Li’s SOC containing the allegation of distress was
                    filed on 16 March 2009. Li’s expert AEIC was
                    filed on 21 February 2012. While Gleneagles filed
                    objections to Li’s expert’s AEIC on 5 March
                    2012, no objections were raised as to Li’s allegation
                    that he suffered depression. It was only on 12 April
                    2012 that counsel for Gleneagles wrote a letter to Li
                    proposing that Li be submitted to an examination by a
                    psychiatric expert to be appointed by Gleneagles, a
                    suggestion which Li rejected. The time lapse between the SOC
                    and the request for the psychiatric examination was thus
                    approximately three years, and the present summons for an
                    order for medical examination was taken out very close to
                    the dates that were initially fixed for the AD. I will
                    examine the effect of delay in case law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     In <em>Lane
                        v Willis</em>, Davies LJ observed that there had
                    been “considerable delay on the part of the
                    defendant” (at 332). A timeline of the relevant
                    events will illustrate this (see <em>Lane v
                        Willis</em> at 333). The incident giving rise to
                    the plaintiff’s claim took place on 16 May 1968.
                    On 13 September 1968, the plaintiff’s solicitors
                    had sent the defendant’s solicitors a report which
                    made it clear that a neurosis element was subsisting. This
                    was followed by a second letter which again made plain that
                    the neurosis element was subsisting and was serious. The
                    plaintiff was also examined by the defendant’s
                    neurologist. The statement of claim was then served on
                    16 June 1969. An amendment to the statement of claim
                    followed on 5 February 1971, and this enlarged the
                    gravity of the neurosis aspect of the claim (see above at
                        <a href="#p1_41">[41]</a>). The
                    defendant’s neurologist then examined the plaintiff on
                    a further two occasions. On 22 July 1971 the defendant
                    made a request for the plaintiff to be examined by a
                    psychiatrist on the defendant’s behalf. It can thus be
                    seen that the defendant was aware of the neurosis claim as
                    early as 13 September 1968 but took approximately 2
                    years and 10 months to request for the psychiatric
                    examination, despite having sight of two medical reports
                    from the plaintiff detailing the neurosis element and
                    despite having its own neurologist examine the plaintiff
                    three times. Even so, this was not fatal to the finding that
                    the defendant’s request was reasonable in that
                    case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     
          <em>Lane v
                        Willis</em> can be distinguished from the present
                    case. The defendant in <em>Lane v
                        Willis</em> had sight of two medical reports from
                    the plaintiff which mentioned a serious neurosis element
                    even before the plaintiff filed his statement of claim. In
                    the present case, Li’s expert’s AEIC was filed
                    considerably later in the course of proceedings. Li’s
                    expert’s AEIC would have been the first time a claim
                    of depression (as opposed to distress, which is not a
                    psychiatric condition) was raised against Gleneagles, and
                    within a month of receiving Li’s expert’s
                    medical report Gleneagles requested that Li submit to a
                    medical examination by an expert to be appointed by
                    Gleneagles. The operative delay here is thus <em>less than a month</em>. Further, in
                        <em>Lane v Willis</em>, the
                    defendant’s neurologist had examined the plaintiff
                    three times but in the present case no expert has ever
                    examined Li on Gleneagles’ behalf. Even though the
                    defendant’s conduct of the case in <em>Lane v Willis</em> was arguably more worthy of
                    reproach than in the present case (and indeed, in <em>Lane v Willis</em> at 334, Sachs LJ
                    expressed disapproval at the way the defendant had handled
                    the matter), as noted in the preceding paragraph, the
                    defendant’s request for a medical examination was
                    still found reasonable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Bearing in mind that
                    Gleneagles might be unfairly disadvantaged in its conduct of
                    the AD if it is unable to obtain an expert opinion (see
                    above at <a href="#p1_22">[22]</a>), and that
                    its right to defend to defend itself in litigation might
                    thus be compromised, I find that the delay does not in
                    itself show that Gleneagles’ request that Li submit
                    himself to a medical examination is unreasonable. This is
                    especially so when it is noted that Gleneagles’
                    request for medical examination was done <em>within a month</em> of receiving Li’s
                    expert’s medical report.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Even though delay does not
                    bar an order for medical examination, I am of the view that
                    in general, a party seeking an order for medical examination
                    would do well to apply for such an order as soon as possible
                    after they become aware of the new allegation, and should do
                    so before trial dates have been set. This will promote
                    proper and efficient administration of
                justice.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(4)   Whether a request for medical
                examination is only reasonable in cases of personal
                injury</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Li’s case is that a
                    medical examination is mainly applicable when the matter
                    involves a claim of personal injury. Counsel cites <em>Starr</em> for this proposition, where it
                    was held (at 69) that it was clearly established that if the
                    defendant in a <em>personal injury</em>
                    case made a reasonable request for the plaintiff to be
                    medically examined, the plaintiff should accede to the
                    request unless he has reasonable ground for objecting to
                    that particular doctor. As Li’s claim against
                    Gleneagles was not for personal injury, counsel for Li
                    submits that Gleneagles’ request for a medical was not
                    reasonable. In reply, counsel for Gleneagles noted that a
                    Stay had been ordered pursuant to a request for medical
                    examination in the <em>Jackson</em>
                    case which involved a defamation claim and not a claim for
                    personal injury.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     While I accept Li’s
                    point that cases in which orders for medical examinations
                    were granted have mainly been personal injury cases, I find
                    that this point does not advance Li’s case. The fact
                    that orders for medical examinations have been granted
                    mainly in personal injury cases does not go so far as to
                    suggest that requests for medical examinations are always
                    unreasonable in non-personal injury cases. As counsel for
                    Gleneagles has rightly pointed out, orders for medical
                    examination have been made in non-personal injury cases,
                    such as <em>Jackson</em>. For the
                    reasons given above (see <a href="#p1_36">[36]</a> in particular), I find that the request
                    for medical examination in the instant case is reasonable,
                    so as to enable Gleneagles to properly conduct its
                    case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Reasonableness of Li’s refusal</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Whether there is reasonable objection to
                the nature of the medical examination </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     In <em>Singapore Court Practice 2009</em> at para
                    25/3/11, it is noted that when a medical examination would
                    be “oppressive”, the court may exercise its
                    discretion against granting a Stay. A similar point is made
                    in <em>Singapore Civil Procedure
                        2007</em> (GP Selvam gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell
                    Asia, 2007) (“<em>Singapore Civil
                        Procedure 2007</em>”) at para 40A/1/3 where
                    it is stated that if the proposed examination is
                    “unpleasant, painful or risky” the court will
                    be reluctant to order a stay. This proposition was derived
                    from <em>Prescott v Bulldog Tools
                        Ltd</em> [1981] 3 All ER 869 (“<em>Prescott v Bulldog</em>”) where it
                    was found (at 876) that the risks reasonably apprehended by
                    the plaintiff were of a substantial risk of not
                    insubstantial discomfort and minimal though real risks of
                    “not insubstantial and possibly serious injury or
                    injuries to health”. The discomfort in that case was
                    of giddiness and nausea and vomiting, while the injury to
                    health was that of a radiation dosage and puncture of the
                    ear membrane (<em>Prescott v
                        Bulldog</em> at 873).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Risks of physical injury
                    of such nature and degree are not present in the instant
                    case given that the proposed medical examination is a
                    psychiatric examination. Even so, psychiatric examinations
                    may risk further psychiatric injury. However, Li has not
                    pleaded that the examination by Gleneagles would cause him
                    further psychiatric injury. While every medical examination
                    inevitably carries the risk of a degree of discomfort, the
                    party refusing medical examination needs to show that the
                    risk of discomfort or injury to health is reasonably
                    apprehended as substantial. As this has not been shown, I
                    find that Li’s refusal of the medical examination is
                    not reasonable on this ground.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Further, I note that
                    Li’s expert has already conducted a psychiatric
                    examination on him. If an expert appointed by Gleneagles is
                    prevented from conducting a similar examination, there would
                    be “one law for plaintiff[s] and another for
                    defendants” (<em>Prescott v
                        Bulldog</em> at 876). This cannot be
                so.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Whether there is reasonable objection to
                the medical examiner</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     In <em>Singapore Civil Procedure 2007</em> at para
                    40A/1/3, it is stated that if the particular medical expert
                    is likely to conduct his examination or make his report
                    “unkindly or unfavourably” then a Stay should
                    not be ordered. This is derived from <em>Starr</em> where it was held (at 72) that if the
                    plaintiff could prove that he had a reasonable apprehension
                    that the defendant’s choice of doctor might make a
                    just determination of the cause “more difficult than
                    it would be if another doctor conducted the
                    examination” this goes towards a finding that the
                    plaintiff’s refusal was reasonable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     In the present case,
                    Gleneagles has not nominated any particular doctor, but has
                    simply applied for the medical examination to be conducted
                    by a psychiatric expert “to be appointed” by
                    itself. Counsel for Li argues that as Gleneagles is a
                    hospital, there is a “<em>prima
                        facie</em> risk” that any psychiatric
                    expert to be appointed by Gleneagles would have a
                    “pecuniary or commercial relationship” with
                    Gleneagles thus compromising the impartiality of the medical
                        examination.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> Against
                    this, counsel for Gleneagles argues that the credibility of
                    its appointed expert is an issue that could be taken up at
                    the AD hearing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     I would be slow to say
                    that there is <em>prima facie</em> risk
                    that <em>any</em> expert appointed by
                    Gleneagles would fail to be impartial owing to a pecuniary
                    or commercial relationship with Gleneagles. The fact that
                    Gleneagles <em>might</em> appoint an
                    expert that <em>might not</em> be
                    impartial is, in my view, insufficient to amount a
                    reasonable objection as it relies on a <em>hypothetical</em> situation. If Gleneagles
                    appoints a non-impartial expert, objection can properly be
                    taken, but the proper forum for this would be at the AD when
                    the situation has crystallised, and not at the present
                    application. While it is “safer to offer the
                    plaintiff a choice of doctors” (<em>Singapore Civil Procedure 2007</em> at para
                    40A/1/3), the failure to do in this case is not fatal. It
                    would be different if there was a named expert against whom
                    there were substantiated submissions that he had
                    “difficulty in providing reports which are not
                    misleading” (<em>Starr</em> at
                    72).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Having examined the
                    relevant factors, I find that Gleneagles’ request that
                    Li submit himself for an examination by a psychiatric expert
                    to be appointed by Gleneagles is reasonable, and that
                    Li’s refusal to submit to the medical examination is
                    unreasonable. I thus give leave for Gleneagles’
                    psychiatric expert to file an AEIC on behalf of Gleneagles
                    and direct that the action be stayed pending completion of a
                    reasonable psychiatric examination on Li which is reasonably
                    required by Gleneagles’ appointed
                expert.</p>
