On 16 March 2022, the Judge made orders on costs and disbursements against the Companies in respect of each of the two Suits by way of correspondence from the Court (the “Costs Orders”). Thereafter, on 17 March 2022, the Judge directed parties to write in by 21 March 2022 “if there are any objections to the Court having made the orders on costs and disbursements by way of the letter dated 16 March 2022”.

On 24 March 2022, counsel for the Companies first attempted to file a purported “appeal”. However, this was filed under “All Other Summons” in the underlying casefile. Counsel for the Companies was informed that there were two issues with such a filing. First, nothing on the face of that document stated that it was an appeal and it did not comply with the relevant form applicable then for a notice of appeal. Second, the document was filed in the underlying casefile. Accordingly, that filing was rejected by the General Division of the High Court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 On 25 March 2022, the Companies filed a Notice of Appeal to the Court of Appeal.

</div> That was also procedurally deficient for three reasons. First, it was filed out of time as 24 March 2022 was the last day for filing an appeal. However, when filing the Notice of Appeal, counsel for the Companies indicated that an extension of time was not required. Second, it was filed to the Court of Appeal instead of the Appellate Division of the High Court. Third, there was no accompanying Certificate for Security for Costs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 On 29 and 30 March 2022, the Registry of the Supreme Court attempted to contact counsel for the Companies on his mobile line and office line but to no avail. He, however, did write in on 29 March 2022 (again, in the underlying casefile) to inquire about the filing of the Notice of Appeal. On 30 March 2022, the Registry responded, asking counsel for the Companies to confirm whether the Notice of Appeal to the Court of Appeal was filed out of time as that appeared to be the case. On 31 March 2022, he wrote to the Registry, stating that the appeal was “not out of time”.

However, counsel for the Companies was absent as neither he nor his staff allegedly had notice of the CMC. The CMC was thus refixed to 7 April 2022. At the CMC on 7 April 2022, the AR set out the background which led to the CMC and the issues faced by the initial filing on 24 March 2022 as well as the subsequent filing on 25 March 2022 which we have mentioned at [7] and [8] above. The AR said that the Notice of Appeal would be rejected due to numerous deficiencies. The AR also mentioned that counsel for the Companies ought to consider whether an application for an extension of time to appeal should be filed. The Customers had indicated they might apply to strike out the appeal, if he sought to file an appeal without an extension of time. Eventually, the Companies filed NA 39 on 12 April 2022 before the Appellate Division of the High Court without seeking an extension of time to do so.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The parties’ cases </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 The Customers contend that because NA 39 refers only to the decision of the Judge on 16 March 2022, it is an appeal against the Costs Orders only. As such, it may be filed only with the court’s permission to do so. If the Companies wished to appeal against the Main Judgment on <span class="font-italic">liability</span>, which was pronounced on 24 February 2022, they might do so only if an extension of time to appeal was obtained. As neither permission to appeal against the Costs Orders nor an extension of time to appeal against the Main Judgment was sought, NA 39 should be struck out.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 The Companies contend that NA 39 was “against the whole of” the Judge’s decision in respect of <span class="font-italic">liability and costs</span>.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Third, the fact that the trial was bifurcated does not change the foregoing analysis. The Companies’ submission on this point is misconceived as the Customers are not, contrary to their submission, alleging that the <span class="font-italic">trial itself </span>was on the issue of costs only. Rather, the pertinent issue is what decision of the Judge was appealed against in NA 39.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 We make one final point in respect of the Companies’ submission that filing two separate notices of appeal (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the first against the Main Judgment and the second against the Costs Orders) would result in unnecessary costs. This argument is also unpersuasive. This Court had recently given guidance on this point in <span class="font-italic">Ser Kim Koi v GTMS Construction Pte Ltd and others</span> [2021] 1 SLR 1319. In particular, where a judgment on costs was issued within the time for filing an appeal against the judgment on liability, a party should file a <span class="font-italic">single</span> notice of appeal in respect of <span class="font-italic">both </span>judgments against liability and costs (at [12]). The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">The “Luna” and another appeal</span> [2021] 2 SLR 1054 likewise confirmed that the correct procedure is that where a costs decision is delivered <span class="font-italic">before </span>a notice of appeal has been filed in respect of the substantive decision, the appellant should file a <span class="font-italic">single</span> notice of appeal against <span class="font-italic">both</span> the substantive decision and the costs decision (at [103]). Naturally, the notice of appeal must be appropriately worded to refer to both decisions and the appropriate dates thereof.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 That is precisely the case here, where the Costs Orders were made both (a) <span class="font-italic">before</span> a notice of appeal was filed and (b) <span class="font-italic">prior</span> to the expiry of the period limited for filing a notice of appeal against the Main Judgment. Had the Companies followed the correct procedure, permission to appeal would not be required since the Notice of Appeal would relate to <span class="font-italic">both </span>the Main Judgment and the Costs Orders and thus it could not be said that the “only issue in the appeal relates to costs” under para 3(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) of the Fifth Schedule. Such procedure would thus not result in any unnecessary costs and ensure that appeals are appropriately filed within time. Yet, this was not done here.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 In conclusion, we agree with the Customers that NA 39 relates <span class="font-italic">only </span>to the Costs Orders made on 16 March 2022. That being so, it is uncontroversial that the Companies would require permission to appeal. Given that they have not obtained permission, this Court is not seised with the requisite jurisdiction to hear and determine the appeal.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The relevant time period for filing an appeal</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The foregoing is sufficient to determine SUM 15. For completeness, we address the relevant time period within which one may file an appeal in view of the relatively new Rules of Court 2021 (the “Rules of Court 2021”). This part addresses the second issue which would arise if the Companies’ case was taken at its highest, which is that, NA 39 was against the Main Judgment <span class="font-italic">in addition to </span>the Costs Orders.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties’ cases</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The Customers’ position is that NA 39 is a “backdoor appeal” against the Main Judgment as the Companies failed to appeal against the same within the prescribed time.

A party who wishes to appeal against a decision of a lower Court made in proceedings to which the Revoked ROC applies must, under the Rules of Court 2021, file the notice of appeal within one month after the date on which the judgment or order appealed against was pronounced. In the present circumstances, a notice of appeal against <span class="font-italic">liability </span>should have undoubtedly been filed and served within one month after the Judge’s judgment <span class="font-italic">on such liability</span>, which was pronounced on 24 February 2022.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The Companies’ reliance on O 19 r 4 of the Rules of Court 2021 is somewhat misplaced and arises from a misunderstanding of the transitional provisions and application of the Rules of Court 2021 as stipulated in O 1 r 2 which we have elaborated in the foregoing paragraphs. In contrast, O 19 r 4(1) of the Rules of Court 2021 provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">When time for appeal starts to run (O. 19, r. 4)</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">4.</span>—(1)  Unless the Court otherwise orders, the time for the filing of an appeal and for the filing of an application for permission to appeal does not start to run until after the lower Court has heard and determined all matters in the trial, including costs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 As clearly stipulated in O 1 r 2(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Rules of Court 2021 (reproduced at [32] above), the relevant time that applies to a <span class="font-italic">judgment or order made </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">before 1 April 2022 </span>(such as the Main Judgment and the Costs Orders in the Suits) is one month from the date of such judgment or order. Simply put, although O 19 r 4 of the Rules of Court 2021 came into operation on 1 April 2022 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, was in operation by the time NA 39 was filed), it does not apply to appeals against the Judge’s decisions in the present case. Accordingly, the time to appeal against the Main Judgment starts to run from 24 February 2022 <span class="font-italic">and not </span><span class="font-italic">16 March 2022 </span>as the Companies contend.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Therefore, even if NA 39 was against the Main Judgment in addition to the Costs Orders<span class="font-italic"> </span>(as the Companies contend), it was filed out of time. The Companies thus required an extension of time to file the same. As no such extension of time was sought and obtained by the Companies, NA 39 ought to be struck out, even if it were the case – as the Companies contend – that the appeal was against <span class="font-italic">both </span>the Main Judgment and the Costs Orders.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 For the foregoing reasons, we allow SUM 15 and strike out NA 39.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 The present state of affairs is unsatisfactory because counsel for the Companies failed to appreciate the applicable rules of civil procedure which, in our view, have been clearly set out in the Rules of Court 2021. Furthermore, at the CMC of 7 April 2022, counsel’s attention was brought to the specific point that 24 March 2022 was the last day for filing an appeal against the Main Judgment. Counsel for the Companies was specifically informed to consider whether to seek an extension of time to appeal. Yet he chose not to do so. It seems that this unfortunate state of affairs has arisen because of the intransigence of counsel for the Companies. In the circumstances, we reserve our judgment on costs. Parties are to file and serve written submissions (if any) on costs for SUM 15 and NA 39 within 14 days from the date of our judgment, limited to five pages. Counsel (and solicitors) for the Companies are to also address the question as to why costs should not be borne by him (and/or them) personally. As the Customers have already addressed costs in their earlier submissions, they should clarify within the same deadline whether they are filing and serving any further submission on costs.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Woo Bih Li<br/>Judge of the Appellate Division</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Kannan Ramesh<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Hoo Sheau Peng<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Pillai Subbiah (Tan &amp; Pillai) for the applicants;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Palaniappan Sundararaj and Ranita Yogeeswaran (K&amp;L Gates Straits Law LLC) for the respondents.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>

NA 39 was against the “whole of the decision” of the High Court Judge (the “Judge”) “given on 16-03-2022” in HC/S 1044/2018 and HC/S 1307/2018 respectively (collectively, the “Suits”). The parties who filed SUM 15 are collectively referred to as the “Customers” and the parties opposing SUM 15 are collectively referred to as the “Companies”.</div><div class="txt-body text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background and material facts</span></div><div class="txt-body text-left">2 The Customers were holiday makers who were travelling from Genting Highlands back to Singapore on 31 August 2016. They were on board a double decker luxury coach (the “Bus”). En route to Singapore, the Bus was involved in a road accident. The Customers sustained injuries and filed an action to claim damages.</div><div class="txt-body text-left">3 On 24 February 2022, the Judge gave interlocutory judgment on liability in favour of the Customers with damages to be assessed (including damages in relation to the Companies’ contractual liability to all the Customers for failing to provide the transportation service with reasonable care) and costs to be heard separately in <span class="font-italic">R</span><span class="font-italic"> Manokaran and others v Chuah Ah Leng and others and another suit</span> [2022] SGHC 39 (the “Main Judgment”). On 16 March 2022, the Judge made orders on costs and disbursements against the Companies by way of correspondence from the Court (the “Costs Orders”). </div><div class="txt-body text-left">4 On 12 April 2022, the Companies filed NA 39 which was not the Companies’ first attempt to file an appeal against the Main Judgment. On 24 March 2022, counsel for the Companies first attempted to file a purported “appeal” which was rejected by the General Division of the High Court. On 25 March 2022, the Companies filed a Notice of Appeal to the Court of Appeal. That was also procedurally deficient for several reasons, including that it was filed out of time as 24 March 2022 was the last day for filing an appeal against the Main Judgment. However, when filing the Notice of Appeal to the Court of Appeal, the solicitors for the Companies indicated that an extension of time was not required.</div><div class="txt-body text-left">5 On 30 March 2022, the Registry responded, asking counsel for the Companies to confirm whether the Notice of Appeal to the Court of Appeal was filed out of time as that appeared to be the case. On 31 March 2022, counsel for the Companies wrote to the Registry, stating that the appeal was “not out of time”. At a case management conference (“CMC”) on 7 April 2022, the Assistant Registrar (“AR”) said that the Notice of Appeal would be rejected due to numerous deficiencies. The AR also mentioned that counsel for the Companies ought to consider whether an application for an extension of time to appeal should be filed. The Customers had indicated that they might apply to strike out the appeal, if counsel for the Companies sought to file an appeal without an extension of time. </div><div class="txt-body text-left">6 Eventually, the Companies filed NA 39 on 12 April 2022 before the Appellate Division of the High Court without seeking an extension of time to do so.</div><div class="txt-body text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The parties’ cases</span></div><div class="txt-body text-left">7 The Customers contended that because NA 39 referred only to the decision of the Judge on 16 March 2022, it is an appeal against the Costs Orders only. As such, it may be filed only with the court’s permission to do so. If the Companies wished to appeal against the Main Judgment on <span class="font-italic">liability</span>, which was pronounced on 24 February 2022, they might do so only if an extension of time to appeal was obtained. As neither permission to appeal against the Costs Orders nor an extension of time to appeal against the Main Judgment was sought, NA 39 should be struck out.</div><div class="txt-body text-left">8 The Companies contended that NA 39 was “against the whole of” the Judge’s decision in respect of <span class="font-italic">liability and costs</span>. Such appeal was filed within time as the relevant time began running only when the Judge had resolved <span class="font-italic">all issues, including costs</span>. As such, the relevant time only ran from 16 March 2022 when the Costs Orders were made. SUM 15 should accordingly be dismissed.</div><div class="txt-body text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Decision on appeal</span></div><div class="txt-body text-left">9 It was clear that two different decisions were rendered on two different dates. The first is the Main Judgment, which was pronounced on 24 February 2022, in respect of the Companies’ liability. The second is the Costs Orders which were made on 16 March 2022 (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[1</span><span class="font-weight-bold">7]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body text-left">10 The Customers were wrong to have extracted <span class="font-italic">a single judgment in respect </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">of liability and costs</span> in each of the Suits without mentioning the two different dates. Where there were <span class="font-italic">multiple</span> decisions rendered on <span class="font-italic">different</span> dates in relation to the same case (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, the first on liability and the second on costs), the extracted judgment ought to reflect accurately <span class="font-italic">each</span> of the dates on which the respective decisions were made, if that was permissible. If that was not permissible, then two orders for each of the Suits should have been extracted. The Customers’ error, however, did not and could not change the relevant date for the purposes of determining the time within which a notice of appeal might be filed (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[18]–[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">19]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body text-left">11 The phrase “against the whole of the decision” in NA 39 is not to be read in isolation. It is to be read in its proper <span class="font-italic">context</span> – which, in this case, is the Judge’s decision “given on 16-03-2022”. In this regard, it is clear based on the Court’s correspondence dated 16 March 2022, that the Judge’s decisions in each of the Suits on that date related to <span class="font-italic">costs only</span>. Read in totality, NA 39 is an appeal against the <span class="font-italic">whole of the Judge’s decision </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">on costs only </span>(<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, on every aspect of the Costs Orders) but not on the Judge’s decision in respect of liability (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[22]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body text-left">12 The fact that the Customers’ extracted judgments filed on 4 April 2022 stated that the “Date of Judgment” was “16-March-2022” was immaterial. Rather, it was the actual date on which the judgment or order appealed against was pronounced that was material. To this end, the extracted judgment did not and could not change the date on which the judgment in respect of liability was in fact pronounced by the Judge (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 24 February 2022) (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[20]</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">[23]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body text-left">13 Where the Costs Orders were made both (a) <span class="font-italic">before</span> a notice of appeal was filed and (b) <span class="font-italic">prior</span> to the expiry of the period limited for filing a notice of appeal against the Main Judgment, the Companies ought to have filed a single notice of appeal. Had the Companies followed the correct procedure, permission to appeal would not be required since the Notice of Appeal would relate to both the Main Judgment and the Costs Orders and not just the Costs Orders only (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[25]</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">[26]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body text-left">14 Under O 1 r 2 of the Rules of Court 2021 (the “Rules of Court 2021”), an appeal against a decision of a lower Court made in proceedings to which the revoked Rules of Court (2014 Rev Ed) apply must be filed within one month after the date on which that judgment or order appealed against was <span class="font-italic">pronounced</span>. The Companies’ reliance on O 19 r 4 of the Rules of Court 2021 was somewhat misplaced and arose from a misunderstanding of the transitional provisions and application of the Rules of Court 2021 as stipulated in O 1 r 2 (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[32</span><span class="font-weight-bold">]–[34]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body text-left">15 The time to appeal against the Main Judgment started to run from 24 February 2022 and not 16 March 2022 as the Companies contended. Therefore, even if NA 39 was against the Main Judgment in addition to the Costs Orders (as the Companies contended), it was filed out of time. As no such extension of time was sought and obtained by the Companies, NA 39 ought to be struck out (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[35]</span>–<span class="font-weight-bold">[36]</span>). </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-italic">This summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the Court’s grounds of decision.
