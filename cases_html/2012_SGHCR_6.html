<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This interlocutory
                    application arose out of a dispute that spanned two suits
                    which were subsequently consolidated. Mr Balour Singh
                    (“Mr Singh”), who was the
                        10<sup>th</sup> defendant in Suit No 755
                    of 2011 (“S 755/2011”) and the
                        11<sup>th</sup> defendant in Suit No 381
                    of 2011 (“S 381/2011”), applied to strike out
                    both statements of claim insofar as they pertained to him,
                    on the grounds that he was not the proper defendant to both
                    suits. On 1 June 2012 I dismissed his application and now
                    set out my grounds for so doing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The first suit, S 755/2011,
                    was referred to by the parties as the “commission
                    claim”; and the second suit, S 381/2011, as the
                    “defamation claim”. Both claims arose from the
                    same set of facts – the sale and purchase of nine
                    residential properties located along Sophia Road
                    (“the Sophia Road properties”), completion of
                    which took place in October 2011. In S 755/2011, Isabel
                    Redrup Agency Pte Ltd (“Isabel Redrup”)
                    claimed that the defendants, who were the owners of the
                    Sophia Road properties, had breached an agreement to pay it
                    a commission for being the effective cause of the sale of
                    the Sophia Road properties. After the option to purchase the
                    Sophia Road properties was granted in February 2011, Isabel
                    Redrup invoiced the owners of the Sophia Road properties for
                    commission purportedly due. The owners’
                    representative, one Mr Simon Loh (“Mr Loh”),
                    then allegedly made defamatory statements about Isabel
                    Redrup and its representative, one Ms Susan Eleanor Prior
                    (“Ms Prior”), to the media, the Council of
                    Estate Agents, and to the police in the form of a police
                    report. The making of these statements was allegedly
                    authorised by the owners of the Sophia Road properties in a
                    letter signed by the same. This was the substrate of S
                    381/2011. The parties to S 381/2011 were the same as those
                    in S 755/2011, save for the inclusion of Ms Prior as the
                    second plaintiff to S 381/2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Mr Singh objected to his
                    inclusion as a defendant in both suits. His involvement in
                    these proceedings stemmed from the fact that he was a
                    trustee of the Sikh Business Association (“the
                    Association”), which was located at, and held an
                    interest in, a property known as 124 Sophia Road. This was
                    one of the Sophia Road properties that were the subject of
                    the sale and purchase. In respect of the commission claim,
                    Mr Singh’s case was that he was merely a bare trustee
                    of the Association and could not be made to shoulder
                    liability for what was essentially a contract for commission
                    allegedly entered into between Isabel Redrup and the
                    Association. In respect of the defamation claim, Mr
                    Singh’s case was that he had not signed the purported
                    letter of authorisation. There was a signature above his
                    printed name on the letter, but he contended that this
                    signature was not his.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The parties did not dispute
                    that the Association was an unincorporated association. As
                    the term “unincorporated association”
                    suggests, such an entity is an association of people that is
                    not incorporated, and therefore does not have a separate
                    legal corpus. Such an entity has a separate existence from
                    its members, but it does not have its own legal personality
                    separate from its members. This unique set of
                    characteristics necessitates a unique set of mechanisms for
                    the unincorporated association to hold land, enter into
                    contracts, and to be made a defendant to litigation. These
                    mechanisms, and the problems associated with their
                    interplay, were thrown into sharp focus over the course of
                    these proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The commission claim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       In support of the striking
                    out application for the commission claim, counsel for Mr
                    Singh, Mr Bajwa, put forward two main arguments. Firstly,
                    that the contract appointing Isabel Redrup as the marketing
                    agent for the Sophia Road properties was made between Isabel
                    Redrup and the Association, and Mr Singh was not a party to
                    this contract. Mr Bajwa referred to a letter dated 26 August
                    2009 from Mr Loh, on behalf of the owners of the Sophia Road
                    properties, to Isabel Redrup, appointing it as the sole and
                    exclusive marketing agent of the properties for six months
                    with effect from 25 August 2009 (“the 26 August 2009
                    letter”). This letter listed under the heading
                        “<u>124 Sophia
                    Road</u>” the Association’s name, not Mr
                    Singh’s name, and furthermore Mr Singh’s name
                    did not appear anywhere on this letter. Secondly, that Mr
                    Singh was merely a bare trustee of 124 Sophia Road, and his
                    powers did not extend to entering into contracts or
                    appointing agents. Therefore, Mr Singh could not have
                    entered into such a contract to appoint an agent in any
                    event.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The pith of Isabel
                    Redrup’s case is that the defendants wrongfully did
                    not pay it a commission which was rightfully due. This
                    obligation to pay a commission must have emanated from an
                    agreement to pay the same, made between Isabel Redrup and
                    the person on whose behalf it allegedly sold 124 Sophia Road
                    for. Who would this person be?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The statement of claim for S
                    755/2011 alleges that the agreement to pay commission was
                    made as a result of certain utterances, conduct, and/or
                    writing between the plaintiff’s representative, Ms
                    Prior, and the defendants’ representative, Mr Loh. The
                    letter of 26 August 2009 which Mr Bajwa had referred to
                    suggested that it was the Association which had entered into
                    the contract to appoint Isabel Redrup as the marketing agent
                    for the Sophia Road properties. It must be pointed out that
                    the contract to appoint the marketing agent and the contract
                    to pay the marketing agent commission are distinct. Counsel
                    for the plaintiff in S 755/2011, Mr Vincent Yeoh (“Mr
                    Yeoh”), sought to draw the inference that the
                    intention of the defendants, including Mr Singh, was that
                    they were to pay Isabel Redrup a commission upon the
                    successful sale of the Sophia Road properties. Mr Yeoh
                    pointed to a draft commission agreement and two draft
                    options exhibited in Ms Prior’s affidavit, all of
                    which referred to Mr Singh as one of the vendors of the
                    property; and all of which indicated that the vendors were
                    to pay the agent a commission. But these documents were
                    unsigned and undated, and the draft options were made
                    expressly subject to contract. It was thus difficult to draw
                    the inference which Mr Yeoh put forward, as there was no
                    visible concurrence to this on the part of the defendants.
                    One of the draft options had been enclosed in an email of 30
                    June 2010 from Mr Loh, as the defendants’
                    representative, to Isabel Redrup. Even if this represented
                    Mr Yeoh’s case at its highest, as evidence of the
                    defendants’ intentions, there was still no evidence
                    that these intentions had been consummated to form a
                    contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The discussion in the
                    preceding paragraph was not meant to pre-empt a
                    determination of the merits of this case, rather, it was
                    necessary in order to sift through the relevant documents
                    for the purposes of this striking out application. At the
                    end, what remains is the letter of 26 August 2009 appointing
                    Isabel Redrup as the marketing agent for the sale of the
                    Sophia Road properties. Although the appointment of an agent
                    may not necessarily entail the payment of a commission; had
                    there been an agreement to pay commission it must have been
                    made between Isabel Redrup and the person appointing the
                    same, which this letter indicated to be the
                    Association.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Turning to the alleged
                    agreement to pay commission, one difficulty with Mr
                    Bajwa’s argument – that the Association, not Mr
                    Singh, was party to this agreement – is that the
                    Association, as an unincorporated association, cannot enter
                    into contracts in its own name. As stated earlier at
                        <a href="#p1_4">[4]</a>, unincorporated
                    associations do not have separate legal personality, and
                    therefore they must depend upon their members to enter into
                    contracts on their behalf.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Another feature of
                    unincorporated associations is that they cannot hold
                    property in their own right, and one mechanism for such
                    associations to hold property is to depend on a trustee to
                    hold property on trust for their benefit. Mr Singh was one
                    of the trustees of the Association, and was involved in the
                    sale of 124 Sophia Road, which property was statutorily
                    vested in Mr Singh’s name jointly with another trustee
                    of the Association. Mr Singh had also signed the final
                    option which effected the sale of 124 Sophia
                Road.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The high standard of a
                    plain and obvious case necessary for a successful striking
                    out application was stated in <em>Gabriel
                        Peter &amp; Partners (suing as a firm) v Wee Chong Jin
                        and others</em> [1997] 3 SLR(R) 649 at
                        [18]. In order
                    for the statement of claim for S 755/2011 to be struck out
                    insofar as Mr Singh is concerned, it must be plain and
                    obvious that he is not a proper defendant. To test the
                    strength of the arguments to strike out, it will be assumed
                    for the sake of argument that the alleged agreement to pay
                    Isabel Redrup a commission existed, and that it had been
                    made by Mr Loh as a representative of <em>inter alia</em>, Mr Singh. Given the extent of Mr
                    Singh’s involvement in the sale of 124 Sophia Road, it
                    would not be a stretch to infer that had there been such an
                    agreement, it would have been made on his behalf. These
                    assumptions do not pre-determine the issue of whether Mr
                    Singh was the proper defendant, since Mr Singh would
                    presumably have in turn been acting on behalf of the
                    Association in entering into the commission agreement. The
                    question remains as to whether Mr Singh in so doing could be
                    held personally liable, or whether the Association should be
                    the proper named defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     This question of law is
                    not one to which there is an easy answer. On the one hand,
                    since unincorporated associations depend on their members to
                    enter into contracts on their behalf, <em>vis</em>-à-<em>vis</em> the contracting third party, the
                    contracting party is the member, not the association. One
                    question that lingers is whether it remains unfair for the
                    contracting member to bear contractual liability for what
                    are essentially the affairs of the association, although
                    this concern is ameliorated by the possibility of the
                    contracting member seeking indemnification from the
                    association.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     On the other hand, as Mr
                    Bajwa had pointed out, s 35(b) of the Societies Act (Cap
                    311, 1985 Rev Ed) states that every society registered under
                    the Societies Act may sue or be sued in its own name. Mr
                    Yeoh did not dispute that the Association was so registered,
                    and the constitutional documents of the Association made
                    reference to such registration. Pursuant to s 35(d) of the
                    Societies Act, it seems that any judgment entered into
                    against a society in its own name will be satisfied out of
                    the property of the society. Yet, it must be emphasised that
                    every society <em>may</em> be sued in
                    its own name, and therefore s 35(b) is a permissive, rather
                    than a mandatory provision, statutorily permitting some form
                    of legal standing for societies in respect of litigation.
                    The section does not discount the possibility of individual
                    members facing suit as a result of acts undertaken on behalf
                    of the society.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The position in Singapore
                    on this question of law does not seem to be settled, and
                    there are a sufficient number of authorities from the
                    Commonwealth that point in either direction. Another issue
                    to consider is whether, if the Association cannot enter into
                    contracts in its own right, what would it mean to say that
                    the Association could be sued in its own name, and thus
                    potentially be made liable in its own name on those
                    contracts?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Turning to Mr
                    Bajwa’s second submission, that Mr Singh was merely a
                    bare trustee and was therefore not empowered to enter into
                    contracts or effect a sale of 124 Sophia Road, I agreed with
                    Mr Yeoh’s submission that this was really a matter
                    between Mr Singh and the members of the Association. In my
                    view, this would go to whether Mr Singh had exceeded his
                    powers as a trustee in any way and whether he could receive
                    indemnification from the Association for any contractual
                    liability he would have to bear. This was not an issue which
                    concerned Isabel Redrup.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In any event, the fact
                    that the discussion above (at <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a>–<a href="#p1_15">[15]</a>) was necessary shows that the question
                    as to whether Mr Singh is a proper defendant is not one to
                    which there is a plain and obvious answer, and therefore the
                    application in respect of S 755/2011 is
                dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The defamation claim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     I move on to S 381/2011,
                    or what was termed the defamation claim. Mr Bajwa pointed to
                    an undated letter which purported to authorise the making of
                    those allegedly defamatory statements by Mr Loh. This letter
                    was allegedly signed by the “vendors” of the
                    Sophia Road properties, which signatures appeared above the
                    names of the vendors listed in the letter. Mr Singh’s
                    name was among the names of the vendors listed, and there
                    was a signature above his name. However, Mr Bajwa claimed
                    that this signature was not that of Mr Singh, rather, it was
                    that of the vice president of the Association; and Mr Singh
                    therefore could not be taken to have authorised those
                    allegedly defamatory statements.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The question therefore is
                    whether it is plain and obvious that Mr Singh did not so
                    authorise. As Mr Adrian Tan, counsel for the plaintiffs in S
                    381/2011 pointed out, this does not turn on Mr Singh’s
                    powers or capacity as a trustee of the Association. If it is
                    established that Mr Singh had indeed authorised those
                    statements, he could be personally liable whether he was
                    acting on his own behalf or on behalf of the
                    Association.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     I was not of the opinion
                    that it was so plain and obvious. Mr Singh’s name did
                    appear on the alleged letter of authorisation, and there is
                    a signature above it. Mr Bajwa’s submissions
                    essentially amount to an allegation of fraud or
                    impersonation. This allegation was not plainly or obviously
                    made out before me, and in all likelihood substantial
                    disputes of fact would be involved in such allegations.
                    These would not be suitable for determination at the
                    striking out stage.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     For the reasons enumerated
                    above, the striking out application was dismissed in its
                    entirety, with costs of $3,500 awarded to each of the sets
                    of lawyers for the plaintiffs in the respective
                    suits.</p>
