<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       Summons A (“Sum A”) was the
                    defendant’s application under O 20 r 1 of the Rules of Court
                    (Cap 322, R5, 2006 Rev Ed) (“ROC”) for an amendment to
                    be made to the wording of an Order of Court dated August 2007 (“the Order
                    of Court”) made in connection with Summons B (“Sum B”).
                    Subsequent to the hearing of Sum A which took place in March 2010, the parties
                    wanted to settle the matter. Accordingly, I deferred making a decision on the
                    application. However, after waiting more than seven months for the outcome of
                    the settlement negotiations, I called the parties to attend before me in October
                    2010 and gave the parties one more week to settle the matter. At the next
                    hearing in November 2010, the matter remained unresolved. As I was not prepared
                    to delay the matter any further, I rendered my decision in November
                2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The defendant’s application in Sum A to
                    amend the Order of Court was occasioned by a dispute between the parties as to
                    whether the Judgment made in June 2009 (“the Judgment”) in respect
                    of Suit Y of 2006 (“Suit Y”) ought to be published in view of the
                    plaintiffs’ application in Sum B and the Order of Court that was granted
                    pursuant to it. Sum B was an application by the plaintiffs for:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1.    
              <b>[Suit Y] to be heard</b>
<b><em>in camera</em></b>
<b>;</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.    
              <b>any judgment pronounced or
                                delivered in [Suit Y] not be made available for public
                                inspection;</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.    the time for service of [Sum B] be abridged;
                            and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4.    the Court give such further directions as may be
                            necessary.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original in bold italics; emphasis added in bold]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Sum B further stated that the application was:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... made pursuant to [<em>sic</em>]
                        sections 8(2) and 8(3) of the <em>Supreme Court of
                            Judicature Act</em> and Order 42 Rule 2 of the <em>Rules of Court</em> and/or sections 22 and 23 of the
                            <em>International Arbitration Act</em> and
                        Order 69A Rule 3(1)(a) of the <em>Rules of
                            Court</em>. The application is made to preserve the
                        confidentiality of matters referred to arbitration. [emphasis in
                        original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In August 2009, I heard the plaintiffs’ application in Sum B and
                    the Order of Court was filed by the plaintiffs to record the order that I made
                    at the hearing. The Order of Court stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">

                        bold]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In Sum A, the defendant sought to amend the Order of Court such that
                    paragraph 2 would read as such:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.    [Suit Y] be heard <u>otherwise
                                than in open court, pursuant to the Plaintiffs’ application
                                under section 22 of the International Arbitration Act
                                (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed) (the
                                “IAA”)</u><em><del>in
                        camera</del></em>.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The plaintiffs argued that O 42 r 2 of
                    the ROC governs proceedings heard in camera whereas s 23 of the
                    International Arbitration Act (Cap 143, 2002 Rev Ed)
                    (“IAA”) governs proceedings heard “otherwise than in open
                    court”. They submitted that as the proceedings were <em>in
                        camera</em> (following the plaintiffs’ application for this in
                    Sum B and the Order of Court granted subsequently for the proceedings to be
                    heard <b><em>in camera</em></b>), there was an absolute bar to
                    publication of the Judgment. It was the defendant’s position that the
                    plaintiffs’ application eventually proceeded under s 22 of the IAA
                    and that s 23(3)(b) and s 23(4) of the IAA applied such that, at the
                    very least, a redacted version of the Judgment could be published.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Notwithstanding the language of the Order of
                    Court, the defendant submitted that the court’s true meaning in making the
                    order in Sum B in August 2007 was that it was an order being made pursuant to
                    ss 22 and 23 of the IAA. As such, the defendant applied, via Sum A, for the
                    Order of Court to be amended to reflect this.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The events leading to Sum A</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       In August 2007, the plaintiffs filed Sum B. The
                    text of the application is quoted above at <a href="#p1_2">[2]</a>. The supporting affidavit for the plaintiffs’
                    application only referred to s22 and s23 of the IAA. No mention was made of s 8
                    of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed)
                    (“SCJA”) or O 42 r 2 of the ROC. The relevant paragraphs
                    are:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4. Sections 22 and 23 of the IAA implicitly recognise the
                        confidential nature of arbitrations by allowing the Court to hold any
                        proceedings under the IAA “otherwise than in Open Court” and
                        restrict the publication of any information relating to such proceedings
                        respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5. The confidentiality inherent in arbitration proceedings should extend
                        to the current action. Sections 22 and 23 of the IAA are clear
                        illustrations of the public policy in keeping arbitrations, and all
                        proceedings related to arbitrations, confidential. This policy has to be
                        jealously guarded in order to advance Singapore’s attractiveness as an
                        international arbitration hub.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">6. Further, it is expedient in the interests of justice and/or there is
                        sufficient reason that the current action be heard <em>in
                            camera</em> and that any judgment pronounced or delivered in the
                        current action not be available for public inspection.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">7. The Defendant has alleged, <em>inter alia</em>,
                        that the Plaintiffs have waived the confidentiality of the arbitration
                        proceedings. The Plaintiffs do not agree. There will be no prejudice to the
                        Defendant if the current action is heard <em>in
                            camera</em> until the issue of waiver has been decided. On the
                        other hand, there will be irreparable prejudice to the Plaintiffs if the
                        proceedings are not heard <em>in camera</em> and it is
                        later held that there has been no waiver.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in italics in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The hearing of the application took place in
                    August 2007. All parties at the hearing, as well as the Court, dealt with the
                    application on the basis of s 22 and s 23 of the IAA rather than s 8
                    of the SCJA. No mention was made of O 42 r 2 of the ROC. I allowed
                    prayer 1 of the plaintiffs’ application for Suit Y to be heard <em>in camera</em> but deferred making a decision on prayer 2
                    concerning the availability of the Judgment for public inspection. Liberty to
                    apply was granted to both parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       In June 2009, I handed down my Judgment,
                    dismissing the plaintiffs’ claims in Suit Y. Each party subsequently gave
                    an undertaking of confidentiality in relation to the Judgment until the
                    plaintiffs’ application under s23 of the IAA was heard. The undertakings
                    of confidentiality expressly stated that the plaintiffs’ application to
                    preserve confidentiality would be made under s23 of the IAA. The
                    plaintiffs’ undertaking was set out in a fax dated June 2009 which
                    read:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We … undertake that copies of the judgment and/or grounds of
                        decision rendered in the captioned matter will not be distributed to
                        non-parties to the captioned matter until the Plaintiffs’ application
                        under s 23 of the International Arbitration Act (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed)
                        is heard and determined.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The defendant’s undertaking was set out in a fax dated June 2009
                    and read:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As requested by His Honour, we … jointly undertake that the said
                        judgment be kept confidential and that it will not be released or copied
                        pending a hearing to be fixed … for the hearing of the
                        Plaintiffs’ application under section 23 of the International
                        Arbitration Act, Cap 143A concerning the restriction of the publication
                        of the judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       In July 2009, solicitors for the defendant
                    submitted a written request for the Judgment to be made available for public
                    inspection without redacting the identity of the parties. The request mentioned
                    that the plaintiffs had indicated that they would be making an application
                    pursuant to s 23 of the IAA (which deals with restrictions on the reporting
                    of proceedings heard otherwise than in open court).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The solicitors for the plaintiffs objected to
                    the defendant’s request. The reasons for the plaintiffs’ objection
                    were set out in a letter dated July 2009 which stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">17. As a preliminary point, the Plaintiffs have given instructions to file
                        a Notice of Appeal against the Judgment. As the Judgment would be subject to
                        appeal, the Court cannot rule out the prospect that the Court of Appeal may
                        come to a decision which is different from that in the Judgment. As such, it
                        would be premature for Your Honour to rule on the Plaintiffs’
                        application under section 23 of the IAA until the matter has been fully
                        and finally determined by the Court of Appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">18. If Your Honour is minded to give directions at this stage, the
                        Plaintiffs request that Your Honour give directions to the effect that the
                        Judgment remain confidential.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b><em>Section 23 of the IAA</em></b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">19. The Plaintiffs’ application is brought under section 23 of
                        the IAA which states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">21. While Your Honour may give directions permitting the publication of
                        the Judgment if Your Honour considers it to be of major legal interest,
                        under s 23(4) of the IAA, this must be subject to such publication not
                        revealing any matter, including the identity of the parties, which any party
                        to the Suit reasonably wishes to remain confidential.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">22. For the following reasons, the Plaintiffs’ position is that the
                        unredacted version of the Judgment does not meet the requirements set out in
                        s23(4).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The plaintiffs’ letter made no reference to O 42 r 2
                    of the ROC. Rather, the plaintiffs’ objection to publication of the
                    Judgment proceeded on the basis of the plaintiffs’ application under s23
                    of the IAA to keep the Judgment confidential. Paragraph 21 of the letter
                    provided that directions may be given permitting the publication of the Judgment
                    if it was of major legal interest and if the Judgment was sufficiently
                    redacted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     In July 2009, Sum B was fixed for further
                    hearing and the plaintiffs submitted, pursuant to s23 of the IAA, that the
                    Judgment should be kept confidential and unpublished pending the outcome of the
                    plaintiffs’ appeal to the Court of Appeal against the Judgment. I granted
                    the plaintiffs’ application save that a copy of the unredacted version of
                    the Judgment may be given to the arbitrator and the costs draftsmen of the
                    defendant’s solicitors on their undertaking to keep the Judgment
                    confidential.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The plaintiffs filed an appeal against the
                    whole of the Judgment in July 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     In October 2009, the plaintiffs filed an
                    application to the Court of Appeal for the appeal to be heard <em>otherwise than in open court</em> and for an order, <em>inter alia</em>, that in any judgment pronounced or delivered
                    in the appeal, there would be no publication of the identity of the parties to
                    the proceedings and/or of any matter which would enable any member of the public
                    to deduce the identities of the parties. This was granted by a consent order in
                    November 2009. The hearing before the Court of Appeal was in November
                    2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The Court of Appeal delivered its decision on
                    the plaintiffs’ appeal against the Judgment in November
                2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     In November 2009, the defendant, by way of a
                    fax, requested for the issue of confidentiality and publication of the Judgment
                    to be revisited. Subsequently, the parties exchanged correspondence and in its
                    letter dated March 2010, the defendant stated at paragraph 7 that
                    “[i]f necessary, the Defendant will apply under Order 20
                    rule 11 of the Rules of Court for an amendment to the wording of the [Order
                    of Court] made.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     In March 2010, the defendant applied, via Sum
                    A, supported by an affidavit of the defendant’s solicitor, for the Order
                    of Court to be amended (as discussed above at <a href="#p1_2">[2]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Decision on Sum A</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The plaintiffs submitted that the
                    defendant’s application for an amendment of the Order of Court should not
                    be allowed for the following reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_a"></a>(a)     The <em>in
                            camera</em> order was not a “clerical mistake” or an
                        “accidental slip or omission” which could be amended by the
                        court under O 20 r 11 of the ROC;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_b"></a>(b)     Even if the <em>in
                            camera</em> order was made due to a mistake as to its legal effect
                            (<em>ie</em>, the absolute bar on publication) or a
                        misunderstanding, the Court had no jurisdiction to amend its own order and
                        the defendant’s remedy lay in an appeal for which the defendant was
                        out of time; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_c"></a>(c)     The court had no jurisdiction to entertain the application to rehear
                        or alter the <em>in camera</em> order into an order of
                        a fundamentally different nature.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     I disagreed with the plaintiffs. In my
                    opinion, the <em>in camera</em> order was an accidental
                    slip or omission which could be amended under O 20 r 11 of the ROC
                    because it was clear to the parties at the hearing in August 2007 that I had
                    intended, when I made the orders recorded in the Order of Court, for Suit Y to
                    be heard “otherwise than in open court” pursuant to ss 22 and
                    23 of the IAA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     O 20 r 11 of the ROC states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">Amendment of judgment and orders (O 20
                        r 11)</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">11. Clerical mistakes in judgments or orders, or errors arising therein
                        from any accidental slip or omission, may at any time be corrected by the
                        Court by summons without an appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The commentary to O 20 r 11 in <em>Singapore
                        Civil Procedure</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2007) states (at
                    20/11/1):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The error or omission must be an error in expressing the manifest
                        intention of the court; the court cannot correct a mistake of its own in law
                        or otherwise, even though apparent on the face of the order (<em>Charles Bright &amp; Co Ltd v Sellar</em> [1904]
                        1 KB 6, CA; <em>Re Gist</em> [1904] 1 Ch 398
                        at 408) such as a mistake due to a misunderstanding of a rule or legislation
                            (<em>Bentley v O’Sullivan</em> [1925]
                        WN 95).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In view of the events leading to the
                    defendant’s application in Sum A (see <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a> –
                    <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a> above), I agreed with the defendant
                    that the court’s true meaning and manifest intention in making the order
                    which was recorded in the Order of Court was that it was an order being made
                    pursuant to sections 22 and 23 of the IAA and O 69A r 3(1)(a) of
                    the ROC, <em>i.e</em>. for the proceedings to be held
                    “otherwise than in open court”, as opposed to s 8(2) and
                    s 8(3) of the SCJA and O 42 r 2 of the ROC. This is evident from
                    [129] of the Judgment where I stated that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Even in the present suit, the application under s 22 of the IAA was
                        made in [SUM B] to preserve confidentiality only one day before the trial,
                        and heard on the first day of trial…</p>
<p class="Judg-1">That this was the parties’ understanding of the Order of Court
                    is also reflected in the submissions and letters from both parties, as detailed
                    above. Additionally, the Order of Court specifically stated that the
                    Court’s decision on prayer 2 of the plaintiffs’ application
                        (<em>ie</em> for any judgment pronounced or delivered
                    in Suit Y not to be made available for public inspection) was to be adjourned
                    for hearing on a date to be fixed. After the conclusion of the trial, the
                    plaintiffs brought an application under s 23 of the IAA to restrain
                    publication of the unredacted version of the Judgment (see <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a> above). This clearly indicated that the
                    parties had understood that the order for the hearing to be <em>in camera</em> was made pursuant to ss 22 and 23 of the IAA and
                    that no decision had been made in August 2007 to bar publication of the
                    Judgment. I therefore allowed the defendant’s application to amend the
                    Order of Court to reflect this correct position.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Whilst I agreed with the plaintiffs’
                    submission that a mistake as to the legal effect of a court order is not a
                    ground for amending the court order (see <em>Molnlycke AB and
                        anor v Proctor and Gamble Limited and ors (No. 6)</em> [1993]
                    FRS 154), I noted that there is a difference between a mistake as to the
                    legal effect of a court order and a mistake in the use of words to express the
                    court’s manifest intention. In the former scenario, the court and the
                    parties intended for the order to be made but did not realise its effect whereas
                    in the latter case, the parties intended for a particular order to be made but
                    this intention was not accurately captured in the wording of the court order. In
                    the latter scenario, the error may be corrected by the Court pursuant to
                    O 20 r 11 of the ROC. In the present case, contrary to the
                    plaintiffs’ submission, the <em>in camera</em> order
                    had not been made due to a mistake or misunderstanding as to the legal effect of
                    such an order. Rather, the court had clearly intended to make an order for the
                    hearing to be heard otherwise than in open court pursuant to ss 22 and 23
                    of the IAA but had used the words “<em>in
                        camera</em>” to express such an intention.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The plaintiffs had also sought to rely on the
                    cases <em>Regina v Cripps, ex parte Muldoon</em> [1984]
                    QB 686 and <em>Preston Banking Company v William Allsup
                        &amp; Sons</em> [1895] 1 Ch 141 in which the English courts had
                    stated that a trial judge or a court cannot reconsider a final and regular
                    decision once it has been perfected, even if it has been obtained by fraud. In
                    my opinion, these cases did not assist the plaintiffs. The rationale behind the
                    decisions in these cases is that a court should not be allowed to consider or
                    vary his decisions once an order has been perfected. In the present case, an
                    amendment of the Order of Court would accurately reflect the decision that was
                    actually made in August 2007 and did not vary that decision in any
                way.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Decision on the publication of the Judgment</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Having allowed the defendant’s
                    application to amend the Order of Court, the issue then became whether the
                    Judgment should be published where the hearing had been held otherwise than in
                    open court pursuant to ss 22 and 23 of the IAA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Sections 22 and 23 of the IAA provide as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Proceedings to be heard otherwise than in open

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Restrictions on reporting of proceedings heard

                        proceedings under this Act in any court heard otherwise than in open
                        court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) A court hearing any proceedings to which this section applies shall,
                        on the application of any party to the proceedings, give directions as to
                        whether any and, if so, what information relating to the proceedings may be
                        published.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3) A court shall not give a direction under subsection (2)
                        permitting information to be published unless —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a) all parties to the proceedings agree that such information may be
                        published; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b) the court is satisfied that the information, if published in
                        accordance with such directions as it may give, would not reveal any matter,
                        including the identity of any party to the proceedings, that any party to
                        the proceedings reasonably wishes to remain confidential.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(4) Notwithstanding subsection (3), where a court gives grounds of
                        decision for a judgment in respect of proceedings to which this section
                        applies and considers that judgment to be of major legal interest, the court
                        shall direct that reports of the judgment may be published in law reports
                        and professional publications but, if any party to the proceedings
                        reasonably wishes to conceal any matter, including the fact that he was such
                        a party, the court shall —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a) give directions as to the action that shall be taken to conceal that
                        matter in those reports; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b) if it considers that a report published in accordance with directions
                        given under paragraph (<em>a</em>) would be likely
                        to reveal that matter, direct that no report shall be published until after
                        the end of such period, not exceeding 10 years, as it considers
                        appropriate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Section 23(3)(b), read with s 23(2),
                    allowed for the publication of the Judgment, on the application of either party
                    to the proceedings, if it was sufficiently redacted to conceal all matters that
                    the parties reasonably wished to be concealed. In my opinion, the redacted
                    version of the Judgment, which had been approved by both parties, adequately
                    concealed the identities of the parties to the proceedings in Suit Y and other
                    matters which the plaintiffs wished to remain confidential. Accordingly, I had
                    the discretion to give directions concerning the redacting and publication of
                    the redacted Judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The plaintiffs submitted that I should not
                    allow the Judgment to be published for three main reasons. First, the plaintiffs
                    claimed that to allow publication of the Judgment would undermine the Court of
                    Appeal’s direction that the Court of Appeal’s decision should remain
                    confidential. The parties disagreed as to the directions given by the Court of
                    Appeal with regards to the confidentiality of its decision. The plaintiffs
                    claimed that the Court of Appeal had directed that its decision should be kept
                    confidential with liberty to the parties to apply for directions if there was a
                    change in circumstances. On the other hand, the defendant claimed that the Court
                    of Appeal merely directed that the relevant application to publish the Court of
                    Appeal’s decision should first be filed and the Court of Appeal would then
                    decide the matter upon hearing the application. Until then, the Court of
                    Appeal’s decision would remain confidential. Regardless of the actual
                    order made by the Court of Appeal with regards to publication of the Court of
                    Appeal’s decision, it suffices for me to note that the Court of Appeal has
                    not specifically directed that there shall be no publication of the redacted
                    Judgment (of the High Court).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Second, the plaintiffs argued against
                    publication of the Judgment on the ground that since the Court of Appeal had not
                    published its decision, publication of the High Court Judgment would lead to
                    unhelpful speculation as to which of the grounds the Court of Appeal agreed or
                    disagreed with. I agreed with the defendant that this should not be a concern
                    militating against publication.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Third, the plaintiffs’ claimed that
                    publication of the Judgment would defeat the general principle in
                    Singapore’s arbitration law that arbitrations are not only private but
                    also confidential. I agreed with the defendant that the confidentiality of the
                    arbitration was sufficiently preserved by redacting the Judgment to be
                    published.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In any event, section 23(4) of the IAA
                    allows the publication of any judgment considered by the Court to be of
                    “major legal interest” in accordance with directions given by the
                    Court to conceal any matter reasonably desired by any party to the proceedings.
                    The Judgment in issue considered the most recent jurisprudence on
                    confidentiality in arbitration, including the recent English Court of Appeal
                    decision of <em>Emmott v Michael Wilson &amp; Partners</em>
                    [2008] EWCA Civ 184 (“<em>Emmott</em>”).
                    The decision in <em>Emmott</em> had never been discussed by
                    a Court in Singapore. The Judgment in issue contained a comprehensive discussion
                    on the law of confidentiality in arbitration and set out the legal position on
                    the implied obligation of confidentiality in arbitration. I took the view that
                    the Judgment was of major legal interest and its publication after redacting was
                    justified.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Even if I had dismissed the defendant’s
                    application to amend the Order of Court in Sum A such that the proceedings were
                    indeed heard <em>in camera</em>, I disagreed with the
                    plaintiffs’ submissions that this would be an absolute bar to publication
                    of the Judgment. The application in Sum B for the confidentiality of the
                    proceedings was granted pursuant to s 22 of the IAA. The plaintiffs
                    submitted that regardless of whether the <em>in camera</em>
                    order was made under s 22 of the IAA or s 8 of the SCJA, the common
                    law and O 42 r 2 of the ROC barred publication of the judgment.
                    Order 42 rule 2 provides that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">Judgment in proceedings heard in
                        camera</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2. Where proceedings are heard in camera pursuant to any written law, any
                        judgment pronounced or delivered in such proceedings shall not be available
                        for public inspection except that the Court may, on such terms as it may
                        impose, allow an inspection of such judgment by, or a copy thereof to be
                        furnished to, a person who is not a party to the proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The plaintiffs claimed that O 42 r 2 of the ROC applies
                    specifically to proceedings heard <em>in camera</em> whilst
                    s 23 of the IAA only imposes restrictions on the reporting of proceedings heard
                        <em>otherwise than in open court</em>. The plaintiffs
                    relied on the maxim <em>generalia specialibus non
                        derogant</em> to argue that O 42 r 2 takes precedence over
                    s23 of the IAA in the event that a hearing is held <em>in
                        camera</em>. The plaintiffs also cited the cases of <em>Clibbery v Allan and anor</em> [2002] EWCA Civ 45 and <em>Department of Economics, Policy and Development of the City of
                        Moscow and another v Bankers Trust Co and another</em> [2004] EWCA
                    Civ 314 (“<em>Department of Economics, Policy and
                        Development of the City of Moscow v Bankers Trust Co</em>”), as
                    authority for the proposition that there should be no subsequent publication of
                    information arising from proceedings heard in camera.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The maxim <em>generalia
                        specialibus non derogant</em> provides that “where the literal
                    meaning of a general enactment covers a situation for which specific provision
                    is made by another enactment contained in an earlier Act, it is presumed that
                    the situation was intended to be dealt with by the specific provision rather
                    than the later general one” (Francis Bennion, <em>Statutory interpretation: a code</em>, London: LexisNexis 2008,
                        5<sup>th</sup> Ed at p306). In my opinion, the maxim
                    did not apply in the plaintiffs’ favour in the present case.
                    Section 23 of the IAA deals specifically with proceedings under the IAA
                    whilst O 42 r 2 of the ROC deals generally with proceedings held
                        <em>in camera</em>. Section 23 of the IAA cannot be
                    construed as a general enactment vis-à-vis O 42 r 2 of the ROC on the
                    issue of proceedings heard in camera. Section 23 of the IAA deals in detail with
                    the situation where proceedings under the IAA are heard otherwise than in open
                    court (including where the proceedings are heard <em>in
                        camera</em>) and should be applied in the present case instead of the
                    cases cited by the Appellant as listed in the preceding paragraph. Moreover, in
                        <em>Department of Economics, Policy and Development of the
                        City of Moscow v Bankers Trust Co</em>, the English Court of Appeal
                    accepted that where judgment could be given without disclosing significant
                    confidential information, the public interest in ensuring appropriate standards
                    of fairness in the conduct of arbitrations militated in favour of a public
                    judgment, even though the hearing might have been in private. In the words of
                    Mance LJ at [39]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Further, even though the hearing may have been in private, the court
                        should, when preparing and giving judgment, bear in mind that any judgment
                        should be given in public, where this can be done without disclosing
                        significant confidential information… Arbitration is an important
                        feature of international, commercial and financial life, and there is
                        legitimate interest in its operation and practice. The desirability of a
                        public judgment is particularly present in any case where a judgment
                        involves points of law or practice which may offer future guidance to
                        lawyers or practitioners…</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Even if the defendant had not applied to amend the Order of Court, I
                    would agree with the defendant that s 23 of the IAA applied, instead of
                    O 42 r 2 of the ROC, so that publication of the Judgment (with the
                    appropriate redactions) may be ordered where the hearing was held <em>in camera</em> pursuant to an application granted on the
                    basis of ss 22 and 23 of the IAA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     For the foregoing reasons, I allowed the
                    defendant’s application in Sum A to amend the Order of Court and ordered
                    that the redacted version of the Judgment may be published. I further ordered
                    that without the leave of the court, there shall be no disclosure of the
                    unredacted Judgment and the identities of the persons, entities and matters
                    anonymised in the redacted version of the Judgment. After hearing the parties on
                    costs, I decided that there should be no order as to costs.</p>
