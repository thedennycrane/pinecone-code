The important evidence that points towards Kwan’s actual receipt of these cash withdrawals (plus $2,000 cash which Teo had in hand for Loan No. 3) is the subsequent issuance of cash cheques many months later by Kwan to Teo, the total sum of which very coincidentally matches the same total loan quantum of $1,621,000.00 as claimed by Teo. The objective evidence here points towards an intended repayment by Kwan <span class="font-italic">vide</span> several post-dated cash cheques of an aggregate loan of $1,621,000.00 that he had taken from Teo.

</div> He contends that since the date of the first cheque (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 13 November 2016) was two years after large sums of money had allegedly been loaned to Kwan, it is not possible for Teo to have loaned such large sums without asking for any collateral or agreement at that time but only two years later.

</div> In my view, this does not logically follow. It is not unbelievable that Teo did not ask for any written loan agreement or documentation initially because of the goodwill Teo had towards Kwan. It is Teo’s consistent and uncontradicted evidence that he treated Kwan as a very close friend that he had known for over twenty years and had regarded Kwan as his “brother”. Further, I accept that he had grounds to be assured of Kwan’s creditworthiness because Kwan owned multiple properties, paid Teo to renovate his properties, invested for Teo’s wife successfully and was even proxy for several high net worth investors(see [7]–[9] above). Therefore, the fact that the total sum of all the cash cheques received by Teo from Kwan as intended repayment or assurance of repayment is the same as Teo’s claim as to the total loan quantum [given by him], namely $1,621,000.00, is probative of Teo’s version of events.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Second, on Teo’s version of events, he loaned a sum of $245,000.00 on 11 July 2015 to Kwan (see Loan No. 4 in the table provided at [10]). Teo submits that, in this particular instance, Kwan deposited the cash into his Citibank account two days later on 13 July 2015. Kwan’s Citibank account statement shows a previous balance of $3,174.31 on 1 July 2015 and a cash deposit of $250,000.00 on 13 July 2015.

</div>
</div> As such, this lends credence to Teo’s version of events.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 When cross-examined, Kwan could not proffer a good explanation for this cash deposit. On his own version of events, there was only one loan of $250,000.00 given in June 2015 and another loan of $300,000.00 given in November 2015 (see [15] above). Interestingly, Kwan does not assert that he had kept the $250,000.00 given in June 2015 and only deposited it on 13 July 2015. Instead, he claims that the $250,000.00 loan given in June 2015 was spent on salaries and payments for housing loans, and the cash deposit on 13 July 2015 was not from Teo.

</div> But he does not explain how he had gotten such a huge sum of money at that time or say who he had borrowed it from. On balance, I accept that it is more likely that the $250,000.00 deposit came from Teo’s Loan No. 4 of $245,000.00 given in cash to Kwan two days earlier. As such, this is corroborative of Teo’s version of events. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Third, Kwan’s own version of events is riddled with inconsistencies. It is contradicted by his own police report against Teo dated 25 June 2018.

</div> In that report, he stated that the first time he borrowed money from Teo was “one and a half year[s] ago sometime in end 2016” and the sum was $200,000.00. He also stated that “[on] and off, I still borrowed money from him and in total I have received a total of SGD$800,000.00 from him”. However, on Kwan’s own version of events, his first loan from Teo was $250,000.00 in June 2015 and he maintains that he had only taken two loans from Teo which amount to $550,000.00. Not only are there clear contradictions, what he stated in his police report clearly suggests that there were other loans given to him by Teo other than the two loans he admits to.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 These inconsistencies are stark especially since Kwan claims to have an excel spreadsheet recording the cash loans given to him and the repayments in cash.

</div> As such, there should be no reason for him to give an inaccurate version of the loans and repayments to the police when he could have easily checked and/or made the spreadsheet available to the police to support his allegations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 In his police report dated 25 June 2018, he said the following:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">On and off, I still borrowed money from him and in total I have received a total of SGD$800,000 from him.

According to his account before the court, he had paid a total of $1,497,000.00 by April 2018 (see [18] above). Yet, he informed the police that he had in total repaid over $900,000.00 which is substantially lower than the sum that he now claims to have repaid. Additionally, while Kwan claimed in his police report to have been forced to write a $500,000.00 cheque to Teo, Teo has not adduced or included any cheque of $500,000.00 in making out his claim (see [13] above). If Teo had indeed received the cheque, there is no reason why Teo would not have produced the cheque and increased his claim amount.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Under cross-examination, Kwan’s answer to these inconsistencies is that he was emotional at the time of making the police report because he was worried about his family since “Teo and his people [were] already at [his] house” and his wife had called him and was crying very badly.

</div>
</div> However, I find this explanation a convenient afterthought and unbelievable. In the police report, Kwan stated the following:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">As long as I don’t pay him, he will threaten that he will send people down to my house, send letters to my neighbors, reminding me that he knows where my daughter study and when my wife leave the house. The latest threat that he gave me was that he informed me that it is very cheap to get people down from Malaysia and do something to me. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I would also like to state that he has not harassed my house, my family members and my neighbors as of now. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 It is inconceivable that, if Kwan’s wife had truly called him and was crying very badly with Teo outside the door, Kwan would have withheld that crucial piece of information from the police and not asked for immediate assistance. His use of the words “the latest threat he gave me” implied that up to the material time Kwan was making the police report, this was the most egregious act by Teo. He also clearly stated of his own volition in his police report that there was no harassment of his house or family members up to that point in time.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Aside from the police report, I note that inconsistencies also exist in Kwan’s version of events in his defence dated 9 September 2019, his affidavit evidence-in-chief dated 1 September 2020 and his evidence at trial. In his defence, he claims that the actual amounts borrowed were $225,000.00 in May 2016 and $245,000.00 in November 2016. In his affidavit evidence-in-chief, he claims that the actual amounts borrowed were $250,000.00 in June 2015 and $245,000.00 in November 2015. At trial, he claims that the actual amounts borrowed were $250,000.00 in June 2015 and $300,000.00 in November 2015. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 When cross-examined on these inconsistencies, Kwan explains that while he borrowed $250,000.00 in June 2015 and $300,000.00 in November 2015, he only received cash of $225,000.00 in June 2015 and $245,000.00 in November 2015. For the June 2015 loan, Teo deducted the first month of interest of $25,000.00 from the loan amount of $250,000.00. For the November 2015 loan, Teo deducted the first month of interest of $45,000.00 and $10,000.00 as coffee money for the loan amount of $300,000.00.

</div> However, if that is the case, it is inexplicable why Kwan recorded the sum of $250,000.00 for the June 2015 loan (including the $25,000.00 interest) but recorded the sum of $245,000.00 for the November 2015 loan (excluding the $45,000.00 interest and $10,000.00 coffee money) in his affidavit evidence-in-chief. In the light of his background in the finance industry and given that Kwan purportedly has an excel sheet recording all these transactions, I find these inconsistencies and his explanations for the inconsistencies damaging to his credibility. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Given the foregoing, I find on a balance of probabilities that Teo’s version of events is true and that Teo had granted seven loans (as set out at [10] above) with an aggregate amount of $1,621,000.00 to Kwan (the “Loans”).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 2: Whether the loans were interest-bearing </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 I turn next to the issue of whether the Loans were interest-bearing. This has a significant bearing on Kwan’s main defence that the Loans are unenforceable under the MLA. Teo maintains that the Loans were given on an interest-free basis while Kwan asserts that he had to pay interest for the Loans. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 On balance, I accept Teo’s submission that the Loans were given on an interest-free basis. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Kwan primarily relies on a series of WhatsApp messages with Teo to assert that Teo had continually demanded for interest payments.

</div> It was Kwan who requested Teo to relay the information from the Malaysian loan sharks to him in written form through WhatsApp messages.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 I accept Teo’s submission on this point. If Teo had charged interest beginning with the first loan in 2014, there would likely be WhatsApp messages between Teo and Kwan showing Teo constantly reminding Kwan of the repayment dates and amounts of interest accruing from time to time as Kwan borrowed more and more money from Teo. There is no explanation given by Kwan as to why Teo would change his dominant mode of communication from phone calls before end 2017 to WhatsApp messages after end 2017. If Kwan’s case is accepted, it stands to reason that there must have been some similar messages requesting for interest payments after November 2014. However, Kwan has not adduced any such evidence. It is conspicuous that only messages for end 2017 and 2018 were adduced. Further, I find it hard to accept Kwan’s assertion that he was not able to recover messages from 2015 to end 2017. From the words “TODAY” or “YESTERDAY” present on the screenshots of many of the WhatsApp messages, it is apparent that Kwan had the presence of mind to screenshot the WhatsApp messages on the day the messages were sent to him or the next day.

</div> Thus, it is more likely that Teo’s explanation is true. On Teo’s case, the answer to this is simply that there were no such messages prior to end 2017 either stating the amount or demanding payment of the accrued interest because the Malaysian Loan had not come into existence at that time and the Loans to Kwan were given interest-free. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 It is also telling that the figures in the WhatsApp messages do not correspond at all to either parties’ account of the quantum of the various loans extended at various times from Teo to Kwan. This makes Teo’s case more believable since the seventh and final loan took place on 20 October 2017 (see above at [10]) and the Malaysian Loan came into existence only after that when Teo no longer had money to lend to Kwan.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 In several of the messages, Teo made references to his position as guarantor for the Malaysian Loan.

On questioning, he recounts that cash of $800,000.00 constituting the Malaysian Loan was handed over by the Malaysians who were on motorcycles behind the hawker centre near the Singapore Customs to Kwan through his side of the window.

</div> Kwan and Teo were at that time seated in the car. After Kwan passed to them 12 pieces of cheques bearing his signature, the Malaysians looked at them before riding off subsequently.

</div> It is clear that this request was in the context of the documents required for the Malaysian Loan. It is inconceivable that Teo would suddenly request for such detailed documentation when it is Kwan’s own evidence that the loans taken by him in June and November 2015 were given in cash with no documentation. It is unlikely that Teo would suddenly request for such documentation in 2018 for no reason. However, Teo’s WhatsApp messages can be adequately explained by the existence of the Malaysian loan sharks since the granting of the Malaysian Loan by them would very likely be conditional upon such documentation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In the premises, I accept Teo’s evidence that the Malaysian Loan exists and are separate from the Loans. The WhatsApp messages relied on by Kwan concern only the interest payments for the Malaysian Loan. They have nothing to do with Teo’s Loans.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Apart from Teo’s testimony that the Loans were interest-free, I also rely on the fact that the total principal sum for the Loans based on the relevant cash withdrawals (which total $1,619,000.00) from Teo and/or his wife’s bank account as stated in the bank statements <span class="font-italic">largely</span> <span class="font-italic">matched</span> the aggregate amount of the cash cheques (which total $1,621,000.00) issued by Kwan and given to Teo as repayment or an assurance of repayment of the Loans.

This further demonstrates that the Loans were free of interest. If the Loans were interest-bearing, then the aggregate amount of the cash cheques issued by Kwan for repayment or assurance of repayment would have to be much greater than the total principal sum of the Loans based on the bank statements furnished by Teo, which is not the case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Therefore, I find that Teo did not charge any interest for the Loans he gave to Teo. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 3: Whether Kwan made any repayment to Teo</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 The only remaining factual issue is whether any repayment has been made by Kwan to Teo. Kwan claims that he has repaid a sum of $1,497,000.00 in cash over 16 repayments (see [18] above) while Teo has maintained consistently that Kwan has not made any repayment till date (see [14] above). In such a situation, the court must rely on the trite principle that he who asserts a fact must prove it.

</div> For the final alleged repayment of $487,000.00 in April 2018, Kwan also relies on a WhatsApp message where he told Teo “the money I got immediately from the sales of the condo I immediately return and the fund didn’t even stay extra day in my account”.

As I recognise (at [22] above), the presence of such bank statements do not show that the amounts withdrawn had in fact been paid to the recipient. There must be other corroborating evidence to show that. In so far as Kwan’s case is that the WhatsApp messages do show Teo’s demands for repayment, it bears noting that none of the figures in the WhatsApp messages actually match the amounts of Kwan’s alleged repayments (see [18] above).

Therefore, this does not assist Kwan. Even with respect to this specific message, the reply to that message contradicts Kwan’s case. In response, Teo replied as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Ya I know this is what we have Agee if not I will not going around ask the Casio side to load you.

Therefore, Teo recommended to Kwan to sell another one of his properties so that Kwan could repay the Malaysian Loan. The two messages, viewed together, do not support Kwan’s contention that he had repaid Teo a sum of $1,497,000.00 in cash over 16 repayments.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 For completeness, I note that Kwan’s police report mentions that he had paid about $500,000.00 in interest and another lump sum of $481,000.00 to Teo (see [27] above). However, Kwan has not adduced any evidence to corroborate those assertions. Even Kwan’s account of his own repayments does not include either sum of $500,000.00 or $481,000.00 (see [18] above). While the latter sum of $481,000.00 may plausibly be a reference to the sum of $487,000.00 from Kwan’s sale of his property, I have earlier found that it was made in repayment of the Malaysian Loan and not the Loans. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 In the premises, I find that Kwan has not shown that he has made any repayment to Teo for the Loans. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 4: Whether Teo is an unlicensed moneylender under the MLA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Given my factual findings above, I turn now to address the final issue on whether Teo is an unlicensed moneylender under the MLA. It is trite that the MLA prohibits the business of moneylending rather than the mere act of lending money.

If the borrower can show that a person lends a sum of money in consideration of a larger sum being repaid, the person is presumed to be a moneylender. Once a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> presumption is raised, it is for the lender to rebut the presumption by showing that it does not apply. He has to bring himself within one of the exceptions in s 2 or show that he is not a moneylender within the terms of the definition in s 2. In rebutting the presumption, the claimant, for instance, has to show that there was neither system nor continuity in moneylending. The local test of whether there is a business of moneylending is whether there was a system and continuity in the transactions. If no system or continuity is displayed, the alternative test (the [<span class="font-italic">Litchfield</span><span class="font-italic"> v Dreyfus </span>[1906] 1 KB 584 (“<span class="font-italic">Litchfield</span>”)] test) of whether the alleged moneylender is one who is ready and willing to lend to all and sundry provided that they are from his point of view eligible is used …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">12 In the case where the borrower is unable to raise the presumption in s 3, the burden is then on him to prove the business of moneylending through the two tests mentioned. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 As I have found that the Loans were interest-free (at [49] above), Kwan cannot rely on the presumption in s 3 of the MLA. The burden is thus on Kwan to prove that Teo is in the business of moneylending by either showing that “there was a system and continuity in the transactions” or that Teo is “one who is ready and willing to lend to all and sundry provided that they are from his point of view eligible”.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 In considering whether there is a “system or continuity in the transactions”, the court asks whether the loans are part of an ongoing and routine series of transactions made by the alleged moneylender (see <span class="font-italic">Neville, Guy v </span><span class="font-italic">Andrla, Dominic </span>[2017] SGHC 295 at [15(b)]).

In terms of continuity, the existence of a number of loans does not necessarily mean that the lender is a moneylender (see <span class="font-italic">Ding </span><span class="font-italic">Leng Kong v Mok Kwong Yue and others </span>[2003] 4 SLR(R) 637 at [52]). Thus, just because the Loans were made on seven occasions (see [10] above), this does not necessarily mean that there is the requisite degree of continuity to make Teo a moneylender. The facts do not show an ongoing and routine series of transactions. To the contrary, they show that the Loans were given occasionally by Teo to Kwan as per Kwan’s requests on account of their very close friendship.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Since there is no system or continuity in the transactions, I turn to consider whether Teo is “one who is ready and willing to lend to all and sundry provided that they are from his point of view eligible”. Teo has given evidence that while he has lent small sums of $1,000.00 to $2,000.00 to his friends, workers and subcontractors, he has not charged interest and has even forgiven their debts if they did not repay him.

</div> Kwan has not adduced any evidence to show that Teo has been always willing to lend to all and sundry so long as they are eligible. Since Teo’s evidence on this point is uncontradicted, I accept that apart from Kwan, Teo had lent money occasionally to his friends, workers and subcontractors but he is not one who can be described as “ready and willing to lend to all and sundry provided that they are from his point of view eligible”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 For the foregoing reasons, I find that Teo is not an unlicensed moneylender under the MLA. As such, the Loans are enforceable as against Kwan.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 I note that Kwan has also raised s 14(3A)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MLA to argue that Teo had assisted in a contravention of s 5(1) of the MLA by collecting or demanding payments of a loan on behalf of a person whom Teo knows or has reasonable grounds to believe is carrying a business in contravention of s 5(1) of the MLA.
