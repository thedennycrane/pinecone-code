        Choo Han Teck J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The appellant, a 42-year old man drove his car
                    SFJ 5953 T into a traffic controlled junction at Yishun Street 72 and Yishun
                    Ring Road at 6.45am on 13 February 2008. In so doing his car collided
                    against a motorcycle ridden by a 19-year old Ng Yaoming. Ng died as a result of
                    the collision. His 20-year old pillion rider, Wong Wei Xia was injured. The
                    appellant was charged under s 66(1) of the Road Traffic Act, (Cap 276, 2004
                    Rev Ed) for driving in a manner dangerous to the public. He was also charged
                    under s 338 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) for causing grievous
                    hurt to the pillion rider</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The main issue at trial was whether the
                    appellant drove into the junction when the traffic light had already turned red
                    against him. The prosecution adduced evidence from Wong Wei Xia as well as two
                    independent witnesses, Neo Che Kok (“Neo”) and Haji Roslan bin
                    Kasin (“Haji Roslan”). Neo testified that he had stopped at the
                    junction in the same direction as the motorcycle. When he saw that the light
                    changed to green in his favour he engaged the gears of his truck and was about
                    to move when he noticed the appellant’s maroon coloured MPV
                    “dash” past him and then the motorcycle crashed against the MPV.
                    Similarly, Haji Roslan who was on a bicycle gave a similar version of what he
                    saw. Neo and Haji Roslan were cross-examined and they maintained their version
                    of the accident. The trial judge accepted their evidence, and after considering
                    them with the rest of the evidence, including the expert evidence of the
                    defence, she found the appellant guilty as charged.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       In so far as the facts were concerned, I did not
                    think that I could interfere with the findings made below especially when
                    important facts were gleaned from the testimonies of eye-witnesses. Mr
                    Sreenivasan, counsel for the appellant, argued that the court below failed to
                    apply <em>Lim Hong Eng v PP</em> [2009] 3 SLR(R) 682,
                    (“Lim Hong Eng”) a previous decision of this court. Counsel
                    submitted that the evidence in the appellant’s case were similar to that
                    in <em>Lim Hong Eng</em>. I did not think so. I held in
                        <em>Lim Hong Eng</em> that what constituted dangerous
                    as well as rash driving are matters of fact for the trial judge to determine.
                    Only obvious instances in which the appellate can be certain that the facts were
                    wrong would it interfere. <em>Lim Hong Eng</em> was an
                    unusual case because the findings of fact made by the trial judge supported the
                    appellant’s case that she was more negligent than rash. The relevant
                    passage in which I set out those facts is as follows at [5]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It appears from the evidence that [Lim Hong eng] was not aware that the
                        traffic lights had turned red. This was a finding made by the District
                        Judge, who held that the appellant did not intend to beat the red light, and
                        had entered the Junction unaware not only of the fact that the lights were
                        red against her, but also that the motorcycle was passing through the
                        junction ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The prosecution in that case also conceded that Lim Hong Eng was not
                    speeding. <em>Lim Hong Eng</em> thus turned on different
                    facts. In cases like this and <em>Lim Hong Eng</em>,
                    inferences in respect of facts such as whether the crossing by a vehicle into
                    the path of another was done in a manner that was dangerous was for the trial
                    judge based on the finding of other facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       In the present case the trial judge acknowledged
                    that there was no evidence that “the appellant had deliberately failed to
                    take note of the traffic light signals.” Contrary to counsel’s
                    submissions, this was not a case of her placing a burden on the appellant. It
                    was an observation made to support the court’s view that “every
                    driver crossing a signalised junction must adhere to the traffic light signals
                    which are there to regulate the traffic.” I think that must be right.
                        <em>Lim Hong Eng</em> was different in that the trial
                    judge’s findings supported the accused person’s account that she
                    thought that the light was green in her favour. Not every instance of such
                    confusion would merit a reduction in charge or sentence but in the overall
                    circumstances, there was sufficient evidence in the judge’s own findings
                    of fact to give the benefit of doubt to the appellant in <em>Lim
                        Hong Eng</em>. Perusing the grounds of decision of the trial judge in
                    this case, I am of the view that she did not accept the submission that the
                    appellant crossed into the junction mistaking the light to be green in his
                    favour. <em>Lim Hong Eng</em> was not a case that
                    propounded any new law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Accordingly, the appeal before me failed and was
                    dismissed. However, given counsel’s submission as to the circumstances,
                    namely, that the appellant was driving his daughter to school, and that he was
                    not a “racer”, as well as the fact that he attended to the
                    injured, I reduced the overall sentence from nine months to four months (four
                    months on each charge to run concurrently).</p>
