<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was an appeal against the sentence imposed
                    by the District Court in Ministry of Manpower (MOM) Summons No. 1804 -
                    1807/2009 and 1810 - 11/2009. The appellant, an incorporated company, had
                    pleaded guilty to six charges for making false declarations to the Ministry of
                    Manpower (MOM) in connection with its application for work passes for foreign
                    workers under s 22(1)(d) of the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act
                    (Cap 91A, 1997 Rev Ed)(“the Act”). The appellant was
                    sentenced to a fine of $10,000 for each of these offences (collectively referred
                    hereafter as “the offences”), making a total fine of $60,000.
                    Seven other similar charges under s 22(1)(d) of the Act were also taken
                    into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. The court ordered the
                    appellant to pay $20,000 of the fine forthwith, with the balance of $40,000 in
                    instalments of $10,000 per month beginning 1 June 2009 and thereafter on or
                    before the 1<sup>st</sup> of each subsequent
                month.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The appellant was untraced and had a clean
                    record. The appellant was run by its sole shareholder and director, one Lim Chek
                    Chee (“Lim”) and Lim had earlier also been charged for the same
                    offences as the appellant under s 22(1)(d) of the Act. Lim was sentenced to
                    two months imprisonment per charge, with three of the six charges running
                    concurrently for a total imprisonment term of six months. The written grounds of
                    the District Judge in relation to the present appeal could be found in <em>Public Prosecutor v Lim Kopi Holdings Pte Ltd</em> [2009]
                    SGDC 209 (“the GD”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Section 22(1)(d) of the Act provides as
                    follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       After hearing the submissions of the
                    appellant’s counsel and the respondent, I reduced the fine imposed for
                    each of the offences from $10,000 to $3,000, making a total fine of $18,000. I
                    also ordered that the excess amount of fine already paid pursuant to the
                    sentence of the District Court be refunded to the appellant. I now give the
                    reasons for my decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The facts of the case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The appellant, Lim Kopi Holdings Pte Ltd, was in
                    the business of operating coffee shops in Ang Mo Kio. Because the appellant and
                    Lim were both inexperienced in running coffee shops, they hired one Patrick Boo
                    (“Patrick”), whose company – Starworld Agency –
                    advised the appellant and Lim in their coffee shop business. For the period
                    between March 2008 to August 2008, the Central Provident Fund (CPF) Board
                    records showed that the appellant was making CPF contributions in respect of
                    some thirty local workers. I should explain here that the MOM determines the
                    number of foreign workers a company is entitled to hire based on the size of the
                    company’s local workforce. Despite what were on the CPF records, more than
                    half of the contributions made were fictitious. These bogus hires were in fact
                    family members and relatives of Lim, who had agreed to let the appellant use
                    their names as part of the scheme to inflate the number of local workers hired
                    by the appellant so that the latter would be permitted to hire more foreign
                    workers. In the two weeks from 24 June 2008 to 1 July 2008, the
                    appellant made several applications for work passes to hire six foreign workers
                    as kitchen assistants in its coffee shop. In so doing, it made the following
                    declarations in its application forms to MOM (see GD at [3]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(i) It was aware that the company’s CPF accounts would be used by
                        the Controller of Work Pass, MOM, to determine the strength of the defendant
                        company’s local workforce, and consequently its foreign worker
                        entitlement; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(ii) It certified that its CPF accounts only included contributions made
                        to persons who are actively employed by it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The reason why an applicant was required to make
                    such declarations was explained by Ms Kwa Chin Bee, prosecutor from the MOM
                    who informed the District Court that “CPF accounts are crucial in the
                    MOM’s process of determining foreign worker entitlements… [and
                    because] it is difficult to examine each and every employment relationships, the
                    Ministry places heavy reliance on the accuracy of the CPF records in its work
                    permit approval process”
                    <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>. It is therefore an
                    offence under s 22(1)(d) of the Act to furnish false or misleading
                    information in relation to such an application. It was undisputed that MOM would
                        <em>not</em> have approved the appellant’s
                    application for work passes for the foreign workers had it known that those
                    bogus local workers in respect of whom CPF contributions were made were in fact
                    never employed by the appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Decision Below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The District Judge, in his GD, emphasised the
                    need to deter offences committed against public institutions and, by committing
                    the six offences, the appellant had “frustrated the Government’s
                    efforts to effectively regulate and monitor the recruitment of foreign labour in
                    Singapore” (GD at [11]). In his view, the approval process was an
                    important “mechanism put in place by MOM in order to regulate the influx
                    of foreign workers whilst protecting equal opportunities for local workers to
                    secure employment”, and because the appellant had intentionally deceived
                    MOM, a substantial fine of $10,000 per charge was warranted (see GD at [11] and
                    [12]). I should add that the District Judge had merely summarised the mitigating
                    factors tendered by the counsel for the appellant, without discussing them, or
                    indicating whether he accepted them (see GD at [6]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The parties’ respective cases</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Appellant’s Case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Counsel for the appellant argued that the
                    District Judge had failed to consider the mitigating factors in this case,
                    resulting in the court imposing a deterrent sentence which was manifestly
                    excessive and not commensurate with the moral culpability of the appellant. The
                    salient mitigating factors relied on by the appellant could be summarised in the
                    following manner. First, because the appellant and Lim were in essence the
                    “same entity”, the court should not in such a circumstance impose
                    deterrent sentence twice over.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>
                    Second, the appellant also argued that the actions of the appellant were not
                    motivated by profit and a reduction of sentence was warranted as there were no
                    victims in the present case and no financial loss was caused<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>. Third,
                    the hiring of fictitious local workers was essentially the idea of Patrick and
                    not the appellant or Lim. The appellant had therefore committed the offence out
                    of misguided trust in Patrick.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Respondent’s Case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The respondent’s case was, in broad
                    strokes, identical to the one presented by Ms Kwa Chin Bee before the
                    District Judge below (see <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a> above). The
                    respondent urged this court to take a stiff stand towards the appellant as the
                    principle of deterrence was a “dominant consideration” in
                    sentencing when deception of a public body was involved<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>. In reply to the appellant’s
                    case, the respondent made the following arguments. First, even if the appellant
                    and Lim were “the same entity”, s 20 of the Act provides for
                    the equal punishment of companies and persons alike for offences under the Act
                    and the appellant was therefore not being punished <em>twice</em> by the fines imposed on it.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> Second, it was said that
                    contrary to the appellant’s argument that it did not profit from the
                    offences, the scheme to make false CPF contributions to fictitious local workers
                    stemmed from “Lim’s concern that the coffee shop be a viable
                        business”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>Accordingly, “it was wholly inaccurate to
                    argue that the appellant had not intended to profit from the offences”.
                    Rather, the profit “was the continuing financial viability of the coffee
                    shop business venture”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> and the “gain” was the
                    appellant’s hiring of the six foreign workers.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> It was also
                    irrelevant that there were no victims or financial loss caused. This was because
                    the very <em>raison d’être</em> of s 22(1)(d) of
                    the Act was to “regulate and monitor the recruitment of foreign labour in
                    Singapore”
                    <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> and the
                    presence of victims or financial losses were not therefore preconditions to an
                    infringement of s 22(1)(d). Third, the respondent rejected as without
                    merits the appellant’s argument that it had committed the offences under
                    influence by Patrick because “it would have been clear to Lim that such a
                    course of action was illegal or <em>at [the] least,
                        improper</em>”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">My decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     This case throws up an interesting issue of
                    how corporate offenders should be sentenced when the person managing the company
                    has also been dealt with for the same, or substantially the same, infringements.
                    Before we go further, I should add that at no time should it be doubted that an
                    offence under s 22(1)(d) of the Act is a serious one, which ought to be
                    dealt with swiftly and sternly by the courts. Deterrence is therefore without
                    dispute an important consideration for such offences; otherwise the very object
                    of such a law would be flagrantly undermined. This much was clear from the
                    second reading of the Employment of Foreign Workers (Amendment) Bill (see
                        <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official
                        Report</em> (22 May 2007) vol 83 at col 928 <em>per</em> the then Minister for Manpower, Dr Ng Eng Hen
                    (“Dr Ng”)). Notably, Dr Ng emphasised that offences of
                    deception warrant <em>stiffer</em> penalties to
                    “maintain the equilibrium” between the economic advantages of
                    having access to foreign manpower and other social objectives such as enabling
                    locals to compete for jobs with foreign workers (<em>id</em>, at col 928):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The ability of our companies to access foreign manpower is a comparative
                        advantage. But our foreign worker policy cannot be based on a <em>laissez-faire</em> approach, which will be detrimental to
                        our overall progress…We constantly monitor the labour situation and
                        make fine adjustments to maintain the equilibrium between our economic
                        competitiveness and other social objectives, to enable locals to compete for
                            jobs….<b><em>For Singapore, as a small island, we
                            need to be vigilant and manage our foreign worker population well, to
                            ensure that it continues to contribute positively to our economy. We
                            need a robust system with effective laws, enforcement and safeguards
                            against the illegal entry and employment of foreign
                        workers</em></b>…I will now highlight the significant provisions of
                        the bill…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…[O]ffences of deception. We have made work pass applications
                        user-friendly by allowing submissions through fax, mail or electronically.
                        Work pass criteria are also made known to companies so that they have

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Any deception of public institutions which
                    frustrates the aims of the Act cannot be condoned and the District Judge was
                    certainly justified to state that for such an offence a deterrent sentence is
                    warranted, and expected by society (see GD at [11] where the District Judge
                    relied on the cases of <em>Dong Guitian v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [2004] SGHC 92 and <em>Lim Mong Hong v
                        Public Prosecutor</em> [2003] 3 SLR 88). However, it is also
                    a trite principle, as well as an important precept of sentencing law, that
                    “deterrence must always be <em>tempered by proportionality
                        in relation to the severity of the offence committed as well as by the moral
                        and legal culpability of the offender</em>” (<em>Tan Kay Beng v Public Prosecutor</em> [2006] 4 SLR 10 at
                    [31]; emphasis added). How then could this best be achieved, where a corporate
                    offender was a small family business and the person behind it was also being
                    dealt with by the law? Before proceeding further, I should state that deterrence
                    is without doubt a concept applicable to companies, in the same way as it is
                    applicable to individual offenders. This is because companies are often engaged
                    in the taking of calculated risk, and the only means by which companies can
                    therefore be deterred from engaging in wrongful conduct (companies being legal
                    entities may not be sentenced to imprisonment), would be to ensure that the
                    right forms of financial disincentives are applied. Thus, the following was
                    observed by the New South Wales Law Reform Commission in <em>Sentencing Corporate Offenders</em> (Issues Paper No. 20,
                    November 2001) (“<em>New South Wales Law Reform Commission
                        Report”)</em> at para 3.2:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Deterrence is generally cited as the primary aim of and justification for
                        sentencing corporate offenders. This is because, in theory at least,
                        corporations can be deterred from committing wrongful
                            conduct…<b><em>They tend…to engage in
                            wrongful conduct as a calculated risk, often economically motivated.
                            They can be deterred if that conduct represents a risk that is not worth
                            taking</em></b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(Emphasis added)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Although deterrence may be a <em>predominant</em> sentencing aim for offences under the Act,
                    especially where there is a deception of public institutions such as in the
                    present case, this does not necessarily mean that <em>other</em> sentencing objectives cannot also apply to corporate
                    offenders in an <em>appropriate</em> case where the facts
                    so warranted. In each case, it is useful to bear in mind that “any judge
                    who comes to sentence…ought to have…four classical principles
                        [<em>viz</em>, rehabilitation, deterrence, retribution,
                    and prevention] in mind and to apply them to the facts of the case to see which
                    of them <em>has the greatest importance in the case with which he
                        is dealing”</em> (<em>Public Prosecutor v Kwong
                        Kok Hing</em> [2008] 2 SLR 684 at [17], citing <em>R v Sargeant</em> (1974) 60 Cr App R 74 at [77]). Still,
                    the court must temper the objective of deterrence, with the specific moral and
                    legal culpability of the offender. In this regard, it would be apposite to
                    revisit the words of Chan Sek Keong CJ in <em>Luong Thi Trang
                        Hoang Kathleen v Public Prosecutor</em> [2009] SGHC 250

                    [25]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Judges should not blindly apply any sentencing principle without
                        considering all the circumstances of the case at hand, especially the
                        culpability of the accused in that particular case. It cannot be
                        overemphasised that the court must apply its mind to the facts of each case
                        before it and determine the appropriate sentence accordingly.</p>

                    yet again that sentencing is fact-sensitive and depends on the object behind the

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…[S]entencing is not a purely logical exercise, and the troublesome

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     In the recent decision of <em>Auston International Group v Public Prosecutor</em> [2008]
                    1 SLR 882 (“<em>AIG”</em>), Lee
                    Seiu Kin J noted that three factors were particularly relevant in deciding the
                    quantum of fine to be imposed on a corporate offender. The three factors are (i)
                    the degree of contravention of the statute (“the first factor”);
                    (ii) the intention or motivation of the offender (“the second
                    factor”); and (iii) the steps taken by the company upon discovery of the
                    breach or the degree of remorse shown by the offender (“the third
                    factor”) (see <em>AIG</em> at [13] to [18]). I have
                    no doubt that Lee J did not mean to suggest that this list was in any sense
                    exhaustive. I could envisage another three other factors which would also
                    provide useful guidance to any court faced with the task of determining what a
                    fair quantum of fine should be for a corporate offender. But before identifying
                    the additional three factors, it would be expedient to examine how the facts of
                    the present case stood up to the three factors set out in <em>AIG</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     In this case, although the degree of
                    contravention of the Act was fairly extensive, there being six charges and a
                    further seven taken into account by the lower court, the first factor was
                    mitigated by the second and third <em>AIG</em> factors. To
                    fully appreciate the interplay between the three factors in the instant case, it
                    would be necessary and useful to first understand the working relationship
                    vis-à-vis the appellant, Lim and Patrick. The plea of leniency made by Lim after
                    he was arrested was instructive for this purpose:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Our company has committed an offence, and we have to be responsible for
                        our act. However, on the other hand, we wish to plea for leniency, <b><em>for the fact that we totally have no experience in setting up
                            and running [a] coffee shop business</em></b>, and we had to follow
                        100% the advices from our consultant, Starworld Agency. <b><em>All headcounts that were not actively worked in our company had been
                            removed by Sept 2008</em></b>. We started business in June
                        2008…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Also, after being asked to sign so many work pass applications, <b><em>we felt uncomfortable and on 14<sup>th</sup>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     This plea of leniency offered several insights
                    into the present matter. First, it clearly showed that the appellant and Lim
                    were remorseful after the incident; Lim’s prompt cooperation with MOM and
                    subsequent plea of guilt was a reflection of this. Second, it demonstrated that
                    the appellant and Lim, who were novices in the coffee shop business, were both
                    not entirely comfortable with the false employment scheme, so much so that by
                    September 2008, they replaced the bogus local hires with workers actually
                    employed by the company. This concern also prompted the appellant to seek a
                    written declaration from Starworld Agency, stating that the latter was not
                    receiving any illegal rebates for the hiring of foreign workers. The written
                    declaration and letter of understanding dated 14<sup>th</sup>
                    July 2008 reads as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     While the Prosecution had correctly submitted
                    that it was no excuse (as far as the commission of the offences were concerned)
                    for the appellant to claim that it had entered into the scheme on the behest of
                    Patrick as the appellant should have known – at the very least –
                    that something <em>improper</em> was involved (see
                        <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> above), this did not necessarily
                    equal to the appellant having the <em>blatant</em>
                    intention to defraud MOM. This was evident from the Appellant’s discomfort
                    with the employment scheme, and its concern that Starworld Agency might be
                    taking illegal rebates. In this regard, it must be borne in mind that Starworld
                    Agency was a consultant hired by the appellant and in relying on its advice, I
                    do not think that it could fairly be said that the appellant had deliberately
                    hatched this scheme with the purpose of undermining the object of the Act or
                    defrauding MOM. Reverting to the second and third <em>AIG</em> factors, there was in the present case an absence of a
                        <em>brazen</em> intention to deceive MOM and, instead,
                    there was a clear display of remorse on both the part of both Lim and the
                    appellant as soon as investigations begun into the matter. Therefore, in my
                    view, it would not be right to apply the principle of deterrence simpliciter,
                    without making the necessary adjustment in the light of these mitigating
                    circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     At this juncture, it would be appropriate to
                    discuss the further factors, referred to in <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a> above, that may be relevant to the sentencing of a
                    corporate offender. A fourth factor relevant to our case was the fact that the
                    appellant was essentially the alter ego of Lim, since the latter was the
                    former’s sole shareholder and director. In these circumstances, it could
                    be said that punishing the appellant with a substantial fine would be tantamount
                    to penalizing Lim <em>in extenso</em>. Put in another way,
                    deterrence should not be imposed <em>twice</em>, when the
                    company was solely owned and managed by one individual. While s 20 of the
                    Act, as cited by the respondent, states that a company is equally punishable as
                    an individual for an offence under the Act, this related only to <em>liability</em>, and the quantum of fine or the level of
                    sentence imposed was a matter to be decided separately. In cases involving
                    closely held companies – such as the one before us – the subject of
                    deterrence should rightly be the managers themselves and it is incumbent on the
                    courts to ensure that the totality principle is not breached where the company
                    and manager are in fact one and the same. A similar concern was noted in the
                        <em>New South Wales Law Reform Commission Report</em>
                    at para15.2:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">15.2  If the owners of a corporation have been
                            prosecuted and fined for the same offence, or if they are co-defendants
                            with the corporation, an issue that arises is whether or not the fine
                            imposed on the owners is relevant in determining the amount of fine to
                            be imposed on the corporation. This issue is important in the context of
                            a corporation owned by one director or by a relatively small number of
                            people. In such instances, it may be argued that the corporation is the
                            alter ego of its owners-managers and so an appropriate punishment may be
                            achieved by offsetting the fine imposed on the corporation by the amount
                            imposed on its owners. <b><em>It may be argued that a
                                failure to do so would result in the imposition of a double (and
                                therefore excessive) penalty</em></b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In the present case, the directing mind and will behind the appellant
                    was indisputably Lim, who had already been given a deterrent sentence when he
                    was given a custodial sentence of six months for the same offences. While it
                    could not be denied that the appellant was also guilty of the same offences as
                    Lim, to impose a deterrent fine on the appellant for exactly the same offences
                    for which a deterrent sentence was already imposed on Lim, was to effectively
                    impose double deterrent sentences for the same offences, thus rendering the fine
                    imposed on the appellant manifestly excessive. In such circumstances where the
                    company was effectively the alter ego of its controllers, there was no
                    justification to impose double deterrent sentences. The object of the Act would
                    be sufficiently achieved if a deterrent sentence was already imposed on the
                    person controlling the company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     A fifth factor relevant here was the fact that
                    the appellant was essentially a small family business with little resources. In
                    sentencing a corporate offender, the quantum of fine imposed should not be
                    oppressively such that it vastly exceeds the financial capacity of the company
                    to pay. The fine specified under s 22(1)(d) of the Act is that it should
                    not exceed $15,000 for each charge but when cumulatively added upon, the final
                    quantum payable could become prohibitive for small companies culpable of
                    multiple breaches of the Act. Courts should be slow to impose a manifestly
                    excessive fine, replete with the consequences of running the company aground or
                    out of business. A similar concern was also duly noted by Lee J in the <em>AIG</em> case when he said that it was “not
                    clear…how imposing a severe punishment on the company would deter
                    individuals who manage companies [and] <em>the courts must be
                        careful not to impose overly onerous conditions on the corporate world
                        simply to ensure compliance with regulatory provisions in a situation where
                        the law can effectively be applied to deter individuals from committing such
                        acts</em>” (<em>AIG</em> at [19]; emphasis
                    added). Thus, the corporate offender’s ability to pay is a relevant
                    consideration to be balanced against the need for deterrence and the aims of the
                    other sentencing objectives (see <em>Chia Kah Boon v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [1999] 4 SLR 72). A similar thought was
                    expressed by Scott Baker J in <em>R v F. Howe and Son (Engineers)
                        Ltd</em> [1999] 2 Cr. App. R. (S.) 37, a case where the English Court
                    of Appeal had to sentence a company for the infringement of environmental
                    statutes (at 42 and 43):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We are not persuaded that the size of the company and its lack of ability
                        to provide its own specialist safety and electrical personnel
                            mitigates[<em>sic</em>] these offences. <b><em>The means of the company is, on the other hand a very material
                            factor to the amount of the fine</em></b>…. Other matters that
                        may be relevant to sentence are the degree of risk and extent of the danger
                        created by the offence; the extent of the breach or breaches, for example
                        whether it was an isolated incident or continued over a period and,
                            <b><em>importantly, the defendant's resources and the
                            effect of the fine on its business</em></b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     In this case, the appellant is a private
                    company with a paid up capital of only one dollar. The appellant was also set up
                    using money belonging to Lim and his family members. As pointed out by counsel
                    for the appellant, and I noted this was not disputed by the Prosecution,
                    “$250,000 had already been invested by Lim in this business to date,
                    monies which came from his life savings, loans from relatives and bank
                        loans”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> Business was also poor and “since the
                    business started, it has only generated enough money to pay the monthly rental
                    due on the lease of the premises and the renovation costs”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> Having regard to its financial state, a fine
                    of $60,000 would also in my view, be an oppressive one, which could very well
                    drive the appellant out of business, to the detriment of the family members who
                    had lent Lim the money to set up the business in the first place.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Yet another relevant factor – which I
                    would hasten to add was not one which was applicable in this case but which I
                    thought I should make known nonetheless – would be the consideration of
                    the community of interests which may be affected if a prohibitive fine is
                    imposed on a company. These diverse interests belonging to shareholders,
                    employees and creditors (when the company is in winding up) are relevant
                    considerations particularly in the case of a large corporation, where the
                    criminal conduct is attributable only to a select few managers or controlling
                    minds. In these circumstances, imposing a hefty fine would only pass on the
                    burden of the fine to these <em>other</em> innocent
                    parties, and in an <em>appropriate</em> case, courts should
                    exercise care in the weighing and balancing of this community of
                    interests.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     At this juncture, I will address one other
                    argument raised by the appellant, namely, that the offending acts were not
                    motivated by profit and that there were neither victims nor the causation of
                    financial loss in the present case (see <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a>
                    above). There were two limbs in this argument. In my opinion, both these limbs
                    were without merits and I could not accept them as valid mitigating factors.
                    While the absence of personal gain may be a legitimate mitigating factor and
                    even that is of “very little weight” (see <em>Lai
                        Oei Mui Jenny v Public Prosecutor</em> [1993] SGHC 157 at [3]), it was
                    clear, as the respondent had rightly pointed out, that the financial gain here
                    was the wage differentials saved by the appellant from hiring the foreign
                    workers (see <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> above). As for the argument
                    premised on the absence of victims or financial loss, I would like to make two
                    points in response to it. First, it is a trite principle of sentencing law that
                    in some cases, intangible damage may be even more reprehensible and the absence
                    of actual harm was of little relevance or importance. It may be noted that in
                        <em>Public Prosecutor v Ng Tai Tee Janet</em> [2001]
                    1 SLR 343 the court stated (at [28]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the proceedings before me, counsel for the respondents belaboured the
                        point that no actual harm or loss was suffered by any party and that the
                        respondents believed that they had not caused anyone to suffer. This
                        argument was in my view, misconceived. <b><em>When
                            considerations of public interests were implicated, these factors were
                            of less relevance or importance. The loss or damage sustained was of an
                            intangible nature and the ultimate victim was the State</em></b>. In
                        any case, an act had in fact taken place in consequence of the abetment, the
                        principal offence was not completed only due to the alertness of the SATS
                        officer. The respondents were certainly not entitled to claim any credit for
                        this.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Second, regulatory Acts are very often enacted to promote or advance
                    social policies and it is imperative that their provisions should be strictly
                    complied with in order to ensure that those policies would not be thwarted. In
                    this case, the Act serves an important public policy of maintaining the
                    equilibrium between the comparative advantages of having access to foreign
                    manpower and other social objectives such as enabling locals to compete for jobs
                    with foreign workers (see <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a> above).
                    Bearing in mind the public interests involved, I could <em>not</em> place any weight on the fact that no tangible loss or
                    financial damage was caused. It cannot be emphasised enough that the courts take
                    a stern view of any public deception of government bodies and an appropriate
                    deterrent sentence must be imposed whenever an employer seeks to undermine the
                    objectives of the Act, subject of course, in each instance, to the careful
                    consideration of the legal and moral culpabilities of the offender: see
                        <em>Kathleen Luong</em> at <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a> above.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     For all the above reasons, the District Judge
                    should have taken into account the mitigating circumstances of this case, in
                    particular the second and third <em>AIG</em> factors, as
                    well as the additional factors I have examined above (see <a href="#p1_18">[18]</a> to <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a>).
                    In the result, I agreed with counsel for the appellant that a fine of $10,000
                    for each charge, for a total fine of $60,000 was manifestly excessive. I
                    accordingly reduced the fine to $3,000 per charge, for a total fine of $18,000.
                    I also ordered that the balance amount of fine paid be refunded to the
                    appellant.</p>
