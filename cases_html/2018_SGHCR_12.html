Certain admiralty claims have shorter limitation periods than the six year period applicable to general claims in contract and tort. One example, which is well known to the shipping industry, is claims arising out of vessel collisions which are subject to a two year limitation period under Section 8(1) of the Maritime Conventions Act 1911 (Cap IA3, 2004 Rev Ed) (the “MCA”). A consequence of a shorter limitation period is that the renewal of writs assumes critical importance to protect against claims being defeated by a defence of limitation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 By way of two applications (one each in HC/ADM 3/2017 (“ADM 3”) and HC/ADM 4/2017 (“ADM 4”)), the Defendant applied to set aside two <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> orders which extended the validity of the writs in ADM 3 and ADM 4, for a period of 12 months each (the “Extension Orders”). The Plaintiffs in ADM 3 and ADM 4 had only applied to extend the validity of the writs <span class="font-italic">after</span> the writs ceased to be valid <span class="font-italic">and</span> the two year time bar under the MCA had set in. A setting aside of the Extension Orders would mean that the Plaintiffs’ claims against the Defendant are time-barred under the MCA. The Plaintiffs resisted the setting aside applications, citing, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the Defendant’s conduct during settlement negotiations in the intervening period between the issuance of the writs and their expiry. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 After hearing the parties, I decline to set aside the Extension Orders, but I vary them to the extent that the validity of the writs in ADM 3 and ADM 4 are extended for six months.

O 6 r 4(2) and O 6 r 4(2A) are the relevant provisions which govern the renewal of admiralty writs, and they read as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Duration and renewal of writ (O. 6, r.4)</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) Subject to paragraph (2A), where a writ has not been served on a defendant, the Court may by order extend the validity of the writ from time to time for such period, not exceeding 6 months at any one time, beginning with the day next following that on which it would otherwise expire, as may be specified in the order, if an application for extension is made to the Court before that day or such later day (if any), as the Court may allow.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2A) Where the Court is satisfied on an application under paragraph (2) that despite the making of reasonable efforts, it may not be possible to serve a writ within 6 months, the Court may, if it thinks fit, extend the validity of the writ for such period, not exceeding 12 months at any one time, as the Court may specify.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Broadly, applications to extend the validity of a writ can be classified into three categories (see <span class="font-italic">The “Lircay” </span>[1997] 1 SLR(R) 699 at [19]). The first is where the application is made at a time when the writ is still valid and the before the relevant period of limitation has expired (“Category (1) cases”). The second is where the application is made at the time when the writ is still valid but the relevant period of limitation has expired (“Category (2) cases”). The third is where the application is made after the writ has ceased to be valid and the relevant period of limitation has expired (“Category (3) cases”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The general principles governing the renewal of writs under O 6 r 4 may be briefly stated as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The general rule is that an admiralty writ, if it is to be effective against a defendant, must be issued before the relevant period of limitation has expired and must be served within 12 months of its issue (see  <span class="font-italic">The “Lircay”</span> at [19]). Thus, it is incumbent on a plaintiff to serve the writ promptly (see <span class="font-italic">The “Antares V” </span>[2002] 2 SLR(R) 616 at [20]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The decision to extend the validity of the writ involves an exercise of discretion by the court (see <span class="font-italic">The “Lircay”</span> at [18]), which is to be approached in two stages.  At the first stage, the court considers whether the plaintiff has shown the existence of matters which constitute good reason for an extension to be granted. It is not possible to circumscribe the scope of the expression ‘good reason’ (see <span class="font-italic">The “Lircay”</span> at [18]), although it has been observed that hardship to the plaintiff does not, without more, constitute good reason for an extension to be granted (see <span class="font-italic">The “Ching Ho” </span>[2001] 3 SLR(R) 84 at [21]). More often than not, the issue of good reason for extension is inextricably bound with whether the plaintiff had good reason(s) for failing to serve the writ during the original period of validity (see <span class="font-italic">Waddon v Whitecroft-Scovill Ltd </span>[1988] 1 All ER 996 at 1001a). If the plaintiff succeeds in showing that there is a good reason for an extension, the court then goes on to consider all the circumstances of the case, including the hardship or prejudice to either party, to arrive at a value judgment on whether the extension should be granted or refused (see <span class="font-italic">The “Ching Ho” </span>at [20]-[21] and Toh Kian Sing SC, <span class="font-italic">Admiralty Law and Practice</span> (LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2017) (“<span class="font-italic">Admiralty Law and Practice</span>”) at pp 459-460). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The Defendant’s right to limitation has a strong bearing on how the court’s discretion is to be exercised (see <span class="font-italic">Admiralty Law and Practice</span> at p 460). The defendant in Category (3) cases has an accrued right of limitation whereas defendants in Category (1) and (2) cases do not. Thus, the plaintiff in Category (3) cases must also give a satisfactory explanation for its failure to apply for extension before the writ expired (see <span class="font-italic">Admiralty Law and Practice</span> at p 461). This is because the grant of an extension in a Category (3) case would deprive the defendant of an accrued defence of limitation, and courts are understandably more reluctant to assist a tardy plaintiff who has allowed both the limitation period and the validity of the writ to expire (see <span class="font-italic">Admiralty Law and Practice</span> at p 461). However, that is not to say that the issue of limitation only features as a factor in Category (3) cases. Even in Category (1) and Category (2) cases where there is no issue of an accrued right of limitation, the effect of the extension <span class="font-italic">may</span> be such as to enable a plaintiff to serve the writ after the relevant period of limitation has expired, and the court must bear this in mind when considering whether to grant an extension (see <span class="font-italic">The “Lircay”</span> at [19]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Settlement Negotiations </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Specifically in relation to settlement negotiations, the existence of ongoing settlement negotiations does not, without more, constitute good reason for extension (see <span class="font-italic">The “Ching Ho”</span> at [33]). However, settlement negotiations can amount to good reason for extension if a fair interpretation of the negotiations show either (a) an agreement to defer service of the writ or (b) conduct by the defendant or its representative of such character as to lead a reasonable plaintiff to think that it is unnecessary to serve the writ and to do so would increase the costs in a manner which is unwarranted in the circumstances (<span class="font-italic">see Admiralty Law and Practice </span>at p 463). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Before considering the relevant cases, it would be helpful to unpack the concepts involved. The first concept, an agreement to defer service of the writ, is clear on its face. Case law has found that such agreements can either be express (see <span class="font-italic">The “Lircay” </span>at [3], [9] and [28]) or implied (see <span class="font-italic">The “Owenbawn” </span>[1973] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 56 at 60).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The second concept requires further elaboration. In my view, there are two aspects to this. First, there must exist negotiations that were making progress. Sporadic or one sided pursuits of settlement would not lead a reasonable plaintiff to think that service of the writ would increase costs in a manner which is unwarranted.  In the words of Rix J in <span class="font-italic">The “Finnrose” </span>[1994] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 559 at 564 (articulated albeit in a different context involving an application to strike out for want of prosecution):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Sporadic attempts at a settlement are no excuse for letting a matter go to sleep. Litigants who mislead themselves into thinking that fruitless negotiations are going somewhere have only themselves to blame if they allow time to pass them by… </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Second, there must also be conduct by a defendant or its representatives which induced or contributed to the plaintiff’s belief that service was unnecessary due to the presence of ongoing settlement negotiations. In circumstances where a defendant’s conduct had a causal link with the plaintiff’s withholding of service, it would arguably be unjust for a defendant to be allowed the benefit of a statutory limitation (see the decision of the Singapore Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Kun Kay Hong v Tan Teo Huat </span>[1983-1984] SLR(R) 762 (“<span class="font-italic">Kun Kay Hong</span>”) at [13]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 I now consider the authorities which lend support to the proposition stated at [37] above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The first authority is Brandon J’s decision in <span class="font-italic">The “Owenbawn”</span>. The decision concerned a Category (3) case which arose out of a collision between the vessels the “Dionisis L” and the “Owenbawn”. The parties commenced proceedings within time, and security was furnished by both sides for the other’s claim. The plaintiff issued its writ on 2 July 1971 and the defendant knew about this. Both parties did not serve their writs because they were engaged in settlement negotiations. In the course of the settlement negotiations (in January 1972), the plaintiff threatened to end the negotiations due to delay on the part of the defendant’s solicitor in obtaining instructions. The defendant’s solicitor responded in February 1972 to state that he had instructions to resume without prejudice discussions. The parties’ solicitors thereafter met on 16 February 1972 wherein a settlement proposal was put forward by the defendant. There was delay by the plaintiff, and on 10 July 1972, the defendant’s solicitor wrote to the plaintiff’s solicitor to ask whether he had instructions on the defendant’s settlement proposal. By that time, the plaintiff’s writ had expired, but the plaintiff’s solicitor was not aware of this because he mistakenly believed that the writ had been issued in August 1971. In the beginning of August 1972, the plaintiff’s solicitor realized that the writ had expired and applied for a renewal of the writ. The Admiralty Registrar acceded to the application, and the renewed writ was served on the defendant on 22 August 1972. The defendant applied to set aside the order renewing the plaintiff’s writ. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43  Brandon J first observed that there were three situations where it would be just to renew a writ, namely (a) an express agreement to defer service, (b) an implied agreement to defer service, and (c) conduct by the defendant “<span class="font-italic">leading the plaintiff to suppose it would be all right to defer service of the writ, with the result that the defendant can be said to have been party to the delay in serving the writ</span>” [emphasis added in italics] (see <span class="font-italic">The “Owenbawn”</span> at 60).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44     Brandon J next considered the communications between the parties, and found that negotiations had continued until August 1972 (at 60–61). On a fair interpretation of the negotiations, Brandon J held that there was an agreement that service of the plaintiff’s writ would be deferred so long as negotiations were continuing (at 61). Even if there was no such agreement, there was at least conduct by the defendant of such character as to lead a reasonable solicitor acting for the plaintiff to believe that service of the writ could be deferred due to the negotiations (at 61–62). On those grounds, Brandon J upheld the Admiralty Registrar’s renewal of the plaintiff’s writ. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The second authority is <span class="font-italic">Kun Kay Hong</span>, a Category (3) case. The case concerned a personal injuries claim arising out of a motor accident. Shortly after the writ was issued and during the course of the settlement negotiations, the defendant’s solicitor wrote to the plaintiff’s solicitor to request that the plaintiff defer service pending the completion of their investigations (at [5]–[8]). The writ expired, and there was a five and half month delay before the plaintiff’s solicitor filed the application to extend the validity of the writ. According to the plaintiff’s solicitor, there was a delay because he was relatively junior at the bar and partly due to indications that the matter would be amicably settled (at [9]). The Court of Appeal upheld the renewal of the writ, holding that there was a good reason for an extension because the defendant’s solicitor had expressly requested (during settlement negotiations) that the plaintiff’s solicitor withhold service pending the completion of investigations (at [13]-[14]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">13 The question is whether in the circumstances of this case there was a sufficient or good reason such that the discretion of the learned assistant registrar to extend the validity of the writ was properly exercised. In considering this question, <span class="font-italic">we have to point out that there is a distinction between mere negotiations on the one hand and the situation in which a defendant or his representative has stated that there is no need to serve the writ pending negotiations for a settlement</span>. The mere fact that negotiations for a settlement were in progress has been held as not amounting to a good reason to extend the validity of a writ: see <span class="font-italic">Easy v Universal Anchorage Co Ltd </span>[1974] 1 WLR 889. On the other hand, it has been held that it was a sufficient reason that the defendant’s insurers have stated that there was no need to serve the writ pending negotiations for a settlement…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">14 After hearing the arguments, we were satisfied that there was a sufficient or good reason. It was a sufficient reason that the solicitors for the underwriters of the defendant had requested the plaintiff’s solicitors to stay their hands and withhold service of the writ. The request remained operative for ten of the 12-month period of the validity of the writ. <span class="font-italic">Even as late as mid-October 1982, the defendant was still asking for the [settlement] amount acceptable to the plaintiff. The defendant’s solicitors had requested withholding of service “pending completion” of their investigations. At no time did they tell the plaintiff that they had completed their investigations</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The third authority is MPH Rubin J’s decision in <span class="font-italic">The “Antares V”</span>, a Category (2) case. The case arose from a cargo damage claim subject to a one year limitation period under the Hague Rules. It is clear from Rubin J’s reasoning that his Honour found good reason for extension because the defendant P&amp;I Club’s conduct led the plaintiff to think that it was unnecessary to serve the writ and to do so would have scuttled the prospects of settlement. The relevant extract of the decision reads as follows (at [24]–[26]):  </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">24 In the case at hand, first of all when the plaintiffs suggested the idea of arbitration, the defendants were not inimical to the proposal. Second, when the plaintiffs suggested negotiated settlement or court process in lieu of arbitration, the defendants again did not raise any objection… From all the correspondence exchanged between the parties, <span class="font-italic">one feature was very clear, that was, that parties were earnestly engaged in negotiations, albeit sporadically</span>, during the material time…. Another <span class="font-italic">inescapable aspect of the case was that the defendants’ P&amp;I Club could not have been blind-sided to the fact that the writ must have been renewed beyond the extension period granted to them. Had it not been for such an assumption and had it not been for the P&amp;I Club’s desire to reach a negotiated settlement, the club would not have provided the letter of undertaking</span>…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">25 … Although it has been said that negotiations between parties alone do not amount to good reason to extend the period of validity of the writ and that the plaintiffs should protect their position by issuing as well as serving the writ on the defendants, <span class="font-italic">I do not think that this is meant to be applied in a rigid and inflexible manner. The fact is that an attempt on the plaintiffs’ part to serve the writ would in all likelihood have ruined the prospects of settlement, or at lea</span><span class="font-italic">st would have been a set-back to the negotiation process</span>… <span class="font-italic">The authorities also indicate that the defendant’s conduct in causing or contributing to the delay may be taken into account by the court in exercising its discretion in such cases</span>…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">26 … I concluded that the plaintiffs have amply <span class="font-italic">satisfied the court with sufficiently good reason for not serving the writ during its initial validity.</span> <span class="font-italic">In my view, the fact of the negotiations between the parties and the way the P&amp;I Club conducted their correspondence most certainly swung the balance of justice in the plaintiffs’ favour</span>… </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 The final authority is the decision of Judith Prakash J (as her Honour then was) in <span class="font-italic">The “Ching Ho”</span>, a Category (2) case. The decision also concerned a cargo damage claim. Prakash J set aside the order extending the validity of the writ as the plaintiff failed to show good reason for extension, but there are significant differences which sets this decision apart from the preceding cases.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) At all material times during the parties’ negotiations, the defendant was not aware of the existence of the writ (at [32]). As it turned out, the undertaking provided by the defendant’s P&amp;I Club only covered some but not all of the plaintiffs named in the writ (at [13]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The writ expired on 24 April 2001. However, by 7 February 2001, it was already clear that the defendant was not disposed to settling the plaintiffs’ claim and that further attempts at negotiations would serve no purpose (at [12] and [33]). Once it became obvious that settlement could not be achieved, the plaintiffs should have served the writ while it was still valid when the defendant’s vessels called at Singapore on two occasions in March and April 2001 (at [18] and [33]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Prakash J had considerable doubt on the plaintiffs’ explanation for non-service, namely, that their representative had misinterpreted the identities of the plaintiffs in favour of whom the letter of undertaking was issued (at [29]–[31], and [35]). Her Honour found that the plaintiffs’ representative was a professional claims adjuster and handler, and should have had no difficulty in properly interpreting the letter of undertaking (at [35]). Further, the defendant could not blamed for refusing to allow its solicitors to accept service of process for the plaintiffs not named in the letter of undertaking (at [34]) </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 In sum, Prakash J found that the delay in serving the writ was not induced or contributed to by the defendant or its representatives (see [34]). The misinterpretation of the letter of undertaking (if it even existed at all) was the plaintiffs’ own doing, and the plaintiffs ought to have served the writ once it became clear on 7 February 2001 that the defendant was not minded to settle the claim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 When the decisions of <span class="font-italic">The “Owenbawn”</span>, <span class="font-italic">Kun Kay Hong</span>, <span class="font-italic">The “Antares V”</span> and <span class="font-italic">The “Ching Ho</span>” are seen in the round, the common thread between them is the culpability of the defendant in the plaintiff’s failure to serve the writ during the period of validity. In cases where the defendant’s conduct during negotiations may be fairly said to be culpable, the courts have had less hesitation in finding for the plaintiff and extending the writ. On the contrary, in cases where the plaintiff is solely to blame for the failure to effect service, the courts have had much less sympathy for the plaintiff <span class="font-italic">(</span>eg, <span class="font-italic">The “Ching Ho”</span>). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-justify font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issues </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Broadly, two main issues arise for consideration. I propose to deal first with the issue of whether there is good reason for extension, before considering the balance of hardship between the parties.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-justify font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Is there “Good Reason” for Extension?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The issue of whether there is good reason for extension should be approached from two time periods - (i) from the issuance of the Writs on 3 January 2017 until the Defendant’s provision of the LOUs on 11 October 2017, and (ii) from 12 October 2017 to the Plaintiffs’ applications to extend the Writs on 29 January 2018. The difference in approach arises from the mode of service available to the Plaintiffs in each time period.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Prior to the provision of the LOUs, the Plaintiffs needed to serve the Writs on the Defendant’s vessels, and the Plaintiffs need to explain why they did not. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) After the LOUs had been issued, the complexion of the case changed. The LOUs allowed the Plaintiffs to call on the Defendant’s P&amp;I Club to procure the appointment of a Singapore law firm to accept service of the Writs. Accordingly, the Plaintiffs need to explain why they did not call on the undertaking to facilitate service of process.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Pre-LOUs (3 January 2017 – 11 October 2017)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Good reason for extension will be shown if there was no reasonable opportunity to serve the Writs. This will be the case if none of the ships proceeded against called at Singapore (see <span class="font-italic">The “Lircay”</span> at [23]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 In this case, the Defendant accepted that there was no opportunity to serve the Writs prior to the issuance of the LOUs as none of the ships proceeded against called at Singapore. Thus, I find that the Plaintiffs have established good reason for the period from 3 January 2017 to 11 October 2017. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Post-LOUs (12 October 2017 – 29 January 2018)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The Plaintiffs’ explanation as to why they did not call on the Defendant P&amp;I Club’s undertaking to facilitate service of process is premised on the existence of settlement negotiations and Mr Chandler’s conduct during these negotiations. I will first consider whether there were in fact settlement negotiations between the parties, and if so, the duration of these negotiations.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left"> (1) Were there Settlement Negotiations?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The parties have put forward competing narratives of the correspondence between Mr Murali and Mr Chandler. On the one hand, the Plaintiffs contended that the correspondence evidenced that there were ongoing settlement negotiations. On the other hand, the Defendant denied the existence of such negotiations and submitted that there were merely discussions on the provision of security. To this end, the Defendant referred repeatedly to the absence of any settlement offer (for liability or quantum) in the correspondence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 In my view, the correspondence must be analysed objectively as a whole and in context to determine whether there were ongoing settlement negotiations. In my judgment, it is clear that the parties were engaged in ongoing negotiations on (a) the provision of security to avoid arrest, and (b) the settlement of the Plaintiffs’ claims. These negotiations started from around 23 February 2017 and carried on until 25 January 2018, when Mr Andrew Lee raised the issue of time bar and asked Mr Murali for copies of the Writs. My reasoning is as follows.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The correspondence between Mr Murali and Mr Chandler started from an invitation to negotiate made by Mr Chandler. In Mr Chandler’s first email of 23 February 2017, he informed Mr Murali that the Defendant was “open” to resolving the Plaintiffs’ claims “swiftly and amicably” (see [12] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 The email exchanges thereafter showed that the parties were agreed on the subject matter of the negotiations, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the provision of security to avoid arrest <span class="font-italic">and</span> the settlement of the Plaintiffs’ claims. When Mr Murali replied on 24 February 2017, he stated that the negotiations had to cover both (a) the provision of security <span class="font-italic">and</span> (b) the settlement of the Plaintiffs’ claims (see [14] above). Mr Chandler explicitly agreed to negotiate on this basis, for on 27 February 2017, he proposed a telephone discussion and sought “<span class="font-italic">starting positions</span>” for “<span class="font-italic">settlement </span><span class="font-italic font-underline">and</span><span class="font-italic"> security</span>” [emphasis added in italics] (see [15] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Mr Murali and Mr Chandler had a telephone discussion on 1 March 2017. Based on the preceding exchange of emails, I am more inclined to believe Mr Murali’s account that the parties discussed the provision of security and the prospects of settlement during this telephone discussion. Mr Chandler claimed that the co-operative or conciliatory language used in phone calls or e-mails with the opposing  party’s solicitor’s was “solely to keep the Member’s strategic options open” and did not mean that he entered into settlement negotiations.

</div><span class="font-italic"> </span>Respectfully, this statement is not borne out by the language of Mr Chandler’s emails on 23 and 27 February 2017. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Mr Murali emailed Mr Chandler on 19 July 2017 to provide (a) an itemised breakdown of the Plaintiffs’ claims, (b) the supporting documents to the Plaintiffs’ claims, and (c) a breakdown of Plaintiffs’ security demand (see [17] above). To my mind, this email sets out the Plaintiffs’ “starting positions” for settlement and security, which Mr Chandler had requested for on 27 February 2017. From the outset, the Plaintiffs took the position that the Collisions were solely caused by the Defendant’s negligence (see [11] above). The Defendant never intimated a cross-claim, and it is little surprise that the Plaintiffs opened with their highest settlement figure (on a 100% liability basis).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 The provision of supporting documents in Mr Murali’s email of 19 July 2017 also supports the conclusion that settlement negotiations were underway, because there was no obligation on the Plaintiffs’ part to disclose the supporting documents for their claim to the Defendant at that stage. Further, after setting out the itemised breakdown to the Plaintiffs’ claim, Mr Murali stated in his email that he would be “happy to discuss the claim” as it “would be in the interest of both parties to avoid costly litigation” (see [17] above). Why else would Mr Murali say all this if parties were not engaged in settlement negotiations? I would add, parenthetically, that the correspondence between Mr Murali and Mr Chandler up to this point was interspersed with emails marked “without prejudice” (see [15] and [17] above).

The reason why parties focused on the issue of security as a matter of first priority was because Mr Murali could not give a confirmation that he would not arrest the Defendant’s vessels while Mr Chandler took his clients’ instructions (see [18] above).

Mr Chandler responded minutes later to essentially ask for time until 19 January 2018 to provide a substantive response on the settlement of the Plaintiffs’ claims, because (a) the Defendant’s appointed expert was “in the process of retrieving his file from storage”, and (b) Mr Chandler was going on vacation (see [23] to [25] above).

If that was truly Mr Chandler’s intention, he would have said so explicitly.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 I find that the settlement negotiations in all likelihood came to an end on 25 January 2018. Prior to 25 January 2018, Mr Murali was awaiting the Defendant’s settlement position. Mr Murali sent an email reminder setting a new deadline of 24 January 2018 when Mr Chandler failed to respond by the agreed deadline of 19 January 2018 (see [27] above). However, when Mr Andrew Lee wrote to Mr Murali on 25 January 2018 to raise the issue of limitation and to ask for copies of the Writs (see [27] above), the Plaintiffs probably knew then that the settlement negotiations had come to an end. I suspect that the Plaintiffs also probably found out after Mr Lee’s email that the Writs ceased to be valid on 2 January 2018, and filed applications shortly thereafter (on 29 January 2018) to retrospectively extend the validity of the Writs. There is no evidence of settlement negotiations beyond 25 January 2018. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left"> (2) Settlement Negotiations - Good Reason for Extension?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Having found that there were in fact settlement negotiations between the parties, I next consider whether these negotiations amounted to good reason for an extension to be granted. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 At the outset, I do not accept the Plaintiffs’ submission that the LOUs and the surrounding correspondence evidenced an implied agreement to defer service of the Writs while settlement discussions were ongoing.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Defendant’s Solicitor’s Letter to Registry dated 19 June 2018 at para 12.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> Looking at the whole course of negotiations objectively, it is clear to me that the parties were never <span class="font-italic">ad idem </span>on the issue of deferring service of the Writs (during the pendency of settlement negotiations or otherwise). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 That being said, I do think that Mr Chandler’s conduct led the Plaintiffs to think that it was unnecessary to serve the Writs and that to do so would increase the costs in a manner which was unwarranted in the circumstances. Mr Chandler knew of the issuance of the Writs on 3 January 2017. At the material time, the parties were earnestly engaged in settlement negotiations. The negotiations progressed positively and culminated in the issuance of the LOUs, which obviated the need to arrest the Defendant’s vessels. When the negotiations moved to the substantive subject of the settlement of the Plaintiffs’ claims after 11 October 2017, Mr Chandler did not provide any indication that the Defendant was not interested in such negotiations. While Mr Chandler did not respond to Mr Murali’s email reminders on 12 October 2017, 9 November 2017, and 6 December 2017, there was no suggestion that this was an indication of the Defendant’s abandonment of the settlement negotiations. Indeed, when Mr Chandler finally responded on 21 December 2017 (very swiftly, I might add) in the face of Mr Murali’s threat to end the negotiations, he asked for time until 19 January 2018 to provide the Defendant’s settlement position. Mr Chandler’s reasons for needing more time: (a) that the Defendant’s appointed expert was retrieving his file from storage and (b) he was going on vacation were innocuous, and it appears that the Plaintiffs did not think twice about providing the requested extension. Under these circumstances, the Defendant’s conduct during negotiations may be fairly said to be culpable in the Plaintiffs’ failure to serve the Writs during their validity. Further, bearing in mind the history of the negotiations between the parties, I find that it was reasonable for the Plaintiffs to have taken the view that service of the Writs could be deferred while they awaited the Defendant’s settlement position and that service of the Writs was not only unnecessary but that it could potentially derail the settlement negotiations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 When the Plaintiffs finally realised on 25 January 2018 that settlement negotiations were off and that their Writs had expired, they took immediate steps to extend the validity of the Writs. In light of the foregoing, I find that the Plaintiffs have established good reason for extension for the period after the LOUs were issued. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Before leaving this issue, I will briefly address the Plaintiffs’ suggestion that the Defendant’s act of asking for time until 19 January 2018, before then raising the issue of limitation when the Plaintiffs were expecting the Defendant’s settlement position, was redolent of sharp practice.

</div>
</div>
</div> I find that there is insufficient material before me to make such a determination, and I need not make any definitive ruling on this point, given my finding that the Defendant had – by its conduct – led the Plaintiffs to think that it was unnecessary to serve the Writs.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Satisfactory Explanation</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Since this is a Category (3) case, the Plaintiffs must, in addition to showing good reason, also provide a satisfactory explanation for their failure to apply for an extension before the Writs expired. In other words, the Plaintiffs must give a satisfactory explanation to account for the delay between the expiry of the Writs and the filing of their applications to renew the Writs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 In this case, the Plaintiffs applied to extend the validity of the Writs on 29 January 2018 ie, 27 days after the Writs’ expiry on 2 January 2018. The reason why the Plaintiffs only applied to renew the Writs on 29 January 2018 was because their solicitors only realised that the Writs had expired on 25 January 2018. While the Plaintiffs candidly admitted that this was attributable, in part, to an administrative oversight on the part of their solicitors, one has to go further to consider why the oversight was not discovered earlier. The question to be asked is this: why did it take the Plaintiffs this long to consider the issue of the validity of the writs, thereby allowing them to lapse? </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 In my view, the answer is that the Plaintiffs’ solicitors did not give the matter the close attention they might otherwise have given it because of (a) the history of (at least partially successful) negotiations between the parties and (b) Mr Chandler’s specific act of asking for time until 19 January 2018 to provide the Defendant’s settlement position. This led the Plaintiffs’ solicitors to believe that service could be deferred and caused them to put work on the file on hold while they awaited the Defendant’s settlement position. As a result, the Plaintiffs’ solicitors did not discover the oversight until 25 January 2018. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Under these circumstances, I find that the Plaintiffs have provided a satisfactory explanation to account for the delay. While the Plaintiffs are not entirely blameless, it can be said that the Defendant played a causative role in the Plaintiffs’ tardiness. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Further, the length of delay in this case is also minimal or short relative to the delay in <span class="font-italic">Kun Kay Hong</span>, where an extension was granted. There, the Court of Appeal did not find the delay of five and a half months fatal, as the delay had been induced or contributed to by the defendant’s conduct. At [15], the Court of Appeal held as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In the course of arguments, we were somewhat anxious over the delay in the filing of the application which was made some five months and 16 days after the expiry of the validity of the writ. In most cases, this delay would have been fatal. We cannot over-emphasize that it is the duty of a plaintiff who issues a writ to serve it promptly. We examined the reasons given by [the plaintiff’s solicitor] for the delay. <span class="font-italic">On the particular facts before us, we came to the conclusion that the delay was not fatal. We were satisfied in all the circumstances that the delay has been induced, or contributed to, by the words and conduct of the solicitors for the defendant</span>. [emphasis added in italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Before leaving this section, I hasten to add that I am in no way excusing the Plaintiffs’ solicitors for their oversight. In finding that the Plaintiffs have given a satisfactory explanation, I am merely recognising that the conduct of the Defendant’s representatives played a causative role in the Plaintiffs’ failure to apply for renewal before the Writs expired.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-justify font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Balance of Hardship</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 Having found that the Plaintiffs have shown good reason for an extension to be granted and that they have provided a satisfactory explanation for their failure to apply for an extension before the Writs expired, I now consider the balance of hardship. I recognise that the Defendant would be deprived of the substantive defence of limitation if the Writs are renewed.

</div>
</div> However, after considering all the circumstances of the case, I still consider it appropriate for the Writs to be renewed for the following reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 First, the Plaintiffs will be left with no remedy against the Defendant if the Writs are not renewed.
                   <sup><button class="btn btn-link superscript-btn" data-target="#fn-2c584ded-d0b6-4b49-8dc4-3e7e190e0efd" data-toggle="modal" type="button">55</button></sup>

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Ng’s 1st Affidavit at para 18.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> While the Plaintiffs must take some blame for the state of affairs, I do not consider the degree of fault substantial enough to deprive them of their cause of action against the Defendant. Having found that the Defendant’s conduct played a part in the Plaintiffs’ failure to serve during the Writs’ validity, it would be unjust and unfair if the Defendant could rely on a limitation defence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 Second, the Plaintiffs pursued their claims with reasonable diligence. The Plaintiffs commenced proceedings within time, and this is their first application for an extension of the validity of the Writs. During the original validity of the Writs, the Plaintiffs obtained security for their claims, and repeatedly chased the Defendant for their settlement position. To grant an extension in this case does not offend against the policy underlying statutes of limitation, which is to ensure that claims are pursued with reasonable diligence (see <span class="font-italic">The “Pearl of Jebel Ali</span>” [2009] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 484 at [50]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 Finally, the Plaintiffs took out the applications to renew the Writs promptly. Once the Plaintiffs became alive to the issue of time bar on 25 January 2018, they applied for an extension to the validity of the Writs four days later. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-justify font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Length of Extension</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 The Plaintiffs prayed for and obtained a twelve-month extension to the validity of the Writs under the Extension Orders. I now consider whether this length of extension is appropriate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 To begin with, the fact that admiralty writs are valid for 12 months in the first instance does not <span class="font-italic">ipso facto </span>mean that the writ ought to be renewed for a further 12 months. It is clear from the regime established under O 6 r 4(2) and O 6 r 4(2A) that a twelve-month extension is the exception rather than the norm. The applicant who seeks to rely on O 6 r 4(2A) must show that his case is out of the ordinary; and that even if reasonable steps to serve the writ are taken, it may not be possible to serve the writ within a six-month period (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Court Practice 2017 </span>(Jeffrey Pinsler gen ed) (LexisNexis, 2017) at para 6/4/4). In the admiralty context, absent any agreement between the parties on service, it may not be possible to serve the writ within a six-month period if none of the ships proceeded against called at Singapore in the preceding 12 months during the writ’s validity. Another conceivable situation is where the parties agree to defer service indefinitely subject to written notice for settlement negotiations, and the negotiations are expected to be long drawn. Ultimately, it is not possible to be prescriptive on when a twelve-month extension under O 6 r 4(2A) should be ordered; and much will depend on the circumstances of each case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 On the facts of this case, I do not think that the twelve-month extension was warranted. The settlement negotiations came to an end on 25 January 2018, and it would have been incumbent on the Plaintiffs to immediately take steps thereafter to serve the Writs. The undertaking in the LOUs allowed the Plaintiffs to call on the Defendant’s P&amp;I Club to appoint a Singapore law firm to accept service of process, and the Plaintiffs would not need a further 12 months to serve the Writs. Thus, I find that the validity of the Writs ought to have been extended for six months under O 6 r 4(2) of the Rules. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 Therefore, pursuant to the court’s power to vary <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> orders after the <span class="font-italic">inter partes </span>hearing under O 32 r 6 of the Rules (see <span class="font-italic">WEA Records Ltd v Visions Channel 4 Ltd </span>[1983] 1 WLR 721 at 727B-E), I will vary the Extension Orders to provide that the validity of the Writs be extended for a period of six months from 3 January 2018 up to and including 2 July 2018. Further, although the costs of the extension applications was ordered to be in the cause, I think the appropriate order to be made here is for there to be no order as to costs, given my finding that the Plaintiffs are not blameless. Accordingly, I so order.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 Before concluding, I should highlight that the Writs have been deemed served within the six-month extension ordered. On 15 May 2018, the Defendant entered appearance <span class="font-italic">gratis</span> (pursuant to O 70 r 7(2) read with O 10 r 1(3) of the Rules) and applied to set aside the Extension Orders. Since the Defendant has failed to set aside the Extension Orders, the Writs were valid when they were deemed to have been duly served on the Defendant on 15 May 2018 pursuant to O 10 r 1(3) of the Rules (see also <span class="font-italic">The “Ursus” </span>[2015] SGHCR 7 at [14]).   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 Matters of limitation are never a trifling matter, and this case underscores the importance of closely monitoring the expiry dates of writs even where good faith negotiations are afoot. While I have found it appropriate to extend the validity of the Writs, a writ should not be renewed as a matter of course. Parties are well advised to take all reasonable steps to effect service at all times, lest they be overtaken by a period of limitation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 For the foregoing reasons, the Defendant’s applications to set aside the Extension Orders are dismissed. The Extension Orders are varied in the terms outlined at [86] above. The Registry is to fix a pre-trial conference for directions on the filing of the preliminary acts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 I will hear parties on costs. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Navin Anand<br/>Assistant Registrar  </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">K Muralitherapany and Ng Lip Kai (Joseph Tan Jude Benny LLP) for the Plaintiffs;<br/>Ramachandran Doraisamy Raghunath and Rafizah Gaffoor (Peter Doraisamy LLC) for the Defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
