<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       Mr Radius Christanto
                    (“Mr Christanto”) is in remand at Changi
                    Prison pursuant to a warrant for apprehension made on 3 May
                    2012, upon a request made by the Australian authorities on
                    27 April 2012 under the Extradition Act (Cap 103, 2000 Rev
                    Ed) (“Extradition Act 2000”). Mr
                    Christanto’s application for bail before the learned
                    District Judge (“DJ”) was denied on 4 May
                    2012. He therefore filed this criminal motion petitioning
                    the High Court under s 97 of the Criminal Procedure Code
                    2010 (Act 15 of 2010) (“CPC 2010”) for bail
                    pending the hearing for committal under s 28(7) of the
                    Extradition Act 2000. On his application on 17 May
                    2012, I directed that Mr Christanto be transferred to
                    Changi Hospital as an interim measure pending determination
                    of the present criminal motion. Mr Christanto is wanted by
                    the Commonwealth of Australia to stand trial for two charges
                    pertaining to an alleged conspiracy to bribe a foreign
                    public official under ss 11.5(1) read with 70.2(1) of the
                    Australian Criminal Code Act 1995 (No 12 of 1995)
                    (“Australian Criminal Code”). The charges are
                    as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">First charge</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Between 17 December 1999 and on or about 6 June 2000
                        at Melbourne and diverse other places, Securency
                        International Pty Ltd together with Radius Christanto,
                        Myles Curtis, Mitchell Anderson, Hugh Brown and diverse
                        others conspired to provide a benefit to another person,
                        such benefit being not legitimately due to the other
                        person, with the intention of influencing a foreign
                        public official in the exercise of the official’s
                        duties as a foreign public official in order to obtain
                        or retain business.</p>

                        Limited together with Radius Christanto, Myles Curtis,
                        Mitchell Anderson, John Leckenby, Peter Hutchinson and
                        diverse others conspired to provide a benefit to another
                        person, such benefit being not legitimately due to the
                        other person, with the intention of influencing a
                        foreign public official in the exercise of the
                        official’s duties as a foreign public official in

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Mr Christanto was first
                    contacted by the Corruption Prevention Investigation Bureau
                    (“CPIB”) on 16 March 2012 after which he
                    was required to attend three times at the CPIB (<em>ie</em> 16 March 2012, 19 March
                    2012 and 4 May 2012) which he did. He was initially
                    required to post bail of $10,000 on 16 March 2012 and
                    on the second occasion on 19 March 2012, was required
                    to provide two sureties and the bail amount was increased to
                    $200,000 ($100,000 per surety). Mr Christanto complied
                    with his bail conditions until he was arrested and the
                    warrant for apprehension was issued. The Prosecution oppose
                    Mr Christanto’s criminal motion before the High
                    Court on the following grounds:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_a"></a>(a)     Bail is not
                        available under s 95(1)(c) of CPC 2010 for fugitives who
                        have been arrested under a warrant of apprehension
                        issued under s 24(1) of the Extradition Act 2000;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_b"></a>(b)     Parliament has unequivocally spoken
                        through s 95(1)(c) of CPC 2010 to deny bail to
                        fugitives as the alternative may amount to a breach of
                        Singapore’s obligations and may give a fugitive a
                        further opportunity to flee from the reach of the
                        requesting country.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The following
                    questions thus arise in this application:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_c"></a>(c)     Whether the
                        Magistrate/DJ had the power to grant bail to fugitives
                        facing extradition proceedings under either the
                        Extradition Act 2000 or CPC 2010;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_d"></a>(d)     If not, whether the
                        High Court had the power to grant bail to fugitives
                        facing extradition proceedings either under s 97 of CPC
                        2010 or in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction, if
                        any; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_e"></a>(e)     In the event that the High Court has
                        the power to grant bail in extradition proceedings, what
                        considerations are operative and what bail conditions
                        should be imposed on the fugitive.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       I turn now to the first
                    question of the Magistrate’s power to grant bail in
                    extradition proceedings. In order to understand the
                    provisions governing the grant of bail in extradition
                    proceedings, it is important to refer to the key Acts and
                    their respective predecessors. The first is the Extradition
                    Act 1870 (33 &amp; 34 Vict c 52) (UK). It was later
                    consolidated as the Extradition Acts, 1870 to 1935,
                    henceforth termed “Extradition Act 1870” for
                    convenience, which was passed in England as a comprehensive
                    Act on extradition proceedings. Before the Extradition Act
                    1870 came into force, the law (apart from the common law) on
                    extradition in England was in three treaties with France, US
                    and Denmark. The three separate Acts which gave effect to
                    the three treaties were repealed (see Sir Francis Piggott in
                        <em>Extradition: A Treatise on the Law
                        relating to Fugitive Offenders</em> (Kelly &amp;
                    Walsh Limited, 1910) (“Piggott”) at
                    pp 29–30). Orders in Council were put in place to
                    give effect to England’s extradition treaties, and the
                    Orders in Council extended the application of the
                    Extradition Act 1870 to the British colonies under s 17
                    of Extradition Act 1870 (Piggott at pp 37 and 177).
                    Shortly thereafter, the Fugitive Offenders Act 1881 (44
                    &amp; 45 Vict c 69) (UK) (“Fugitive Offenders Act
                    1881”) was enacted. Piggott explains the difference
                    between the two Acts at p 189:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The object of the [Fugitive Offenders Act 1881] ... is
                        to apply the principles of extradition to the [British
                        Empire]. It differs from the Extradition Act [1870] in
                        this important particular, that it applies to a much
                        larger area of crime – to all offences punishable
                        “either on indictment or information, by
                        imprisonment with hard labour for a term of 12 months or
                        more, or by any granter punishment.” It applies
                        to all persons, subjects and aliens, who have committed
                        offences in one part of the Empire and escaped to
                        another part [of the Empire]. But its limitations are
                        obvious; directly the fugitive has got beyond the
                        dominions, it is powerless, and both subject and alien
                        come under the Extradition Act [1870] with its
                        limitations. This may be illustrated by the following
                        example – If a Frenchman from Reunion were to
                        commit an offence ... in Mauritius, and escape to
                        Australia, he could be sent back to Mauritius under the
                        Fugitive Offenders Act; but if he had escaped to New
                        Caledonia he could only be dealt with under the
                        Extradition Act ... and he is not liable to surrender if
                        his offence is not within the treaty with France.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Fugitive Offenders Act 1881 was intended for
                    the extradition of fugitives who had committed offences in
                    and then had escaped to different parts of the British
                    empire whereas the Extradition Act 1870’s jurisdiction
                    and operation depended, in all cases, on treaties with
                    foreign countries. In so far as bail was concerned, under s
                    5 of the Fugitive Offenders Act 1881, the Magistrate was
                    expressly given powers to order bail for fugitives before
                    him/her:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A fugitive when apprehended shall be brought before a
                        Magistrate, who (subject to the provisions of this Act)
                        shall hear the case in the same manner and have the same
                        jurisdiction and powers, as near as may be (including
                        the power to remand and admit to bail), as if the
                        fugitive were charged with an offence committed within
                        his jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Section 9 of the Extradition Act 1870 also had a
                    similar provision relating to the powers of the Magistrate,
                    but the question as to whether this provision expressly
                    conferred on the Magistrate powers to grant bail, was a
                    problematic one. Section 9 of the Extradition Act 1870
                    stated as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Hearing of case and evidence of political character of
                        crime –</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">When a fugitive criminal is brought before the police
                        magistrate, the police magistrate shall hear the case in
                        the same manner, and have the same jurisdiction and
                        powers, as near as may be, as if the prisoner were
                        brought before him charged with an indictable offence
                        committed in England.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">A question may arise as to why s 5 of the
                    Fugitive Offenders Act 1881 expressly provided for the
                    Magistrate’s power to grant bail while no express
                    mention of the same appeared in the Extradition Act 1870.
                    Piggott (at p 94) discusses this apparent omission,
                    concluding that the silence of the Extradition Act 1870, if
                    it were to be given any significance at all, is inconclusive
                    on the question of the existence of the Magistrate’s
                    power to grant bail. He states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The powers given to the magistrate under [s 9 of the
                        Extradition Act 1870] include the power to remand from
                        time to time... But whether they also include the right
                        to admit the prisoner to bail is a difficult question
                        not yet authoritatively decided. A difference in the
                        drafting of the corresponding section of Fugitive
                        Offenders Act, 1881, s. 5, may be at once noticed.
                        There the same language is used; but after the words
                        “as near as may be,” the following
                        parenthesis is added – “(including the
                        power to remand and admit to bail).” No reliable
                        argument can be made on this difference between the two
                        Acts; for while it may be said, on the one hand, that
                        the express reference to bail in the Act of 1881 shows
                        that it was deliberately excluded from the Act of 1870,
                        it may also be argued that it was put into the later Act
                        in order to prevent the same point arising as had arisen
                        under the earlier Act, and therefore does not clear up
                        the doubt under that Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">I am in full agreement with this
                view.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Upon independence, our own
                    legislative history began with the Extradition Bill (Bill 16
                    of 1968) which was passed as the Extradition Act 1968
                    (Act 14 of 1968) (“Extradition Act 1968”). In
                    the explanatory statement to the Extradition Act 1968, the
                    following was said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Bill provides for the repeal of the United Kingdom
                        Extradition Acts, 1870 to 1935, and the Fugitive
                        Offenders Act, 1881, in so far as they apply to and
                        operate as part of the law of Singapore ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Our Extradition Act 1968 patterned legislation
                    enacted and in force in Australia (then), namely the
                    Extradition (Commonwealth Countries) Act 1966 (No 75 of
                    1966) (Cth) and the Extradition (Foreign States) Act 1996
                    (No 76 of 1966) (Cth) (collectively, “the 1966
                    Acts” (see: Explanatory Statement to the Extradition
                    Bill, Bill 16 of 1968)) which essentially consolidated the
                    relevant provisions of the Extradition Act 1870 and Fugitive
                    Offenders Act 1881, retaining the distinction between
                    extradition to and from foreign states and within the
                    Commonwealth of Nations. Singapore’s legislative
                    provisions with respect to the grant or management of bail
                    whether under the Extradition Act 2000 currently in
                    force or in the 1968 version of the Act have remained
                    largely unchanged. After the repeal of s 9 of the
                    Extradition Act 1870 and s 5 of the Fugitive Offenders Act
                    1881, no provision of similar power or scope relating to the
                    Magistrate’s power to grant bail in extradition
                    proceedings has been incorporated in any statutory
                    provision. As Piggott argues, the Extradition Act
                    2000’s silence cannot be taken to be conclusive of
                    Parliament’s intention to oust all courts of their
                    jurisdiction to grant bail in extradition proceedings.
                    Taking such a position would create confusion in respect of
                    some of the provisions such as ss 11(2) or 25(2) of the
                    Extradition Act 2000. These provisions have clear references
                    to bail being granted when they provide, for example, that a
                    Magistrate may remand “a person brought before him
                    under this section, either in custody or on bail”.
                    The following sections evidence further instances of such
                    references to fugitives facing extradition proceedings while
                    being on bail: s 10(5)(b) and s 11(6)(b) in
                    relation to Foreign States; s 21(2), s 24(5)(b),
                    s 25(2) and s 25(6)(b) in relation to Commonwealth
                    States; and s 35(2), s 35(5)(b) and
                    s 37(1)(b) in relation to Malaysia. The sheer number of
                    sections in the Extradition Act 2000 which clearly assume
                    that the individual facing extradition may be on bail, begs
                    the question of how, under what provision and by whom the
                    fugitive might have been granted bail to begin with. If
                    Parliament’s failure to include an equivalent of
                    s 5 or s 9 of the Fugitive Offenders Act 1881 or
                    Extradition Act 1870 respectively was to be taken as
                    conclusive evidence that fugitives shall not be granted
                    bail, what then is the court to make of the provisions in
                    the Extradition Act 2000 which conceive of such individuals
                    being on bail? The absence of an express provision
                    conferring such a power to grant bail on the Magistrate
                    cannot logically be the end of this enquiry. The only
                    reasonable conclusion must be that the availability of bail
                    is assumed by Parliament. The silence of the Extradition Act
                    2000 should be addressed by applying the general bail
                    provisions contained in the CPC 2010 or the Criminal
                    Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) (“the
                    old CPC”) (particularly, ss 351 and 352),
                    depending on the time when extradition proceedings were
                    commenced. While the old CPC provisions make no specific
                    mention of extradition proceedings, s 95(1)(c) of CPC
                    2010 specifically states that bail shall not be granted in
                    extradition proceedings. Thus it appears that reading the
                    Extradition Act 2000 with s 95(1)(c) of CPC 2010, the
                    Magistrate does not possess the power to grant bail in
                    extradition proceedings. However, even though the Magistrate
                    is not empowered to grant bail in extradition proceedings,
                    the High Court is vested with this power either under
                    s 97 of CPC 2010 or by invoking its inherent
                    jurisdiction in pursuance of the same.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       A question posed by the
                    present application is whether the High Court may grant bail
                    in extradition cases under either s 95 or s 97 of
                    CPC 2010. There is some uncertainty concerning the nature of
                    the power that allows a higher court to
                    “alter” bail orders of the Magistrate,
                    especially in cases, similar to the present, where the
                    Magistrate refuses bail. Even in jurisdictions such as the
                    US, Australia and Malaysia which have recognised that there
                    is some recourse to a higher court against a
                    Magistrate’s refusal to grant bail, there are
                    divergent views as to whether these applications are brought
                    by way of review or appeal. Tan Yock Lin and S Chandra Mohan
                    in <em>Criminal Procedure in Singapore and
                        Malaysia</em> (LexisNexis, Looseleaf Ed, 2012)
                    (“Tan and Mohan”) note in relation to the
                    Singapore position (at paras 1404 – 1450 and
                    1452) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...[T]he nature of bail is such that a bail decision
                        can in no way be envisaged as a final disposition. Being
                        interlocutory in nature, if appeals were possible, the
                        main trial would become involved in questions which are
                        entirely preliminary in nature. And therefore, even the
                        trial court may consider a fresh application at any
                        time, though an earlier bail application has been
                        refused. If an application for bail may be renewed
                        before the trial court, <em>a
                            fortiori</em> a fresh application may be made
                        to the High Court by way of review. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[...]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In Singapore, there is no appeal from a refusal of
                        bail. Firstly, the [Criminal Procedure] Code has no
                        provision expressly conferring a right of appeal.
                        Secondly, a bail decision is merely interlocutory and
                        does not finally dispose of the rights of the accused.
                        Thirdly, it is not a judgment or order of any
                        finality.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       I agree with the view thus
                    expressed. This is different from the position in Malaysia
                    where “an appeal [to a higher court] from a bail
                    order or refusal of bail of an inferior court” is
                    available under s 394 of the Criminal Procedure Code
                    (Act 593, 1999 Rev Ed) (“Malaysian CPC”) (Tan
                    and Mohan at paras 1454–1500). Thus, as the
                    DJ’s decision to refuse the grant of bail is not
                    appealable, the High Court’s power to consider Mr
                    Christanto’s criminal motion under s 97 of CPC 2010
                    operates as a statutory power of review. The alternative
                    justification is that this power arises from the inherent
                    jurisdiction and power of the High Court to grant bail in
                    extradition proceedings, and this justification has been
                    relied upon by courts in other jurisdictions (see below at
                        <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a> to <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a>).</p>

<p>How s 95(1)’s restrictions relate to the High
                    Court’s powers in s 97 of CPC 2010, was
                    discussed in this Court’s decision in<b><em></em></b><em>Mohamed Hisham bin Sapandi v
                        Public Prosecutor</em> [2011] 4 SLR 868
                        (“<em>Hisham</em>”).
                    It was there held that the High Court’s discretion in
                    s 97 is unfettered by s 95(1) CPC 2010 which
                    solely applies to the Subordinate Courts. The Prosecution
                    has sought to limit <em>Hisham</em>’s reasoning to the first limb of
                    s 95(1)(a). Although the court in <em>Hisham</em> was dealing with s 95(1)(a)
                    (which relates to bail for “offences punishable with
                    imprisonment for a term of 20 years or more”), the
                    reasoning behind reading s 97 as the governing
                    provision, unfettered by s 95(1) of CPC 2010
                    applies to every limb under s 95(1), including
                    s 95(1)(c) pertaining to the grant of bail extradition
                    proceedings. In fact, <em>Hisham</em>
                    stands for the wider proposition that to interpret s 97
                    as subject to any of s 95(1)’s restrictions would be
                    incorrect as it would be contrary to Parliament’s
                    intention and would render the High Court’s
                    jurisdiction under s 97 of CPC 2010
                    nugatory.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       It must also be noted that
                    if s 95(1)(a)-(c) of CPC 2010 is read to limit s 97 of
                    CPC 2010, in the context of extradition proceedings, once a
                    warrant of apprehension is issued, prior to a full committal
                    hearing, “bail would be totally prohibited”
                    and the “discretion of any court totally
                    ousted” (see <em>Hisham</em> at
                        <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a>). This Court
                    found that such a reading was unreasonable, notwithstanding
                    the specific limb of s 95(1) in issue, as “such
                    a drastic change in the law will require clear and express
                    Parliamentary language”. It should also be
                    highlighted that on 18 January 2012, in response to a
                    question posed by MP Sylvia Lim, the Minister for Law,
                    Mr Shanmugam (“the Minister”), confirmed
                    that if a case relating to the High Court’s
                    jurisdiction to grant bail arose again, that Parliament
                    would amend the law to be in line with <em>Hisham</em>. The Minister did not qualify his
                    statement in relation to bail for extradition proceedings.
                    While it was argued by the Prosecution that the
                    Minister’s statement was to be limited to
                    s 95(1)(a) of CPC 2010, the language chosen by the
                    Minister in the relevant Parliamentary debates were
                    explicitly different. The Minister in fact clearly discussed
                    s 95(1) rather than s 95(1)(a) of CPC 2010
                    (see <em>Singapore Parliamentary
                        Debates</em>, <em>Official
                        Report</em> (18 January 2012)
                    vol 88 at col 64). He said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As regards the two points made by the hon. Member, Ms
                        Sylvia Lim, I think the question on bail and sections
                        95, 97, is a valid one. It was considered recently last
                        year in Hisham’s case. The High Court held that
                        its power to grant or vary bail under section 97(1),
                        would be redundant if it were qualified by other
                        provisions, specifically section 95(1). And I think the
                        statement is very clear, it was directly on point in
                        contrast to the earlier case which I think was decided
                        in 2005. And our view is that the statutory language is
                        clear, the judgement is clear, and the latest decision
                        sets out the law. Nevertheless, I thank the Member for
                        raising it, allowing me to clarify that the discretion
                        is unfettered, and if the issue arises again, we will
                        certainly amend, to put that beyond doubt.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">While the Minister’s statement admittedly
                    arose in the context of the Second Reading of the Statutes
                    (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill (Bill 22 of 2011) which
                    proposed amendments to s 95(1)(a) of CPC 2010 only, his
                    views clearly constituted unequivocal Parliamentary approval
                    of <em>Hisham</em>’s
                    interpretation of its intention behind drafting s 97 in
                    addition to or as overriding s 95(1) of CPC 2010. While
                    it is clear that s 97 is not fettered by s 95(1) of CPC
                    2010, how does one explain why s 97, relating to bail for
                    “accused” persons does not have a provision
                    similar to s 95(3) which specifically includes
                    “fugitives” within the definition of
                    “accused” for s 95’s purposes? First,
                    the simple answer is that s 97 of CPC 2010 is a general
                    governing provision intended to grant the High Court
                    discretionary jurisdiction to grant bail where an individual
                    is arrested, particularly in the light of the Extradition
                    Act 2000’s silence on the matter. Accordingly,
                    “any accused” under s 97 must reasonably and
                    necessarily be interpreted to include
                    “fugitives”. Applying the reasoning in
                        <em>Hisham</em>, absent clear
                    Parliamentary language as seen in s 95(1)(c) removing
                    “fugitives” from the scope of the High
                    Court’s jurisdiction, the High Court’s power is
                    “unfettered”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Second, under the procedure
                    in ss 9-10 or 23-24 of the Extradition Act 2000, once a
                    notice is issued by the Minister for the surrender of the
                    fugitive, a warrant of apprehension can be issued by the
                    Magistrate. Under ss 11(1) or 25(1) of the Extradition Act
                    2000, after having been apprehended, the individual shall be
                    brought “as soon as practicable before a
                    Magistrate” for his committal hearing whereupon the
                    requesting state, through the Public Prosecutor, must
                    establish their case to warrant the committal of the
                    fugitive. To interpret s 97 as excluding
                    “fugitives” would result in the drastic
                    consequence of individuals apprehended under the Extradition
                    Act 2000 being denied the opportunity to apply for bail to
                    any court until their committal hearing which does not, by
                    statute, have to be convened by any specific number of days
                    from apprehension. This interpretation would be a serious
                    denial of the established principle of “innocent
                    until proven guilty”. When a person has been charged
                    for a crime but not yet convicted, bail is one of the
                    strongest and sincerest tribute to the presumption of
                    innocence. It is true that persons on bail may jump bail.
                    When such a person does so it is usually because he knows
                    that he is guilty or he does not trust the justice system.
                    Adherence to the presumption of innocence therefore
                    encourages the innocent to have confidence in the justice
                    system, and maintain his/her liberty and right to be heard
                    which the statutory provisions reviewed above seek to
                    preserve.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Third the Australian
                    authorities also lend weight to reading
                    “fugitives” as a sub-set of accused persons as
                    the position has been taken, and rightly so, that
                    extradition proceedings are simply a form of criminal
                    proceedings. This approach must be correct as the CPC 2010
                    is agreed by both parties in this criminal motion to be the
                    statute exhaustively governing all procedural matters in
                    relation to the Extradition Act 2000. In the Federal Court
                    of Perth’s decision of <em>Hempel and
                        another v Moore</em> (1987) 70 ALR 714, the
                    applicant sought an order of review under the Administrative
                    Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (No 59 of 1977)
                    (Cth), against the Magistrate’s refusal of bail after
                    committing him to await surrender to the requesting
                    jurisdiction. One of the issues before the Federal Court of
                    Perth was that O 53 r 35 of the Federal Court Rules in
                    Australia (providing for bail pending appeals in criminal
                    proceedings) was based on s 59(2) of the Federal Court of
                    Australia Act 1976 (No 156 of 1976) which only allowed the
                    court to make rules for “convicted persons”.
                    It was argued that “convicted persons” did not
                    include persons subject to extradition proceedings. The
                    Federal Court rejected this argument, relying on the English
                    cases of <em>Amand v Home
                        Secretary</em> [1943] AC 147 at 156 and <em>Zacharia v Republic of Cyprus</em> [1963]
                    AC 634 at 657 for the proposition that extradition
                    proceedings can be characterised as criminal proceedings,
                    and no distinction should be drawn between
                    “convicted” and “unconvicted”
                    persons. The court was willing to overlook the specific
                    technical significance of the term
                    “conviction” when dealing with an individual
                    facing committal in the course of extradition proceedings.
                    Applying the same reasoning, the term
                    “fugitive” should be read as a subset of
                    “any accused” under s 97 of CPC 2010 on the
                    basis that extradition proceedings are simply a form of
                    criminal proceedings to which all provision the CPC 2010,
                    where consistent with the Extradition Act 2000, must
                    necessarily apply.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Fourth, the relevant
                    statutory provisions relating to bail in extradition
                    proceedings support the interpretation of s 97 of CPC 2010
                    to include fugitives. First, s 418 of CPC 2010 expressly
                    confers the power on the High Court to grant bail in cases
                    where an order for review of detention is sought. This would
                    be after the fugitive has been committed before a Magistrate
                    and has made an application for review of his detention
                    under s 417 of CPC 2010. For completeness ss 417 and 418 of
                    CPC 2010 state as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Application for order for review of

<p class="Judg-1">If s 97 CPC 2010 is interpreted as excluding
                    “fugitives”, it would lead to the curious
                    result that the High Court would have the power to grant
                    bail to a person subject to a warrant of committal pending
                    review of his detention but not to an individual who was
                    merely apprehended pending his committal hearing. That
                    person would be left without any opportunity to apply to
                    bail either before the Subordinate Court or High Court. In
                    addition to ss 417 and 418 of CPC 2010, as noted above, to
                    interpret s 97 as excluding “fugitives” would
                    result in a number of provisions of the Extradition Act 2000
                    (above at <a href="#p1_4">[4]</a>) which
                    conceive of fugitives on bail, incomprehensible.
                    Accordingly, a reading of the relevant provisions that
                    avoids absurd consequences requires the inclusion of
                    “fugitives” within the scope of the High
                    Court’s jurisdiction under s 97 of CPC 2010. As a
                    matter of comparative jurisdictional analysis, the
                    interpretation of s 97 of CPC 2010 that confers on the High
                    Court the power to grant bail in extradition proceedings is
                    a position in the company of one of two approaches taken by
                    Commonwealth jurisdictions. By way of example, England,
                    Malaysia and Australia have taken a statutory approach
                    conferring on the courts an express power to grant to bail
                    in extradition proceedings, while the US and England (prior
                    to certain statutory enactments) have pronounced on the
                    existence of an inherent jurisdiction to grant bail which
                    will be briefly examined. The Hong Kong courts have affirmed
                    that the superior court’s power to grant bail is both
                    based on statute and on the court’s inherent
                    jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The English Bail Act 1976
                    (c 63) (UK) (“Bail Act”) as amended by
                    s 198 of the Extradition Act 2003 (c 41) (UK)
                    (“Extradition Act 2003”), currently in force
                    in England, expressly confers on the courts the power to
                    grant bail to individuals facing extradition by extending
                    the application of bail provisions governing all other
                    domestic criminal proceedings to extradition proceedings.
                    Section 198 of the Extradition Act 2003 introduced the
                    following pertinent changes:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_a"></a>(a)     The inclusion of
                        persons whose extradition is sought within the class of
                        persons with a general right to bail under s 4(1) of the
                        Bail Act which states, “[a] person to whom this
                        section applies shall be granted bail”. The right
                        to bail does not exist if the individual in question is
                        “alleged to be unlawfully at large after
                        conviction” of the extraditable offence (ss
                        198(1)–(5), Extradition Act
                    2003);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_b"></a>(b)     If a person has already been granted
                        bail, a court can vary or impose bail conditions or
                        withhold bail if an application is made on behalf of the
                        requesting territory (s 198(6), Extradition Act
                        2003);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_c"></a>(c)     Bail may not be granted to an
                        individual facing extradition if the conduct forming the
                        subject matter of the extradition would if carried out
                        in England and Wales constitute an indictable offence
                        and it appears that the individual was on bail at the
                        date of the offence (s 198(13), Extradition Act
                        2003);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_d"></a>(d)     Bail is not likely to be granted
                        where the individual failed to surrender to custody,
                        committed an offence on bail or is likely to interfere
                        with witnesses; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_e"></a>(e)     Section 200 of the
                        Extradition Act 2003 amends the Bail (Amendment) Act
                        2003 (c 26) (UK) to give the requesting territory a
                        right to appeal against a judge’s decision to
                        grant a person bail in extradition
                    proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In the Malaysian decision of
                        <em>Sek </em><em>Kon
                        Kim v Attorney – General</em> [1984]
                    1 MLJ 60 (“<em>Sek
                        </em><em>Kon
                    Kim</em>”), the court observed that s 23 of the
                    Fugitive Criminals Act 1967 expressly stated that the
                    provisions of the Malaysian Criminal Procedure Code (FMS Cap
                    6, enacted in 1935) (“Malaysian CPC 1935”)
                    relating to bail shall apply in the same manner in
                    extradition proceedings as if the extradition crime had been
                    committed in Malaysia. However, in so far as the Extradition
                    Ordinance 1958 (which is similar to Singapore’s
                    Extradition Act 1968) in Malaysia was concerned,
                    notwithstanding the lack of a provision similar to s 23, the
                    court nevertheless found that it had “unfettered
                    discretion to grant bail under s 388(i) of the Criminal
                    Procedure Code”. Under the current version of the
                    Malaysian CPC, s 388(1) is similar to s 327 of the old
                    CPC. Malaysia has since enacted the Extradition Act 1992
                    (Act 479) wherein s 44 states as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Provisions in the Criminal Procedure Code when
                        applicable</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">44.    The provisions of the Criminal
                            Procedure Code in relation to matters not covered by
                            this Act shall apply in so far as they are not
                            inconsistent with the provisions of this Act, and in
                            the event of any inconsistence between the
                            Provisions of this Act and the Criminal Procedure
                            Code the provisions of this Act shall
                            prevail.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Presently, similar to the English approach,
                    bail applications in connection with extradition hearings
                    are heard under the Malaysian CPC, and depending on the
                    factors and circumstances of the case, the Malaysian court
                    may grant bail to the fugitive in question.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The inherent jurisdiction
                    to grant bail has also been articulated in the leading US
                    Supreme Court decision in <em>Wright v
                        Henkel</em> 190 US 40 (1903) (“<em>Wright v Henkel</em>”). Fuller CJ
                    held that at pp 41 to 44 that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Not only is there no statute providing for admission
                        to bail in cases of foreign extradition, but section
                        5270 of the Revised Statutes is inconsistent with its
                        allowance after committal, for it is there provided that
                        if he finds the evidence sufficient, the commissioner or
                        judge "shall issue his warrant for the commitment of the
                        person so charged to the proper jail, there to remain
                        until such surrender shall be made."</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The demanding government, when it has done all that
                        the treaty and the law require it to do, is entitled to
                        the delivery of the accused on the issue of the proper
                        warrant, and the other government is under obligation to
                        make the surrender; an obligation which it might be
                        impossible to fulfill if release on bail were permitted.
                        The enforcement of the bond, if forfeited, would hardly
                        meet the international demand; and the regaining of the
                        custody of the accused obviously would be surrounded
                        with serious embarrassment. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We are unwilling to hold that the Circuit Courts
                        possess no power in respect of admitting to bail other
                        than as specifically vested by statute, or that, while
                        bail should not ordinarily be granted in cases of
                        foreign extradition, those courts may not in any 
                        case, and whatever the special circumstances, extend
                        that relief. Nor are we called upon to do so as we are
                        clearly of opinion, on this record, that no error was
                        committed in refusing to admit to bail, and that,
                        although the refusal was put on the ground of want of
                        power, the final order ought not to be disturbed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The “special circumstances test”
                    laid out in <em>Wright v Henkel</em>
                    accepts the existence of the court’s power to grant
                    bail in extradition proceedings while limiting the actual
                    grant to exceptional circumstances. For present purposes, it
                    is important to note that the existence of this power within
                    the inherent jurisdiction of the court remains good law in
                    the US. In the California Court of Appeal decision in
                        <em>United States of America v Terence
                        Damien Kirby</em> 106 F 3d 855
                        (9<sup>th</sup> Cir, 1996)
                        (“<em>Terence Damien
                        Kirby</em>”) (at 858) the court noted that
                    although there was no express statutory provision on the
                    district court’s power to grant bail, such a power was
                    based on <em>Wright v Henkel</em>. The
                    court also held that while “an explicit statutory
                    grant of authority is not, in every case, a necessary
                    prerequisite for judicial action”, it agreed that
                    “there must be some statutory basis for
                    jurisdiction”. The court found that this jurisdiction
                    was based on 28 USC § 1291 which provided
                    that courts of appeal “shall have jurisdiction of
                    appeals from all final decisions of the district
                    courts”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Prior to the enactment of
                    s 198 of the Extradition Act 2003, similar to the Americans,
                    the English also adopted the inherent jurisdiction approach
                    in characterising the power of the court to grant bail in
                    extradition proceedings. In the Privy Council decision of
                        <em>Knowles and others v Superintendent
                        of Her Majesty’s Prison Fox Hill and
                        others</em> [2005] UKPC 17
                        (“<em>Knowles</em>”),
                    allowing the appeal, affirming the existence of the
                    jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Bahamas to grant bail
                    in extradition proceedings (with a similar legislative
                    landscape as Singapore) and the persuasive nature of the
                    reasoning in <em>R v Spilsbury</em>
                    [1898] 2 QB 615 (“<em>R v
                        Spilsbury</em>”) the Lords stated as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">21    It is clear that the Supreme Court [of Bahamas] had
                            an inherent jurisdiction to grant bail to a person
                            detained which was additional to the specific power
                            to grant bail given to the magistrates up to the
                            time of committal. In <em>R v
                                Spilsbury</em> [1898] 2 QB 615
                            in a appeal by a person arrested under the Fugitive
                            Offenders Act 1881 (44 &amp; 45 Vict c 69) ...
                            having reviewed the provision of the 1881 Act Lord
                            Russell concluded that there was no express or
                            implied withdrawal of the right to bail. He said, at
                            p 622:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">“I have come to the conclusion that the
                            provisions of the statute are consistent with the
                            recognition of the power of this court to admit to
                            bail in such cases as the present. This inherent
                            power to admit to bail is historical, and has long
                            been exercised by the court, and if the legislature
                            had meant to curtail or circumscribe this well-known
                            power, their intention would have been carried out
                            by express enactment”.</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">24    There are differences between
                            the Fugitive Offenders Act 1881 and the Extradition
                            Act of The Bahamas, but in the view of the Board on
                            the basis of <em>R v
                                Spilsbury</em>, the Supreme Court had an
                            inherent jurisdiction to grant bail under The
                            Bahamas Extradition Act, the predecessor to which
                            was based on the English Extradition Act 1870 (33
                            &amp; 34 Vict c 52).</p>
<p class="Judg-1">So since 1898, the English courts have
                    strongly resisted the argument that in the absence of a
                    clear Parliamentary pronouncement, the court did not have
                    the power to grant bail for individuals facing extradition
                    proceedings. English statutory law in the form of s 4 of the
                    Bail Act has now codified this power.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The Extradition Act 2000
                    currently in force in Singapore (and its predecessor, the
                    Extradition Act 1968) is based on the 1966 Acts. It would
                    thus be pertinent to examine how the Australian courts have
                    dealt with extradition cases under the 1966 Acts. Some doubt
                    has been cast on the existence of a statutory basis or the
                    inherent jurisdiction to grant bail or review a
                    Magistrate’s refusal to grant bail. The court in
                        <em>R v Rademeyer</em> (1985)
                    59 ALR 141 (“<em>Rademeyer</em>”) rejected the argument
                    that the State Supreme Courts or Federal Courts in Australia
                    had any inherent power to grant bail in extradition
                    proceedings. Like Mr Christanto, the applicant in
                        <em>Rademeyer</em> had been refused
                    bail by the lower court pending the committal hearing. The
                    Sydney Supreme Court in <em>Rademeyer</em> held that the 1966 Acts covered
                    “the whole field in relation to the surrender of
                    fugitive offenders” in Australia. The court also
                    found that the Bail Act 1978 (No 161 of 1978) (NSW)
                    (“Bail Act 1978”) did not apply because a
                    person accused of an extradition crime was not “a
                    person charged” with an offence as required under
                    s 6 of the Bail Act 1978. However, the High Court of
                    Australia subsequently alluded to the existence of its
                    inherent jurisdiction to grant bail in exceptional
                    circumstances, although it found that it did not have to
                    predicate its decision on inherent jurisdiction (<em>Zoeller v Federal Republic of
                        Germany</em> (1989) 90 ALR 161
                    at 163-164). In <em>United Mexican
                        States v Cabal and others</em> [2001]
                    209 CLR 165, the High Court of Australia
                    considered previous decisions which referred to the
                    existence of the inherent jurisdiction to grant bail. The
                    court was considering the availability of bail before
                    special leave to appeal was granted on an application under
                    s 21 of the Extradition Act 1988 (No 4 of 1988) (Cth) (the
                    Act which replaced the 1966 Acts in Australia). It found
                    that the power to grant bail arose from s 73 of the
                    Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act (The
                    Constitution) rather than any inherent jurisdiction of the
                    court:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In our view, the power to grant bail in a criminal or
                        extradition case is an incident of the power conferred
                        by s 73 of the Constitution to hear appeals from orders
                        of certain courts. It is not a question of inherent
                        jurisdiction. The grant of judicial power carries with
                        it authority to do all that is necessary to effectuate
                        its main purpose. Because that is so, the Court has
                        authority to do all that is necessary to effectuate the
                        grant of appellate jurisdiction conferred by s 73 of the
                        Constitution. It therefore has power to stay orders that
                        are or may become the subject of its appellate
                        jurisdiction. If the Court did not have power to stay an
                        order the subject of an appeal, it might fail to do full
                        justice to the appellant or potential appellant. ... If
                        there is an application for special leave to appeal or
                        an appeal under s 73 of the Constitution against an
                        order of imprisonment, this Court has jurisdiction to
                        stay that order. It also has jurisdiction to grant bail
                        so as to make the stay order effective.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It is clear that fugitives are not without
                    recourse in Australia even if the courts are slow to grant
                    bail in extradition cases. Academics have further questioned
                    whether the Federal Courts or State Supreme Courts
                    themselves are dispossessed of inherent jurisdiction to
                    grant bail. E P Aughterson in <em>Extradition: Australian Law and Procedure</em>
                    (The Law Book Company Limited, 1995)
                    (“Aughterson”) noted at
                    pp 197–198:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... State Supreme Courts have held that their inherent
                        jurisdiction to grant bail does not extend to cases
                        where a person is held in custody under [the 1966 Acts],
                        unless the court is vested with federal jurisdiction in
                        the matter. It might be questioned whether Supreme
                        Courts should necessarily so confine their powers. If
                        the inherent jurisdiction does so extend, the
                        confinement of the limitation in s 15(3) [which
                        provides that if bail is refused, no other applications
                        may be made “to any other magistrate”
                        under the Extradition Act 1988, as compared to
                        “any other court” in the 1966 Acts]
                        suggests that the Extradition Act [1988] does not
                        “expressly or by necessary implication”
                        deprive the Supreme Court of that power.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The availability of bail
                    for fugitive offenders has also been acknowledged in Hong
                    Kong. In Hong Kong, the current position is that the
                    superior courts have both the statutory and inherent power
                    to grant bail and review bail orders of the committal court.
                    Like Singapore, the Fugitive Offenders Act of 1881 was good
                    law in Hong Kong while it was still a British colony. The UK
                    Fugitive Offenders Act 1967 also extended to Hong Kong by
                    the Fugitive Offenders (Hong Kong) Order 1967 (see: V E
                    Hartley Booth, <em>British Extradition Law
                        and Procedure </em><em>(volume
                        II)</em> (BRILL, 1981) at pp 92–93).
                    The Law Reform Commission of Hong Kong in its report, Bail
                    in Criminal Proceedings [1989] HKLRC 1 at 3.2.6, p 19
                    (“the report”) considered the issue of denying
                    the right to bail to fugitives and the state of the law in
                    Hong Kong at that time. Rejecting the proposition that bail
                    should be denied, the authors of the report remarked as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We also considered, but rejected, arguments for
                        denying the right to bail to certain categories of
                        persons - such as non-residents, fugitives, deportees,
                        members of the Armed Forces, or persons liable to
                        extradition. Such persons may, it is true, be considered
                        as transient and more likely to abscond. The English
                        Bail Act 1976, by its section 4(2), excludes fugitive
                        offenders. However, we preferred not to deny them the
                        right to bail or a bail decision on the sole ground of
                        belonging to a particular category. Like everyone else
                        they are entitled to have their applications considered
                        on the merits. No doubt their status may be an important
                        factor in deciding whether any of the exceptions is
                        established. We prefer an approach based on the
                        principle that freedom is indivisible and
                        non-discriminatory. We deprecate any approach which
                        discriminates by reference to class or status. Even a
                        fugitive offender is entitled to a determination on
                        bail, for there may be circumstances which make his
                        attendance at court to answer to the charges against him
                        highly probable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In relation to the position under Fugitive
                    Offenders Ordinance (Cap 503) (HK) (“Cap
                    503”) which is currently in force in Hong Kong
                    Special Administrative Region, the Hong Kong Court of First
                    Instance in <em>In re Chong Bing Keung,
                        Peter</em> [1998] HKCFI 351 affirmed
                    that it could review the Magistrate’s order to refuse
                    bail under s 9J(1) of the Criminal Procedure Ordinance
                    (Cap 221) (HK) (“Criminal Procedure
                    Ordinance”) which states that “[w]here a
                    District Judge or magistrate has refused to admit a person
                    to bail or has so admitted a person subject to any
                    condition, that person may in the case of a refusal, apply
                    to a judge to be admitted to bail or in the case of an
                    admission to bail subject to any condition, apply to a judge
                    to be admitted to bail without bail being subject to that
                    condition”. The court held that s 10(5) of
                    Cap 503 “which sets out the requirement for
                    special circumstances has no application to the High Court
                    and only applies to a court of committal”. Section
                    10(5) of Cap 503 provides that “neither the court of
                    committal nor any other court shall remand on bail the
                    person arrested unless it is satisfied that there are
                    special circumstances justifying such remand”. When
                    reviewing a Magistrate’s decision, “the High
                    Court judge only has to consider ... Part IA of
                    the Criminal Procedure Ordinance” which provides for
                    the right of an accused person or a fugitive offender to be
                    admitted to bail. This is notwithstanding Part IA of
                    the Criminal Procedure Ordinance making no reference to
                    “fugitive”, and only referring to
                    “accused persons”. The Court of First Instance
                    in the subsequent case of <em>Hong Kong
                        Special Administrative Region v Robert Henry
                        Cosby</em> [1999] HKCFI 944 affirmed <em>R v Spilsbury</em> and held that as
                    “a superior court of unlimited jurisdiction [it]
                    always has inherent jurisdiction to grant bail”. It
                    is clear that while the source of the courts’ power to
                    review or grant bail to fugitives varies from one
                    jurisdiction to another, there is a discernible consensus in
                    most jurisdictions on the existence of such a
                power.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Lastly, the inherent
                    jurisdiction of this court in criminal proceedings is
                    recognised in s 5 of CPC 2010:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Saving of powers of Supreme Court
                            and law officers</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5.    Nothing in this Code shall
                            derogate from the jurisdiction or powers of the
                            Court of Appeal or the High Court or the Judges
                            thereof, or the Attorney-General or the
                            Solicitor-General.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Parliament thus recognised and provided that
                    the inherent jurisdiction of the court was not to be ousted
                    by the operation of CPC 2010. The inherent jurisdiction of
                    the court may be a basis on which bail can be granted or
                    refusal of bail reviewed in cases where s 97 of CPC
                    2010 does not, on its plain meaning, apply. Suffice to say
                    that while some jurisdictions have a clear statutory
                    framework governing the power to grant bail in extradition
                    proceedings, the remaining countries such as the US, England
                    (pre-statute) and Hong Kong have pronounced the very power
                    to be capable of invoking the court’s inherent
                    jurisdiction, albeit in exceptional circumstances. Taking
                    the example of England, even in the face of clear statutory
                    restrictions prohibiting the grant of bail to fugitives
                        (<em>ie</em> s 4 Bail Act
                    prior to s 198 of Extradition Act 2003), the
                    courts as far back as 1898 took the view that bail
                    applications could be heard and granted by a court invoking
                    its inherent jurisdiction. While Commonwealth courts have
                    disagreed on the ease of availability and relevant
                    considerations operative on the grant of bail in extradition
                    proceedings, notwithstanding their respective unique
                    statutory landscapes, they are in agreement on the existence
                    of the power to hear such bail applications. It is for
                    Parliament to clearly and unequivocally oust the courts of
                    the power to grant bail in extradition proceedings, short of
                    which s 97 should be interpreted as inclusive of
                    fugitives and as unfettered by s 95(1)(c) of CPC 2010.
                    As eloquently phrased by Lord Russell of Killowen CJ in
                        <em>R v Spilsbury</em> at
                    p 620:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This court has, independently of statute, by the
                        common law, jurisdiction to admit to bail. Therefore the
                        case ought to be looked at in this way: does the Act of
                        Parliament, either expressly or by necessary
                        implication, deprive the court of that power?</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It is thus the opinion of this Court that it has
                    the power to grant bail to fugitives facing extradition
                    proceedings either under s 97 of CPC 2010 or by
                    invoking its inherent jurisdiction. The question then arises
                    as to what factors the court should take into account and
                    what if any considerations should be accepted as
                    distinguishing extradition proceedings from domestic
                    criminal proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The US court in <em>Re Mitchell</em> 171 F 289
                    (1909) affirmed <em>Wright v
                        Henkel</em> in holding that while the fugitive had
                    a right to bail, bail would be granted “only in the
                    most pressing circumstances, and when the requirements of
                    justice are peremptory”. As noted by Roberto Iraola,
                    commenting on the way US courts exercise their inherent
                    jurisdiction in extradition proceedings, in “The
                    Federal Common Law of Bail in International Extradition
                    Proceedings” 17 Ind Int’l &amp; Comp
                    L Rev 29 at pp 29–47, the following
                    factors are examples of “special
                    circumstances”: a substantial likelihood of success
                    at the hearing, availability of bail for the underlying
                    charge in the requesting country, the requesting
                    country’s allowance of admission to bail for those
                    facing an extradition hearing for the same offense, the
                    likelihood of success in defending against the action in the
                    requesting country, a delayed extradition hearing, a severe
                    health problem, probable lengthy delay as a result of the
                    extradition proceedings itself and appeals therefrom, the
                    age of the extraditee and availability of a suitable
                    detention facility. The presumption against bail in
                    extradition cases and the US court’s reluctance to
                    exercise the power save in “exceptional
                    circumstances” was likely founded on the fact that
                    the inherent jurisdiction of the court is by definition
                    discretionary and to be exercised in “exceptional
                    circumstances”. A review of the cross-jurisdictional
                    approaches to the grant of bail in extradition proceedings
                    reveals that it is the source of the power that justifies a
                    differentiation of the scope of the court’s power
                        <em>vis-a-vis</em> extradition
                    proceedings and domestic criminal proceedings. By way of
                    summary, the court in <em>In the Matter of
                        Extradition of Nacif-Borge</em>
                    829 F Supp 1210 (D Nev 1993)
                    at 1214 (“<em>Nacif-Borge</em>”) noted that bail has
                    “usually” been denied in extradition
                    proceedings. The evolution of the English approach noted in
                        <em>Knowles</em> wherein the Lords
                    stated at [26] that “it should only be in exceptional
                    cases that bail as a matter of discretion is granted”
                    is markedly different from the current approach in England
                    which is now entrenched in statute. With enactment of
                    s 198 of the Extradition Act 2003, while certain
                    considerations specific to extradition have been
                    incorporated into the Bail Act, the scope of the power to
                    grant bail and the individual’s right to bail is
                    identical regardless of whether they face domestic criminal
                    prosecution or international extradition. The English
                    experience reveals that where the power to grant bail is
                    statutory, the court’s power is broader and consistent
                    with its powers in domestic criminal
                proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The Singapore courts do
                    not have to invoke their inherent jurisdiction to grant bail
                    in extradition cases since s 97 of the CPC 2010 is a
                    clear statutory basis for the High Court to exercise its
                    power to grant bail in all criminal proceedings.
                    Accordingly, it is my opinion that the uniform approach
                    treating extradition proceedings as a subset of criminal
                    proceedings is preferred. The relevant factors for each
                    crime (whether extraditable or not) will vary depending on
                    the nature of the offence, unique aspects of the factual
                    matrix of the case and the individual in question. As in
                    domestic proceedings, the flight risk posed by the
                    individual can be addressed by the bail conditions imposed
                    rather than eclipsing the availability of bail. The question
                    of whether bail is granted depends on the facts of each
                    case. Furthermore, analyses of the relevant factors on the
                    grant of bail will quickly show that no single unique factor
                    attributable to fugitives stand out requiring a wholly
                    unique, separate or narrower approach to be taken at the
                    very outset when confronted with extradition proceedings.
                    While some factors may be more relevant than others such as
                    the flight risk of the fugitive, this would also be the case
                    when one compares different domestic criminal offences
                    (whether cheating or murder). This distinction is also borne
                    out by the fact that the narrower scope of the power to
                    grant bail is adopted by countries which take the inherent
                    jurisdiction approach such as the US.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     A review of the case law
                    arising from a range of jurisdictions will show that the
                    courts do not have a consistent response to the question of
                    when bail would be granted in extradition proceedings, and
                    what factors would be regarded by the court as sufficient.
                    This is understandable as the exercise of the power to grant
                    bail is discretionary and fact-sensitive. In <em>Sek </em><em>Kon
                        Kim</em>, the court held that the following
                    non-exhaustive factors would be considered in a bail
                    application for individuals facing extradition:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1)    The nature and gravity of the
                            offence charged.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    The severity and degree of
                            punishment which conviction might
                        entail.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3)    The guarantee that the accused
                            person if released on bail would not either abscond
                            or obstruct the prosecution in any
                        way.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(4)    The danger of the witness
                            being tampered with and whether the accused person
                            if released on bail is likely to tamper with
                            prosecution evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(5)    The opportunity of the accused
                            to prepare the defence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(6)    The character, means and
                            standing of the accused.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(7)    The long period of detention
                            of the accused and probability of further period of
                            delay.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Given that bail was
                    granted in <em>Sek </em><em>Kon Kim</em>, a summary of the facts may
                    be useful. This case concerned an applicant, a Malaysian,
                    who worked in Australia and who upon return to Malaysia was
                    accused of committing certain offences relating to
                    fraudulent conversion of cheques totalling A$104,646.78. The
                    alleged offences were committed in 1973 and the applicant
                    had returned to Malaysia soon thereafter. Extradition
                    proceedings were commenced in 1979 and he was arrested in
                    1983. The Magistrate refused to grant bail to the applicant
                    pending the committal hearing. The court hearing the
                    application from the Magistrate’s decision found that
                    given that the underlying offences were not serious in
                    nature, were alleged to have taken place in 1973, and the
                    applicant had vast business dealings in Malaysia and had
                    surrendered his travel documents, bail should be granted to
                    the applicant. The application for bail was allowed at
                    $100,000 with two sureties and the surrender of all his
                    travelling documents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Mr Quek and Mr Haq,
                    counsel for Mr Christanto, emphasised the following
                    considerations of fact which lent weight to his petition for
                    the grant of bail:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_a"></a>(a)     Co-operation: He
                        (Mr Christanto) has co-operated with Singapore
                        authorities and attended at least three sessions at the
                        CPIB to assist in their investigations. The Prosecution
                        has stated that “[t]here is clear evidence that
                        until his arrest on 4 May 2012, Mr Christanto
                        did not have the faintest idea that he was wanted by the
                        Australian authorities on very serious charges, and that
                        actions were being taken to have him
                        extradited”.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_b"></a>(b)     Delay in commencement of
                        extradition proceedings: 12 years have lapsed since
                        the offences identified in the charges were alleged
                        committed and Mr Christanto has not been on notice
                        either actual or constructive of investigations against
                        him.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_c"></a>(c)     Low flight risk: He was aware of the
                        facts forming the subject matter of the Australian
                        extradition charges prior to the issuance of the warrant
                        of apprehension and notwithstanding that, he complied
                        with his bail terms from the CPIB.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_d"></a>(d)     Substantial roots
                        in Singapore: He has real roots in Singapore since he
                        attended the then Nanyang University in 1973 and
                        Singapore has been his place of residence from around
                        1989. He successfully applied and received a long term
                        visit pass in 2008 prior to the commencement of any
                        investigations against him. His three children have been
                        “practically raised and educated” in
                        Singapore, completing their primary, secondary and
                        junior college education between 1989 and 2003. His
                        daughter and younger brother also work and reside in
                        Singapore (the Prosecution submitted, in error, at the
                        hearing before the DJ that Mr Christanto had no
                        family in Singapore).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_e"></a>(e)     Substantial investments in
                        Singapore: He has substantial investments in Singapore
                        in the form of seven immovable properties worth
                        approximately $25 million of which two apartments (in
                        The Claymore at 27 Claymore Road and The Seaview at
                        29 Amber Road) have been fully paid for. The remaining
                        five properties are currently being rented out and are
                        at least 40% paid for. He also has cash deposits of
                        about S$15 million in Singapore
                    banks.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_f"></a>(f)     Poor health: He is 64 years of age
                        and is in poor health as he suffers from a
                        “myriad of heart ailments”. Dr Chua
                        Thiam Eng (“Dr Chua”) of Cambridge
                        Clinic stated that in his opinion, Mr Christanto
                        “is definitely sick and unfit for remand”
                        and this opinion was concurred by Dr Hui Kok Pheng
                        (“Dr Hui”) of Mount Elizabeth Medical
                        Centre. A letter dated 14 May 2012 from
                        Dr Chua states that Mr Christanto suffers
                        from:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_22-p2_f-p3_i"></a>(i)       Coronary Artery Disease with an angioplasty done in

<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_22-p2_f-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       Benign prostate hypertrophy

<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_22-p2_f-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       Cervical spondylosis with chronic neck ache and
                            pain requiring physiotherapy three times a
                            week;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_22-p2_f-p3_iv"></a>(iv)       Mild chronic inflammation
                            in the right middle lobe of his lung requiring
                            further evaluation; and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_22-p2_f-p3_v"></a>(v)       Further evaluation
                            was also required for his cardiac and lung
                            conditions and persistent symptoms of chest pain and
                            giddiness.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Finally, Mr
                    Christanto expressed his commitment to abiding by the bail
                    conditions and offered to post a bail sum of S$200,000 to
                    $500,000. His counsels, Mr Quek and Mr Haq also
                    submitted that pursuant to the additional conditions of bail
                    under s 94 of CPC 2010, this Court could order
                    Mr Christanto to report once in the morning to the
                    police and once in the evening, in addition to impounding
                    his passport.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Section 95(2) of the CPC
                    2010 provides for an exception to the general prohibition
                    against the grant of bail by the Subordinate Courts in
                    extradition proceedings, on account of the health of the
                    person to be detained. Section 95(2) provides that
                    “[n]otwithstanding subsection (1), the court may
                    direct that any juvenile or any sick or infirm person
                    accused of such offence be released on bail”. This
                    power is available to the High Court under s 97 of the
                    CPC 2010. The discretion to grant bail on account of the
                    potential detainee’s illness should not of course be
                    exercised merely because bare allegations of poor health are
                    made by the fugitive. The court has to be satisfied that
                    remanding the person would significantly exacerbate his or
                    her illness, and that this cannot be remedied by changing
                    the conditions of remand, for example, by remanding him or
                    her in a medical institute. I considered
                    Mr Christanto’s application under s 97 of
                    the CPC 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The factors relevant to a
                    bail hearing in extradition proceedings vary considerably
                    depending on when the application is made (<em>ie</em> prior to the fugitive’s
                    committal hearing, after the fugitive has been committed or
                    pending the hearing of an order of review of detention under
                    s 418 of CPC 2010). I pause to clarify my earlier
                    decision in <em>Public Prosecutor v Lim Yong
                        Nam</em> [2012] SGHC 45
                        (“<em>Lim Yong
                    Nam</em>”). In <em>Lim Yong
                        Nam</em>, the fugitive was released on bail of
                    $100,000 pending his committal hearing and after the
                    committal order was issued the Magistrate ordered his bail
                    to be extended in the light of his medical conditions. I
                    therefore accepted the Prosecution’s view that the
                    Magistrate had no authority to grant bail once a warrant of
                    committal had been granted under s 11(1) of the
                    Extradition Act 2000. In relation to the Magistrates’
                    power to grant bail in extradition proceedings, having had
                    the benefit of full arguments in the present application, I
                    am now of the view that my decision in <em>Lim Yong Nam</em> should be read in light of s
                    95(1)(c) of CPC 2010, the governing provision on bail
                    applications before the Subordinate Courts. On the question
                    of the High Court’s power to grant bail in extradition
                    proceedings, I must emphasise that in the light of my
                    decision in <em>Hisham</em> and
                    s 418 of the CPC 2010 which avails the High Court of
                    the power to grant bail to a committed fugitive awaiting
                    extradition, it would be wrong for s 97 of the CPC 2010
                    to interpreted such that the High Court does not have power
                    to grant bail to a fugitive caught between his/her committal
                    and review hearing. Accordingly, I find that the High Court
                    has the power to grant bail throughout extradition
                    proceedings and to review the DJ’s decision to refuse
                    bail under s 97 of CPC 2010, and alternatively, by
                    invoking its inherent jurisdiction. Turning to the facts of
                    this case, I am of the view that as Mr Christanto is
                    awaiting his committal hearing, the fact that he co-operated
                    with the CPIB to the best of his abilities and complied with
                    bail conditions imposed upon him support the grant of his
                    bail at this juncture. I am also satisfied that
                    Mr Christanto has substantial assets in and family ties
                    to Singapore and that the bail conditions imposed on his
                    travel outside of this jurisdiction will sufficiently answer
                    the Prosecution’s concerns as to any flight risk which
                    he potentially poses. I pause to note that while it is
                    doubtful that Mr Christanto would have succeeded under
                    s 95(2), in exercise of my discretion under s 97
                    of the CPC 2010 I also took into account his medical
                    conditions and the undisputed evidence of his doctors as to
                    the effect of remanding him. Having considered the totality
                    of the evidence before me, I order that bail shall be
                    granted to Mr Christanto at $2,000,000 in two sureties
                    with the following conditions:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_A"></a>(A)     ss
                        94(2)(a)–(d) of CPC 2010 to apply, namely:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_24-p2_A-p3_a"></a>(a)       to
                            surrender any travel document in his
                            possession;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_24-p2_A-p3_b"></a>(b)       to surrender to custody or
                            to make himself available for investigations or to
                            attend court at the day, time and place appointed
                            for him to do so;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_24-p2_A-p3_c"></a>(c)       not to commit any
                            offence while released on bail or on personal bond;
                            and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_24-p2_A-p3_d"></a>(d)       not to interfere with any
                            witness or otherwise obstruct the course of justice
                            whether in relation to himself or any other
                            person;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_B"></a>(B)     he shall report once in the morning
                        at 8.30 am and once in the evening at 6.30pm to the
                        nearest police station or as the police may
                        direct;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_C"></a>(C)     he shall not apply for any further
                        travel documents or leave the jurisdiction of Singapore
                        pending extradition proceedings against him;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_D"></a>(D)     his sureties shall not leave the jurisdiction of
                        Singapore without the permission of the High Court or
                        the DJ having conduct of the pending extradition
                        hearings.</p>
