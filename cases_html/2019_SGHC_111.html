However, the categories of guidelines or factors are obviously not closed and much would depend, in the final analysis, on the precise facts and context concerned.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 I make two preliminary points. First, Wham might not have held himself out as a professional journalist, blogger, commentator or authoritative news source, but he did submit that he was a social activist (see <span class="font-italic">Wham Kwok Han </span><span class="font-italic">Jolovan</span> at [83]). It was not Wham’s case that he had, or would have had, little or no influence and reach through his Facebook profile.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Second, I do not accept the AG’s submission that the extent of dissemination of Wham’s post was further amplified by the two further posts that Wham published on his Facebook profile on 8 October 2018 and 9 October 2018 respectively (see [10] above). While Wham republished the contemptuous content of Wham’s post in these two further posts, it appears to me that these further posts were for the purposes of informing the public of the status/outcome of the proceedings against him for scandalising contempt.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 In this case, I accept that <span class="font-italic">Au </span><span class="font-italic">Wai Pang</span> serves as a useful reference for determining the appropriate sentence for Wham, since the contemptuous material in <span class="font-italic">Au </span><span class="font-italic">Wai Pang</span> had also been published on the Internet.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 In <span class="font-italic">Au </span><span class="font-italic">Wai Pang</span>, the contemnor was a first-time offender for scandalising contempt. Likewise, this is the first time that Wham is convicted for scandalising contempt.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 However, I am of the view that Wham’s culpability and the gravity of his scandalising contempt were clearly less than the culpability of the contemnor in <span class="font-italic">Au </span><span class="font-italic">Wai Pang</span> and the gravity of that scandalising contempt. Wham’s post contained a bare statement impugning the integrity and impartiality of Singapore’s judges (see <span class="font-italic">Wham Kwok Han </span><span class="font-italic">Jolovan</span> at [96]). In great contrast, the contemptuous article in <span class="font-italic">Au </span><span class="font-italic">Wai Pang</span> was 16 paragraphs long and was by far a more targeted and detailed attack on certain members of the judiciary. The entire thrust of the article was to allege, with specificity, certain vested and improper interests on the part of these members (see <span class="font-italic">Au </span><span class="font-italic">Wai Pang</span> at [48]). These allegations were also carefully crafted to take the form of insinuations as opposed to express views, thereby making the article even more insidious (see <span class="font-italic">Au </span><span class="font-italic">Wai Pang</span> at [48], [54]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 On the other hand, Wham did not show any remorse for his post as he refused to remove it from his Facebook profile and refused to apologise for his post even after conviction. In <span class="font-italic">Au </span><span class="font-italic">Wai Pang</span>, the contemnor apparently removed his contemptuous article from his blog after the court granted leave to the AG to apply for an order of committal against him. The contemnor there also apologised (see <span class="font-italic">Au </span><span class="font-italic">Wai Pang</span> at [10]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 In <span class="font-italic">Au </span><span class="font-italic">Wai Pang</span>, the contemnor was sentenced to a fine of $8,000.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 In my view, a sentence of a fine of $5,000, with one week’s imprisonment in default, would be appropriate for Wham for the offence of scandalising contempt under s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Act in the circumstances.

The relevant provisions in relation to an apology are ss 12(2) to 12(5) which state:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Punishment for contempt of court</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) In addition to any punishment imposed under subsection (1), where a person has committed contempt in relation to the proceedings before a court, the court may refuse to hear the person until the contempt is purged or the person submits to the order or direction of the court or an apology is made to the satisfaction of the court.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3) In addition to any punishment imposed under subsection (1), the court may, on its own motion or on application by the applicant in the contempt proceedings, make an order that the person who has committed contempt must publish such notice, and in such manner, as the court thinks necessary to apologise for the contemptuous publication.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(4) An order under subsection (3) may be made subject to such exceptions or conditions (including the duration for which the notification must be made accessible to members of the public) as may be specified in the order.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(5) Despite subsection (1), the court may discharge the person who has committed contempt or remit the punishment or any part of it on his or her purging of the contempt, submission to the order or direction of the court or on apology being made to the satisfaction of the court.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Where a contemnor refuses to purge his contempt, whether in refusing to apologise or in refusing to remove his contemptuous publication, a question may arise as to whether the court should make an order under s 12(3) for him to publish a notice to apologise. It is clear that the purpose of making such an order is not to extract a sincere apology from such a contemnor since if he were sincere about it, he need not be compelled to apologise. The question then is under what circumstances the court should make such an order.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 I do not agree with the AG’s submission that there should be a general approach to order a contemnor to publish a notice to apologise to purge his contempt if he failed to do so voluntarily. Just because the court now has the power to make such an order under s 12(3) does not mean that the court should generally exercise it as long as the contemnor does not apologise.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Seen in this light, whilst purging the contempt of a contemnor may be one of the intended effects of an order under s 12(3), I do not think that the overriding concern of s 12(3) is to purge such contempt. Prior to the Act, there did not seem to have been a need for a contemnor to purge his scandalising contempt by apologising for it. The AG did not refer the court to the parliamentary debates to show that Parliament considered that there was such a necessity when enacting the Act, or that Parliament generally intended for a contemnor to purge his scandalising contempt by apologising for it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 After all, a contemnor’s failure to purge his scandalising contempt, which also evidences his lack of remorse, is a factor the court takes into account when sentencing him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 In so far as a notice to apologise published in the same manner as the contemptuous publication may be efficacious in informing that target audience that the contemptuous publication is scandalising contempt, this has to be weighed against the factor that the contemnor has refused to purge his scandalising contempt. It seems meaningless to order a contemnor to apologise when the apology would not be sincere.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Furthermore, if a contemnor refused to publish a notice to apologise as ordered by the court, he might further be liable for an act of contempt of court, and more time and resources may have to be spent to commence proceedings against him again. This may result in a disproportionate use of such time and resources as compared with the original offence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In <span class="font-italic">Re Ouellet (Nos 1 and 2)</span> (1977) 72 DLR (3d) 95 at 100, Tremblay CJQ (in the Quebec Court of Appeal) was of the view that it was not useful to compel the contemnor in question to apologise. He said:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">As to the sentence, the order of probation includes the obligation by the appellant to present apologies. It is evident that if he does it, the appellant will not do it willingly. With respect to the contrary opinion, I am not at all convinced that it is useful to impose this obligation on the appellant. Forced apologies are humiliating for the person uttering them. Moreover, in the present case, they would not mean anything to persons concerned, except maybe to tickle their ego and they would not in any way better the administration of justice in Canada. Finally, if the appellant persisted in refusing to apologize, the Superior Court and, maybe the Court of Appeal, would have to devote to this case time which would be better employed for more important cases for the people of Canada. I would therefore strike out the order of probation forcing him to apologize.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 As there is no general rule that the court should order a contemnor to publish a notice to apologise for his contemptuous publication, the court will have to consider the facts of each case before deciding whether to make such an order.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The AG did not raise any specific circumstance to warrant ordering Wham to publish a notice to apologise besides the general arguments made. In the circumstances of this case, I do not think that it is necessary to make an order that Wham publish a notice to apologise for his post pursuant to s 12(3). His refusal to apologise would be and was taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence for him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 The Respondents are the first individuals against whom proceedings were commenced for scandalising contempt under s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Act. It is premature for this court to set out the circumstances under which a court should order a contemnor to publish a notice to apologise for his contemptuous publication pursuant to s 12(3).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Given that I find it unnecessary to order Wham to publish a notice to apologise for his post, there is no further question of imposing conditions in respect of the order.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Removal of Wham’s post</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 It appears that the court has the power to order Wham to remove his post from his Facebook profile, although this power may not be explicitly stated in s 9(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the Act. Section 9(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Inherent power of court</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">9.</span> Nothing in this Act limits or affects the inherent powers of a court, including but not limited to —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) the power of the High Court or the Court of Appeal to issue an injunction including but not limited to an interim injunction to restrain a contempt of court; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 I am of the view that “an interim injunction to restrain a contempt of court” relates to a <span class="font-italic">prohibitory</span> injunction, and not a <span class="font-italic">mandatory</span> injunction. I have my doubts with the AG’s submission that an order for Wham to remove his post would be a prohibitory injunction. It seems to me that an order for Wham to remove his post would be a mandatory injunction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Be that as it may, s 9(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) seems to include a mandatory injunction. After all, it refers to the power to issue “an injunction”. This is wide enough to encompass both a prohibitory injunction as well as a mandatory injunction. The next clause, “including but not limited to an interim injunction to restrain a contempt of court”, provides only an illustration of the kind of injunction that may be issued. The question then is under what circumstances the court should issue a mandatory injunction for a contemnor to remove his contemptuous publication which is still accessible to the public at large.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 In so far as the AG submitted that ordering Wham to remove his post is necessary to purge his scandalising contempt, similar considerations as those mentioned at [42]–[48] above apply. I do not think that there should be a general approach to order a contemnor to remove his contemptuous publication to purge his contempt if he failed to do so voluntarily. Again, a contemnor’s failure to purge his scandalising contempt, which also evidences his lack of remorse, is a factor the court takes into account when sentencing him. Moreover, if a contemnor refused to remove his contemptuous publication as ordered by the court, more time and resources may have to be spent to commence proceedings against him again, resulting in a disproportionate use of such time and resources as compared with the original offence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 The court will have to consider the facts of each case before deciding whether to issue a mandatory injunction for a contemnor to remove his contemptuous publication.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 I observe that the Minister for Law, Mr K Shanmugam, had made a remark in the parliamentary debates, albeit in relation to the power of the AG to give a non-publication direction under s 13 of the Act. The Minister remarked that “[a contemptuous or an allegedly contemptuous] article could be there for weeks by which point in time, there is no point taking it down anyway” (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</span> (15 August 2016) vol 94).

</div>
</div> The Minister was referring to a contemptuous or an allegedly contemptuous article that had been published online publicly and the need to act quickly in certain situations to require that the publication be taken down. His point was that if there were no avenue to act quickly, it would be pointless to act later.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 This brings me to another point the AG stressed, that Wham’s post has remained on his Facebook profile for several months, thus suggesting that this scandalising contempt is continuing and should be dealt with.

The reality is that such a post would ordinarily recede into the background with the passage of time unless attention was drawn to it by some other development.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The AG did not raise any specific circumstance to warrant ordering Wham to remove his post besides the general arguments made. In the circumstances of this case, I do not think that it is necessary to issue a mandatory injunction for Wham to remove his post. His refusal to remove it would be and was taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence for him. Moreover, as mentioned, given that Wham’s post has been published on his Facebook profile since 27 April 2018, which is about a year ago, his post would ordinarily have receded into the background on his Facebook profile.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 As in the case of making an order for a contemnor to publish a notice to apologise for his contemptuous publication, it is premature for this court, at this point, to set out the circumstances under which a court should issue a mandatory injunction for a contemnor to remove his contemptuous publication.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Appropriate sentence for Tan</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 I proceed to address the issue of the appropriate sentence for Tan.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Parties’ arguments</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 In summary, the AG submitted that, in view of an antecedent, the appropriate sentence for Tan should not be less than the sentence imposed upon him for his previous conviction for scandalising contempt, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, it should not be less than 15 days’ imprisonment. In the written submissions to the court and at the hearing on the appropriate sentence for Tan, the AG also submitted that the court should order Tan to publish a notice to apologise for his post, and order him to remove his post forthwith. However, at the hearing on sentence, Tan said that he would remove his post from his Facebook profile. I understand from the letter Tan’s counsel later sent to the court dated 21 March 2019 that Tan’s post has been removed. I will elaborate later on why Tan eventually decided, at the hearing, to remove his post (see [76] below).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 In Tan’s written submissions to the court dated 30 October 2018, he had submitted that the appropriate sentence is not more than three days’ imprisonment.

</div> However, as mentioned (at [62] and [76] above), at the hearing on sentence, Tan said he would remove his post from his Facebook profile. Tan’s counsel has also informed the court that Tan’s post was removed after the hearing (see [79] above).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 I reproduce the statement in Tan’s post:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">By charging <span class="font-underline">Jolovan</span> for scandalising the judiciary, the AGC only confirms what he said was true.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Sentence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 I make three preliminary points. First, a court is not bound to sentence a person to imprisonment just because both the applicant and the respondent submit that the appropriate sentence is a custodial one.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 Second, I do not consider Tan to be more culpable for publishing his post <span class="font-italic">after</span> proceedings against Wham had been commenced for scandalising contempt (see [82] above). After all, Tan’s post was about those proceedings. Also, at that point, it was not yet determined that Wham was guilty of scandalising contempt.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 Third, I reject Tan’s characterisation of his post in itself not bearing the elements of scandalising contempt and that the reference to Wham’s post was “extraneous” (see [67] above). This was not Tan’s case before the court in his submissions on liability. The words “the AGC only confirms what he said was true” in Tan’s post were intertwined with and repeated what Wham said in Wham’s post (<span class="font-italic">Wham Kwok Han </span><span class="font-italic">Jolovan</span> at [115]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 I address Tan’s culpability next. I observe that Tan was directly criticising the AG for commencing proceedings against Wham for scandalising contempt, and Tan’s attack on the Singapore courts was less direct. Given this particular factual matrix, I am of the view that Tan was less culpable than Wham.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 On the other hand, as with Wham, Tan did not show any remorse for his post. Tan refused to apologise for his post even after conviction, and as at the hearing on sentence, he had not removed his post from his Facebook profile. To be clear, whilst Tan removed his post after the hearing on sentence and on the same day, this was not a reflection of remorse for his post. Tan’s counsel made it clear at the hearing that Tan’s decision to remove his post was just to put his counsel in a “better position to ask the Court for some compassion” (see [76] above); it is a separate question whether Tan’s decision assisted his submission for a custodial sentence and I will come to this later.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 This is not the first time that Tan is convicted for scandalising contempt, but it is Wham’s first.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 Briefly, Tan was previously found liable for scandalising contempt (at common law) on 24 November 2008 because he wore a T-shirt imprinted with a picture of a kangaroo dressed in a judge’s gown, within and in the vicinity of the Supreme Court on two occasions when an assessment of damages hearing was being held, and distributed similar T-shirts in the Supreme Court (see <span class="font-italic">Tan Liang </span><span class="font-italic">Joo John</span> at [30]). Tan was, at that time, also involved in or acquiesced in posting a photograph on the Singapore Democratic Party website, of him and his two co-respondents wearing these T-shirts and standing outside the main entrance of the Supreme Court building. The High Court concluded that the conduct of Tan and his co-respondents communicated to an average member of the public their conviction that the Singapore courts were “kangaroo courts” (see <span class="font-italic">Tan Liang </span><span class="font-italic">Joo John</span> at [28]). In sentencing Tan to 15 days’ imprisonment, the High Court also took into account the fact that Tan refused to apologise and was particularly recalcitrant (<span class="font-italic">Tan Liang </span><span class="font-italic">Joo John</span> at [40]–[41]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 While Tan has again committed scandalising contempt, the nature of his previous contempt in 2008 was very different from the nature of his contempt on the present occasion in relation to his post. It may have been that both offences involved some element of publication of the contemptuous allegation online, namely, one aspect of Tan’s previous contempt in 2008, and the very nature of Tan’s present contempt in relation to his post. However, this alone is insufficient to equate the two offences. Tan’s culpability and the gravity of his contempt then were obviously much more than his culpability and the gravity of his contempt on the present occasion. I thus reject the AG’s attempt to equate the two very different acts in terms of culpability and gravity.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 As mentioned, both the AG and Tan submitted that the appropriate sentence for Tan is a custodial sentence but for different reasons. Leaving aside for the time being the question of the personal consequences that might result for Tan depending on the sentence to be imposed upon him, and given my finding that Tan was less culpable than Wham but that Tan has an antecedent, I am not persuaded that a custodial sentence is appropriate for Tan. Neither am I persuaded that the sentence for Tan ought to be more severe than the sentence for Wham. Tan’s antecedent should not overshadow his present offence. He was already sentenced for his previous offence and has already served that sentence. The mere existence of one antecedent for which Tan was sentenced to a custodial term does not necessarily mean that a custodial sentence is warranted for him should he commit scandalising contempt again. It is important to consider the nature of the contempt on both occasions. Where the antecedent was much more serious, it does not follow that, without more, Tan should be sentenced to a custodial term on this present occasion. Here, Tan did not repeat what he did on the previous occasion, and as mentioned, the nature of his present contempt was quite different.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 I proceed to consider whether the court should consider the personal consequences that might result for Tan depending on the sentence to be imposed upon him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 The relevant portions of Arts 45(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) and 45(2) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (1985 Rev Ed, 1999 Reprint) state:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Disqualifications for membership of Parliament</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">45.</span>—(1) Subject to this Article, a person shall not be qualified to be a Member of Parliament who —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) has been convicted of an offence by a court of law in Singapore or Malaysia and sentenced to <span class="font-weight-bold">imprisonment for a term of not less than one year</span> or to <span class="font-weight-bold">a fine of not less than $2,000</span> and has not received a free pardon:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) The disqualification of a person under clause (1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) or (<span class="font-italic">e</span>) may be removed by the President and shall, if not so removed, cease at the end of 5 years beginning from … as the case may be, the date on which the person convicted as mentioned in clause (1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) was released from custody or the date on which the fine mentioned in clause (1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) was imposed on such person …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 Tan submitted that if he were sentenced to a fine of not less than $2,000, pursuant to Art 45(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>), and if he did not receive a free pardon, he would not be qualified to be a Member of Parliament for a time period of up to five years (Art 45(2)). As he was of the view that a sentence of a fine would not be less than $2,000 in his case, Tan thus argued that the appropriate sentence for him should be a custodial term of a few days.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 It seems that under Art 45(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>), a sentence of one year’s imprisonment is supposed to be the notional equivalent of a fine of $2,000 as each is a threshold for disqualification for membership of Parliament. This appears anomalous as a sentence of one year’s imprisonment would appear to be obviously more severe than a fine of $2,000 in current times. The provision in Art 45(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) was already a part of the Constitution of Singapore in force as at 9 August 1965. However, it may be that the quantum of the fine has not been reviewed to take into account inflation. Hence, the result is that for someone aspiring to be a Member of Parliament, a custodial sentence of a few days may be perceived as being more favourable to him than a $2,000 fine although the opposite perception would apply for most others.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 I turn to consider the High Court case of <span class="font-italic">Stansilas</span><span class="font-italic"> Fabian Kester</span> ([85] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>). I find the reasoning of Sundaresh Menon CJ in <span class="font-italic">Stansilas</span><span class="font-italic"> Fabian Kester</span> helpful, and I reproduce his analysis at [110]–[111]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">110 The second argument is that an offender should not receive <span class="font-italic">punishment of a certain type</span> or above a certain degree because he will lose his job or face disciplinary proceedings otherwise. The argument is that the imposition of <span class="font-italic">a certain type</span> or degree <span class="font-italic">of punishment</span> will lead to <span class="font-italic">hardship or compromise the offender’s future in some way</span> and that <span class="font-italic">this additional hardship</span> may and indeed should be taken into account by the sentencing court. However, <span class="font-italic">this will not often bring the offender very far.</span> Prof Ashworth accounts for the general lack of persuasiveness of such arguments in the following lucid fashion ([Andrew Ashworth, <span class="font-italic">Sentencing and Criminal Justice</span> (Cambridge University Press, 6th Ed, 2015)] at p 194):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Is there any merit in this source of mitigation [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the effect of the crime on the offender’s career]? <span class="font-italic">Once courts begin to adjust sentences for collateral consequences</span>, is this not a step towards the idea of wider social accounting which was rejected above? In many cases one can argue that these collateral consequences are a concomitant of the professional responsibility which the offender undertook, and therefore that they should not lead to a reduction in sentence because <span class="font-italic">the offender surely knew the implications</span>. Moreover, there is a discrimination argument here too. If collateral consequences were accepted as a regular mitigating factor, this would operate in favour of members of the professional classes and against ‘common thieves’ who would either be unemployed or working in jobs where a criminal record is no barrier. It would surely be wrong to support a principle which institutionalized discrimination between employed and unemployed offenders.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">111 Whichever way one looks at it, <span class="font-italic">I do not regard it as relevant to sentencing. </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">A person who breaches the criminal law can expect to face the consequences that follow under the criminal law.</span> Whether or not such an offender has already or may as a result suffer <span class="font-italic">other professional or contractual consequences</span> should not be relevant to the sentencing court.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 Menon CJ’s analysis as set out above is applicable to sentencing in general. He dealt with the general argument that “imposition of <span class="font-italic">a certain type</span> or degree <span class="font-italic">of punishment</span> will lead to hardship or compromise the offender’s future in some way” [emphasis added]. Menon CJ’s analysis will also apply to Tan’s situation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 I accept that as regards Tan, there is no discrimination of the kind mentioned by Prof Ashworth. However, as mentioned by Menon CJ, whichever way one looks at it, the collateral consequences are not relevant to sentencing. Menon CJ stated that “other professional or contractual consequences should not be relevant to the sentencing court”. In my view, this also applies to consequences other than professional or contractual consequences such as political consequences. In other words, a person who breaches the criminal law must expect to face the consequences under the criminal law whether or not he also suffers collateral consequences. I thus reject Tan’s submission in so far as he suggested that justice would not be done in this case if he were sentenced to a fine of at least $2,000 (see [75] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 It may even be said that it is for any person who has political aspirations to ensure that he does not run afoul of the law. In the case of Tan, this is not his first brush with the law. Even if it could be said that he was initially unaware that his post might be scandalising contempt, it was open to him to remove his post from his Facebook profile as soon as he was aware that the AG intended to take action against him for his post. Tan could have done so as a matter of prudence and not because he necessarily agreed with the AG’s perception.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 Alternatively, as soon as the court convicted him for scandalising contempt, Tan could have immediately removed his post and apologised for it. For his own reasons, he chose not to do so. His decision to remove his post was made only during the hearing on sentence. It was an eleventh-hour manoeuvre to try and persuade the court to accede to his request not to impose a fine. As mentioned, it was not a reflection of genuine remorse.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 Had Tan taken any of the courses of action mentioned above, then he might have avoided the continuation of proceedings against him for scandalising contempt, or he would have been in a better position to seek a fine of less than $2,000. In the circumstances, Tan is responsible for the situation he finds himself in.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 Consequently, the personal consequences for Tan, depending on the sentence to be imposed upon him, are irrelevant to sentencing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 I now address the cases which Tan’s counsel submitted with his letter to the court dated 20 March 2019, sent after the hearing on sentence (see [78] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 In the High Court case of <span class="font-italic">Low </span><span class="font-italic">Meng Chay</span>, the appellant filed two magistrate’s appeals against sentences imposed upon him for being manifestly excessive. The appellant had been sentenced for multiple offences under s 73 of the Trade Marks Act (Cap 332, 1985 Rev Ed) and under s 73 of the Trade Marks Act (Cap 332, 1992 Rev Ed) (which, amongst other things, amended the penalties attached to contraventions of s 73). Before the magistrates, the appellant had been sentenced to:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) in relation to the first magistrate’s appeal, fines amounting to $24,000 (with 24 months’ imprisonment in default) and 32 months’ imprisonment; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) in relation to the second magistrate’s appeal, fines amounting to $66,600 (with 32 months and 23 days’ imprisonment in default).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The appellant was unable to pay the fines which amounted to $90,600, and therefore faced imprisonment for an aggregate period of seven years, four months and 23 days.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 On appeal, Yong Pung How CJ was of the view that in all the circumstances, this aggregate period was manifestly excessive, when s 73 (as amended) only provided for imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years (<span class="font-italic">Low </span><span class="font-italic">Meng Chay</span> at [8]). Yong CJ was of the view that to give effect to all the default sentences would offend the totality principle and thus considered what the proper sentence should be (<span class="font-italic">Low </span><span class="font-italic">Meng Chay</span> at [12]). It was against this backdrop that Yong CJ stated: “[w]hen it is unambiguously clear that a defendant cannot pay a fine … the fine should not be imposed even though the court would have preferred to impose a fine rather than a short term of imprisonment” (<span class="font-italic">Low </span><span class="font-italic">Meng Chay</span> at [13]). Consequently, Yong CJ allowed both the appellant’s appeals and sentenced him to:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) in relation to the first magistrate’s appeal, a total of 12 months’ imprisonment; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) in relation to the second magistrate’s appeal, a total of 21 months’ imprisonment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Accordingly, this meant that the appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for an aggregate period of two years and nine months.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 The primary concern in <span class="font-italic">Low </span><span class="font-italic">Meng Chay</span> appeared to be that the appellant faced a manifestly excessive period of incarceration when all the default sentences (for not paying the fines) were given effect to. Therefore, I doubt that <span class="font-italic">Low </span><span class="font-italic">Meng Chay</span> stands for a <span class="font-italic">general</span> proposition that so long as an individual cannot pay a fine, the court should impose upon him a custodial sentence instead. The nature of a custodial sentence is different from that of a fine, and as mentioned, a custodial sentence of a few days may be perceived as being more severe than a $2,000 fine (for most).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 In any case, even if the holding in <span class="font-italic">Low </span><span class="font-italic">Meng Chay</span> were that a fine should not be imposed upon an individual who is unable to pay one, this would not assist Tan. Tan did not submit that he would be unable to pay a fine if one were imposed upon him. Further, nowhere in <span class="font-italic">Low </span><span class="font-italic">Meng Chay</span> do I find support for the wide proposition which Tan contended, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that courts have imposed upon an offender a custodial sentence just because a fine would be “unusually harsh and thus unjust” given his particular circumstances (see [78] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 As for the District Court case of <span class="font-italic">Amzad</span><span class="font-italic"> Hossen Shajidul Haque</span>, the District Court stated that for being concerned in loading duty unpaid tobacco, the accused would have to be sentenced to a fine in the range of $29,022.45 to $38,696.60 or an imprisonment term up to three years or both (at [9]). The District Court then considered, at [11], the High Court case of <span class="font-italic">Yap Ah Lai v Public Prosecutor</span> [2014] 3 SLR 180 (“<span class="font-italic">Yap Ah Lai</span>”) at [46], which had held that having regard to the “legislative intent” for the relevant offence and “the very heavy fines that are mandated”, a custodial sentence will generally be imposed unless there is reason to believe that the offender can pay the fines. The District Court thus imposed a custodial sentence upon the accused in its case because he had no means to pay the fine (<span class="font-italic">Amzad</span><span class="font-italic"> Hossen Shajidul Haque</span> at [13]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 <span class="font-italic">Yap Ah Lai</span> was a case where the offender was concerned in importing uncustomed goods and thus guilty of offences under s 128F of the Customs Act (Cap 70, 2004 Rev Ed). In view of the very heavy fines mandated, Menon CJ took into account the fact that the offender was unlikely to be able to pay the fines. Accordingly, he was of the view at [18] that it would generally be inappropriate to impose a fine, with imprisonment in default, if the effect of this would be to punish those who are genuinely unable to pay. Hence, reference to the level of fines prescribed for these offences can only be of limited value in calibrating the appropriate sentence of imprisonment where imprisonment is the primary sentence instead of a fine.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 As with <span class="font-italic">Low </span><span class="font-italic">Meng Chay</span>, <span class="font-italic">Amzad</span><span class="font-italic"> Hossen Shajidul Haque</span> and <span class="font-italic">Yap Ah Lai</span> do not assist Tan where he did not submit that he would be unable to pay a fine if one were imposed upon him. Again, nowhere in <span class="font-italic">Amzad</span><span class="font-italic"> Hossen Shajidul Haque</span> or in <span class="font-italic">Yap Ah Lai</span> do I find support for the wide proposition which Tan contended, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that courts have imposed upon an offender a custodial sentence just because a fine would be “unusually harsh and thus unjust” given his particular circumstances.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 In this case, the custodial threshold is not crossed in the case of Tan, whose sentence should be similar to Wham’s (see [96] above). Therefore, in my view, a sentence of a fine of $5,000, with one week’s imprisonment in default, would be appropriate for Tan for the offence of scandalising contempt under s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Act in the circumstances. The fine is to be paid within eight days from and including the date of this judgment.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Notice to apologise</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 As in the case in relation to Wham, I do not think that it is necessary in the circumstances of this case to make an order that Tan publish a notice to apologise for his post pursuant to s 12(3) of the Act. Given that I find it unnecessary to order Tan to publish a notice to apologise, there is also no further question of imposing conditions in respect of the order.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Removal of Tan’s post</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 The question of ordering Tan to remove his post from his Facebook profile is academic since he has removed it.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 In the circumstances, I sentence Wham to a fine of $5,000, with one week’s imprisonment in default. The fine is to be paid within eight days from and including the date of this judgment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 I also sentence Tan to a fine of $5,000, with one week’s imprisonment in default. The fine is also to be paid within eight days from and including the date of this judgment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 On the issue of costs, the AG sought against Wham costs of $8,000 and disbursements of $2,297.82, and sought against Tan costs of $5,000 and disbursements of $1,966.39, on the basis that some of the work overlapped but more work was done for the proceedings against Wham.
