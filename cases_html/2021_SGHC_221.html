</div> he was approached by the Plaintiff in Hong Kong in or about September 2018 and asked how the Plaintiff could raise cash on an urgent basis using the ML shares.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 Ding suggested that one option would be for the Plaintiff to engage in margin financing by pledging the ML shares to a securities company and drawing cash based on a percentage of the market value of the pledged ML shares. Ding also informed the Plaintiff that a margin financing account with a securities company can be operated easily online and trading could be done, using a login code and a password.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 However, Ding told the Plaintiff that there was a drawback on margin financing from securities companies in Hong Kong. It was usually not available to foreigners. Ding advised the Plaintiff that a bank account also needed to be opened in the name of the margin account holder, who would have to pre-sign cheques to enable the Plaintiff to withdraw funds from the bank account. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 The Plaintiff inquired if Ding could assist him to find a trustworthy Hong Kong local or a Chinese national, who could hold some of the ML shares for him. However, the Plaintiff would operate and control the margin account himself.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 In the course of their discussions, Ding learnt that the Plaintiff was indebted to various creditors and had also furnished personal guarantees to banks in Singapore that had extended loans to his companies in Singapore. One such personal guarantee was for about S$50m for loan facilities extended to MEP Logistics Pte Ltd (“MEP”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 Subsequently, the Plaintiff told Ding he needed someone to hold 300m of the ML shares (“the 300m shares”) for him. Around 20 September 2018, Ding contacted the Defendant and inquired if she could oblige the Plaintiff. Out of goodwill as the Plaintiff was her former employer, the Defendant agreed. As the ML shares would only be held by the Defendant on the Plaintiff’s behalf, it was agreed that no payment would be made by the Defendant to the Plaintiff for the 300m shares. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 Accordingly, the Defendant signed all the requisite forms and the 300m shares were transferred to her. The Defendant also opened a bank account with HSBC (“the HSBC account”) as required by the Plaintiff.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 On Ding’s recommendation, the Plaintiff opened an account with Grand China Securities Ltd (“Grand China”) to hold the 300m shares and for margin trading, based on the 300m shares as collateral. Ding was not involved with the account opening process at Grand China, which arrangements were made by the Plaintiff himself, although it was Ding who put the parties in touch.

</div> the Plaintiff alleged that he flew to Hong Kong with his wife on or about 21 September 2018. There, Ding obtained blank documents addressed to various securities companies in Hong Kong and asked him to sign them; those companies included Grand China. The Plaintiff added that Ding then arranged for him to meet the representative of the securities companies and for him (and his wife) to open a bank account with the Bank of China (“the Bank of China account”) so that sale proceeds of the ML shares that he sold could be deposited into the account.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 Subsequently, on or about 2 November 2018, when the Defendant was in Hong Kong, Ding deposed that he received a telephone call from the Plaintiff’s wife who requested that Ding contact the Defendant to remit S$200,000 from the HSBC account to Singapore as the Plaintiff needed money urgently.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 Ding did contact the Defendant and inquired if she could effect the remittance requested by the Plaintiff.

</div> by which the Defendant could hold shares on the Plaintiff’s behalf. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Ding confirmed that the <span class="font-italic">modus operandi</span> as regards bank accounts for margin financing purposes was to have the person who opened the margin account and related bank account to relinquish all rights and control over the margin and bank accounts in favour of the beneficial owner by signing standing letters of authority, settlement instruction forms listed at [33], pre-signing cheques and handing over bank tokens and login passwords for internet banking, to either the beneficial owner or his authorised representative or the securities company with which the margin account was opened.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Ding insisted that the 300m shares were held by the Defendant on behalf of the Plaintiff and she never bought those shares. He accused the Plaintiff of lying in contending otherwise. He was aware that the Defendant never traded on the ML shares. In fact, she had never purchased or traded in any shares. Ding denied he told the Plaintiff to go after the buyer of his shares when the Plaintiff allegedly chased him for payment. He said he could not, as the Defendant is his sister-in-law and in trying to help the Plaintiff, he got her into trouble.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Ding also denied that Ming Lam is owned by his wife as a majority shareholder, contrary to what the Plaintiff claimed. His wife owned less than 20% of Ming Lam’s shares and does not control Ming Lam. Ding alleged that when Ming Lam bought over MEPPL, the Plaintiff hid a lot of his own debts from Ming Lam. The Plaintiff had by then defaulted on the UOB loan and could not even afford to pay the interest. That was why the Plaintiff was in a hurry to transfer that debt to someone else. The court was therefore sceptical of the Plaintiff’s claim that he sold off MEPPL as it had a lot of assets (see above at [29]). It seems more likely than not that the company was debt-ridden. A shareholder of a company which is asset rich is highly unlikely to want to get rid of it as the Plaintiff did in regard to MEPPL.   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> The issue(s)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The only issue the court has to decide in this case is, did the Plaintiff sell 300m of the ML shares to the Defendant as he alleges or, did she merely hold the shares on his behalf as she and Ding contend?  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The findings </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 It was very telling that during cross-examination, the Plaintiff disclosed he no longer held the balance 680m of the ML shares after allegedly selling 300m to the Defendant.

</div> The <span class="font-italic">gravamen </span>of the Plaintiff’s case was that he sold 300m of the ML shares to the Defendant and he denied she was holding the said shares on his behalf. Yet this statement showed that after her alleged purchase of the 300m shares, the Defendant periodically delivered blocks of the ML shares ranging from 34.32m to 50m. No doubt those ML shares were delivered by Grand China for sales made for the Plaintiff, pursuant to the authorisation documents the Defendant had signed at the time the margin account was opened.     </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Further, there were repeated fund withdrawals according to the statement of account coupled with substantial amounts such as HKD 2.9m and HKD 2.47m being deposited into the HSBC account in October 2018

Even more significant was the fact that the last traded price of ML shares on 19 November 2018 was HKD 0.041824, a drastic drop of HKD 0.208 from its previous price of HKD 0.25 on 7 November 2018. These entries corroborated the version of facts put forward by the Defendant and Ding. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The court finds that the Defendant’s account with Grand China was opened on behalf of the Plaintiff and it was a margin trading account. The Plaintiff had pledged the ML shares to Grand China and when he could not pay and/or top up the account with cash when the price of ML shares fell, Grand China liquidated all his remaining shares that it held. That explained why the Plaintiff as he testified, revealed that all his ML shares were sold but he did not know at what price nor did he receive the sale proceeds (see above at [46]). The shares had been force-sold by Grand China leaving an outstanding debit balance of HKD 618,302.41 that with interest amounted to HKD 624,400.81, which Grand China was claiming from the Defendant as the nominal account holder. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Foolish and clueless as the Defendant was, the court found her to be an honest witness.
