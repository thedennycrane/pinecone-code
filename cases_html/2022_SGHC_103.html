SI Eugene invited the accused to make any alterations to the Contemporaneous Statement, but the accused declined. SI Eugene then wrote an acknowledgment clause at the end of the Contemporaneous Statement and read it to the accused in Mandarin. The accused appended his signature at the end of each page and below the acknowledgment clause. SI Eugene also signed below the acknowledgment clause.

</div> I observe that there is a minor discrepancy between SI Tay’s testimony and his conditioned statement as to the time at which he (and other CNB officers) escorted the accused out of the CNB “A” office. SI Tay’s testimony indicates that he was in the CNB “A” office until 3.50am before he (and other CNB officers) escorted the accused to the Exhibit Management Room.

</div>
</div>
</div> Nevertheless, conditioned statements are admissible to the same extent and carry the same effect as oral evidence. As it is implicit under s 62(1) of the Evidence Act 1893 (2020 Rev Ed) that oral evidence must be the witness’s own, this same principle must equally apply to conditioned statements.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 In the present case, whether a conditioned statement contains that CNB officer’s own evidence would depend on whether<span class="font-italic"> </span>that conditioned statement reflects the CNB officer’s own account of events. Having another officer prepare or review the CNB officer’s conditioned statement, as stated at [33(b)] above, is not an objectionable practice <span class="font-italic">in itself</span>. It only becomes objectionable if the conditioned statement departs from the CNB officer’s own account of events. Accordingly, I am unable to accept the Defence’s submission that allowing a third party to prepare or review a witness’s conditioned statement would be akin to training or coaching the witness as to what evidence to give. This sweeping proposition is not supported by any principle or logic. Much would depend on whether the resulting conditioned statement still reflects that CNB officer’s own account of events. As acknowledged by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Ernest Ferdinand</span> at [134], whether the evidence is the witness’s own is a <span class="font-italic">fact-s</span><span class="font-italic">pecific inquiry</span>. For the same reason, it is not appropriate to lay down any hard and fast rule that unless the witness provides a cogent explanation as to why a third party prepared or reviewed his conditioned statement, and what steps were taken to avoid influencing the witness’s evidence, the evidence in the conditioned statement is contaminated, as advocated for by the Defence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 As for the consequence of a breach of the <span class="font-italic">Momodou</span> Principles and the Modified <span class="font-italic">Momodou</span> Principles, I am unable to accept the Defence’s contention that such a breach should affect the admissibility of the evidence and not its weight. This sits at odds with the holding of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Ernest Ferdinand</span> at [136]–[137], which contemplates the converse:</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">136 … The line that must not be crossed is this: the witness’s evidence must remain his own.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">137 From this simple principle, at least three rules follow, <span class="font-italic">the breach of which </span>may <span class="font-italic">– depending on all the circumstances – lead the court to accord </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">less weight (or even no weight)</span><span class="font-italic"> to the resulting testimony.</span></div><div class="txt-body text-justify">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics; emphasis in original omitted]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Hence, the Court of Appeal indicates that a breach of the Modified <span class="font-italic">Momodou</span> Principles will affect the <span class="font-italic">weight</span> of the evidence, instead of its admissibility. This is reinforced by the fact that the possibility of ascribing no weight to the evidence is expressly canvassed in lieu of excluding the evidence altogether.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 The Defence’s submission that contaminated evidence should be rendered inadmissible altogether rests on Lord Mackay’s decision in <span class="font-italic">R v H</span>. However, that decision does not assist the Defence. In that case, the accused was charged with sexual offences against two girls living with him in the same house. It was accepted that there was a risk that both girls had colluded to make false allegations against the accused. Against these facts, Lord Mackay was concerned with two legal issues. The first was whether evidence could be admitted as similar fact evidence, and secondly, <span class="font-italic">supposing the evidence was admissible</span>, whether it could be used as corroboration of the evidence of the witnesses supporting the allegation in issue, having regard to the admitted risk of collusion (<span class="font-italic">R v H</span> at 603). Lord Mackay held that collusion is generally not relevant at the stage of deciding whether to exclude evidence on the ground that it does not qualify as similar fact evidence. In relation to the second question, he held that if similar fact evidence has been admitted, but no reasonable jury could accept the evidence as free from collusion, the judge should direct the jury that it cannot be relied upon as corroboration. Where this is not so but the question of collusion has been raised, the judge must draw the importance of collusion to the attention of the jury and leave it to them to decide whether such evidence can be relied upon as free from collusion and tell them that if they are not so satisfied they cannot rely on it as corroboration (<span class="font-italic">R v H</span> at 612). Leaving aside the question of the relevance of <span class="font-italic">R v H</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>as neither the issue of admissibility of similar fact evidence nor the issue of corroboration is engaged, the broad proposition relied upon by the Defence, that evidence that is <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">contaminated</span> and shown to be <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">unreliable</span> is susceptible to be excluded, does not assist the Defence in its attempt to raise a reasonable doubt in the Prosecution’s case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 This is because the conditioned statements of SI Tay, SSgt Low and ASP Yang were, in the first place, not contaminated within the meaning of the <span class="font-italic">Momodou</span> Principles and the Modified <span class="font-italic">Momodou</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>Principles. In other words, their conditioned statements contained their own account of events.

</div> these matters are not being relied upon by the Prosecution to establish the chain of custody. The same goes for parts of the evidence given by SI Eugene, SI Alwin, Sgt Fauzi, Sgt Hidayat, SSgt Au Yong, SSgt Nurshila, SSSgt Fardlie and Insp Nur Yusyeila which are not within their respective personal knowledge and which are based on their personal assumptions. There is thus no need to take into account these affected parts in the evidential analysis.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 As I have shown at [23] above, all the evidence relied upon to build the chain of custody is squarely in the respective CNB officers’ personal knowledge. The affected pieces of evidence at [44] above do not impact on the Prosecution’s ability to establish an unbroken chain of custody. Hence, despite the Defence’s strenuous effort in advancing its submissions set out at [25(a)] and [25(b)] above, I am unable to accept that they raise a reasonable doubt in the chain of custody.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 I now consider the Defence’s submission set out at [25(c)] above. Here, the Defence raised several concerns regarding the seizure and handling of the drug exhibits, none of which are sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt in the chain of custody of the Drugs. One of these concerns is the presence of alleged inconsistencies in the CNB officers’ statements and testimonies as to whether SI Eugene and SSgt Low were present in the accused’s bedroom at the time of search and seizure.

</div> nothing turns on this point. Even if there are indeed inconsistencies on this point, they do not impugn the integrity of the chain of custody as set out by the Prosecution.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 The Defence also raises the concern that SSgt Low’s claim that he checked the seized exhibits against the field diary together with SI Alwin remains uncorroborated by other CNB officers who were present in the accused’s bedroom at the material time.

</div> However, corroborative evidence is unnecessary especially given the absence of evidence undermining the veracity of SSgt Low’s claim. SI Alwin, who assisted Sgt Hidayat in packing and sealing the exhibits seized from the accused’s bedroom, was silent as to whether he and SSgt Low checked the items against the field diary. Sgt Hidayat could not remember if SSgt Low was in the accused’s bedroom during the search and also could not remember who was holding on to the field diary.

</div> but this is insufficient to cast doubt on SSgt Low’s claim since SI Eugene was in the accused’s bedroom only for pockets of time.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 In any event, I agree with the Prosecution that even if the CNB officers did not check the drug exhibits against the field diary, this would be insufficient to raise a reasonable doubt in the chain of custody. This is because the movement of the drug exhibits is still well-accounted for: there is sufficient evidence proving that after the exhibits seized from the accused’s bedroom were packed and sealed into Tamper-Proof Bags, the seized exhibits were packed into the black duffel bag, and SI Alwin handed the black duffel bag containing the seized exhibits to SI Eugene (see at [23(b)]–[23(d)] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 This brings me to the next point. In view of the evidence at [23(c)] above, the Defence’s claim that no one could attest to what happened between the time after the Tamper-Proof Bags were sealed and the time that the Tamper-Proof Bags were allegedly put into the black duffel bag,

</div> is not correct. On a related note, the Defence also alleges that after SI Eugene took over the black duffel bag, no one had personal knowledge as to what the items inside that bag were.
                   <sup><button class="btn btn-link superscript-btn" data-target="#fn-a4f40bf0-b6c9-40f6-a7cb-3c84cdd7cf31" data-toggle="modal" type="button">110</button></sup>

</div> This allegation is equally meritless in attempting to raise a reasonable doubt in the chain of custody. What is important is that after SI Alwin handed over the black duffel bag to SI Eugene, and before SI Tay handed over the seized exhibits one by one to ASP Yang at the Exhibit Management Room, there is no evidence that any of the seized exhibits were removed from the black duffel bag, except when SI Eugene took out five black packets (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, exhibits D5 to D9) when recording the accused’s Contemporaneous Statement. Even then, SI Eugene placed those exhibits back into the black duffel bag after the Contemporaneous Statement was recorded.

</div> I set out the evidence of Insp Nur Yusyeila and Officer Yee below and explain why this discrepancy alleged by the Defence is illusory:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Insp Nur Yusyeila’s testimony is that she did not check the exhibits against the field diary or the police report filed by Sgt Fauzi.

</div> This does not support but neither does it contradict ASP Yang’s testimony that he cross-checked the exhibits against the police report. In this connection, the Defence makes the point that Insp Nur Yusyeila did not cross-check against any list even though Sgt Fauzi said that the officer assisting the Investigation Officer (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, ASP Yang) would do so together with the Investigation Officer.

</div> However, SI Tay’s evidence is silent as to whether he cross-checked the exhibits against the police report before passing them to ASP Yang. SI Alwin, SSgt Nurshila and Sergeant Syazwan Bin Daud Mohamed were also present in the Exhibit Management Room at the material time and witnessed SI Tay handing over the exhibits to ASP Yang, but they did not expressly mention that SI Tay cross-checked the exhibits against the police report before passing them to ASP Yang.

</div> In any event, even if I accept Officer Yee’s evidence that the “arresting officer”, which in the circumstances must have been a reference to SI Tay, cross-checked the exhibits against the police report before passing all the exhibits to ASP Yang, her evidence still does not undermine ASP Yang’s evidence, as ASP Yang did not claim that he was the <span class="font-italic">only</span> one who cross-checked the exhibits against the police report filed by Sgt Fauzi. In fact, Officer Yee’s evidence is compatible with Sgt Fauzi’s evidence that it would be the Investigation Officer “and the official [who] hand over the items to the [Investigation Officer]” who would do the cross-checking.

</div> Hence, it is plausible that both the “arresting officer” and ASP Yang cross-checked the exhibits against the police report. In any event, it is sufficient for ASP Yang alone to have cross-checked the exhibits against the police report.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Lastly, the Defence urges this court to infer that Officer Yee did not adhere to protocol and, as a result, to exclude exhibit D7B from the Charge, on the basis that her DNA was found on the exterior of exhibit D7B.

</div> As noted by the expert witness, Ms Tang Sheau Wei June, there are a few plausible explanations for why Officer Yee’s DNA was found on the exterior of exhibit D7B: (a) she had come into direct contact with exhibit D7B, (b) she had talked, coughed or sneezed nearby, or (c) she had previously touched another person’s hand and that person transferred her DNA onto exhibit D7B.

</div> The Defence claims that Q4 supports the accused’s version because it referred to the action of keeping without mentioning the action of passing things to another person. This claim was put to SI Eugene, who disagreed.

</div>
</div> Clearly, what was put to the accused at Q4 is an equivocal piece of evidence in so far as determining what the accused said at A3 is concerned. It is equally plausible that SI Eugene chose to focus only on what Alan had asked the accused to “keep”, notwithstanding that the accused’s previous response also mentioned that Alan would ask him to “pass” things to others. Indeed, even on the version advocated for by the Defence, SI Eugene could have focused only on the action of keeping in Q4 even though the accused had earlier mentioned that Alan’s men would “take [the things] from [him]”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Next, at Q12 of the Contemporaneous Statement, SI Eugene asked the accused whether he knew who would “come and collect”.

</div> Latching onto SI Eugene’s use of the word “collect” in Q12, the Defence put to SI Eugene that the accused must have used the word “collect” in his response at A3 (thus implying that A3, as reflected in the Contemporaneous Statement, was wrongly recorded). SI Eugene disagreed.

</div>
</div> Indeed, the use of the word “collect” in Q12 does not suggest that the accused must have used the word “collect” in A3. The accused’s answers at A10 and A11 (which were unchallenged) claimed that Alan had asked him to place things at the “6th and 7th floor staircase” and that he proceeded to place different plastic bags at the said location.

</div> It was thus natural for SI Eugene to follow-up with the question as recorded at Q12. Nothing in the Contemporaneous Statement indicates that the accused must have said what he now claims he said. On the face of the Contemporaneous Statement, there is also no indication that the accused could not have said what is recorded at A3. In these circumstances, there is no reason to doubt that SI Eugene had accurately recorded the accused’s answer at A3 of the Contemporaneous Statement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 I am similarly unconvinced that SI Eugene had not accurately recorded what the accused said at A17 of the Contemporaneous Statement. It is undisputed that after the Contemporaneous Statement was recorded, SI Eugene read the Contemporaneous Statement back to the accused in <span class="font-italic">Mandarin</span>, and the accused affirmed that the Contemporaneous Statement, as read back by SI Eugene in Mandarin, was true and correct. It is also undisputed that SI Eugene invited the accused to make any alterations to the Contemporaneous Statement but he declined.

</div> When given an opportunity to explain why he did not flag out to SI Eugene that his answer at A17 as recorded in the Contemporaneous Statement was different from what he told SI Eugene, the accused said that he was feeling uncomfortable and nervous, and did not know what was written as his answer because he answered the question in Mandarin.

</div>
</div> In my view, these are mere excuses which must be rejected. The accused claimed that he felt nervous because “many people rushed into [his] room suddenly and [he] did not know what had happened”. However, when the Prosecution pointed out to the accused during cross-examination that the Contemporaneous Statement was recorded at 11.05pm, which was nearly three hours after CNB officers gained entry into his home, the accused shifted his stance and claimed that he was nervous because between the time the CNB officers entered his room and the time his Contemporaneous Statement was recorded, “many things had happened”.

</div> The accused’s claim that he did not know what was written as his answer is also baseless. The accused knew what was recorded in the Contemporaneous Statement because SI Eugene read the Contemporaneous Statement back to the accused in <span class="font-italic">Mandarin</span>, and the accused <span class="font-italic">affirmed</span> that the Contemporaneous Statement, as read back by SI Eugene to the accused in Mandarin, was true and correct.

LE Wong was the Mandarin interpreter for the recording of the Long Statements. For all the Long Statements, ASP Yang asked the accused questions in English, and LE Wong interpreted the same to the accused in Mandarin. The accused answered in Mandarin, and LE Wong interpreted the same to ASP Yang in English.

</div> It also bears emphasising that for all the Long Statements, the accused accepts that LE Wong had interpreted and read back the statements to him in Mandarin. During this process, several amendments and corrections to typographical errors were made. Each amendment was explained to the accused in Mandarin, and when he was invited to make further amendments to his statements, he declined. The accused then signed at the bottom of each page of the Long Statements, and against each amendment.

The accused, on his own accord, decided to place the “grass” and “red wine” at “the 6th and 7th floor staircase” of the Block respectively. He then “placed a white colour plastic bag which contains many black packets of item” which he thought was “grass” at the 6th floor and a red plastic bag containing a black zip lock bag with “red wine” at the 7th floor.

To this end, the accused can show either that: (a) he believed he was in possession of something innocuous, even if he is unable to specify exactly what that was, or (b) he believed that he was in possession of some contraband item or drug other than the specific drug in his possession: <span class="font-italic">Gobi </span>at [59].

This conclusion is the result of the following reasons which, taken together, show that the accused did not believe that the Drugs in exhibits D4 to D9 were “ganja”:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The accused’s alleged belief that exhibits D4 to D9 contained “ganja” was raised late in the day and stood in sharp contrast with the positions he took in his statements. This not only reveals that the accused is a witness lacking in credit, but also indicates that this defence at trial was an afterthought.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The accused’s narrative of how he came to believe that the Drugs were “ganja” was improbable. I disbelieved the accused’s claim that Alan told him that the Drugs in exhibit D4 were “ganja”. Even if Alan did say so, it was implausible for the accused to believe Alan.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) The accused is not a witness of credit and his defence at trial was an afterthought</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 I begin with the first reason. The accused’s evidence as to what he knew about the contents of exhibits D4 to D9 as well as how he came to have such knowledge evolved over time. The general position he took in his statements was one of ignorance – he never opened exhibits D4 to D9, never looked at the Drugs, never asked Alan what was inside, and knew nothing about the specific nature of their contents. He <span class="font-italic">never </span>mentioned that he believed that exhibits D4 to D9 contained “ganja”. However, his position changed at trial: he claimed for the first time that he had looked at the Drugs and had formed the belief that they were “ganja” because this was what Alan told him after he asked Alan. This marked shift in the accused’s evidence and the absence of any credible explanation for this change show the accused’s lack of credit and renders his belated assertion at trial unbelievable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 I will first set out the accused’s conflicting positions in relation to the contents of exhibit D4, before proceeding to set out his similarly conflicting evidence in relation to the contents of exhibits D5 to D9.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(A) Accused’s evidence regarding the contents of exhibit D4</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 In the 2nd Long Statement, the accused alleged that he did not recognise what the brown substance in exhibits D4A1, D4C1, D4C2, D4B1A, D4B2A and D4C2A was. According to the accused, when he received the black packet marked D4, he did not open it up to see what was inside. Neither did he ask Alan what was inside exhibit D4.

Crucially, the accused was asked by ASP Yang whether he <span class="font-italic">knew</span> other names which were used to refer to “grass”. If Alan truly referred to “grass” as “hot one”, that would have been something squarely within the accused’s knowledge. But he did not mention this to ASP Yang.

</div> Given his understanding that “HOT” referred to “hot one” and “GU” referred to “grass”, it must have been clear to the accused that Alan did not refer to “grass” as “hot one”, and for the same reason, the accused could not have equated the two terms. As the Prosecution rightly contends,

On the accused’s own account at trial, Alan told the accused to take notes, so that if he subsequently asked the accused what the accused was keeping for him, the accused would be able to answer him.

That brings us back to the implausibility of the accused’s trust in Alan, and the lack of a countervailing explanation as to why the accused would readily accept Alan’s words at face value.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion on whether the accused rebutted the s 18(2) presumption</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 I am not convinced that the accused has rebutted the s 18(2) presumption on a balance of probabilities for the foregoing reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 For completeness, I make a few final remarks to address parties’ submissions. First, the Defence advances the argument that the Prosecution has not been able to prove that the accused knew that “hot one” referred to diamorphine.
                   <sup><button class="btn btn-link superscript-btn" data-target="#fn-0cb4339f-e635-45ad-b2dc-8ebdc49a6ba3" data-toggle="modal" type="button">327</button></sup>

</div>
</div> However, it is not necessary for the Prosecution to prove this. The Prosecution invokes the s 18(2) presumption, which places the burden of proof on the Defence to rebut that presumption on a balance of probabilities. One of the obstacles standing in the way of the Defence is the accused’s admission that he suspected that exhibits D5 to D9 contained “hot one” (see above at [131]). This contradicts the Defence’s case that the accused believed that the Drugs were “ganja”. To overcome this, and in an attempt to rebut the s 18(2) presumption, the Defence makes the submission that the accused believed that “hot one” referred to “grass”.

The accused has not provided any evidence showing that Alan was the person who originally deposited the Drugs with him. In fact, he testified that an unknown person, who was not Alan, would normally deposit the drugs for his collection. Given the accused’s account that he was supposed to pass the Drugs to another of Alan’s men, the accused was moving the Drugs along the chain of distribution – he took possession of the Drugs from an unknown person for the purpose of giving them to someone else whose identity he did not know.

The accused had agreed to receive illicit drugs from Alan on numerous occasions and had received a large variety of drugs of significant quantities. Instead of simply returning the drugs to Alan, the accused would assist in repacking the drugs if the packaging was torn. He was also paid for his assistance. Consequently, even if the accused was just “safekeeping” the drugs, he was a “professional bailee” who was an integral part of the process of moving the drugs towards the ultimate customer.

On the accused’s account of events (see above at [90]–[99]), Alan called him out of the blue six months after their first and only meeting to ask if he could keep his things at the accused’s place. The accused agreed, and helped Alan store his things on multiple occasions. What is baffling is that even after the accused found out that Alan had been sending him illicit drugs for storage, the accused continued to “help” Alan, someone whom he barely knew, keep drugs (including the Drugs) without any protest and for no payment notwithstanding that he was facing substantial financial difficulties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">160 In this connection, the accused had been unemployed for two years at the time of his arrest.
