        Quentin Loh J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       In <em>A-G v Shadrake
                        Alan</em> [2010] SGHC 327 (“the main judgment”), I
                    convicted the respondent, Mr Alan Shadrake, of the contempt of scandalising
                    the judiciary through his book, <em>Once a Jolly Hangman:
                        Singapore Justice in the Dock</em> (“the book”). I then
                    gave parties one week to consider my judgment and, in the case of
                    Mr Shadrake, to consider whether he wished to make amends for his contempt.
                    One week later I heard counsel on sentence and reserved judgment, which I now
                    give. For convenience I have adopted the abbreviations used in the main
                    judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       In the main judgment I confined myself to the
                    minimum finding necessary to dispose of the issue of liability. I found that
                    when read in context, eleven statements in the book written by Mr Shadrake,
                    which is or was circulated in Singapore, posed more than a remote possibility of
                    undermining public confidence in the administration of justice in Singapore. I
                    found also that the statements fell outside the ambit of fair criticism because
                    they had been made in bad faith and/or without rational basis. I did not say
                    more on the magnitude of the risk posed. That went to sentencing, and I did not
                    address the issue in order that Mr Shadrake would have the maximum latitude
                    to make amends for his contempt. I pointed out the possibility of making amends
                    at [138] of the main judgment and when I delivered a summarised version of the
                    main judgment in open court. As the case law indicates, this could be done by
                    Mr Shadrake apologising sincerely and unequivocally to the court, and by
                    him doing all that is within his power to withdraw the offending publication (or
                    the offending parts thereof) from circulation. I should state for the record
                    that, had Mr Shadrake made appropriate amends for his contempt, he would
                    have been dealt with very differently.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Regrettably, while Mr Shadrake certainly
                    appears to have been busy in the meantime, his efforts seem to have been in the
                    opposite direction. During the hearing on sentence, Ms Subramanian for the
                    Attorney-General tendered an online article published by the Guardian newspaper
                    on 7 November 2010 (“the Guardian article”). The Guardian article
                    was based on an interview with Mr Shadrake, made after I gave the main
                    judgment and after he had had a chance to review my reasons for finding him in
                    contempt for eleven out of the fourteen statements impugned by the
                    Attorney-General. Among other things Mr Shadrake insisted in the interview
                    that the book was “devastatingly accurate” and declared that:
                    "This story is never going away. I'll keep it on the boil for as long as I live.
                    They're going to regret they ever started this." In its entirety, the Guardian
                    article read as follows (with emphasis added in bold for the title and the
                    passages relied upon by Ms Subramanian):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Alan Shadrake faces Singapore jail term for criticising
                            use of death penalty</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Contempt of court conviction for British author whose
                            book fiercely criticises Singaporean justice system</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">When his head hit the pillow in his Singapore hotel room in the early
                        hours of 18 July, Alan Shadrake must have believed his gamble had paid
                        off.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Earlier that day, the British author had attended the
                            launch of his controversial book, in which he accused Singapore's
                            judiciary of bowing to outside pressure and applying double standards in
                            its application of the death penalty</b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>He knew that the authorities did not like what he had
                            to say</b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>While wealthy – often well-connected foreigners
                            – can expect leniency, he argued in Once the Jolly Hangman:
                            Singapore's Justice in the Dock, the poor and disenfranchised are
                            summarily executed</b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">But at dawn he was woken by the arrival of three police officers who
                        ransacked his room before taking him away for questioning.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Two days of interrogations later, Shadrake was released on bail, minus his
                        confiscated passport, fearing he, too, was about to feel the full force of
                        the same unforgiving criminal justice system he had lambasted in print.
                        "They used shock and awe tactics in an attempt to terrify me into
                        submission."</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Last week the 76-year-old was convicted of contempt of court, for which he
                        could spend up to six months in Singapore's Changi prison, when the high
                        court sentences him this week. He also faces separate charges of criminal
                        defamation, which carries a maximum penalty of two years in prison and a
                        hefty fine. Shadrake's crime was to challenge the enthusiastic use of the
                        death penalty in a country notoriously intolerant of dissent. <b>Drawing on interviews with a retired chief executioner,
                            lawyers, former police officers and human rights activists, his central
                            claim is that justice in one of the world's most advanced economies is
                            anything but blind. He highlights several inconsistent applications of
                            the law which, he says, prove Singapore's judiciary "picks and chooses
                            how they respond depending on the state's diplomatic and economic
                            interests"</b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In handing down the guilty verdict, the judge, Quentin Loh, said Shadrake
                        had "scandalised" the judiciary through "a dissembling and selective
                        background of truths and half-truths, and sometimes outright
                        falsehoods".</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>He offered the prolific British author the chance to
                            "make amends", but Shadrake was unrepentant. "They are effectively
                            asking me to apologise, but I have done nothing wrong and I have no
                            amends to make," he said. "It's utter nonsense - I haven't scandalised
                            anyone. "I'm not going to run away or back down. If they want to jail
                            me, then so be it."</b> Past experience suggests that Shadrake
                        should have taken the advice of the British high commission in Singapore and
                        excused himself from the book launch.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The country's elder statesman, Lee Kuan Yew, whose son is now prime
                        minister, has frequently used strict anti-defamation laws to crush dissent
                        and punish foreign journalists.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A Wall Street Journal editor was fined $10,000 last year for publishing
                        articles deemed to have shown contempt for Singapore's judiciary, while
                        three local activists were sentenced to short prison terms for wearing
                        T-shirts illustrated with a kangaroo dressed as a judge. Shadrake's
                        conviction has thrown into sharp relief the contradiction at the heart of
                        Singapore's rise from colonial backwater to economic powerhouse: that the
                        gains that have given its people the highest living standards in Asia since
                        it declared independence from Britain in 1963, co-exist with an unapologetic
                        contempt for freedoms taken for granted in other developed Asian
                        economies.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The government is also highly sensitive to attacks on its draconian
                        attitude towards serious crime. According to Amnesty International,
                        Singapore, a country of nearly 5 million, has the highest per capita rate of
                        executions in the world, having put more than 420 people to death since
                        1991.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In a 2004 report, Amnesty said the death penalty was disproportionately
                        used against migrant workers, drug addicts and poorer people.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">"Singapore's drug laws flout global fair-trial standards by shifting the
                        burden of proof to suspects," says Lance Lattig, a researcher on Singapore
                        for Amnesty in London. "A drug trafficking suspect faces hanging unless he
                        can manage to prove his innocence. If the Singapore government has issues
                        with Shadrake's book, it should address his arguments directly, not threaten
                        him with prison."</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Shadrake has admitted one minor inaccuracy in his book,
                            but insists the rest of the material is "devastatingly accurate"."They
                            know the book is accurate, which is why they're going to all this
                            trouble," he said</b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As he waits to learn his fate, the former Fleet Street journalist, who
                        arrived in Singapore in 2002 to write travel articles for the local tourist
                        board, admits to fantasising about swimming along the causeway and over the
                        border to Malaysia, visible from his hotel room.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>But he has no intention of fleeing: "I am prepared to
                            go to jail: if I apologise, or try to abscond, it means I lied, that I
                            got my facts wrong."</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">With his client's biggest day in court only days away, Ravi is concerned
                        about the toll the trial is taking on Shadrake's health. He suffers from
                        high blood pressure and an irregular heartbeat, and in August he spent two
                        days in hospital after a longstanding colonic complaint caused internal
                        bleeding.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Shadrake, meanwhile, insists he is in good spirits,
                            even managing to belt out a defiant karaoke version of "My Way" on the
                            night of his conviction</b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">And while the British high commission in Singapore has offered only "words
                        of comfort" since his arrest, he says he has received countless messages of
                        support from ordinary Singaporeans. <b>"The authorities
                            overreacted without thinking through the consequences and the
                            anti-Singapore hysteria that followed," he said. "And that is growing
                            all the time."</b></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Shadrake refuses to reveal how he will respond if he is
                            sent to prison this week, saying only that he has several back-up plans
                            in place: "This story is never going away. I'll keep it on the boil for
                            as long as I live. They're going to regret they ever started
                            this."</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-1">When I sought clarification on the accuracy of the Guardian article,
                    Mr Shadrake confirmed through his counsel, Mr Ravi, that it accurately
                    reported what he had said. Mr Ravi also made express what was implied in
                    Mr Shadrake’s interview with the Guardian: Mr Shadrake was going
                    to publish a second edition of the book, with new chapters. A clearer intent to
                    repeat his contempt there cannot be.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Mr Ravi informed me that Mr Shadrake
                    would apologise if the sensitivities of the judiciary had been offended, and
                    that Mr Shadrake never had the intention of undermining the judiciary. In
                    his reply he confirmed this. I am unable to accept this as having any mitigating
                    value. I had explained very clearly at [53] of the main judgment that the law is
                    not concerned with the personal sensibilities of judges. It is concerned with
                    the actual or potential effect on public confidence in the administration of
                    justice. In proposing to apologise if the sensitivities of the judiciary had
                    been offended, Mr Shadrake showed that he is completely oblivious to what I
                    have said in the main judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       It was against this regrettable background that
                    I considered the parties’ submissions. Mr Ravi’s written
                    submissions argued for a financial penalty to be imposed but during the hearing
                    he submitted that a censure would be quite sufficient. Ms Subramanian submitted
                    for a minimum sentence of 12 weeks’ imprisonment. As I observed when
                    reserving judgment, these two positions were quite far apart.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The case law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       I first consider the several cases cited in
                    argument, beginning with the local cases. Ms Subramanian relied on three cases
                    for the relevant sentencing principles.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The first case is <em>AG v Chee
                        Soon Juan</em> [2006] 2 SLR(R) 650 (“<em>Chee Soon Juan</em>”), where Lai J remarked that
                    fines would no longer be the norm for the offence of scandalising the court.
                    That case involved a statement that the Singapore judiciary was biased and
                    unfair and acted at the instance of the government in cases involving opposition
                    politicians. The statement was read aloud during court proceedings and then
                    circulated to the media and other entities. In deciding on sentence, Lai J
                    observed that the offence of scandalising the court had hitherto been punished
                    with fines only, but went on to observe that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">59     It appeared at first sight that the
                        present offences of contempt <em>in facie curiae</em>
                        by insulting the Judiciary as a whole before AR Low, and of contempt by
                        scandalising the court, warranted a fine rather than a term of imprisonment.
                        However, the present case can also be distinguished from all previous cases
                        in which fines were imposed for acts scandalising the court. None of those
                        cases involved situations where the contemptuous statements were actually
                        read <em>before</em> the court. This factor, coupled
                        with the unfounded allegations made against the Judiciary, clearly rendered
                        the acts of the Respondent as "conduct calculated to lower the authority of
                        the court" which amounted to "sheer, unmitigated contempt" sufficient to
                        warrant a sentence of imprisonment: (<em>per</em> Yong
                        CJ in <em>Re Tan Khee Eng John</em> ([27] <em>supra</em>) at [14]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">60     The Respondent's conduct leading up to the
                        present proceedings was clearly reprehensible. In addition, he was not
                        contrite nor did he make any attempt to withdraw his offending remarks.
                        Instead, he repeatedly maintained that he spoke the truth. As the SSG had
                        submitted, a jail sentence was necessary so as to deter the Respondent from
                        repeating, and like-minded persons from committing, similar acts in
                        future.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">61     For the reasons stated, I decided to and
                        did impose a jail sentence of one day on the Respondent. It was to serve as
                        a warning to others who chose to go down the Respondent's path that,
                        henceforth, similar offenders can expect to be incarcerated and perhaps
                        fined as well and, if the circumstances warranted it, sent to jail for
                        longer periods too. Fines as the penalty for contempt of court of this
                        nature will no longer be the norm.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As Mr Ravi pointed out, it appears from the passages cited that
                    Lai J’s dictum that fines will no longer be the norm must be read in
                    the light of the learned judge’s finding that <em>Chee Soon
                        Juan</em> differed from previous cases in that the contempt was
                    committed (partly) in the face of the court. Lai J’s dictum was also
                    made with reference to recalcitrant offenders.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The second case is <em>AG v
                        Hertzberg</em> [2009] 1 SLR(R) 1103 (“<em>Hertzberg</em>”), where Tay J expounded the
                    relevant sentencing principles as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">57     The AG submitted that in
                        assessing the proper sanction to be imposed on the third respondent, the
                        following principles of sentencing would apply in the instant case:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">... denunciation (to drive home the point that such behaviour is
                            unacceptable), specific deterrence (to prevent a recurrence of such
                            behaviour) and general deterrence (to signal to others that such
                            behaviour will be dealt with severely).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The AG pointed out that the third respondent is a repeat offender, having
                        been fined $6,000 in <em>Zimmerman</em> (<a href="#p1_13">[13]</a> <em>supra</em>) and $4,000 in <em>Wain</em> (<a href="#p1_13">[13]</a> <em>supra</em>). The AG, suggesting that the previous
                        fines were derisory in amount, submitted that a substantial fine, one that
                        is sufficient to hurt but not to cripple, should be imposed.
                        Mr Jeyaretnam, on the other hand, pointed out that our courts have been
                        imposing fines in the region of a few thousand dollars with the highest
                        amount ever awarded for the present form of contempt of court being $10,000
                        in <em>Lingle</em> (<a href="#p1_21">[21]</a> <em>supra</em>) at [64])[<em>sic</em>]. He submitted that if the third respondent was found
                        liable for contempt of court, the fine imposed should not depart from the
                        existing scale as laid down in the earlier cases. Anything more, he argued,
                        would have an unnecessary "chilling effect" on speech and would not be
                        needed to vindicate the honour and reputation of the courts.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">58     I agree that the general sentencing
                        principles referred to above are appropriate in determining the appropriate
                        punishment for the criminal forms of contempt of court such as the present
                        one of "scandalising the court" in the instant case. The factors that the
                        court should have regard to in deciding the appropriate punishment are the
                        nature of the contempt, who the contemnor is, the degree of his culpability,
                        how the contempt was published, the kind of publication and the extent of
                        the publication (see <em>Zimmerman</em> at [50]). Other
                        relevant considerations would be whether the respondent argued against
                        culpability, expressed regret over his conduct or made an apology for his
                        contempt of court (see also <em>Wong Hong Toy</em>
                        ([52] <em>supra</em>) at [46] and <em>AG
                            v Pang Cheng Lian</em> [1974-1976] SLR(R) 271). As
                        mentioned above (at [34]), whether the statements in question merely pose a
                        remote possibility or present a real risk of harm to the administration of
                        justice can also be taken into account in determining the sentence. The
                        considerations are not exhaustive and what are of particular relevance would
                        depend ultimately on the facts of each case. While the fines imposed in the
                        earlier cases provide useful guides, each case should of course be dealt
                        with on its own merits.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In <em>Hertzberg</em>, a $25,000 fine was imposed
                    on the corporate contemnor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The third case is <em>AG v Tan
                        Liang Joo</em> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 1132 (“<em>Tan Liang Joo</em>”), where Prakash J gave her own
                    summary of the applicable sentencing principles:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">31     The penalty for contempt of court can take
                        the form of either a fine or imprisonment and there is no limit on the
                        amount of the fine or duration of imprisonment (<em>AG v Chee
                            Soon Juan</em> (<a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> <em>supra</em>) at [57]; <em>Lee Hsien
                            Loong v Singapore Democratic Party</em> (<a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> <em>supra</em>) at [179]). In reaching a decision on
                        the sentence, I bore in mind that "[t]he object of imposing the penalty for
                        the offence of scandalising the court is to ensure that the unwarranted
                        statements made by the contemnor about the court or the judge are repelled
                        and not repeated" (<em>Gallagher v Durack</em> at 57).
                        The relevant factors for consideration include: the nature and gravity of
                        the contempt; the seriousness of the occasion on which the contempt was
                        committed; the importance of deterring would-be contemnors from following
                        suit; and the culpability of the contemnor (see <em>Lee Hsien
                            Loong v Singapore Democratic Party</em> at [179]-[180] and [222]).
                        Fines as the penalty for scandalising the court are no longer the norm
                            (<em>AG v Chee Soon Juan</em> at [61]). The
                        appropriate sentence can only be determined by looking at the particular
                        facts of each case (<em>Soong Hee Sin v PP</em> [2001]
                        1 SLR(R) 475).</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In <em>Tan Liang Joo</em>, the three respondents
                    were wearing t-shirts imprinted with a picture of a kangaroo dressed in a
                    judge’s gown within and in the vicinity of the Supreme Court building when
                    an assessment of damages involving politicians was ongoing. One of the
                    respondents wore the t-shirt on further occasions and posted photographs of the
                    respondents wearing the t-shirts online. All the respondents refused to
                    apologise after they were found to be in contempt. The last-mentioned respondent
                    was sentenced to 15 days’ imprisonment while the other two were sentenced
                    to 7 days’ imprisonment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Also relevant are the penalties imposed in
                    those cases where internationally-reputed publications such as Newsweek, the
                    Wall Street Journal Asia and the International Herald Tribune have scandalised
                    the courts by alleging bias and partiality in cases between politicians from the
                    ruling party and the opposition: <em>A-G v Pang Cheng
                        Lian</em> [1974–1976] SLR(R) 271; <em>A-G v Zimmerman Fred</em> [1985–1986] SLR(R) 476;
                        <em>A-G v Wain Barry J</em> [1991]
                    1 SLR(R) 85; <em>A-G v Lingle</em> [1995]
                    1 SLR(R) 199 and <em>Hertzberg</em>. In those
                    cases, which predated Lai J’s dictum in <em>Chee Soon
                        Juan</em>, fines were imposed on both the corporate owners of the
                    publications as well as the human agents involved in publication. Mr Ravi
                    relied on these cases as examples where low sentences were
                imposed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Counsel also referred me to several foreign
                    authorities. These are of course not sentencing precedents as such, but may be
                    illuminating insofar as they touch on matters of principle and the proper
                    sentencing approach to take in cases where the court has been
                    scandalised.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The first case referred to by Ms Subramanian
                    is <em>Secretary for Justice v The Oriental Press Group
                        Ltd</em> [1998] HKCFI 564, which concerned a
                    widely-circulated Hong Kong newspaper, the Oriental Daily News and its editor,
                    amongst others. They were convicted for threatening, harassing and intimidating
                    a judge, and for publishing seven articles over a month which vilified the
                    judiciary with scurrilous remarks and racist slurs. This campaign was in
                    response to a decision against the paper by the targeted judge in a separate
                    proceeding. The Hong Kong Court of First Instance found both the editor and the
                    company who owned the paper to be in contempt.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The court’s judgment on sentence is
                    found in a separate judgment: <em>Secretary for Justice v The
                        Oriental Press Group Ltd</em> [1998] HKCFI 173
                        (“<em>Oriental Press Group</em>”). In
                    respect of the editor, the court held that he must bear ultimate responsibility
                    for the contents of the paper and the conduct of its staff, although the court
                    suspected that the editor may have been influenced or encouraged by the board of
                    the company which owned the paper. The editor had also apologised. After
                    considering these and other factors, the court held that the editor should be
                    jailed for 3 months in respect of the publications and 3 months in respect of
                    harassing the judge, with 1 month of the latter sentence to run consecutively
                    with the former sentence, making a total of 4 months. It is significant that the
                    court adopted 8 months as the starting point, although it is not clear whether
                    this was in respect of the publications or the harassment or both.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     In respect of the company which owned the
                    paper, the court held, in stern language, that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">15. We have noted the unreserved apology which the Oriental Press Group
                        Ltd. has tendered. We have also read the guidelines (if they can properly be
                        characterized as guidelines) which it has issued as to the form and content
                        of articles appearing in the <em>Oriental Daily
                            News</em> to ensure that the law is not broken in the future.
                        However, it is impossible for us to deal with the Oriental Press Group Ltd.
                        other than by the imposition of a very heavy fine. We bear in mind that in
                        the Group's consolidated accounts for the year ending 31st March 1997, the
                        Group's profit after taxation was in the region of $208 million. We bear in
                        mind also that fines are intended to punish the offender. They are meant to
                        hurt. A fine which is merely an irritating annoyance represents hardly any
                        punishment at all. In all the circumstances of the case, we believe that the
                        proper fine to impose on the Oriental Press Group Ltd. for its contempt of
                        court relating to the publication of the articles complained of in a
                        newspaper with the largest readership in Hong Kong is one of $5
                        million.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The editor’s appeal to the Court of
                    Appeal was dismissed and the Court of Final Appeal refused leave to appeal
                    further.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The second case is <em>Secretary of Justice v Choy Bing Wing</em>
                    [2005] HKCFI 1125, where the respondent was convicted of scandalising
                    a judge, <em>viz</em> Rogers VP, with the intention and in
                    the hope that it would result in the recusal of the judge from a proceeding he
                    was involved in. His appeals against liability failed. In meting out a sentence
                    of 6 months, the Hong Kong Court of First Instance considered that the
                    respondent was “set on a calculated course of conduct to try and ensure
                    that, with a tirade of abuse, he could obtain the result he desired; namely, to
                    obtain the recusal of Rogers VP, and, by that result, to fashion the Court
                    of Appeal to his own liking”: <em>Secretary of Justice v
                        Choy Bing Wing</em> [2005] HKCFI 1159 (“<em>Choy Bing Wing</em>”) at [23].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The third case is <em>Durack v
                        Gallagher</em> (1982) 65 FLR 459. In that case, Gallagher, a
                    union leader, had successfully appealed to the Full Court of the Federal Court
                    of Australia against his conviction for contempt. In speaking to the media after
                    his acquittal, Gallagher said: “I'm very happy to the rank and file of
                    the union who has shown such fine support for the officials of the union and I
                    believe that by their actions in demonstrating in walking off jobs ... I believe
                    that that has been the main reason for the court changing its mind.”
                    Fresh contempt proceedings were instituted, and Keely J, sitting as a single
                    judge in the Federal Court, found Gallagher to be in contempt. In sentencing
                    Gallagher to three months’ imprisonment Keely J made the following
                    observations:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Over a long period, the activities of the Federation [ie the union] and
                        the sayings of Mr. Gallagher have been given much publicity by the
                        news media. Mr. Gallagher is a public figure. He has been given every
                        opportunity to explain his answer. He has not done so. He has shown no sign
                        of remorse. He has expressed no regret to the Court. He has offered no
                        apology to the Court. His conduct had a tendency to impair the confidence of
                        the public in the court's judgments. It attacked the integrity, propriety
                        and impartiality of the Court. The confidence of the public in the
                        integrity, propriety and impartiality of the Court must be
                        maintained.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The contempt of court by Norman Leslie Gallagher warrants the
                        imposition of a severe penalty. In all the circumstances it is not
                        appropriate that a monetary penalty should be imposed. In any event it is
                        all too easy for Mr. Gallagher to have a monetary penalty paid by
                        'benefactors'. The punishment must take the form of imprisonment. In all the
                        circumstances he must be sent to prison for three calendar months. In
                        addition he will be ordered to pay the Attorney-General's costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Gallagher’s appeal to the Full Court of
                    the Federal Court was dismissed: <em>Gallagher v
                        Durack</em> (1982) 68 FLR 210. Gallagher then sought leave
                    from the High Court to appeal against conviction and sentence in <em>Gallagher v Durack</em> (1983) 152 CLR 238
                        (“<em>Gallagher v Durack</em>”). The
                    majority refused leave, and gave the following reasons at 245 in respect of
                    sentence:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">An independent ground on which special leave to appeal was sought was that
                        it was erroneous for the Federal Court to take into account as one of the
                        reasons for imposing a sentence of imprisonment instead of a fine the fact
                        that the court thought that the applicant would not pay a fine out of his
                        own funds. Counsel relied upon cases in which it has been held that it is
                        wrong to impose a sentence of imprisonment not because it is merited but
                        because of a belief that the convicted person cannot pay a fine. Such cases
                        however are quite distinguishable from the present, whose circumstances were
                        most exceptional. The applicant, in the course of the interview, made it
                        clear that the Federation would not pay the fine imposed upon it out of its
                        ordinary funds, and it can be inferred from his further remarks that moneys
                        to pay that fine would be provided by employers who could not afford to have
                        industrial trouble with the union. The Full Court did not rely on the latter
                        circumstance, although it was entitled to do so. The object of the
                        imposition of a penalty upon a person convicted of contempt of court is to
                        endeavour to ensure that the unwarranted statements which he has made about
                        the court or a judge are repelled and will not be repeated. In the present
                        case, the applicant, who did not go into the witness box to explain the
                        meaning of his statement or his attitude towards its repetition, was given
                        an ample opportunity to apologize to the court but has chosen not to do so.
                        If the court comes to the conclusion that a person convicted of contempt of
                        court will not personally suffer or be deterred by a fine, that is a matter
                        which it may consider in imposing sentence. It is of course clear that the
                        Federal Court reached its conclusion that a sentence of imprisonment should
                        be imposed chiefly because of the gravity of the contempt, and that the
                        matters to which reference has just been made provided only an additional
                        consideration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Reference should also be made to the vigorous
                    dissent of Murphy J, who made a point on selective prosecution which is
                    pertinent to an argument made by Mr Ravi. Murphy J held at
                    252–253:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">20. Special leave should also be granted to appeal against the sentence of
                        three months' imprisonment. It is very rare for imprisonment to be imposed
                        in a contempt of this kind where the court orders are not being wilfully
                        disobeyed. (See <em>Dunbabin's Case</em> (1935) 53 CLR,
                        at p 448 ; <em>Solicitor-General v. Radio Avon
                        Ltd</em>. (1978) 1 NZLR 225, at p 242 ; <em>Dean's
                            Case</em> (1567) Cro Eliz 689, at p 690 [1653] EngR 589; (78 ER
                        925, at p 926) .) The Federal Court observed that imprisonment was necessary
                        because a fine would be no deterrent to Mr. Gallagher as it would
                        be paid by others. Special leave would enable the Court to consider whether
                        this represents a departure from proper principles of sentencing. The
                        question is of public importance. It has grave implications for newspaper
                        editors whose fines for contempt are paid for by newspaper companies. If the
                        approach of the Federal Court on this question was wrong, the sentence
                        should be reconsidered.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">21. We were informed that Mr. Gallagher had no previous
                        conviction for contempt of court or for anything else (except for refusal to
                        answer before a Royal Commission in circumstances such that the Federal
                        Court correctly decided to disregard it). In the light of the fact that
                        normally fines only are imposed even for serious contempts in scandalizing
                        the court, the sentence of three months' imprisonment appears to be a savage
                        penalty. It would be unfortunate if this departure from the normal created
                        the impression that imprisonment for scandalizing the court is reserved for
                        militant trade union leaders.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">22. Special leave would also enable consideration of another aspect which
                        concerned the Federal Court. Although the statements emanated from
                        Mr. Gallagher they were given national publicity by the media. Yet
                        Mr. Gallagher alone has been prosecuted. If, as the Federal Court
                        thought, the statements were a clear contempt, this is an instance of
                        selective prosecution. The Federal Court noted that no explanation was
                        advanced by the Attorney-General for proceeding only against
                        Mr. Gallagher. The authority and standing of the Federal Court can only
                        be lowered if it allows itself to become the vehicle of unexplained
                        selective prosecutions for contempt of itself. The fact that no one else who
                        participated is to be punished should have been an important factor in
                        considering whether to sentence Mr. Gallagher to imprisonment (see
                            <em>Attorney-General (N.S.W.) v. Mundey</em> (1972)
                        2 NSWLR 887). Although some attempt was made in this Court to explain the
                        prosecution of Mr. Gallagher alone, it was not persuasive.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The fourth is <em>Re
                        Bauskis</em> [2006] NSWSC 908, where the respondent was
                    wearing a t-shirt with the slogan “Trial by jury is democracy”,
                    and refused to remove the t-shirt or leave the courtroom when asked to do so. He
                    also used abusive language against the judge and refused to apologise when
                    committed for contempt. The judge took the view that the respondent, together
                    with others, was attempting to intimidate him. He sentenced the respondent to 14
                    days’ imprisonment: <em>Re Bauskis</em>
                    [2006] NSWSC 907 (“<em>Re
                    Bauskis</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Mr Ravi urged me to rely on <em>R v Hoser</em> [2001] VSC 443. In that case, the
                    offending publication was a book attributing improper motives to judges in cases
                    where the author had been convicted. The judge, Eames J, imposed a fine of
                    $3,000 on the author and $2,000 on the company through which he published the
                    book: <em>R v Hoser</em> [2001] VSC 480
                        (“<em>R v Hoser</em>”). In declining to
                    impose a term of imprisonment, Eames J agreed with counsel’s submission
                    that many of the impugned passages in the book were found not to constitute
                    contempt, that in examining the passages he (Eames J) had identified a number of
                    important issues concerning the administration of justice, that the
                    author’s integrity and credibility had already been adversely affected by
                    the judge’s finding, that the author was motivated by a deep sense of
                    grievance as to his convictions, and that the author would remove the offending
                    passages in future editions of the book. This was notwithstanding the fact that
                    the judge found that the book was widely disseminated, that the author and his
                    company earned substantial profits from the publication of the book, that the
                    author expressed no remorse for his actions, and that the judge had little
                    confidence that the author would not repeat his acts of contempt. On appeal, the
                    author was convicted in respect of more statements but no further penalty was
                    imposed: <em>Hoser v R</em>
                    [2003] VSCA 194.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Ms Subramanian also referred me to some
                    decisions of our courts which were unaccompanied by grounds. In the absence of
                    grounds I am unable to accord too much weight to those decisions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Application to the facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     I would reiterate that the foreign authorities
                    relied upon are not sentencing precedents as such, but are useful as
                    illustrations of the sentencing approaches taken. In this regard, it is
                    noteworthy that the High Court of Australia in <em>Gallagher v
                        Durack</em> sanctioned 3 months’ imprisonment for a public
                    statement that the Federal Court had bowed to the power of the unions and not
                    the law of the land. Similarly, the Hong Kong Court of First Instance in
                        <em>Oriental Press Group</em> imposed a sentence of 3
                    months for the scandalising publications in that case, which sentence was
                    affirmed on appeal. These sentences show that the courts of those jurisdictions
                    have not hesitated to give robust sentences where the facts warrant it. These
                    sentences, I should add, are significantly higher than the 15 days imposed in
                        <em>Tan Liang Joo</em>, currently the highest sentence
                    of imprisonment imposed in Singapore for scandalising the court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     However, to the extent that both counsel were
                    referring to those authorities as benchmarks, I cannot, with respect, agree with
                    them. In any case it would be difficult to reconcile the sentences in the
                    Australian cases of <em>Gallagher v Durack</em> and
                        <em>R v Hoser</em>, relied on by Ms Subramanian and
                    Mr Ravi respectively, and it would be incongruous and inappropriate for a
                    Singapore judge to reconcile Australian sentences. Further, in <em>Choy Bing Wing</em> and <em>Re
                        Bauskis</em>, the contempt was directed at ongoing proceedings. The
                    part of <em>Oriental Press Group</em> pertaining to the
                    harassment of a judge is also not applicable here. However, in deference to
                    Mr Ravi’s reliance on <em>R v Hoser</em>, I
                    would say that, had the facts of that case been put before me, I would be
                    disposed to give a much heavier sentence than that which was given in that
                    case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The general sentencing principles are well
                    articulated in the local authorities cited above and are uncontroversial. There
                    are two broad considerations. The first is the culpability of the contemnor and
                    the need for specific deterrence. The second is the actual or potential effect
                    of the contemning publication, <em>ie</em> the risk posed
                    by the publication to public confidence in the administration of justice, and
                    the need for general deterrence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     On the basis on the law as I have stated it in
                    the main judgment, I would also hold that imprisonment would be the norm for the
                    author of a publication which scandalises the court. To constitute contempt by
                    scandalising, a publication must not only pose a real risk of undermining public
                    confidence in the administration of justice; it must also fall outside the ambit
                    of fair criticism, meaning that it is either made without rational basis, made
                    without a honest and genuine belief as to its truth, or made in abusive
                    language. The mere satisfaction of these criteria, without more, already makes
                    for a high degree of culpability. The contemning author stands by definition in
                    an area where his right of free speech has been abused and where the public
                    standing of the courts should be vindicated. In the absence of special reasons,
                    such as appropriate amends, the default punishment should be
                    imprisonment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Effect of the book</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     I first consider the effect of the book. The
                    precise extent of circulation in Singapore is not established, although it is
                    not disputed that the book is or was circulated in Singapore, and had sold a
                    total of almost 6,000 copies in Singapore and overseas. There is also
                    Mr Ravi’s candid statement during the hearing on liability
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In fact, in my office, I’ll be very honest, I’m not selling
                        the book. I have -- so many lawyers have come to take the books because my
                        client have provided a lot of copies from the distributors. I’m not
                        selling it but I have given lawyers gratuitously at the -- my clients have
                        been quite pleased that many lawyers are turning up in droves to buy -- to
                        have a copy of the book. Some would like to just make payment at their
                            volition.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">The impugned statements are also in a more enduring medium than
                    journals or magazines, <em>viz</em> a book.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     I next consider the sheer breadth and gravity
                    of Mr Shadrake’s allegations. As I said at [72] of the main judgment,
                    “the more serious the allegation made, the greater the risk it poses to
                    public confidence in the administration of justice, all other things being
                    equal.” In this regard, Mr Shadrake’s allegations of judicial
                    impropriety are without precedent in this jurisdiction in terms of their
                    specificity, the number of judges targeted (the whole Supreme Court bench in
                    Vignes Mourthi’s case) and their gravity, pertaining as they did to cases
                    concerning the life and liberty of those who come before the courts. In
                    particular they surpass the allegations made in <em>Chee Soon
                        Juan</em> and <em>Tan Liang Joo</em>, where
                    sentences of imprisonment were imposed. I briefly recapitulate some of
                    Mr Shadrake’s key allegations:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_a"></a>(a)     In discussing the case of Julia Bohl
                        (the 2<sup>nd</sup> statement), Mr Shadrake claimed
                        that the courts gave a light sentence arranged for by the Singapore
                        government under threat of economic reprisals by the German government.
                        There was no rational basis supplied for this, and Mr Shadrake’s
                        own source (Mr Anandan’s autobiography) clearly stated otherwise,
                            <em>ie</em> that Julia Bohl could not face the
                        death penalty because the amount of pure cannabis seized was only 281 grams
                        and below the threshold of 500 grams.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_b"></a>(b)     In discussing the case of Maria Krol-Hmelak and Peter
                        Johnson (the 4<sup>th</sup> statement), Mr Shadrake
                        claimed that the courts succumbed to executive and diplomatic pressure in
                        acquitting two accused persons in a capital case. In his affidavit,
                        Mr Shadrake claimed he was referring to an abuse of prosecutorial
                        discretion, not the judiciary. This was plainly unsustainable as the
                        relevant sentence in the passage reads: “So it was very likely
                            <em>a government verdict not a judicial
                        one</em>” (emphasis added). During submissions, Mr Ravi
                        supplied in support of the 4<sup>th</sup> statement the
                        wholly untenable basis that the trial judge, Lai Kew Chai J, had
                        indicated that he would give written grounds for his decision but later did
                        not do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_c"></a>(c)     In
                        discussing the cases of Dinesh Bhatia, Andrew Veale and Penelope Pang (the
                            7<sup>th</sup> and 8<sup>th</sup>
                        statements), Mr Shadrake claimed that the rich and well-connected are
                        shown favouritism and given light jail sentences, notwithstanding that
                        Mr Anandan’s autobiography, which he claimed to rely on, also
                        gave three instances (out of four) where fines were imposed for similar
                        offenders who were certainly not rich or famous. He acknowledged that he had
                        made a mistake in stating that Dinesh Bhatia faced the maximum sentence of
                        10 years. This was impossible since Dinesh Bhatia was a first offender. But
                        he did not and has not said anything about withdrawing an almost identical
                        statement just immediately before the one he had acknowledged as
                        erroneous.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_d"></a>(d)     In
                        discussing the case of Vignes Mourthi (the 9<sup>th</sup>,
                            10<sup>th</sup> and 11<sup>th</sup>
                        statements), Mr Shadrake claimed that the Supreme Court judiciary has
                        culpably suppressed possibly exculpatory evidence in a capital case,
                        supplying only the completely untenable rationale that the Legal Service and
                        the judiciary were “porous”. During submissions on sentence,
                        Mr Ravi then put forward Mr Shadrake’s insincere
                        “apology” referred to at <a href="#p1_34">[34]</a> below.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_e"></a>(e)     In the 1<sup>st</sup> and
                            5<sup>th</sup> statements, Mr Shadrake made further
                        general statements alleging judicial impropriety in cases concerning the
                        life and liberty of those who come before the courts. In general, he has
                        shown himself to be more interested in make allegations against the
                        judiciary than with criticising the analyses and outcomes in individual
                        cases.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     I now consider the likely effect on a member
                    of the public who reads the book. Mr Shadrake does not have the reputation
                    and ostensible credibility of some of the publications which have been found to
                    be in contempt of our courts, <em>eg</em> the International
                    Herald Tribune and the Wall Street Journal Asia. But he has presented himself as
                    an investigative journalist, and the book is written in the style of a piece of
                    investigative journalism. For example, at p 26 of the book, which I have set out
                    at [85] of the main judgment, he says that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I wanted to expose some of the ghastly secrets of the gallows – the
                        kind of secrets Singapore’s leaders are so proud of, revere, put so
                        much faith in but don’t want anyone else to know about. Capital
                        punishment in the tiny state had for far too long been shrouded in this kind
                        of secrecy and discussion on the subject completely discouraged. It was time
                        something was done about it in as dramatic a way as possible, I thought to
                        myself. Could I be the one to expose the un-exposable? It would not be the
                        first time I had rattled a few cages in high places with an equally
                        embarrassing expose ... But being trained in journalism in the
                        ‘publish and be damned’ way, I was determined to go ahead come
                        what may.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The average reader will not subject Mr Shadrake’s claim to
                    being an investigative journalism or his allegations to searching criticism. He
                    will read Mr Shadrake’s allegations much in the way they were
                    presented in the Guardian article:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">While wealthy – often well-connected foreigners – can expect
                        leniency, [Mr Shadrake] argued in Once the Jolly Hangman: Singapore's
                        Justice in the Dock, the poor and disenfranchised are summarily
                        executed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Drawing on interviews with a retired chief executioner, lawyers, former
                        police officers and human rights activists, [Mr Shadrake’s]
                        central claim is that justice in one of the world's most advanced economies
                        is anything but blind. He highlights several inconsistent applications of
                        the law which, he says, prove Singapore's judiciary "picks and chooses how
                        they respond depending on the state's diplomatic and economic
                        interests".</p>
<p class="Judg-1">I would therefore sentence Mr Shadrake on the basis that an
                    average person who reads the book is likely to believe his
                allegations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Mr Ravi pointed out the Attorney-General
                    has not taken steps to ban the book. He did not explain the legal basis on which
                    the Attorney-General is bound to ban the book, and in any case I am not
                    concerned in these proceedings with whether the Attorney-General should ban the
                    book. But I do understand Mr Ravi to be making a point about what he sees
                    as the incongruity of the Attorney-General’s actions here. Now, if this
                    was a case where the Attorney-General has been improperly selective in
                    prosecuting those who are involved in creating and distributing a scandalous
                    publication, I can see some force in the dissenting judgment of Murphy J in
                        <em>Gallagher v Durack</em> that this should count
                    towards sentence. In fact, as Lord Reid explained in <em>A-G v
                        Times Newspaper Ltd</em> [1974] 1 AC 273 at 289, the fact
                    that others are free and are likely to make similar comments must be taken into
                    account in assessing liability in the first place. The reason for this is easy
                    enough to understand – if others are free to make scandalous remarks then
                    the risk to public confidence cannot be said to emanate solely from the
                    publication which is selectively prosecuted, and this would naturally be
                    reflected in the sentence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     But on the facts there is simply no selective
                    prosecution. As emerged during the various hearings before me, the
                    Attorney-General had advised bookstores carrying the book to take legal advice,
                    as a result of which the book has been taken off the shelves. This left
                    Mr Shadrake, who was unwilling from the very start, despite several
                    overtures by the Attorney-General, to retract his contemptuous publication and
                    apologise to the court. I do not see how, on these facts, there could be said to
                    be any sort of improperly selective prosecution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     In the same connection, Mr Ravi also made
                    a point about how those involved in making the IBA report had not been
                    prosecuted and punished for contempt. This ignores the facts. The relevant IBA
                    conference had been held in Singapore in October 2007. The IBA report was
                    released in July 2008, after some exchanges with the government and well after
                    the conference had ended. So I am doubtful that those who were involved in
                    making the report were within jurisdiction. But assuming in
                    Mr Shadrake’s favour that they were within jurisdiction and not
                    prosecuted, the fact remains, as I have made clear in [131] of the main
                    judgment, that it was Mr Shadrake’s selective quotation of the IBA
                    report, and his exaggeration of its conclusions, that placed him outside the
                    scope of fair criticism. So this was not a case of Mr Shadrake being
                    selectively prosecuted for repeating what the IBA was free to say.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Culpability</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     There is no doubt that
                    Mr Shadrake’s personal culpability is of the very highest order. He
                    has made sustained and extensive allegations of judicial impropriety in cases
                    concerning life and liberty, and has done so without rational basis, and with
                    reckless disregard as to the truth or falsehood of his allegations. He has in
                    particular showed a tendency to distort his sources for his own
                purposes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Outside the courtroom Mr Shadrake has
                    declared his complete lack of remorse, and discarded his pretence that he was
                    not targeting the judiciary in the book. He has also asserted that his book was
                    “devastatingly accurate”, despite everything I have said in the
                    main judgment. Notwithstanding this, Mr Shadrake instructed Mr Ravi to
                    inform me during the hearing on sentence that he did not mean to allege a
                    cover-up by the “high echelons of the judiciary” in Vignes
                    Mourthi’s case, despite his express words to the contrary in the book. In
                    the light of this, his already misguided proposal to apologise must be regarded
                    as nothing more than a tactical ploy to obtain a reduced sentence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     He is a first time offender, but that carries
                    no weight at all in the light of the sustained allegations he has made in the
                    book and his intention, stated through Mr Ravi in the face of the court,
                    that he intends to produce a second edition of the book. This last fact is
                    unprecedented in our case law, and calls for a strong element of specific
                    deterrence in determining the sentence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Disgorgement of profit </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Questions had crossed my mind as to the
                    motives of Mr Shadrake in writing this book. The bibliographical note on
                    the back cover of the book does not show that he had a history of being an
                    activist against the death penalty. Certainly, following from what I have said
                    in the main judgment, it does not seem that he was overly concerned about
                    ascertaining the truth or falsity of what he wrote. Notwithstanding his claims
                    of meticulous research, the sources given by him during the hearing were mostly
                    publicly available, and indeed one (the Chief Justice’s article) was
                    published after his book. His style and tone is sensational in nature: see
                        <em>eg</em> p 26 of the book, which I set out above at
                        <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a>. All these point to a man who is
                    out to provoke controversy. But since these are suspicions on my part only, I
                    disregard them for the purposes of sentencing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     However, I do have Mr Ravi’s
                    statement that almost 6,000 copies of the book have been sold in total. I think
                    that a fine should be imposed to prevent Mr Shadrake from profiting from
                    his contempt. Let this be a signal that those who hope to profit from
                    controversy by scandalising the court may expect to have their profits disgorged
                    by a stiff fine, in addition to such other punishment as may be
                imposed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Other factors</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Mr Ravi informed me that Mr Shadrake
                    has had surgery for colon cancer. He has a history of coronary artery disease
                    and had undergone successful angioplasty/stenting. He has also been suffering
                    from hypertension for over 30 years. While the cancer is now in remission,
                    Mr Shadrake still needs to go for annual checkups for polyps. Applying the
                    principles stated by Rajah JA in <em>Chng Yew Chin v
                        PP</em> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 124, I do not think that
                    Mr Shadrake’s medical condition justified the exercise of judicial
                    mercy. His condition was not severe and would not be aggravated by the term of
                    imprisonment contemplated here. Ms Subramanian also informed me that
                    Mr Shadrake would be able to receive appropriate medical attention in
                    prison if necessary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Mr Ravi urged me to consider the possible
                    effect of the sentence I pass on a proposed tie-up between Yale University and
                    the National University of Singapore, which he described as a
                    “multi-million or multi-billion” dollar project that was a
                    “real leap” for Singapore. Needless to say I give no weight at all
                    to this argument. Indeed, I found this argument deeply ironic, given that barely
                    a few weeks ago Mr Ravi was defending as fair criticism
                    Mr Shadrake’s criticism that Andrew Veale was given a light sentence
                    because he was “the sort of people Singapore needs”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     In his earlier submissions Mr Ravi had
                    sought to place reliance on s 225C of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008
                    Rev Ed), which provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Offences against laws of Singapore where no special
                            punishment is provided</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>225C</b>. Whoever does anything which by any law
                        in force in Singapore he is prohibited from doing, or omits to do anything
                        which he is so enjoined to do, shall, when no special punishment is provided
                        by the law for such commission or omission, be punished with fine not
                        exceeding $2,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     When I reminded him of this submission during
                    the hearing on sentence, Mr Ravi clarified that he was abandoning this
                    argument, because it is beyond dispute that the common law recognises
                    imprisonment as a punishment for contempt. This was also Ms Subramanian’s
                    intended reply, and had the argument been pressed I too would have taken the
                    same view.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Conclusion on sentence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     On the basis of Mr Shadrake’s
                    culpability alone, in particular his stated intent to repeat his contempt by
                    publishing an expanded second edition of the book, I would have agreed with Ms
                    Subramanian’s submission of a minimum sentence of 3 months’
                    imprisonment to serve the objective of specific deterrence. This would be
                    further justified by the likely effect of Mr Shadrake’s book on the
                    uncritical reader, as illustrated by the Guardian article. However, I must take
                    into account the previous sentencing precedents (which are on the low end), the
                    fact that the precise extent of the book’s circulation in Singapore was
                    unclear, and also the fact that Mr Shadrake was not a person with a
                    credible and established reputation. I would also apply a discount, entirely
                    undeserved by Mr Shadrake and which will and should not be taken as a
                    precedent, to signal that the courts have no interest in stifling legitimate
                    debate on the death penalty and other areas of the law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     In the result, I sentence Mr Shadrake to
                    6 weeks’ imprisonment and a fine of S$20,000, in default of which he shall
                    serve a further 2 weeks in prison, such further term to run consecutively to the
                    first.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     If at any time after my judgment
                    Mr Shadrake wishes to purge his contempt, he can do so by applying under O
                    52 r 7(1) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Costs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     After delivering the above judgment on
                    sentence I heard counsel on costs. It was common ground that I should fix costs.
                    Ms Subramanian submitted that the Attorney-General should be awarded a total sum
                    of $80,000 and indicated that a taxed sum would be substantially higher.
                    Mr Ravi, rather extravagantly, asked for $100,000 in costs for
                    Mr Shadrake. He argued in the alternative that the Attorney-General should
                    receive less than $10,000 in costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     As a general rule costs should follow the
                    event and there is no reason for me to depart from that rule in this case. As
                    for quantum, the first thing to be noticed is that the submissions on liability
                    and sentence took three and a half days, on top of several ancillary
                    matters.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     I also considered that, although I had adopted
                    the real risk test in preference to the inherent tendency test, it was not quite
                    the test Mr Ravi had argued for, which seemed to require a substantial
                    degree of risk. Ms Subramanian had accepted in the end, as I did, that there
                    might not be much difference between the inherent tendency test and the real
                    risk test, although in this regard I would repeat what was said at [50] and [54]
                    of the main judgment. As for the facts, although I have held that three of the
                    fourteen impugned statements were not in contempt, very little time was spent on
                    those three statements, which in any case do not form the sting of his
                    allegations. The Attorney-General has substantially succeeded on the remaining
                    eleven statements, on which most of the time was spent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     I gave significant weight to the fact that
                    Mr Shadrake had during the hearing on sentence exhibited a complete lack of
                    remorse for his contempt, and in particular had stated, through Mr Ravi,
                    his intention to publish a second and expanded edition of the book. This should
                    be reflected in my order as to costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     In the result, I fixed costs at
                    $55,000.</p>
