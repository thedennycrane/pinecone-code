<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">4 This action concerned construction work

at a project called Hilltops Apartments. The Plaintiffs were the main contractors and the

Defendants were their subcontractors for that project. The Defendants’ Counterclaim

is in respect of a project at the Sinsov Building where they were again the

Plaintiffs’ subcontractors.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">5 The Plaintiffs’ application for

security for costs was in respect of the Defendants’ Counterclaim and was made

pursuant to Section 388 of the Companies Act or, in the alternative, under O. 23 r. 1 of

the Rules of Court, principally on the ground that the Defendants were in financial

straits. There is a pending Petition to wind up the Defendants (CWU 174 of 1999).</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">6 Security for costs at $50,000 was

ordered against the Defendants by the Assistant Registrar.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">7 On 29 August 2001, Judith Prakash J

allowed the Defendants’ appeal against the Assistant Registrar’s decision on

security for costs. On 11 September 2001 (two days before the present appeal), the

Plaintiffs lodged an appeal against the judge’s decision and have instructed Mr

Michael Hwang, S.C. as Counsel for the hearing before the Court of Appeal. I was told that

the Plaintiffs would be seeking to proceed by way of expedited appeal pursuant to O. 57 r.

20.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">8 The Plaintiffs submitted that since the

Defendants had admitted that they were in no position to put up security for costs, it was

obvious that should any costs be ordered against the Defendants in the Counterclaim, those

costs would not be paid. The Plaintiffs accepted that an appeal to the Court of Appeal did

not operate as a stay of proceedings but argued that they were not seeking such a stay but

were merely asking the Court to exercise its discretion in the interest of justice so as

not to render their appeal on security for costs nugatory (<i>Wilson v Church (No.2) </i>(1879-80)

12 ChD 454). They submitted that the trial should therefore not proceed pending the

outcome of their appeal.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">9 Although the Plaintiffs only took out

the application for security for costs some 15 months after the filing of the

Counterclaim, they argued there was no inordinate delay and that, in any event, there were

numerous interlocutory applications during the first half of 2001. The Plaintiffs had also

asked for Further and Better Particulars on 23 October 2000 but no response was made by

the Defendants until 9 March 2001 and that was to refuse to furnish the particulars

sought. When particulars were finally furnished by consent in May 2001, it was then that

the Plaintiffs were able to say that the Counterclaim was not a strong one.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">10 Further, the Plaintiffs argued, they

would suffer grave prejudice as the action concerned a complex construction matter in

which the Plaintiffs would be calling 11 witnesses including an expert and the costs for

the ten-day trial would be in the region of $120,000, with about eight days to be taken up

by the Defendants’ Counterclaim. In contrast, the Defendants were calling only one

witness for the entire action. Counsel for the Plaintiffs had also indicated to the

Registrar at the PTC that they were ready to exchange affidavits of evidence-in-chief

before 1 October 2001 but the Registrar stipulated a deadline two weeks earlier. As an

alternative, the Plaintiffs suggested that their claim proceed for trial while the

Defendants’ counterclaim, which was in respect of an unrelated project, be held over

until after the appeal.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">11 Counsel for the Defendants reiterated

that they were ready with their clients’ affidavit of evidence-in-chief. He informed

me that the winding up petition against the Defendants had been held over for more than

two years because the Defendants’ creditors supported that course of action pending

the Defendants’ counterclaim against the Plaintiffs. He was agreeable to having the

trial dates pushed back by two weeks but would like all the other directions to remain.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman"><u>THE DECISION OF THE COURT</u></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">12 I dismissed the Plaintiffs’ appeal

against the Registrar’s directions with costs fixed at $500 to be paid to the

Defendants. The Plaintiffs have lodged an appeal against my decision on 25 September 2001.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">13 In <i>Dickson Trading (S) Pte Ltd v

Transmarco Ltd</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=4634&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">]1989] 2 MLJ 408, the Plaintiffs there applied for an interlocutory

injunction to restrain the Defendants from disposing of certain shares. Chan Sek Keong JC

dismissed the application. The Plaintiffs then applied for an interim injunction pending

appeal against the dismissal, relying on <i>Erinford Properties Ltd &amp; Anor v Cheshire

County Council </i>[1974] Ch 261. The judge distinguished cases concerning applications

for stay of execution of final judgments after full trials from the application before him

which was in effect a stay of an interlocutory order. In his view, there was a difference

in substance and not merely in degree between the two situations. He was also of the

opinion that the likelihood of an appeal, if successful, being rendered nugatory, was a

sufficient ground for a stay of execution. However, the judge refused the Plaintiffs the

limited injunction sought fundamentally because the Plaintiffs’ action, if ultimately

successful, would not be affected by their failure to obtain an interlocutory injunction.</a></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">14 The Plaintiffs here submitted that

while they were not asking for a stay of execution, the principles set out in the above

case could be relied upon to assist the Court in exercising its discretion whether or not

to vacate the trial dates.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">15 I do not disagree with the principles

stated but it should be noted that in cases like <i>Dickson Trading </i>above, granting

the interim relief sought would still permit the wheels of litigation to roll on. In

contrast, the Plaintiffs here were effectively asking that I apply the brakes and park the

action by the wayside (or at least the counterclaim) until such time as the brakes were

released by the Court of Appeal. This I was not willing to do in the circumstances of this

case.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">16 The Plaintiffs only took out their

application for security for costs some 15 months after the filing of the Defendants’

Counterclaim. If one reckoned the time from the filing of the Amended Defence and

Counterclaim on 25 April 2000, it would still be 14 months. Even if they were justified in

not doing so until after Further and Better Particulars had been provided by the

Defendants, they had nevertheless taken some six months from the filing of the Amended

Defence and Counterclaim to ask for particulars. Further, they ought to have known, at the

time they commenced this action on 1 February 2000 or at least soon thereafter, that the

Defendants were the subject of a winding up petition. They were therefore responsible for

at least a six-month delay.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">17 In addition, their application for

security for costs has already been considered by a High Court Judge and such an

application involved an exercise of discretion. There are other interlocutory applications

the outcome of which could affect the trial process itself; for instance, an application

to make substantial amendments to a claim or an application to call additional evidence at

the trial. Such applications, decided one way or the other, could be said to prejudice one

of the parties to the proceedings. Yet, in such cases impinging on the trial process

itself, it would be highly unlikely that the Court would either vacate the trial dates or

stop the trial at that stage in order to await the outcome of an appeal. Here, any

prejudice to the Plaintiffs would only arise if the Defendants’ counterclaim was

dismissed with costs. The trial process would not be affected at all. The litigation

process would become most unsatisfactory if all such interlocutory applications must first

receive the attention of the highest Court in our system of justice before the next step

could be taken.</font></p>
