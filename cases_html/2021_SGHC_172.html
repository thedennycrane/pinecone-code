The accused refused to do so as he had already helped “Sara” once and gotten into trouble. “Sara” then threatened the accused again and said that he would notify the police and get the accused caught and also that he would not leave him or his family alone. As the accused was scared, he agreed to collect the money. “Sara” then directed him to where he was supposed to pick up the money.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">My decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The three key elements of the offence of possession of controlled drugs for the purpose of trafficking are (a) possession of the controlled drugs (which may be proved or presumed), (b) knowledge of the controlled drugs (which may be proved or presumed) and (c) proof that the possession of the controlled drugs was for the purpose of trafficking: see <span class="font-italic">Masoud Rahimi bin Mehrzad v Public Prosecutor and another appeal</span> [2017] 1 SLR 257 at [28].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 There was undisputed evidence that the accused was in possession of the drugs. For element (c), the Prosecution relied on the presumption of trafficking in s 17 MDA as the accused was found in possession of the drugs and positive evidence had been adduced in the form of his contemporaneous statements (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, P160 and P161) showing that he knew the nature of the drugs in question. Accordingly, the primary issue for my consideration in this regard was whether the evidence was sufficient to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused knew the nature of the controlled drugs found in his possession. As for the methamphetamine, the accused did not dispute his knowledge that the four packets contained methamphetamine; he had consumed “ice” before in Malaysia and was familiar with it. The key issue was whether he knew that the five packets contained diamorphine. If this was established, the burden would then fall upon the accused to rebut the presumption of trafficking in s 17 of the MDA by proving on a balance of probabilities that he did not have the drugs in his possession for that purpose. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The accused knew that the five packets contained diamorphine</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 It is settled law that where an accused is charged with possession of a particular type of drug for the purpose of trafficking, he must have known the nature of the actual drug in his possession: see <span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran a/l K Dharmalingam v Public </span>Prosecutor<span class="font-italic"> </span>[2011] 4 SLR 1156 at [24]–[26], as affirmed in <span class="font-italic">Ramesh</span><span class="font-italic"> a/l Perumal </span>at [65].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 I rejected the accused’s claim of ignorance of what the five packets actually contained. Two of his contemporaneous statements, P160 and P161, clearly revealed his actual knowledge that the five packets contained diamorphine. He had volunteered relevant incriminating information even before the locker was opened in his presence. He was familiar with the street names for both diamorphine and methamphetamine. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 The accused’s evidence was that he did not check the plastic bag when he first picked it up at Tuas as “Sara” had told him there were “important” things inside. Evidently, curiosity eventually got the better of him and he did check the bag after he had decided to bring the bag to keep in his locker. P160 and P161 plainly contradicted the accused’s claim that after seeing that there were four packets of “ice” within the plastic bag as well as a “timbang”, he did not check to see what else was inside. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Turning first to P161, this was a brief question and answer statement which was recorded in the field diary. I noted that Sgt Syazwan and Sgt Dadly had given consistent evidence as to how the statement was recorded. The accused himself had written his Malaysian ID number and signed on the statement. He did not dispute this but claimed that he had only done so because Sgt Yogaraj told him to. Implicit in this claim was an assertion that Sgt Syazwan and Sgt Dadly were never involved in recording any statement from him, and had fabricated the contents of P161, as well as their evidence in court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The Prosecution had disclosed in their entirety all the relevant portions from the field diary (“P232”) at the trial to the Defence. This was furnished in the course of cross-examination of Sgt Dadly, who had confirmed the events that led up to the recording of P161. In the face of this contemporaneous evidence, no questions were posed by the Defence in relation to the juxtaposition of the statement in P161 within P232 to Sgt Yogaraj, Sgt Dadly or Sgt Syazwan. There was no suggestion that it appeared to be out of context in P232.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 I rejected the accused’s contentions in relation to P161. His claims simply did not make sense. The accused acknowledged that he had the opportunity to read the statement when it was shown to him before he appended his signature. He also accepted that he could read and understand the statement.

</div> This was completely at odds with his claim that he had signed the statement purely because Sgt Yogaraj had shown him a book and asked him to sign it. There was also absolutely no plausible reason why his signature and Malaysian ID would have been written in P161 under his own hand unless this was for the purpose stated in P161 <span class="font-italic">ie</span> to acknowledge a statement that he had given voluntarily to Sgt Syazwan, as recorded by Sgt Dadly.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 As for P160, this was a more detailed statement recorded by Sgt Yogaraj after the locker had been opened in the accused’s presence and the drugs were shown to the accused. The accused denied that he had told Sgt Yogaraj that the diamorphine was “saapadu”. Instead, he claimed that Sgt Yogaraj had told him that the substance was known as “saapadu” in Malaysia. When the accused’s claim was put to Sgt Yogaraj during cross-examination, Sgt Yogaraj disagreed that he had initiated the use of the word “saapadu”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 As with his contentions for P161, the accused’s assertion was that Sgt Yogaraj had fabricated both P160 and his evidence in court.

P161 was recorded in the field diary as part of a listing of a chronological sequence of events. It was perhaps not wholly inconceivable, but highly unlikely, that P161 could have been fabricated by way of a contemporaneous addition into the field diary for the purpose of incriminating the accused. It was even less likely that it was surreptitiously added <span class="font-italic">ex post facto</span>. In any event, this was not the Defence’s case and the accused did not offer any reason why the CNB officers would have resorted to such dubious means. As for P160, Sgt Yogaraj had recorded it using a question and answer format, just as he had done for the recording of the accused’s first contemporaneous statement in P159. The accused made no effort to correct both P159 and P160 but signed on them and wrote down his Malaysian ID as well.

The three doctors (Dr Yak Si Mian, Dr Edmund Phua and Dr Derrick Yeo) who examined him following his arrest all confirmed that he had told them that he had not consumed any alcohol or drugs. In particular, Dr Yak Si Mian had examined the accused around 12 hours after P160 was recorded and had noted that he did not report or exhibit any drug withdrawal symptoms.

</div> This was not simply an afterthought, but a barefaced lie. It was pure fabrication on the accused’s part. He had never once mentioned, whether in his statements or in his oral evidence at trial, any such threat from “Sara” to “finish off” his wife. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 I found that the accused’s claim of having acted under duress due to “Sara’s” threats was patently implausible. It was an obvious afterthought. In any event, the defence of duress is not tenable in view of s 94 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed), which provides:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Act to which a person is compelled by threats</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">94. Except murder and offences against the State punishable with death, nothing is an offence which is done by a person who is compelled to do it by threats, which, at the time of doing it, reasonably cause the apprehension that <span class="font-italic">instant death</span> to that person or any other person will otherwise be the consequence.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 It would suffice to highlight that the accused had never alleged that “Sara” had threatened <span class="font-italic">instant death</span> to him or his immediate family. The accused was unable therefore to avail himself of the defence of duress.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The alleged intention to return the drugs to “Sara” was an afterthought</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Finally, I turn to the primary argument raised by the Defence at trial, namely that the accused was intending to return all the drugs to “Sara”. The Defence had cited <span class="font-italic">Ramesh a/l Perumal </span>for the proposition that a person who returns drugs to the person who originally deposited the drugs with him would not ordinarily come within the definition of “trafficking”: <span class="font-italic">Ramesh a/l Perumal </span>at [110]. It was submitted that the presumption of trafficking in s 17(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) and (<span class="font-italic">h</span>) of the MDA had been rebutted, since the accused’s defence was that he was holding on to the drugs for the owner “Sara” to collect them back from him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 In <span class="font-italic">Ramesh a/l Perumal</span>, the Court of Appeal examined the legislative policy on the interpretation of the MDA having regard to the decision of the Privy Council in <span class="font-italic">Ong Ah Chua</span><span class="font-italic">n v Public Prosecutor</span> [1979-1980] SLR(R) 710 and concluded thus as [110]:</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">[I]n our judgment, a person who returns drugs to the person who originally deposited those drugs with him would not ordinarily come within the definition of “trafficking”. It follows that a person who holds a quantity of drugs with no intention of parting with them other than to return them to the person who originally deposited those drugs with him does not come within the definition of possession of those drugs “for the purpose of trafficking”. There is a fundamental difference in character between this type of possession and possession with a view to <span class="font-italic">passing the drugs onwards</span> to a third party. In the former situation, the returning of the drugs to person who already was in possession of them to begin with cannot form part of the process of disseminating those drugs in a particular direction – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, from a source of supply towards the recipients to whom the drugs are to be supplied – because the act of returning the drugs runs counter to that very direction. On the other hand, in the latter situation, the intended transfer of the drugs to a third party is presumptively part of the process of moving the drugs along a chain in which they will eventually be distributed to their final consumer.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">[Emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The Court of Appeal further held at [114] that where a person’s involvement with a quantity of drugs is limited to keeping the drugs as a “bailee” with the intention to return the drugs to the “bailor” who originally deposited them with him, this would not without more render the “bailee” liable for trafficking. The rationale was that the mere act of returning the drugs would not constitute part of the process of supply and distribution of drugs “along a chain” downstream to their end-users. The Court of Appeal did not go so far as to hold that the presumption of trafficking would not operate under any circumstances, but rather observed that a person found in possession of drugs in such a situation would not be caught by the definition of possession of those drugs “for the purpose of trafficking”: at [110]. As the outcome in <span class="font-italic">Ramesh a/l Perumal</span> demonstrates, such a person would be able to successfully rebut the presumption of trafficking.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 In my view, the Court of Appeal’s observations in <span class="font-italic">Ramesh a/l Perumal </span>at [110] did not assist the accused. The prospect of the accused intending to return the drugs to “Sara” was only raised once, in his interviews with Dr Derrick Yeo for psychiatric assessment,

By the time he was first interviewed by Dr Derrick Yeo on 26 April 2018, he had already given three contemporaneous statements, three cautioned statements and four long statements with absolutely no mention of any intention to return the drugs to “Sara”.

He claimed that he waited at the bus stop at Tuas for “two plus hours” but no one came to collect the bag.

He had also never mentioned in any of his 13 statements that there was any arrangement for “Sara” to <span class="font-italic">personally collect</span> the drugs from him. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 On the accused’s own evidence, “Sara” had not in fact “deposited” the drugs with him for safekeeping. The drugs were never intended to be “deposited” with him as a “bailee” for “Sara” to begin with. The accused never alleged that “Sara” had <span class="font-italic">requested </span>him, let alone <span class="font-italic">instructed</span> him, to keep the drugs for him to await further instructions if no one came to collect them. Instead, the accused had kept them in his locker entirely on his own initiative. He allegedly did so only because he had waited in vain for the person who was supposed to collect them from him initially at Tuas on 1 April 2018.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 The common thread in all his 13 statements was that “Sara” would arrange to send someone to collect the drugs from him. It was only at trial, nearly three years after the event, that the accused mentioned <span class="font-italic">for the very first time</span> that “Sara” would be <span class="font-italic">collecting</span> the drugs from him. It would appear that the accused had decided to tailor his bespoke defence belatedly upon realising that “bailment” was a possible defence that might be supportable on the authority of <span class="font-italic">Ramesh a/l Perumal</span>, a decision which was handed down by the Court of Appeal in March 2019, after he had already given all his statements. The isolated mention of an intention to return the drugs to “Sara” when interviewed by Dr Derrick Yeo did not assist him. He would have had every opportunity to raise this point in subsequent long statements, but he never did.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 I rejected the accused’s claim that he was merely holding on to the drugs with a view to returning them to “Sara”, and that “Sara” would be collecting the drugs from him. When the evidence was assessed in totality, it showed that all this was plainly crafted as an afterthought by the accused in a calculated effort to bring himself within the “bailment” defence identified in <span class="font-italic">Ramesh a/l Perumal</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 The Court of Appeal’s observations in <span class="font-italic">Ramesh a/l Perumal </span>in relation to how a person who returns drugs to a person who originally deposited the drugs with him would not ordinarily come within the definition of “trafficking” therefore had no application to the present case. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The presumption of trafficking was not rebutted</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 As explained above, I had found that the accused was in possession of the drugs and had known that the four packets contained methamphetamine and the five packets contained diamorphine. I had also found that he could not avail himself of the defence of duress.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Taking these findings together with his own admissions from his statements, it was evident that the accused knew that “Sara” was a drug trafficker who had gotten him involved in drug dealings. He was fully conscious that “Sara” had arranged for him to assist in delivering or handing over the drugs to some other person(s). Such conduct would amount to giving, transporting, sending or delivering the drugs to a third party. These are four of the seven possible meanings of trafficking stipulated under s 2 of the MDA. He was waiting for “Sara’s” instructions when he was arrested. This was the Prosecution’s basic narrative at trial. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 In this regard, the Court of Appeal had pointedly observed in <span class="font-italic">Ramesh a/l Perumal</span> at [114] as follows:</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">… while we have also found that Parliament’s objective under the MDA was to address the movement of drugs towards end-users, <span class="font-italic">this should not be taken as any suggestion that establishing the offence of trafficking or possession for the purpose of trafficking requires the Prosecution to prove that the accused was moving the drugs closer to their ultimate consumer</span>. In the vast majority of cases, it can reasonably be assumed that the movement of drugs from one person to another, <span class="font-italic">anywhere along the supply or distribution chain</span>, was done to facilitate the movement of drugs towards their ultimate consumers. It is clear, however, that this assumption does not hold true in the case of a person who merely holds the drugs as “bailee” with a view to returning them to the “bailor” who entrusted him with the drugs in the first place. <span class="font-italic">Such a person cannot, without more, be liable for trafficking because the act of returning the drugs is not part of the process of supply or distribution of drugs</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">[Emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 As the observations above make clear, the Prosecution was not required to prove that the accused was moving the drugs closer towards their ultimate consumers. For the avoidance of any doubt, the Prosecution was also not required to show that the accused intended to sell or distribute the drugs. In the present case, there was nothing to suggest that the accused’s act of possession was not intended for the downstream process of supply and distribution of drugs towards their ultimate consumers, given his own statements indicating that “Sara” would arrange for <span class="font-italic">someone to collect the drugs from him</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Taking the accused’s claims as contained in his statements at their highest, he had intended to pass on the drugs in his possession to <span class="font-italic">someone else</span> on “Sara’s” instructions. By doing so, he would be acting as a courier on “Sara’s” behalf since he undoubtedly knew that “Sara” was involved in drug trafficking. Adopting the Court of Appeal’s observations in <span class="font-italic">Ramesh a/l Perumal</span> at [110], this would still amount to “possession with a view to passing the drugs onwards to <span class="font-italic">a third party</span>” [emphasis added]. The Court of Appeal had opined unambiguously at [110] that such a situation involving intended transfer of drugs to a third party is “presumptively part of the process of moving the drugs along a chain in which they will eventually be distributed to their final customer”. The accused had not raised anything in his defence to counter this, other than to assert at the eleventh hour that his 13 statements were all inaccurate and that “Sara” had purportedly said that he would retrieve the drugs from him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 In my assessment, even if I had erred in the above analysis, the accused would still be liable in the alternative for abetting or doing an act preparatory to, or in furtherance of, the commission of a trafficking offence. The facts disclosed that the accused knew that “Sara” was the primary offender involved in drug trafficking. “Sara” had arranged for the delivery or distribution of the drugs through the accused. The accused took it upon himself to safekeep the drugs with a view to handing them over to “someone” who “Sara” would arrange to send to collect the drugs. This is substantially in line with the illustration of abetment by aiding in <span class="font-italic">Ramesh a/l Perumal</span> at [115].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 For completeness, I should mention that I had some reservations in respect of the Prosecution’s closing submissions that the accused’s possession of the drugs for the purpose of giving them <span class="font-italic">back</span> to “Sara” would fall squarely within the definition of trafficking under s 2 of the MDA.

</div> I did not agree that [114] of <span class="font-italic">Ramesh a/l Perumal</span> supports this submission, which glosses over the Court of Appeal’s fundamental point that a “bailee” who retains the drugs with a view to returning them to the “bailor” is not, without more, liable for trafficking. If I had accepted the accused’s assertions that he was only planning to return the drugs to “Sara”, the more reasonable inference would be that this would not amount to movement of drugs “along the supply or distribution chain”, and therefore would not fall within the definition of trafficking under s 2 of the MDA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 I understood the Prosecution’s closing submissions to be premised on the lack of evidence adduced by the accused to show that “Sara” was in fact the “bailor”. It was submitted that the accused gave <span class="font-italic">no evidence</span> that “Sara” was the person who “originally deposited” the drugs with him or that “Sara” had personally left the drugs at Tuas for the accused to collect.

</div>
</div>
</div> In my view, this submission was not sustainable. It reflected an attempt to draw unduly fine distinctions based on a somewhat pedantic reading of [110] and [114] of <span class="font-italic">Ramesh a/l Perumal</span>. There was some objective evidence that “Sara” was not entirely a figment of the accused’s imagination although there was nothing apart from the accused’s own say-so to link “Sara” to the drugs. I did not see a good reason for adopting such a rigidly technical approach in evaluating the facts. The drugs could conceivably have been left at Tuas by someone else acting on “Sara’s” directions and I did not see how that would necessarily negate the possible characterisation of “Sara” as the “bailor”. The essence of the “bailment” defence is that the accused must not have intended to move the drugs along the supply or distribution chain – questions of <span class="font-italic">who</span> had deposited the drugs and <span class="font-italic">who</span> had reclaimed them are important but not determinative. The crux of the matter is that, a person cannot be liable for trafficking if his act “is not <span class="font-italic">part of</span> the process of supply or distribution of drugs” [emphasis in original] (see <span class="font-italic">Ramesh a/l Perumal</span> at [114]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 I found that the presumption in s 17 of the MDA that the accused was in possession of the drugs for the purpose of trafficking was correctly invoked. The accused had failed to rebut the presumption. His defence was not credible, and he was an unreliable and evasive witness. His explanations at trial were entirely self-serving. New assertions and embellishments emerged only in the course of the trial. Indeed, it was not possible to tell precisely how or when he came to be in possession of the drugs, given that he had blatantly lied and given inconsistent accounts and shifting explanations to suit his purposes.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70  I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proved that the accused had actual knowledge of the nature of the drugs. The accused had failed to rebut the presumption in s 17 of the MDA on a balance of probabilities, <span class="font-italic">ie </span>that he had the diamorphine and the methamphetamine in his possession for the purpose of trafficking. His intent to traffic in the drugs found in his possession was premised on his statements which showed that he was awaiting “Sara’s” instructions for him to pass on the drugs to someone else who would be sent to collect them from him. Essentially, by his own admission from his contemporaneous statements, the accused was acting as a courier on “Sara’s” behalf.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 The Prosecution had proved the two charges beyond reasonable doubt. I therefore found the accused guilty as charged and convicted him. As a certificate of substantive assistance was issued, I exercised my discretion under s 33B(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA not to impose the death penalty given that I had found that the accused’s involvement with the drugs was limited to acting as a courier. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 The accused was thus sentenced to life imprisonment and the mandatory minimum of 15 strokes of the cane for each charge, with caning limited to the maximum of 24 strokes permissible by law. I backdated his sentence to 3 April 2018, the date of his arrest.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">See Kee Oon<br/>Judge of the High Court </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Dwayne Lum, Samuel Yap and Pavithra Ramkumar (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the prosecution;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">A Revi Shanker s/o K Annamalai (AR Shanker Law Chambers) and Elengovan s/o V Krishnan (Elengovan Chambers) for the accused.</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
