Ltd (“Viking Engineering”), in the third defendant, Viking Inert Gas Pte Ltd (“VIG”) (“the Buyout Order”). The fair value of the shares in VIG (“the Shares”) was to be ascertained by an independent valuer appointed by agreement of the parties. Pursuant to the Buyout Order, parties agreed to appoint Mr Richard Hayler of FTI Consulting (Singapore) Pte Ltd (“FTI”), with agreed terms of reference. Mr Hayler subsequently completed the valuation and produced a report (“the Report”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The Report was the subject of the present applications.

On 22 October 2019, Mr Feen and the remaining defendants in S 294/2017 filed Originating Summons No 1324 of 2019 (“OS 1324/2019”) challenging the Report. On 2 March 2020, I dismissed OS 1324/2019 and ordered that the purchase price of Viking Engineering’s shareholding in the third defendant, VIG, be fixed at the price set by the Report.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> The defendants have appealed against my decision and I now set out my reasons in full.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 Viking Engineering and Mr Feen were joint venture partners in VIG. On 4 April 2017, Viking Engineering commenced S 294/2017, as minority shareholders of VIG, for minority oppression under s 216 of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed). In these grounds, the term “the defendants” refers to the defendants in S 294/2017, notwithstanding that they are the plaintiffs in OS 1324/2019. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 S 294/2017 arose out of a sale and purchase agreement dated 10 September 2013 between Viking Engineering and Mr Feen in relation to VIG. By this agreement, Viking Engineering, at that time a 51% shareholder in VIG, sold a 21% shareholding in VIG to Mr Feen, thereby giving Mr Feen a 70% shareholding in VIG. This resulted in Viking Engineering holding a remaining 30% shareholding in VIG. Mr Feen was obliged to abide by various undertakings in return, including an undertaking to change the corporate name of VIG to Feen Marine Pte Ltd, the same name that was later used for the second defendant (“Feen Marine”). Mr Feen is the sole director of Feen Marine, the fourth defendant, Scanjet Feen IGS Pte Ltd (“Scanjet Feen”), and the fifth defendant, Feen Marine Scrubbers Pte Ltd (“Feen Marine Scrubbers”), collectively referred to as “the Feen Companies”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 Viking Engineering’s initial claim in S 294/2017 included contentions that, in breach of the sale and purchase agreement, Mr Feen failed to change the name of VIG to Feen Marine and instead incorporated a company of the same name. This is the second defendant. Mr Feen thereafter transferred his entire shareholding in VIG to Feen Marine. The business and corporate opportunities of VIG were said to have subsequently been diverted to Feen Marine and Scanjet Feen. In particular, these corporate opportunities related to the supply of oil discharge monitors, contracts for the supply of inert gas systems (“IGS”) and exhaust gas cleaning services (“ECGS”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 Viking Engineering then followed on with Summons No 4101 of 2017 seeking summary judgment in S 294/2017. On 24 November 2017, leave was given to Viking Engineering to amend its prayers in the summons to include a buy-out of Viking Engineering’s shares in VIG by Mr Feen. After considering the augmented arguments on 14 February 2018, I granted an injunction to restrain Mr Feen and his agents from using the name “Viking” in any manner which may compete with the business of Viking Engineering or be associated with or perceived to be associated with Viking Engineering or the business of Viking Engineering. I also ordered Mr Feen to purchase Viking Engineering’s entire shareholding in VIG, with an independent valuer to be appointed by agreement within 14 days of final judgment to ascertain the fair value of the shares. Unconditional leave to defend was given on the remainder of the claims.  These claims were subsequently settled by parties on 6 July 2018

On the same date, in the course of finalising the form of the final orders, parties agreed that the cost of the valuation exercise would be borne by Mr Feen.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 Subsequently, on or around 21 May 2018, the parties agreed on the draft Terms of Reference for the valuer.

</div> The terms of FTI’s appointment reflected that the first defendant, Mr Feen, was to bear the costs of the valuation exercise.

On 8 March 2019, pursuant to Viking Engineering filing Summons No 5784 of 2018, I set a timeframe for Mr Feen to pay pursuant to O 45 r 6(2) of the ROC: see <span class="font-italic">Viking Engineering Pte Ltd v Feen, Bjornar and others </span>[2019] SGHC 158 (“<span class="font-italic">Viking Engineering v Feen (No 1)</span>”).

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Bjornar Feen’s 1st Affidavit (OS 1324/2019) at para 17.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> The Report formed the subject matter of these present applications. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The applications: context and issues</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 On 16 September 2019, Viking Engineering took out an application in SUM 4610/2019 for Mr Feen to pay the purchase price at the valuation set by the Report for the Shares within seven days of the order. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 On 22 October 2019, the defendants filed OS 1324/2019 seeking a declaration that the Report was not final and binding, or that it be set aside or otherwise disregarded. They argued that Mr Hayler had departed from his instructions and that there were manifest errors in the valuation, raising specific complaints that will be addressed in detail below. In support, they also tendered a report from Mr Mark Collard (“Mr Collard”) of KPMG. In their view, the valuer’s mandate was to be determined from the Buyout Order primarily. Further, they argued that their conduct in the valuation process could not be held against them. In response to SUM 4610/2019, the defendants argued that Viking Engineering had not proved that Mr Feen had no intention to pay and, further, that Mr Feen lacked the financial ability to pay S$13.2 million. They argued therefore that no order under O 45 r 6(2) of the ROC should be made.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 At the hearing, parties had also made respective applications for leave to admit further affidavits in support of their respective cases. In Summons No 751 of 2020 (“SUM 751/2020”), the defendants filed two further affidavits from Mr Feen to put in VIG’s annual financial statements in order to illustrate their points on the financial position of the company. I granted leave to admit these affidavits and Viking Engineering decided not file an affidavit in response, preferring for the hearing to carry on as scheduled. In Summons No 793 of 2020 (“SUM 793/2020”), Viking Engineering sought leave to file a further affidavit to elaborate on Mr Feen’s conduct. The defendants had a right of response and Viking Engineering decided not to pursue the application in the interests of having SUM 4610/2019 dealt with on the same date. I thus granted leave for Viking Engineering to withdraw SUM 793/2020.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14   The single central issue in this case was whether the Report is binding between the parties or whether it should be set aside. It was common ground that the Report, being an expert determination, may only be set aside on one or more of the following three grounds (see <span class="font-italic">The Oriental Insurance Co Ltd v Reliance National Asia Re Pte Ltd</span> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 385 (“<span class="font-italic">Oriental Insurance</span>”) at [47]; and also <span class="font-italic">Poh Cheng Chew v K P Koh &amp; Partners Pte Ltd and another</span> [2014] 2 SLR 573 at [36]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) where the expert materially departed from instructions;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) where there is a manifest error in the expert’s determination that justly requires judicial intervention; or</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) there was fraud, corruption, collusion, dishonesty, bad faith, bias, or the like. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In the present case, only the first two grounds were in issue.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 For the reasons that follow, I decided that Mr Hayler had not materially departed from his instructions, nor was there any manifest error in the Report. In the result, I dismissed OS 1324/2019 and fixed the price for the purchase of Viking Engineering’s shares in VIG at S$13.2 million, the valuation stated in the Report. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Was there material departure from instructions?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 The defendants contended that Mr Hayler had departed from his instructions. In <span class="font-italic">Oriental Insurance</span> at [48], Chan Seng Onn J adopted the <span class="font-italic">dictum</span> in <span class="font-italic">Jones v Sherwood Computer Services Plc</span> [1992] 1 WLR 277 at 287, which provides a two-step approach to this issue (see also <span class="font-italic">Evergreat Construction Co Pte Ltd v Presscrete Engineer Pte Ltd</span> [2006] 1 SLR(R) 634 (“<span class="font-italic">Evergreat</span>”) at [41]): </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) first, the court should determine what the parties had agreed to remit to the expert; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) second, the question is whether “the expert departed from his instructions in a material respect”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 The defendants’ contentions went to both aspects of the two-step test. Various aspects of Viking Engineering’s arguments related to the LOE which, the defendants argued, formed the context for Mr Hayler’s mandate. The second aspect was the issue of whether Mr Hayler departed from his mandate in a material aspect. Once it is established that there was a departure from instructions, it would be considered material “unless it can truly be characterised as trivial or de minimis in the sense of it being obvious that it could make no possible difference to either party”: <span class="font-italic">Veba Oil Supply &amp; Trading GmbH v Petrotrade Inc</span> [2002] 1 All ER 703 (“<span class="font-italic">Veba </span><span class="font-italic">Oil</span>”) at [26], quoted by <span class="font-italic">Oriental Insurance</span> at [57]. In this context, the defendants contended that there were several departures. Further, the defendants submitted that Mr Hayler’s determination was qualified, and therefore not a binding determination made in compliance with his mandate: see <span class="font-italic">Yashwant Bajaj v Toru Ueda</span> [2020] 1 SLR 36 (“<span class="font-italic">Bajaj</span>”) at [66]–[68]. I deal with these points in turn.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">What had parties agreed to remit to Mr Hayler?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 When a court makes an order under s 216 of the Companies Act for the shares of the minority to be purchased, the court also has the power to determine the “manner in which the value of the shares is to be assessed”, and the overriding principle is that the price should be “fair, just and equitable as between the parties”: <span class="font-italic">Poh Fu Tek</span><span class="font-italic"> and others v Lee Shung Guan and others </span>[2018] 4 SLR 425 at [31]. In the present case, an independent valuer was appointed to determine the price that was fair, just and equitable between the parties, and terms of reference were framed for the purpose. As counsel had indicated to the court that the parties would be able to agree to a valuer, the Buyout Order contained the direction that the parties were to appoint a valuer by agreement. Parties then agreed to appoint Mr Hayler. It was undisputed by the parties that the primary source of Mr Hayler’s instructions was the Buyout Order. Its relevant terms read as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">2.

The defendants, as part of their arguments, disputed these additional terms. I held, however, that so long as the LOE did not contradict the Buyout Order, parties would be at liberty to agree. In principle, parties may resolve aspects of any existing litigious dispute as they see fit. Such delineation would form a compromise on the areas thus agreed. As Lord Mustill stated in <span class="font-italic">Channel Tunnel Group Ltd v Balfour Beatty Construction Ltd</span> [1993] AC 334 at 353 (quoted in <span class="font-italic">Evergreat</span> at [34]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[T]hose who make agreements for the resolution of disputes must show good reasons for departing from them … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Therefore, so long as there is no contradiction with the Buyout Order, Mr Hayler cannot be said to have departed from his instructions if he had exercised his authority and discretion as given by the LOE. I dealt with the contentions of material departure in this context.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Was there a material departure from his remit?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 The defendants alleged several departures from instructions. Their primary assertion was that Mr Hayler had given a qualified determination, and I deal with that issue first. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Did Mr Hayler give a qualified determination?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 It was common ground that a qualified determination would be a material departure from instructions. It was important here, to first consider what Mr Hayler was to furnish under the Buyout Order and LOE. This was an expert’s determination of the value of the Shares, which was to be the price at which Mr Feen was to purchase those Shares.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 The defendants relied on<span class="font-italic"> Shorrock Ltd and another v Meggit plc</span> [1991] BCC 471 (“<span class="font-italic">Shorrock</span>”), where the experts, the joint auditors, were asked to provide a certificate on a value described as the “October net deficit”. The certificate itself, however, stated the joint auditors were “unable to determine” a key component of the accounts, specifically a provision of monies in respect of potential legal claims. The English Court of Appeal held that because the qualification meant that the requirement of certainty under the agreement was not met, the determination was therefore not binding on the parties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Similarly, in <span class="font-italic">Bajaj</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([17] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic">,</span> an accountant furnished a qualified report. The case concerned the issue of whether a statutory demand should be set aside on the basis that the debts stated therein had not yet accrued: <span class="font-italic">Bajaj</span> at [1]. Mr Bajaj sought to set aside the statutory demand. The parties had entered into a settlement agreement, which provided for an independent accountant to calculate the final sum due from one party to the other. However, the report was qualified, in that the independent accountant concluded that the values reached in his report were <span class="font-italic">subject to adjustments</span>. The Court of Appeal held that the values arrived at were not “final” and therefore did not satisfy the settlement agreement in that case: <span class="font-italic">Bajaj</span> at [65]. At [77], the Court of Appeal concluded:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Ultimately, <span class="font-italic">it was the assessor’s decision</span> to give a qualified opinion, presumably because he felt that he was unable to rely wholly and solely on the documents submitted by Mr Ueda. He could have very well given an unqualified determination based on the documents submitted by Mr Ueda. [emphasis in the original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">It was therefore clear from <span class="font-italic">Bajaj</span> that it was the expert’s qualification that was crucial. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 In this case, unlike the experts in <span class="font-italic">Bajaj</span> or <span class="font-italic">Shorrock</span>, Mr Hayler did not claim that he was not able to proceed with the valuation exercise. Instead, he simply stated that he lacked certain pieces of information, and then proceeded to make assumptions that enabled him to complete his valuation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The defendants relied primarily on a number of statements made by Mr Hayler in the Report, which I set out here:

I found that this did not assist their case.

These statements were made in the context of explaining the process<span class="font-italic"> </span>by which the valuation was conducted. The purpose of those statements was to set out the gaps in information provided, which set the context for explaining how the valuation process compensated for those gaps. The gaps required articulation as part of the process because clauses 7 and 14 of the LOE expressly gave various discretionary powers to Mr Hayler where such gaps existed. For example, para 2.7 of the Report, which was cited by the defendants, was immediately followed by a number of paragraphs which detailed the assumptions that needed to be made in the absence of information.

</div> Paragraphs 3.77 and 3.78 were the concluding paragraphs of a section dedicated to the procedural background of the valuation. As such, the statements cited by the defendants were not qualifications but served as a explanatory preface to remedial steps that were then taken by Mr Hayler in his valuation process. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Remaining alleged departures from instructions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The defendants advanced three other arguments to contend that Mr Hayler materially departed from his instructions, which they argued were governed strictly by the Buyout Order. First, Mr Hayler failed to apply a discount for lack of marketability. Second, Mr Hayler made various assumptions that were not in accordance with his mandate. Third, Mr Hayler did not consider what business was diverted from VIG. In this context of the diverted contracts, he also failed to consider what contracts were physically impossible for VIG to have performed. I deal with each in turn.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) No discount for lack of marketability</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 The defendants highlighted that Mr Hayler did not apply a discount for the lack of marketability. At para 5.35 of the Report, Mr Hayler explained:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The Court Order directs that no minority discount or discount for lack of marketability should apply to the valuation of the [Viking Engineering]’s shares in VIG. I therefore do not consider this issue in my report. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 It was not disputed that this stated source was erroneous: the Buyout Order did not in fact direct that no discount for lack of marketability was to be applied. It was silent on that issue. Mr Hayler made a mistake as to the source of that condition.  Nevertheless, there was a valid source of this condition in cl 5(c) of the LOE, to which the parties had agreed, as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">5. The valuation, for the purposes of the Determination, will be based on the following assumptions:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) That no discount should be applied to the value of the [Viking Engineering]’s shares in the Company to reflect that these shares represent a minority shareholding in the Company <span class="font-italic">or the lack of marketability of the shares</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 The defendants first took the position in submissions that the LOE was irrelevant. At the hearing, they then took the position that the LOE was inconsistent with the Buyout Order. I did not see any such inconsistency. The discount for minority interest and the discount for lack of marketability are two different issues, as the factors to be determined in relation to each are distinct and separate. Whereas the court would usually deal with whether a discount for minority interest should be applied, the question of whether to apply a discount for non-marketability, as Judith Prakash JA stated in <span class="font-italic">Thio Syn Kym Wendy and others v Thio Syn Pyn and another </span>[2018] SGHC 54 (“<span class="font-italic">Thio Syn Kym</span>”) at [32], “should ordinarily be left to be determined by the independent valuer in his expertise.” In <span class="font-italic">Liew </span><span class="font-italic">Kit Fah and others v Koh Keng Chew and others</span> [2019] SGCA 78 at [59], the Court of Appeal explained that the lack of marketability was industry specific and for that reason agreed with the view expressed in <span class="font-italic">Thio Syn K</span><span class="font-italic">ym</span>. That being the legal context, given that no direction on a discount for marketability was given by the court, parties were able to decide and agree with each other on this question of whether or not the discount for lack of marketability should apply. They were in the best position to understand their own industry, it was open to them to refine and narrow the remit of the valuer, and they did so. “It is simply the law of contract”, as Lord Denning MR explained in <span class="font-italic">Campbell v Edwards</span> [1976] 1 WLR 403 at 407 (cited by V K Rajah J (as he then was) in <span class="font-italic">Evergreat</span> ([16] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [27]). Plainly, Mr Hayler’s decision not to apply a discount for the lack of marketability could not be said to constitute a departure from his remit.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Reliance on assumptions</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The defendants then argued that Mr Hayler was not entitled to rely on assumptions in order to arrive at his determination.

Relying on Mr Collard’s report, the defendants argued that Mr Hayler was effectively “valuing his own numbers”, which was not what he was mandated to do. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The first step is to consider what the parties remitted to Mr Hayler to determine. I agreed with Viking Engineering that neither the Buyout Order nor the LOE dictated what methodology the expert was to use. As to the specific sources of information that Mr Hayler was to have regard to, the Buyout Order stated at para 2(d) that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The valuer shall have regard to any and all financial information and records of [VIG] from the time of its [in]corporation until the valuer completes the exercise contemplated by the Order <span class="font-italic">as the valuer may deem necessary, relevant or desirable </span>for the purposes of ascertaining the purchase price or otherwise for carrying out the termination of this order. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The Buyout Order clearly gave the valuer a wide discretion to determine how he was to have regard to the financial information and records of VIG. As for other assumptions, there was nothing in the Buyout Order that mandated or excluded certain assumptions, other than the conditions expressly stated at para 2(c) (the minority discount), and paras 2(e)–2(f) (the diverted business). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Similarly, the LOE granted the valuer wide discretion.

Therefore, the LOE did not mandate Mr Hayler to abandon the valuation if he determined that necessary or useful information was still missing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Having determined the scope of Mr Hayler’s instructions, I turn to the issue of whether the assumptions made amounted to a material departure. I found that they did not. Mr Collard, in his report, stated that he agreed in principle with the Discounted Cash Flow (“DCF”) and comparative analysis approaches. The use of these various methodologies would require the use of assumptions in application. It was the application of the methodology and specific assumptions used that Mr Collard criticised.

</div>
</div>
</div> In this regard, it was not the court’s role to assess if the assumptions were correct, but whether Mr Hayler had materially departed from his instructions by making the assumptions. In light of the discretion given to Mr Hayler described above, I could not agree that there were departures. Mr Hayler had decided, well within the bounds of his discretion, to use the DCF and comparative approaches which themselves required the use of assumptions and estimations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 I deal with two more of the defendants’ arguments here. First, they argued that the timelines under the LOE were mere guidelines, and therefore, there was no real need for Mr Hayler to have proceeded with the valuation without the necessary information. In my view, Mr Hayler could not be criticised for seeking to complete the valuation with regard to the timeline that the parties had themselves agreed to. While clauses 31 and 32 of the LOE provided that Mr Hayler “will aim” to complete the valuation within six weeks, and to complete the report within three weeks after the end of valuation, it was also envisaged that Mr Hayler would have to inform parties of any delay and to provide an explanation. In any case, it is clear that cl 14 allowed Mr Hayler to proceed in the absence of information and even to draw adverse inferences. Second, the defendants argued that Mr Hayler should have applied to court directly for directions when it was clear that information was not forthcoming. I did not find this argument relevant at all, since I had already determined above that Mr Hayler had the discretion to proceed as he did. Mr Hayler’s actions were therefore unobjectionable.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Diversion of business</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 In accordance with para 2(e) of the Buyout Order and cl 5(d) of the LOE, Mr Hayler was required to ascertain the fair value of the Shares, with the assumption that VIG had undertaken all the business of IGS and ECGS that was diverted away from it to any one or more of the Feen Companies from the date of each of their incorporations until the date on which the valuation exercise was completed.

</div> but failed to engage the issue. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 In this context, I was concerned only with determining if Mr Hayler had departed from his instructions and not whether Mr Hayler had made any errors in his approach to the assumptions regarding the diverted businesses. As Chan J stated in <span class="font-italic">Oriental Insurance</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([14] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [54]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">As a general proposition, so long [as] the expert has answered the question put to him; his determination is binding even if he may have answered it wrongly. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The pertinent issue for me to decide is therefore whether Mr Hayler had directed himself to value VIG on the assumption that the diverted business was performed by VIG. In my view, there was no doubt that he had done so. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The first step is to consider the scope of the instructions. Neither the Buyout Order nor the LOE contained specific instructions as to the method by which the adjustment was to be made, other than conferring upon the independent valuer the broad discretion to have “regard” to the “financial information and records” of the relevant entities “as the valuer may deem necessary, relevant or desirable”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 The next question, then, is whether Mr Hayler did adjust the purchase price on the required assumption. I found that he did. First, at para 4.27 of the Report, Mr Hayler had regard to the various figures and documents provided to conclude that there were business diversions in 2016.

</div> Second, at paras 5.15 and 5.16 of the Report, after noting the defendants’ failure to comply with his information requests, Mr Hayler explained how he proceeded to value VIG taking into account the diverted business.
                   <sup><button class="btn btn-link superscript-btn" data-target="#fn-49740881-88da-4973-ba97-dc682084fc0d" data-toggle="modal" type="button">20</button></sup>

</div>
</div>
</div> Third, Mr Hayler considered whether VIG’s revenue was attributable to the businesses stated at para 2(f)(i) of the Buyout Order. He then implemented the adjustment by taking a broad assumption that VIG’s revenue in 2015, the year before the diversions started, would have grown in line with industry growth.

</div>
</div> These steps were all directed at answering the question of how the purchase price should be adjusted to account for the diverted business. Therefore, there was no basis for the defendants’ assertion that Mr Hayler departed from his instructions here.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 An assessment of physical impossibility also formed a part of Mr Hayler’s consideration of this issue. As noted above, under para 2(f)(ii) of the Buyout Order, all the goodwill and revenue earned from the diverted business was to be attributed to VIG, unless the goodwill or revenue arose from a contract that would have been physically impossible for VIG to have earned. The defendants argued that Mr Hayler had not considered this at all. I disagreed, for reasons that follow.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 First, I found the defendants’ characterisation of the instructions to the valuer to be misconceived.
                   <sup><button class="btn btn-link superscript-btn" data-target="#fn-19710715-5f35-406d-9705-9232942c1ef8" data-toggle="modal" type="button">22</button></sup>

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> In my view, no particular methodology was prescribed under the Buyout Order or LOE. In other words, para 2(f)(ii) of the Buyout Order did not necessarily require Mr Hayler to ask, as the defendants claimed, whether a particular contract was physically impossible to perform. All it required was for him to exclude the goodwill and revenue from contracts that were physically impossible to perform. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Second, on that basis, I found that Mr Hayler had turned his mind to consider what goodwill and revenue was to be excluded. At paras 5.25 and 5.26 of the Report, Mr Hayler set out the parties’ respective positions on this issue.
                   <sup><button class="btn btn-link superscript-btn" data-target="#fn-671a26be-33d6-450c-b603-e9a995f709bb" data-toggle="modal" type="button">23</button></sup>

</div> At para 5.27, he stated the condition found in cl 5(g) of the LOE, which reflected para 2(f)(ii) of the Buyout Order, stating, “I therefore consider that I am required to address it for the purposes of my determination”. His conclusion was stated at paras 5.28–5.31 of the Report. First, he found that the defendants had failed to provide sufficient evidence to prove that the relevant business was physically impossible. I saw no reason to disagree with Mr Hayler’s application of the burden of proof. Second, Mr Hayler considered that a contemporary business does not need to conduct of all its own operations but can outsource parts of the process. Third, financing would have been available given the growth in the sector.

I was not persuaded by this submission. Mr Hayler clearly quoted from the 7 September 2018 letter and addressed what he saw to be the key issues. It was not for the court to look behind Mr Hayler’s report to consider the adequacy of his treatment of the evidence.

More importantly, Mr Hayler rightly felt the information was not reliable: “Navig8” was elsewhere identified by the defendants’ then-solicitors as one of the companies that had decided not to contract with Mr Feen or VIG or other associated companies since 2016, suggesting that it was a client, not an accountant. Mr Hayler justifiably exercised his discretion, given that that particular document provision period had ended, to continue with the valuation exercise without arranging a meeting.

</div> Second, these fact, if true, must have been known by the defendants prior to their agreement to the appointment of an independent valuer, the design of the procedure, and the terms of the LOE.

First, that the defendants were estopped from complaining about how the valuation exercise continued because they had failed to apply to court when they had represented that they would.

</div>
</div>
</div> This failure to apply to court, contended Viking Engineering, gave rise to an estoppel by representation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 In order for an estoppel to apply to preclude challenge to the Report, there must have been a clear and unequivocal representation that the defendants were willing to accept the result of the valuation that proceeded after the defendants failed to apply to court, <span class="font-italic">however that Report might turn out</span>. But the defendants’ conduct suggested, at most, that they were not going to dispute Mr Hayler’s decision to commence the valuation process <span class="font-italic">at that time</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>in July 2018. They would expect that subsequent documents could be introduced and Mr Hayler would revise the valuation accordingly. What Mr Hayler had stated in his email dated 15 July 2018 was that he would proceed with the valuation and deal with additional documents <span class="font-italic">as they came in</span>, rather than postpone the valuation process; his point was that he was going to commence work based on what he had, <span class="font-italic">and</span> “deal with new documents as they are received”. In that context, even if the defendants’ conduct in response to that email represented that they accepted Mr Hayler’s decision communicated on 15 July 2018, this was not a representation that they would accept whatever valuation Mr Hayler arrived at when he took into account the various documents later made available. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 The fact that Mr Hayler decided to commence the valuation process at that time is not the subject of dispute in the present case. Rather, the defendants’ complaints deal with the substance of Mr Hayler’s valuation <span class="font-italic">after</span> further information was given in later submissions. Their complaint was that, having seen all the information available at the end of the last deadline in September 2018, that Mr Hayler should not have made the determination that he did. I turn then to deal with this aspect of the arguments.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Effect of lack of co-operation</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 What then is the effect of the defendants’ lack of co-operation? Viking Engineering relies on <span class="font-italic">Evergreat</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([16] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), to contend that the defendants may not take advantage of their own wrong to set aside the determination. In <span class="font-italic">Evergreat</span>, Rajah J explained<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [51]–[52] as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The courts accept that in general, a party in default under a contract cannot take advantage of his own wrong: <span class="font-italic">Chitty on Contracts </span>vol 1 (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 29th Ed, 2004) at para 1-025. This long established principle may be relevant in a contractual dispute either as a principle of construction or as a rule of law depending on the circumstances; <span class="font-italic">Kensland Realty Ltd v Whale View Investment Ltd</span> (2001) 4 HKCFAR 381. … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In order to invoke this principle, it must be shown that the contractual right or benefit that a party is asserting or claiming is a direct result of that party’s prior breach of contract. The relevant breach, the factual consequences flowing from that breach, and the advantage the contract breaker is seeking to raise must be identified.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 In contrast, the defendants argued, citing <span class="font-italic">Bajaj </span>([17] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), that this principle did not apply in the present case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Again, the exact scope of the decision in <span class="font-italic">Bajaj</span> is important. The Court of Appeal there accepted the <span class="font-italic">Evergreat</span> principle, but decided that it was not applicable in that case, because the accountant chose to qualify his report: [65]. The Court of Appeal concluded that the contractual benefit that Mr Bajaj asserted was not a direct result of his breach of his duty to co-operate: <span class="font-italic">Bajaj</span> at [77]–[78]. As I had found that Mr Hayler had not qualified his report in this case, the issue of the defendants’ conduct became potentially relevant to the other complaints that Mr Hayler departed from his instructions. I turn then to these specific complaints. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 The decision in <span class="font-italic">Evergreat</span> stands for the proposition that a defendant would not be able assert a contractual right if the right arose from the direct result of its own misconduct: at [52]. Coming to the present case, the contract between parties did not furnish the defendants a right to set aside a validly made determination. In so far as the defendants sought to argue that Mr Hayler’s valuation was manifestly in error or a material departure from instructions, I observe that Viking Engineering had not one rejoinder but two. In my judgment, the parties’ contract in this case allowed for Mr Hayler to use his discretion, and his exercise of such discretion was entirely reasonable. First, his use of discretion was the direct result of the defendants’ own breaches of the duty to co-operate. Second, clauses 7 and 14 of the LOE allowed Mr Hayler to make suitable adjustments in the absence of information. The adjustments Mr Hayler made were the result of the defendants’ conduct, and were effected reasonably: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In relation to the use of assumptions, aspects of Mr Hayler’s reliance on assumptions were a direct result of the defendants’ failure to co-operate and to provide the necessary documents. This is clear from the Report itself, where Mr Hayler discussed the limitations of the information at paras 6.10 and 6.11. The defendants could not complain about Mr Hayler’s use of assumptions to set aside the Report, insofar as the assumptions were necessitated by the absence of information due to the defendants’ breach of the duty to co-operate in the very first place. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) In relation to the diversion of business, again the absence of information arose from the defendants’ failure to co-operate. Mr Hayler’s approach was the direct result of the absence of information about the contracts, VIG, and the Feen Companies. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) In relation to the issue of physical impossibility, the defendants’ failure to provide information on the contracts and the Feen Companies meant that Mr Hayler was constrained to assess the issue of diversion in relatively broad strokes, which also prevented him from undertaking the specific analyses that the defendants now argue he should have done. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 I return to the fundamental point in this case. The LOE and the Buyout Order allowed for Mr Hayler to exercise his discretion in the way that he did. His exercise of his discretion was a direct result of the defendants’ lack of co-operation and breaches of their duties under the parties’ agreed LOE. Therefore, the defendants here, similar to the defendants in <span class="font-italic">Evergreat</span>, could not raise complaints about assumptions or conclusions that arose directly out of their own misconduct. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Was there manifest error in the Report?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 I turn then to the arguments on manifest error. In <span class="font-italic">Geowin</span><span class="font-italic"> Construction Pte Ltd (in liquidation) v Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 1256 </span>[2007] 1 SLR(R) 1004 (“<span class="font-italic">Geowin</span>”), Rajah J summarised the applicable principles as follows (at [19]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If the parties agree that an expert’s decision is final, a court should not inquire (in the absence of a charge of fraud or collusion):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) how a decision has been reached;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) into the basis for the decision; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) whether the decision was indeed correct.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">To do so would be entirely contrary to the parties’ contractual intentions to be bound by an expert’s decision – particularly if the agreement itself expressly stipulates that the decision of the expert is final. I respectfully concur with Lord Denning MR’s view in <span class="font-italic">Campbell v Edwards</span> ([16] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) that the only errors that can be corrected by the court are those that appear on the “<span class="font-italic">face</span>” of the award or report (see at [17] above). In the context of a speaking award, the court should not stray beyond the actual report or award in considering how or why the decision was reached. The underlying evidence ought not to be re-examined or referred to as this would be tantamount to an appellate hearing and to that extent contrary to what the parties had solemnly agreed to.<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> The right of review should be confined to correcting apparent mistakes that appear on the face of the report or award (eg apparent mathematical miscalculations) and to determining whether the expert has complied with the terms of his appointment. If an expert answers the right question in the wrong way his decision will nevertheless be binding:</span> see the decision of Knox J in <span class="font-italic">Nikko Hotels (UK) Ltd v MEPC plc </span>[1991] 2 EGLR 103 at 108. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 At the outset, I note that there is a difference of opinion in the High Court on whether underlying sources may be examined. On one hand, in <span class="font-italic">Oriental Insurance</span> ([14] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic">,</span> the court had regard to underlying sources to understand the IA’s reasoning. On the other hand, the courts in <span class="font-italic">Geowin</span> and<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Teo Lay Gek and another v Hoang Trong Binh and others</span> [2019] SGHC 84 (“<span class="font-italic">Teo Lay Gek</span>”) preferred the view that in considering the report, the court should not stray from errors appearing on “the face of the report”.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 In the present case, irrespective of the approach I adopted, this would not make a difference to the end result. In my view, the difference between the two approaches only goes to the narrow issue of what the court should look at in deciding if there is a manifest error. In <span class="font-italic">Oriental Insurance</span> at [89], the court’s reference to other sources was made only in order to understand the IA’s approach and reasoning, not to expand the scope of what constituted a manifest error. <span class="font-italic">Oriental Insurance </span>certainly did not go so far as to suggest that the court was to decide if the expert was correct in his approach and reasoning, but only that it would be useful for the court, at times, to consider other documents to assist it in comprehending the expert’s determination. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 On <span class="font-italic">both</span> approaches, the threshold for a manifest error remains a high one. I summarise the applicable principles as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) a manifest error is an error that is obvious (<span class="font-italic">Veba Oil</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([17] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [33]), or patent (<span class="font-italic">Geowin</span> at [16]); </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) a manifest error is an error that is “obviously capable of affecting the determination” (<span class="font-italic">Veba Oil</span> at [33]; <span class="font-italic">Oriental Insurance</span> at [86]);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) a manifest error is an error that admits “of no difference of opinion” (<span class="font-italic">Veba Oil</span> at [33]); and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) arithmetic miscalculations (<span class="font-italic">Oriental Insurance</span> at [90]), mistakes as to the identity of parties (<span class="font-italic">Legal &amp; General Life of Australia Ltd v A Hudson Pty Ltd</span> (1985) 1 NSWLR 314 (“<span class="font-italic">Legal &amp; General Life</span>”) at 335 quoted by <span class="font-italic">Geowin</span> at [17]) or a reference to a building that does not exist (<span class="font-italic">Walton Homes Ltd v Staffordshire County Council</span> [2013] EWHC 2554 (Ch) (“<span class="font-italic">Walton Homes</span>”) at [46]) are all examples of manifest errors.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 In contrast, a failure to take into account relevant considerations or a decision to take into account irrelevant considerations (<span class="font-italic">Legal &amp; General Life</span> at 335, cited by <span class="font-italic">Geowin</span> at [17]), errors in judgment (<span class="font-italic">eg </span>treating as good debts that turn out to be bad, or omitting losses that were not known at the time: <span class="font-italic">Walton </span><span class="font-italic">Homes</span> at [9] citing <span class="font-italic">Lindley &amp; Banks on Partnership</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 19th Ed, 2010) at para 10-73), mistakes in the expert’s reasoning process (<span class="font-italic">Holt</span><span class="font-italic"> v Cox </span>(1997) 23 ACSR 590<span class="font-italic"> </span>at 596, quoted by <span class="font-italic">Geowin</span> at [18]) and even negligent valuations (<span class="font-italic">Evergreat</span> ([16] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [28]; <span class="font-italic">Teo Lay Gek</span> at [46]) are not regarded as manifest errors.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Criticism of valuation methodology</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 The defendants argued that Mr Hayler’s approach to valuation was a manifest error.

</div> I was not convinced that there was an error.

The defendants complained that Mr Hayler had only used the estimates stated in the summaries to the reports, and that Mr Hayler had failed to distinguish between the different sectors (marine, industrial and aviation) and between the different geographic sectors. The defendants argued that Mr Hayler should have used estimates that were more relevant instead.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 In his analysis, Mr Hayler first identified the “major global players” in the global IGS market at paras 4.28–4.29 of the Report. He then noted that the global IGS and EGCS markets were projected to have strong growth of at least 20% per year from 2017 to 2025. He noted that the global IGS market was projected to grow at a CAGR of 21% and 24.1% up to 2022 and 2026 respectively, and the EGCS market was projected to grow at a CAGR of around 45.8% and 40% up to 2022 and 2025 respectively.

</div> In Appendix 4 of the Report, Mr Hayler set out a more detailed analysis of the IGS and EGCS markets, showing how he derived the figures that he relied on in the body of the Report. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 I was unable to find any manifest error in Mr Hayler’s valuation. The defendants’ criticisms revealed a difference in opinion, which is not a matter within the court’s purview. The defendants argued that the CAGR was mistaken because there were better estimates that were more relevant for VIG’s business, but Mr Hayler had proceeded on a different basis based on his professional judgment. The question of what rates to use in projecting revenue, as well as adjustments to make, are matters of professional expertise. In particular, I noted that Mr Hayler provided justification for his use of the reports. For example, in his view, the projected growth rate for the marine sector, which the defendants argued is the relevant one, would have been higher than the estimated rates for the overall IGS market, but he decided to rely on the overall IGS market rates in the exercise of his judgment.

I noted that Mr Collard’s views on the CAGR of 20% were couched in terms of his own professional judgment. In his view, Mr Hayler should have purchased the reports or relied on the accounts of comparable companies. Mr Collard noted that Mr Hayler did not consider whether a small company would have the same access to growth in the market. He concluded that “[g]rowth at 20% per annum sustained for 20 years would be unusual in an industry without some element of new technology”.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Mark Collard’s Report at para 5.24: PBCP, Vol 1, p [546]. </div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> On his analysis, there was nothing wrong<span class="font-italic"> </span>on the face of the valuation, but his views on the appropriate rates and applications differed. The defendants’ arguments did not reveal manifest error but merely disclosed a preference for one expert opinion over another. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Criticism of comparative analysis</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 The defendants criticised Mr Hayler’s comparative analysis because he used two listed companies, Alfa Laval AB (“Alfa Laval”) and Wartsila Oyj Abp (“Wartsila”) as comparable companies. They argued that these two companies were listed companies with significantly larger market capitalisations, that the fact that they were competitors did not mean that they were comparable, and that, relying on Mr Collard’s report, Mr Hayler had erred in failing to apply any adjustments to the multiples used in the analysis. The defendants submitted that even if Mr Hayler was relying on the competitors identified by Mr Feen at VIG’s Annual General Meeting on 1 August 2016, there were also four other companies identified, two of which were local private companies that should have been relied upon instead. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 I did not find the defendants’ arguments compelling. The question of which companies to use as comparable companies for the purpose of the comparative analysis is plainly one for the expert to exercise his judgment on  and on which there may be a difference in opinion. The same goes for what adjustments should be made to the data to account for differences between the comparable companies and the company being valued. In this case, the decisions against which the defendants are mounting their complaint were within the scope of Mr Hayler’s discretion, given that the parties had tasked him to value the shares in VIG. He made the decision to rely on Alfa Laval and Wartsila, and applied adjustments accordingly. Even if there were more appropriate companies to use as comparators, Mr Hayler’s decision not to do so does not amount to a manifest error.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Other contentions of manifest error not supported by expert evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 The defendants also submitted that as at 10 September 2013, when Viking Engineering sold its 21% shareholding to Mr Feen, the valuation of VIG was S$1.14 million. FTI’s analysis which valued VIG at S$44 million, meant that VIG would have grown more than 38.5 times in just 5 years. This scepticism should have been expressed by expert opinion, but it was not. It did not feature in Mr Collard’s analysis. Nor would that fact have escaped Mr Hayler or Mr Collard. It was only asserted by Mr Feen and repeated by counsel in oral argument. As a general matter, it is not impossible for companies to grow by more than many times the growth rate attributed to VIG: without expert evidence, it was impossible to conclude that such growth was not possible. Indeed, Mr Hayler’s expert evidence indicated the contrary. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 The accounts exhibited in Mr Feen’s two additional affidavits did not assist the defendants either. The 2014 accounts had been available in October 2018 but were not made available to Mr Hayler, nor Mr Collard for that matter. In any case, that set of accounts was ultimately not audited as the independent auditor found insufficient evidence for the auditing process to proceed.

</div>
</div> As for the remaining accounts for 2015 and 2016 found in Mr Feen’s 3rd and 4th Affidavits, although these appear to have been completed around 30 November 2019 or later, whatever documents they were based upon could and ought to have been shared with Mr Hayler. The defendants did not do so. In addition, there was no legal basis shown by the defendants that would enable the court to consider such financial statements in preference to My Hayler’s determination as parties’ appointed expert. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 I noted also that while Mr Collard criticised Mr Hayler’s analysis, he did not attempt to put a competing valuation before the court.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 While, in each case where the court orders a valuation, it retains judicial supervision over the expert, the court will be slow to find that the valuation is in error, since by appointing an expert in the first place the court has taken the position that the matter is best left to the expert: <span class="font-italic">NK v NL </span>[2010] 4 SLR 792 at [6], in the context of the valuation of a court-appointed independent expert, which the Court of Appeal considered as analogous to that of a party-appointed expert. In this case, parties have by agreement further delineated the expert’s scope in the LOE, and by that same LOE, permitted the valuer to make the determination which he has reasonably made. The defendants, after choosing to tarry and failing to co-operate, wished to set aside a Report that was clearly envisaged in parties’ agreed LOE and entirely consistent with the Buyout Order; and to appoint a new valuer. While they have adduced expert evidence, such evidence only related to preferences in valuation methodology, and did not indicate any material departure from instructions or manifest error, nor was any other valuation suggested. There was no proper or substantial basis for the defendants’ application to set aside the Report. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 Having decided the central issue against the defendants, I dismissed OS 1324/2019.  I would also note that the more appropriate means for parties seeking to set aside an expert’s determination would have been through an application within S 294/2017 to seek the court’s directions under the Buyout Order. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85  SUM 4610/2019, on the other hand, was an application for a court order pursuant to O 45 r 6(2) of the ROC for Mr Feen to make the purchase within 7 days. The power to grant such an order is discretionary, premised on sufficient evidence to justify the requested order: see <span class="font-italic">Mok Kah Hong v Zhong Zhuan Yao</span> [2016] 3 SLR 1 at [45]–[46]. The defendants made the point that Mr Feen’s lack of an intention not to comply with the order directing purchase of the Shares was not clearly shown. By the time of the hearing, he had filed OS 1324/2019 to set aside the Report. At the hearing, in the light of my indication that I would set the price at the valuation determined in the Report, Viking Engineering decided not to pursue an order under O 45 r 6(2) of the ROC.
