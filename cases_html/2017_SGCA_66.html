</div> </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The question before the court</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 The question before us was whether the Relevant Provisions provided the court with the power to sentence the applicant to reformative training even though he was above 21 years old on the date of the Second Breach Action. The answer turned on the meaning of the phrase “if he had just been convicted” in s 9(5) of the POA. While we accepted that in practice, offenders could be more than 21 years old when they were sentenced to reformative training, that was due to the fact that those offenders were convicted when they were just under 21 years old and by the time the pre-sentence reports were ready and they appeared in court again for sentencing, they had just turned 21 years old. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 The applicant’s situation was different. Although he was convicted on the Original Offence when he was under 21 years old, he breached his probation twice thereafter and was therefore subject to re-sentencing for his Original Offence under s 9(5) of the POA. The question therefore was whether the “Forward-looking Approach” or the “Backward-looking Approach” should be used by the court to interpret the Relevant Provisions. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Our decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 In our judgment, the Forward-looking Approach, in which an offender’s date of conviction on his original offence was brought forward to the date of the breach proceedings, was consistent with a plain and purposive reading of the Relevant Provisions. It was also the more logical approach. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Where an offender has breached his probation order, s 9(5) of the POA requires the court in the breach proceedings to deal with the offender for his original offence as “if he had just been convicted” on that offence, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, convicted on the date of the breach proceedings. As s 305(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the CPC determines the date of an offender’s eligibility for reformative training as “the day of his conviction”, an offender who is above 21 years old on the day of the breach proceedings does not qualify for and cannot be ordered to undergo reformative training. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The word “just” in the phrase “if he had just been convicted” in s 9(5) of the POA embodies the Forward-looking Approach as its effect is to bring the conviction forward in time so that the court in the breach proceedings is deemed to be the court that convicted the offender despite the fact that the offender had been convicted earlier by the original court. The Forward-looking Approach does not mean that the offender is actually convicted on the date of the breach proceedings. Instead, the court treats the offender as being notionally convicted on the date of breach proceedings for the purposes of re-sentencing him on that date. The deeming effect is necessary because the offender cannot be convicted a second time on the same offence. This means that in the present case, the date of the applicant’s Second Breach Action is treated as the notional date on which he was convicted on the Original Offence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The same approach was adopted by the English Court of Criminal Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Evans</span>. The relevant portion of the decision in <span class="font-italic">Evans</span> is as follows (at 988–989):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">This court is of opinion that the fallacy in the argument set out above is that it disregards the presence of the word “just” in the phrase “if it had just convicted him.” <span class="font-italic">The statute does not require the second court to put itself back in the position of the original court at the moment of conviction</span>; and although the statute says that the second court may deal with the offender in any manner in which it would deal with him if it had “just” convicted him, <span class="font-italic">that does not mean that the second court has in fact just convicted him; it has not</span>. The second court is dealing with an offender who, since his conviction, <span class="font-italic">may have reached an age when he qualifies for corrective training or preventive detention;</span> <span class="font-italic">he may have become too old for Borstal training</span>; and the court has the advantage of hearing how he has behaved himself since the probation order was first made. The second court must deal with the offender <span class="font-italic">in the light of all the circumstances and conditions which exist at the time when it deals with him</span>, not those which existed when he was first convicted, and among them is the circumstance that a valid order or valid orders made against him by the first court is or are still in existence. … [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The applicant found support for his position from the English court’s observation that “if it has just convicted him…..does not mean that the second court has in fact just convicted him; it has not”. This statement appears to suggest that the day of conviction should be taken as the day when an offender is convicted on his original offence and it is not brought forward to the day of the breach proceedings. However, a closer look at the above quoted passage reveals otherwise. The English court expressly noted that “[t]he statute does not require the second court to put itself back in the position of the original court at the moment of conviction”. The natural consequence therefore is that the court in the breach proceedings would also have to consider whether the offender has “reached an age” where he “may have become too old for Borstal training”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The Forward-looking Approach makes sense because the court in the breach proceedings is re-sentencing the applicant for breaching his probation. It would therefore need to be apprised of all the matters that had transpired since he was sentenced for the Original Offence. This would include matters favourable to the applicant, such as his good conduct and cooperation during probation (apart from the commission of further offences). At the same time, this approach would necessitate the consideration that the applicant had since turned 21 years old and was therefore ineligible for reformative training. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 The Backward-looking Approach, however, requires the court to deal with the applicant as if the events that had transpired since the Original Offence did not take place. This would be highly artificial and would require the court to ignore the obvious fact that the applicant was now over 21 years old and that he had committed multiple further offences on several occasions after being placed on probation for the Original Offence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 The applicant suggested that a variant of the Backward-looking Approach should be adopted. He accepted that the court in the Second Breach Action should deal with him based on the facts and circumstances existing at the time of that breach action but argued that the court should treat his age as that on the date of first conviction on the Original Offence, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that he should be considered to be below 21 years old at the time of the Second Breach Action so that reformative training remained a sentencing option for him. In our opinion, there was simply no basis for such an unprincipled approach where the court would consider everything that had happened except the fact that the applicant was now older and more than 21 years in age. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Our interpretation of s 9(5) of the POA would apply also to s 7(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the POA. Section 7(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the POA applies to situations where an offender breaches his probation due to non-compliance with the requirements of his probation order (and not because of the commission of a further offence as in the case of s 9(5) of the POA). In such cases, the court in the breach proceedings would treat the offender as having been convicted notionally on the date of the breach proceedings for the purpose of determining how to deal with him for the original offence. However, the said section also provides alternatively that the court may order continuation of the probation order and impose a fine of up to $1,000 or order detention in prison for up to 14 days.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Consistent with parliamentary intent</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The Forward-looking Approach is consistent with parliamentary intent as it promotes the object and purpose of s 9(5) of the POA and the reformative training regime. Section 9(5) of the POA deals specifically with reoffenders. While rehabilitation remains a relevant sentencing consideration, there is also a heightened need for deterrence when the court deals with an offender who reoffends while on probation (<span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v </span><span class="font-italic">Koh Wen Jie Boaz</span> [2016] 1 SLR 334 at [59(a)]). The Forward-looking Approach promotes the objective of deterrence. This approach causes an offender to take into consideration the fact that he might be subject to a more severe punishment for his original offence once he is above 21 years old should he choose to reoffend whilst on probation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 We accept that there could be offenders who, having been convicted shortly before they turn 21 years old, cross that age by the time they are sentenced to undergo reformative training. The reformative training regime, however, already contemplates the possibility of individuals above 21 years old undergoing reformative training. The reformative training regime bifurcates the conviction and the sentencing of the offender. The law requires an offender’s eligibility for reformative training to be determined on the “day of his conviction” (s 305(1) of the CPC). It also requires the court to call for a report to determine the offender’s suitability for reformative training before ordering him to undergo such (s 305(3) of the CPC). Therefore, there will be offenders who were slightly below 21 in age when convicted but who were slightly above 21 years old at the date of sentencing. Further, the minimum period of reformative training is 18 months and the entire period could extend to 36 months (reg 3 of the RTR). Therefore, an individual who is sentenced to undergo reformative training just before he turns 21 could be close to 24 by the time he is released. The fact that there could be offenders above 21 years old undergoing reformative training was alluded to by Parliament when reformative training was first introduced into Singapore. It was recognised that “[p]risoners do not remain tidily in one age group during the period of their sentences” (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</span> (5 December 1956) vol 2 at col 1069 (W. A. C. Goode, Chief Secretary)).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The Backward-looking Approach and the narrower variant advocated by the applicant, however, have the potential of introducing a pool of offenders that could be much older than the existing mix. The law states that a probation order can extend up to three years (s 5(1) of the POA). An offender who is placed on the full period of probation before he turns 21 years old may breach his probation by reoffending before he turns 24 years old. Under the Backward-looking Approach, he would still be eligible for reformative training. Assuming he breaches his probation order and then absconds for a few years before he is arrested, he would be significantly older by the time of his breach action. The applicant is presently 24 years old but, as can be seen from this discussion, the Backward-looking Approach could result in offenders who are significantly older than that being eligible for and entering the reformative training regime. That would be contrary to the scheme of reformative training in Singapore. Of course, the counter-argument would be that although the much older offender is still eligible for reformative training, his age could be considered an impediment which makes him unsuitable for reformative training. Nevertheless, we think the Forward-looking Approach accords with both a plain and a purposive reading of the Relevant Provisions.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Application to the facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Based on the Forward-looking Approach, the applicant, having crossed the age of 21 on the date of the Second Breach Action, would be ineligible for reformative training. However, even if reformative training was available as a sentencing option, in view of the multiple offences that he had committed, not once but twice while on probation, he should not be sentenced to undergo reformative training. The applicant’s multiple offences were not just regulatory offences. They fell clearly within the realm of intentional criminal action affecting others. They showed his recalcitrant nature and his attitude towards the court’s efforts to accord him an opportunity to make things right without having to spend time in prison and to suffer caning for the Original Offence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Therefore, even if reformative training was an available sentencing option, it would be wrong in principle to sentence the applicant to undergo reformative training. He was given two chances at probation for a serious offence carrying mandatory minimum sentences and had scorned them by committing multiple further offences each time. He will therefore have to bear the consequences of his actions and have to undergo imprisonment as well as caning as ordered by the High Court Judge in MA 63/2016/01. Accordingly, we lifted the stay of execution of caning granted by us on 20 March 2017 (see [11] above). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 For the above reasons, we answered the question of law set out at [2] above in the negative. The applicant was not eligible for reformative training at the time of the Second Breach Proceedings because he had crossed the age of 21. Even if he was eligible, sentencing him to undergo reformative training in his circumstances would be wrong in principle.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Andrew Phang Boon Leong         Judith Prakash   Tay Yong Kwang<br/>Judge of Appeal          Judge of Appeal   Judge of Appeal</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Tan Hee Joek (Tan See Swan &amp; Co) for the applicant;<br/>Mavis Chionh <span class="font-italic">SC</span>, Wong Woon Kwong, Randeep Singh, and Eugene Sng (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the respondent.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
