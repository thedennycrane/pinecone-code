These factors relate to the manner and mode by which the offence was committed as well as the harm caused to the victim. The court should identify precisely where within that sentencing band the offence falls to derive an indicative starting point which reflects the intrinsic seriousness of the offending act: <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>at [39(a)]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 In the present case, as V1 was under 14 years old, a mandatory minimum sentence of eight years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane applied to the Sixth and Eighth Charges under s 376(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Penal Code. This statutory aggravating factor meant that the case “should fall within Band 2 (or even Band 3 if there are additional aggravating factors)”: <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span>at [160]. The fact that V1 was materially younger than the age ceiling stipulated in s 376(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>), having been between ten and 12 years old at the time of the offences, contributed to the intensity of this aggravating factor. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Several other factors added to the gravity of the offences at the first step of the framework.

</div> The accused would have been aware of her low intelligence from their frequent interaction. The accused was entrusted by M with responsibility over V1. On the occasion giving rise to the Sixth Charge, he had assured M that he could take care of V1 while she was away; and at the time of both the Sixth Charge and the Eighth Charge, he had been left alone with V1 in the Flat. This was because of his quasi-paternal relationship with V1, who addressed him as “<span class="font-italic">babak</span>” (meaning “father” in Malay). These circumstances of severe abuse of trust also revealed some degree of premeditation and a deliberate design on the part of the accused to exploit his special access to V1. In particular, on the occasion giving rise to the Sixth Charge, he had deliberately waited until M had left the vicinity of the Flat before committing the offence. At the same time, in misusing his position, he did not take any precautions to protect V1 from the risk of sexually transmitted diseases. Further, in submission to his authority, V1 obeyed the accused’s instruction not to reveal his sexual acts to anyone and the offences against her only came to light in May 2019, some four to 23 months after the offences against her took place. The Child Guidance Clinic at the Institute of Mental Health subsequently found that V1 engaged in acts of self-harm to relieve her stress when she recalled the various acts the accused did to her.

</div> which provided for ten to 15 years’ imprisonment with the statutory mandatory minimum of 12 strokes of the cane. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 At the second step of the framework, I considered the offender-specific aggravating and mitigating factors to ascertain whether there ought to have been any adjustment to the indicative starting point. Here the TIC Charges involving V1 were relevant and very aggravating. The Attempted Rape Charge, the facts of which arose during the course of the Sixth Charge, was grave. The other six charges taken into consideration arose out of separate incidents, two of which involved sexual assault by penetration (the First and Fifth Charges), and three of which involved outrage of modesty (the Second, Third and Fourth Charges). The accused’s early plea of guilt was, however, a mitigating factor, as it obviated the need for the victims to relive and recount their trauma. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The Prosecution’s suggestion of at least 11 years’ imprisonment for each of the SAP Charges

</div> was appropriate. Of relevance was the Court of Appeal’s guidance in <span class="font-italic">BPH</span> that the ten-year sentences imposed in two separate High Court cases were lenient; I deal with this pair of cases at [40]–[42] below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The Prosecution’s suggestion of an additional six months’ imprisonment in lieu of the statutory mandatory minimum of 12 strokes of the cane was also apt. Pursuant to s 325(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (the “CPC”), the accused could not be caned as he was over 50 years old at the time of sentencing. However, an additional term of imprisonment in lieu of caning was warranted in view of the need to compensate for the deterrent and retributive effects of caning that were lost by reason of the accused’s exemption from caning, applying the principles set out in <span class="font-italic">Amin bin Abdullah v Public Prosecutor</span> [2017] 5 SLR 904 (“<span class="font-italic">Amin</span>”) at [59]. The aggravating factors present in this case indicated the need for a high level of general and specific deterrence, and retribution was also a key sentencing consideration given the serious nature of the accused’s offending in relation to the SAP Charges. In view of the totality principle, I adjusted these sentences: see [44] below.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Tenth Charge</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 I turn now to the Tenth Charge. The two-step sentencing framework set out by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>for rape<span class="font-italic"> </span>was transposed to the offence of aggravated outrage of modesty under s 354(2) of the Penal Code in <span class="font-italic">GBR</span><span class="font-italic"> v Public Prosecutor and another appeal </span>[2018] 3 SLR 1048 (“<span class="font-italic">GBR</span>”). This framework is similarly applicable to the offence of outrage of modesty <span class="font-italic">simpliciter </span>under s 354(1), save that the sentencing bands of imprisonment in<span class="font-italic"> GBR </span>should be scaled down linearly to cater to the statutory maximum punishment of two years’ imprisonment for the s 354(1) offence: <span class="font-italic">Kunasekaran</span><span class="font-italic"> s/o Kalimuthu Somasundara v Public Prosecutor </span>[2018] 4 SLR 580 (“<span class="font-italic">Kunasekaran</span>”) at [48]–[49].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The present case fell within Band 2 of the framework, because of the high degree of sexual exploitation involved. The accused had squeezed V2’s breast, thereby intruding into her private parts; and while the accused’s act of squeezing was done over the clothes of V2, it was not merely a fleeting touch. Further, the aggravating factor of the accused’s abuse of his position of responsibility and trust applied equally to V2, who addressed him as “Uncle Joe” and viewed him as a father figure. The accused also took advantage of the fact that V2 would not tell M about the incident because she feared that she would have to return to the children’s home, which she had run away from, if she did so. However, the case fell within the lower end of the spectrum within Band 2 as there was no skin-to-skin touching of V2’s private parts or sexual organs. Applying the principles set out in <span class="font-italic">Amin</span>, the need to compensate for the deterrent and retributive effects of caning was not as significant. I therefore did not impose an additional term of imprisonment in lieu of caning. Thus, the appropriate sentencing range was five to ten months’ imprisonment at the first step. At the second step, the accused’s plea of guilt was mitigating. I took into account the Eleventh Charge, which was a further charge of outrage of modesty against V2 on a separate occasion where the accused had touched the area between V2’s breasts and her stomach over her clothes.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 In <span class="font-italic">Kunasekaran</span>, the accused claimed trial to one charge of outrage of modesty against a 14-year-old girl. He had touched her groin area from outside her school skirt while she was on the bus to school. The High Court Judge found that the sentence of eight months’ imprisonment imposed by the District Judge was not manifestly excessive and dismissed the accused’s appeal against his sentence. The present case was more serious than <span class="font-italic">Kunasekaran</span> because, while the victim in <span class="font-italic">Kunasekaran</span> was several years younger, the accused in <span class="font-italic">Kunasekaran</span> had not been placed in any position of trust or responsibility.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 I was of the view that nine months’ imprisonment for this charge would be sufficient and appropriate, but that in view of the totality principle this sentence should be adjusted downwards: see [44] below.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The aggregate sentence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 In the present case where there were multiple charges, an aggregate sentence that well reflected proportionality and the overall criminality of the accused was the essential issue. The Prosecution sought for the three sentences to run consecutively, with an aggregate sentence of at least 22 years and nine months’ imprisonment with an additional 12 months’ imprisonment in lieu of 24 strokes of the cane.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Two aspects of this particular case were pertinent. First, there were various public interest elements involved. General deterrence arose from a need to “send an unequivocal and uncompromising message to all would-be sex offenders that abusing a relationship or a position of authority in order to gratify sexual impulse will inevitably be met with the harshest penal consequences”: see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v NF </span>[2006] 4 SLR(R) 849 at [42]. Specific deterrence was necessary in the case of this accused, in light of his first targeting V2 and then moving on to V1 with deliberation: see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v </span><span class="font-italic">Law Aik Meng </span>[2007] 2 SLR(R) 814 (“<span class="font-italic">Law </span><span class="font-italic">Aik Meng</span>”) at [22]. The retributive imperative was furthermore engaged. The sentence imposed had to reflect the abhorrence which right-minded members of the public would have towards the offences committed, and encapsulate an appropriate degree of public aversion: see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v </span><span class="font-italic">Kwong Kok Hing</span> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 684 at [17]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Secondly, sentences for unrelated offences which do not form part of a single transaction should generally run consecutively: see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v </span><span class="font-italic">Raveen Balakrishnan </span>[2018] 5 SLR 799 (“<span class="font-italic">Raveen</span><span class="font-italic"> Balakrishnan</span>”) at [41]. In the present case, the two proceeded charges against V1 arose out of separate and distinct occasions. The Tenth Charge concerned another victim altogether in a separate time period. All three proceeded charges could be ordered to run consecutively, and more so in view of the public interests involved. The only limitation was the totality principle. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The first limb of the totality principle requires the court to examine whether the aggregate sentence is substantially above the normal level of sentences for the most serious of the individual offences committed: <span class="font-italic">Mohamed </span><span class="font-italic">Shouffee bin Adam v Public Prosecutor </span>[2014] 2 SLR 998 (“<span class="font-italic">Mohamed </span><span class="font-italic">Shouffee</span>”) at [54]; <span class="font-italic">Raveen</span><span class="font-italic"> Balakrishnan </span>at [73]. In <span class="font-italic">Law </span><span class="font-italic">Aik Meng </span>at [58], the court held that a sentence two years in excess of the relevant ten-year upper limit could not be considered excessive. This first limb was not to be applied rigidly, but as a guideline to ensure that the total sentence remains “proportionate to the gravity of the context” (<span class="font-italic">Law </span><span class="font-italic">Aik Meng</span> at [58]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The second aspect of the totality principle is to ensure that the effect of the aggregate sentence on an offender is not “crushing” but rather, “in keeping with his past record and his future prospects”. It may, for these reasons, be necessary to re-calibrate the individual sentences imposed so as to arrive at an appropriate aggregate sentence: <span class="font-italic">Mohamed </span><span class="font-italic">Shouffee </span>at [57] and [59]; <span class="font-italic">Raveen</span><span class="font-italic"> Balakrishnan</span> at [73].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 In considering these two facets of proportionality, like cases are relevant. The Prosecution relied upon <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v </span><span class="font-italic">BMU</span> [2020] SGHC 231 (“<span class="font-italic">BMU</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v </span><span class="font-italic">BQW </span>[2018] SGHC 136 (“<span class="font-italic">BQW</span>”). In <span class="font-italic">BMU</span>, the accused was convicted of three charges of aggravated sexual assault by digital-vaginal penetration. Twenty-one other charges were taken into consideration, comprising four further charges of sexual assault by penetration and 17 charges of aggravated outrage of modesty under s 354(2) of the Penal Code. The victim was nine to ten years old at the material time and was the daughter of the accused’s girlfriend, and the offences had taken place over a period of 14 months. The accused was sentenced to 11 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane for each charge, with two sentences running consecutively, amounting to an aggregate sentence of 22 years’ imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane.  Although there was only one victim in <span class="font-italic">BMU</span>, there were 24 charges in total, of which seven were aggravated sexual assault by penetration charges committed over seven occasions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 In <span class="font-italic">BQW</span>, the accused, a delivery driver who was over 50 years old at the time of the offences, committed multiple sexual offences against the granddaughter of his employer. The offences began when the victim was seven years old. The accused pleaded guilty to three charges of aggravated sexual assault by digital-vaginal penetration. He was sentenced to ten years’ imprisonment for each sexual assault by penetration charge, with the two sentences running consecutively, amounting to an aggregate sentence of 20 years’ imprisonment. No additional term of imprisonment was imposed in lieu of caning. The present case was more serious in view of the fact that there were two victims, and with whom the accused had a quasi-familial relationship. <span class="font-italic">BQW</span> was also decided prior to <span class="font-italic">BPH</span>.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 The remarks made by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">BPH</span>, in considering two sentencing appeals in respect of BPH and BVZ, are of particular relevance. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 BPH was convicted of two sexual offences against his grandson: one charge of aggravated sexual assault by digital-anal penetration, and one charge of aggravated outrage of modesty for fondling his grandson’s penis. The trial judge had imposed an aggregate sentence of 12 years’ imprisonment, comprising ten years’ imprisonment for the sexual assault by penetration charge and two years’ imprisonment for the outrage of modesty charge, with no caning as the accused was above 50 years old. BVZ, who was described as a “serial sexual predator” (<span class="font-italic">BPH </span>at [91]),<span class="font-italic"> </span>was convicted of four offences, being two charges of sexual assault by penile-oral penetration, one charge of outrage of modesty, and one charge of causing hurt by means of poison. Six other charges were taken into consideration. These offences concerned four 14-year old victims. The trial judge had imposed an aggregate sentence of 20 years’ imprisonment and 16 strokes of the cane, comprising individual sentences of ten years’ imprisonment and eight strokes of the cane for each of the two sexual assault by penetration offences, three years’ imprisonment for the hurt offence, and ten months’ imprisonment for the outrage of modesty offence, with the sentences for the two sexual assault by penetration offences to run consecutively. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The Court of Appeal upheld the sentences imposed on both BPH<span class="font-italic"> </span>and BVZ, and remarked that they were “lenient” towards the accused persons in all the circumstances: <span class="font-italic">BPH </span>at [75] and [90]. In respect of BVZ, the Court of Appeal stated that each of the two sexual assault by penetration charges fell at least within the middle or the upper half of Band 2 of the <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span>framework and would have attracted a sentence of 12 to 14 years’ imprisonment, and that if the proper individual sentences had been ordered instead, the aggregate sentence would have exceeded 24 years’ imprisonment : <span class="font-italic">BPH </span>at [96] and [99].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 I draw a distinction with <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v BOX </span>[2021] SGHC 147 (“<span class="font-italic">BOX</span>”), a case I decided earlier this year. BOX pleaded guilty to two charges of sexual assault by penetration and two charges of aggravated outrage of modesty with another five charges taken into consideration. The Prosecution sought an aggregate sentence of at least 17 years’ imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane. I imposed an aggregate sentence of 17 years’ imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane, ordering that two terms of two and a half years’ imprisonment each for the outrage of modesty offences be consecutive to a 12-year term of imprisonment for one of the sexual assault by penetration offences: <span class="font-italic">BOX </span>at [55] and [57]–[58]. While the two sisters in <span class="font-italic">BOX </span>were aged 10–14 and 8–11 at the material time, the overall seriousness of the offending was lower. For BOX, two of the nine charges involving aggravated sexual assault by penetration, whereas in the present case four of the 12 charges involved aggravated sexual assault by penetration where on each occasion the penetration was more prolonged. Moreover in this case a charge for attempted rape is amongst the charges taken into consideration. Further, caning was available for BOX, and the imposition of 24 strokes of the cane served as a strong signal of deterrence and retribution. While it is not appropriate to impose a longer term of imprisonment for an individual offence on account of the unavailability of caning (which is dealt with instead by a term imposed in lieu of caning), in the aggregation of the sentences for a series of offences where deterrence and retribution are in play, attention should be paid to the combination of punishments. This is relevant in the context of considering the proportionality of the overall sentence to the accused’s overall criminality. Such consideration must include, as a practical matter, an assessment of the quality and tone of the specific component constituents of the sentence in contributing to its overall impact on the offender and the public at large. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 In my judgment, imposing three consecutive terms of imprisonment while adjusting the respective terms best met the needs of both limbs of the totality principle in the present case. I reduced the terms of imprisonment imposed in lieu of caning for the SAP Charges and the sentence for the Tenth Charge by three months each. The sentence for each charge was therefore as follows: </div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) for the Sixth Charge, 11 years’ imprisonment and an additional three months’ imprisonment in lieu of 12 strokes of the cane;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) for the Eighth Charge, 11 years’ imprisonment and an additional three months’ imprisonment in lieu of 12 strokes of the cane; and</div></div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) for the Tenth Charge, six months’ imprisonment.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The aggregate sentence imposed on the accused was therefore 22 years and six months’ imprisonment, with an additional six months’ imprisonment in lieu of 24 strokes of the cane, backdated to 16 August 2019.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Valerie Thean<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Nicholas Lai and Andre Ong (Attorney-General’s Chambers)<span style="color: rgba(192,0,0,1)"> </span>for the Prosecution;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">The accused in person.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
