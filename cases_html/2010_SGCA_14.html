<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was an appeal by Valentino Globe BV
                    (“the Appellant”) against the decision of the High Court judge
                    (“the Judge”) in <em>Valentino Globe BV v Pacific
                        Rim Industries Inc</em> [2009] 4 SLR(R) 577 (“the
                    GD”) where the Judge rejected the Appellant’s opposition to Pacific
                    Rim Industries Inc’s (“the Respondent”) application for the
                    registration of the latter’s mark known as the “Emilio Valentino
                    &amp; V Device” (“the Application Mark”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Factual background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       On 18 December 2003, the Respondent of 5359
                    Valley Blvd, Los Angeles California 90032, United States of America, filed the
                    Application Mark for registration in respect of “Leather goods; all
                    included in Class 18 [of the Nice Classification, <em>ie</em>, the International Classification of Goods and Services under
                    the Nice Agreement]”. The registration application was accepted and
                    advertised on 25 June 2004 in the Trade Marks Journal. On 25 August
                    2004, a notice of opposition was filed by the Appellant, who owned trade mark
                    registration rights in Singapore for an array of “Valentino” trade
                    marks bearing multifarious designs. Collectively, these
                    “Valentino” trade marks shall hereinafter be referred to as
                    “the Valentino Marks”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The Appellant pursued its objection to the
                    Application Mark before the Principal Assistant Registrar (“PAR”)
                    of the Registry of Trade Marks, relying on various grounds of opposition
                    including, <em>inter alia</em>, ss 7(6) and 8(2) of
                    the Trade Marks Act (“TMA”) (Cap 332, 1999 Rev Ed)
                    (“TMA 1999”). At this juncture, we should explain that although
                    the TMA 1999 was amended in 2004 by Act No 20 of 2004 (“the 2004
                    Amendment Act”), ss 7(6) and 8(2) of the TMA 1999 were in no way
                    affected by the 2004 Amendment Act. In July 2005, a new revised edition of the
                    TMA, incorporating all the amendments made thereto, was published (“TMA
                    2005”). What were ss 7(6) and 8(2) of the TMA 1999 are now the same
                    provisions in the TMA 2005, which is the current edition of the Act in force
                    here. For ease of reference, these two provisions will be referred to
                    hereinafter simply as “s 7(6)” and “s 8(2)”
                    respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Having failed before the PAR on all the grounds
                    of its opposition, the Appellant appealed to the High Court but proceeded
                        <em>only</em> under ss 7(6) and 8(2). The High
                    Court upheld the decision of the PAR, for largely the same reasons. Before this
                    court, the Appellant again relied <em>only</em> on
                    ss 7(6) and 8(2). The Appellant’s arguments were essentially as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_a"></a>(a)     Pursuant to s 8(2), the
                        registration of the Application Mark should not be allowed because there
                        existed a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public as the
                        Application Mark was similar to the Appellant’s Valentino Marks and
                        was to be registered for similar or identical goods (“the <em>Confusingly Similar</em>
                    Issue”).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_b"></a>(b)     Pursuant to s 7(6), the registration of the Application Mark should
                        not be allowed because of the Respondent’s bad faith (“the
                            <em>Bad Faith</em>
                Issue”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The findings of the Judge</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Confusingly Similar Issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       In so far as the Confusingly Similar Issue was
                    concerned, while the PAR found that among all the Valentino Marks, only
                    T99/04403D and T00/21726H (“the Relevant Marks”) could be said to
                    be similar to the Application Mark<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>, she eventually found, having carefully
                    examined the marks, that the Relevant Marks were aurally and conceptually
                    dissimilar to the Application Mark.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> The Judge agreed with the
                    findings of the PAR.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The first argument raised by the Appellant was
                    that the array of Valentino Marks evinced a “monopoly claimed [<em>sic</em>] to the device mark [of the word mark Valentino on
                    its own] as well as the composite mark consisting of both the word Valentino and
                    the V device” (the GD at [25]). In response, the Judge remarked that the
                    Appellant could not and did <em>not</em> have a monopoly of
                    the word “Valentino” and noted that if it did, “the many
                    marks which contain the word “Valentino” would never have been
                    registered to begin with” (the GD at [26]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The Appellant also argued that the
                    “Application Mark, which reads “Emilio Valentino”, would
                    result in a misimpression that it was another mark in the Valentino Mark series,
                    thereby resulting in public confusion” (the GD at [25]). In this regard,
                    the Judge held that (and this is an important point) (the GD at [26]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[V]iewing the Application Mark and the Appellant’s Relevant Marks
                        holistically, I find that there is indeed little similarity, be it visually,
                        aurally or conceptually. Even though the common denominator between the
                        Application Mark and the Appellant’s trade marks is the word
                        “Valentino”, the Application Mark consists of several other
                        distinguishing features as the PAR had pointed out. Accordingly, I am of the
                        view that the use of the Application Mark would not result in a likelihood
                        of confusion. The most outstanding difference between the Application Mark
                        and the Relevant Marks is, to my mind, the name “Emilio” in
                        the former. That the name “Emilio” precedes
                        “Valentino” is a very glaring difference between the marks
                        because in the aural sense especially, they are very distinct from one
                        another. One would hear the name “Emilio” before
                        “Valentino” when pronouncing the Application Mark and
                        reading-wise, one would very likely read the name “Emilio”
                        first too. The Application Mark must be viewed in its entirety. Simply
                        because it incorporates the word “Valentino” does not mean
                        that it is so visually and aurally similar as to be confused with the
                        Appellant’s Relevant Marks.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       We would, at this juncture, note that in so far
                    as the argument based on s 8(2) was concerned, the Appellant was (in its appeal
                    to this court) relying only on the following two Valentino Marks: T89/07704E
                    (registered under Class 25 of the Nice Classification) and T89/07703G
                    (registered under Class 25 of the Nice Classification) (collectively,
                    “the Appeal Marks”), instead of the Relevant Marks (see <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a> above), to aver that the registration of the
                    Application Mark would cause confusion<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>. In relation to T89/07704E (with its
                    counterpart being registered as T89/07702I under Class 18 of the Nice
                    Classification), the Judge was of the view that this particular Valentino Mark
                    which contained the words “valentino garavani” was dissimilar to
                    the Application Mark. This was his reasoning at [28]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Simply because the word “valentino” is embedded within the
                        marks does not make “Emilio Valentino” and “valentino
                        garavani” similar to each other. Juxtaposing the “valentino
                        garavani” trademark against the Application Mark, I am hard pressed
                        to find any similarity save for the common constituent word
                        “valentino”, but even that similarity is far from compelling
                        as the Application Mark uses the capital letter “V” in
                        spelling “Valentino” whereas the Appellant’s mark uses
                        the lowercase letter “v”. Further, “valentino”
                        in the Appellant’s “valentino garavani” trademark
                        precedes the word “garavani” whereas in the Application Mark,
                        “Valentino” only comes after the word “Emilio”.
                        Visually and aurally, the marks are thus more distinct than similar.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Turning to the second Valentino Mark (<em>ie</em>, T89/07703G) which the Appellant relied upon for the
                    purposes of this appeal, the Judge also rejected the contention that T89/07703G
                    was similar to the Application Mark. He described the differences between these
                    two marks at [29] of his GD as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">With regard to T89/07703G, the word “valentino” is above the
                        ‘V’ endless belt device … . The positioning of the word
                        “Valentino” in relation to the device is thus unlike that in
                        the Application Mark which has the words “Emilio Valentino”
                        below, not above the stylized “V”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Bad Faith Issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     As regards the Bad Faith Issue, both the Judge
                    and the PAR were of the view that “[s]ince it was the Appellant which had
                    alleged bad faith on the part of the Respondent, … the burden rests upon
                    the Appellant to prove such bad faith” (the GD at [20]). The specific
                    instances of bad faith alleged by the Appellant were: (a) the
                    Respondent’s hijacking of its Valentino Marks; (b) the
                    Respondent’s lack of proprietorship with regard to the Application Mark;
                    and (c) the Respondent’s copying of the Application Mark from a
                    gentleman in Italy who shared an identical mark with the Respondent (see the GD
                    at [20]). After a detailed and careful examination of the evidence before him,
                    the Judge dismissed all the allegations.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues in this appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     As would be apparent from what was stated
                    above (particularly at <a href="#p1_4">[4]</a>), there were, in
                    essence, two issues in this appeal. First, the Appellant submitted that the
                    Respondent’s application to register the Application Mark was made in bad
                    faith pursuant to s 7(6). Second, that confusion was likely to arise in the
                    minds of the public on account of the fact that the Application Mark was similar
                    in particular to the Appeal Marks and was proposed to be registered for similar
                    goods as those of the Appellant, contrary to s 8(2). Accordingly, on either
                    or both grounds, the Appellant contended that the Application Mark should not be
                    registered. We would also add that before us, the Appellant’s main
                    fire-power was concentrated on s 7(6) instead of s 8(2). Accordingly,
                    we will first deal with the Confusingly Similar Issue based on s 8(2),
                    which we can dispose of briefly.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Confusingly Similar Issue: whether there existed a likelihood of
                confusion on the part of the public as the Application Mark was similar to the
                Appeal Marks and was to be registered for similar or identical goods</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Section 8(2) provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A trade mark shall not be registered if because
                        –</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    it is identical with an earlier trade mark and
                                is to be registered for goods or services similar to those for which
                                the earlier trade mark is protected; or</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    it is similar to an earlier trade mark and is
                                to be registered for goods or services identical with or similar to
                                those for which the earlier trade mark is protected,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">there exists a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     For the purposes of the present case, it was
                        para (<em>b</em>) of s 8(2) which was
                    applicable and not para (<em>a</em>) because it was
                    not alleged by the Appellant that the Application Mark was <em>identical</em> with any of the Appellant’s Valentino Marks. It
                    would be seen that in order to establish a case under s 8(2)(<em>b</em>), the following requirements must be proven:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Application Mark was similar to
                        the Appeal Marks;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Application Mark was to be registered for goods or services
                        identical with or similar to those for which the Appeal Marks have been
                        registered for; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_c"></a>(c)     On account of (a) and (b), there existed a likelihood of confusion on
                        the part of the public.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     As mentioned in <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> above, the Valentino Marks which the Appellant relied upon
                    in this appeal were the Appeal Marks, both of which were registered under Class
                    25 of the Nice Classification (which covered “clothing, footwear,
                    headgear”). However, the Application Mark was proposed to be registered
                    under Class 18 of the Nice Classification, that class being in respect of
                    “Leather and imitations of leather, and goods made of these materials and
                    not included in other classes; animal skins, hides; trunks and travelling bags;
                    umbrellas, parasols and walking sticks; whips, harness and saddlery”. For
                    ease of comparison, we set out below the Application Mark and the two Appeal
                    Marks:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     In <em>The Polo/Lauren Co, LP v
                        Shop In Department Store Pte Lt</em>d [2006] 2 SLR(R) 690
                        (“<em>Polo</em>”), this court held (at
                    [24]) that, for the purposes of determining similarity under s 27(2) of the
                    TMA, one must look at the mark and the sign “as a whole”. In
                    adopting this approach, this court in <em>Polo</em> had
                    regard to the following opinion expressed by Parker J in <em>In the Matter of an Application by the Pianotist Company Ld for the
                        Registration of a Trade Mark</em> (1906) 23 RPC 774 at
                    777:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">You must take the two words. You must judge of them, both by their look
                        and by their sound. You must consider the goods to which they are to be
                        applied. You must consider the nature and kind of customer who would be
                        likely to buy those goods. In fact, you must consider all the surrounding
                        circumstances; and you must further consider what is likely to happen if
                        each of those trade marks is used in a normal way as a trade mark for the
                        goods of the respective owners of the marks.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     While we recognised that the case of <em>Polo</em> was concerned with the question of confusion
                    relating to infringement under s 27(2) of the TMA, we were unable to see
                    why the approach to be taken for determining confusion for purposes of
                    opposition to a proposed registration under s 8(2) should be any different
                    from that applicable to determine confusion under s 27(2). Moreover, and
                    more importantly, the material words of the two provisions are
                identical.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     We had examined closely the three marks which
                    were in issue here (see depiction of the marks in <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a> above). Each of the three marks consisted of a combination
                    of word(s) and a design. The only thing which was identical in all the three
                    marks was the word “valentino” but even there the font for the
                    word “valentino” in all the three marks was different. As regards
                    the design on each of the three marks, while the designs on the two Appeal Marks
                    were identical, they were certainly quite different from the design on the
                    Application Mark. The most one could say about all the three designs were that
                    they were based on the letter “V”. Only to this very limited
                    extent could it be said that there was any similarity between the design on the
                    Application Mark and that on the Appeal Marks. In any event, looking at the
                    three marks as a whole, we did not think that we could reasonably hold that the
                    Application Mark was similar to the two Appeal Marks. Thus, the first
                    requirement set out in <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a> above had not
                    been made out.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Turning to the second requirement set out in
                        <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a>, we noted that the Appeal Marks
                    were registered in respect of Class 25 of the Nice Classification, whereas the
                    Application Mark was in respect of Class 18. Thus, the Application Mark was not
                    registered in respect of the same or similar goods as the Appeal Marks. To this
                    extent, to proceed with this appeal relying on the Appeal Marks instead of the
                    Relevant Marks (see [14] of the GD where the Relevant Marks were depicted), the
                    Appellant appeared to have adopted a weaker case. Accordingly, the second
                    requirement was also not satisfied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In the light of our observations in the last
                    two paragraphs, we did not think there would be any likelihood of confusion on
                    the part of the public if the Application Mark were to be registered. In this
                    regard, the fact that the goods sold under the Appellant’s brand were
                    up-market goods was not lost on us. The section of the public which would make
                    purchases of the Appellant’s goods was likely to be a fairly discernible
                    lot, and clearly not a moron in a hurry. Accordingly, the Appellant’s
                    ground of objection to the registration of the Application Mark based on
                    s 8(2) failed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Bad Faith Issue: whether the respondent’s application to
                register the Application Mark was made in bad faith pursuant to
                s 7(6)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     We turn now to examine the second ground
                    advanced by the Appellant to oppose the registration of the Application Mark.
                    Section 7(6) reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A trade mark shall not be registered if or to the extent that the
                        application is made in bad faith.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Once bad faith is established, the application for registration of a
                    mark must be refused even though the mark would not cause any confusion: see
                        <em>Rothmans of Pall Mall Ltd v Maycolson International
                        Ltd</em> [2006] 2 SLR(R) 551 (“<em>Rothmans</em>”) at [29] and Tan Tee Jim SC, <em>Law of Trade Marks and Passing Off in Singapore</em> (Sweet
                    &amp; Maxwell Asia, 2nd Ed, 2005) at para 5.71.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     As was noted by this court in <em>Wing Joo Loong Ginseng Hong (Singapore) Co Pte Ltd v Qinghai
                        Xinyuan Foreign Trade Co Ltd and another and another appeal</em>
                    [2009] 2 SLR(R) 814 (“<em>Wing Joo
                    Loong</em>”) at [33]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is trite law that the legal burden of proof needed to substantiate an
                        action for revocation and/or invalidation of the registration of a trade
                        mark lies throughout on the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As a preliminary observation, we noted that the Appellant here was not
                    attempting to <em>invalidate</em> the registration of the
                    Application Mark pursuant to s 7(6) read with s 23(1) of the TMA which
                    was what the plaintiff in <em>Wing Joo Loong</em> did.
                    Indeed, in the present case, the Appellant was <em>opposing</em> the registration of the Application Mark pursuant to
                    s 7(6). In our view, whether it is a case of opposition to registration
                    under s 7(6) or a case of invalidation under s 23 on the ground of bad
                    faith, it seems to us that there should not be any difference as regards the
                    burden of proof on bad faith in both scenarios. It is in line with common sense
                    and logic that he who asserts must prove although, depending on the evidence
                    tendered, the evidential burden could shift to the other side. The legal burden
                    of proof required to substantiate a ground to oppose the registration of a trade
                    mark remains throughout on the party making the application, and this would be
                    the Appellant in the present case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     To reiterate, s 7(6) provides that
                    “[a] trade mark shall not be registered if or to the extent that the
                    application is made in bad faith”. In opposing the registration of the
                    Application Mark, the Appellant strenuously argued that the Judge had failed to
                    apply the proper test to determine the question of bad faith and, as a
                    consequence thereof, had failed to take into account or failed to give the
                    proper weight to the following relevant matters in his consideration of the
                    issue of bad faith:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_a"></a>(a)     the failure of the Respondent to
                        explain how the name “Emilio Valentino” in the Application
                        Mark had been derived;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_b"></a>(b)     the failure of the Respondent to explain how the
                        ““V” device” in the Application Mark had been
                        derived;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_c"></a>(c)     the
                        failure of the Respondent to explain how the name in the Application Mark
                        was identical to the name of a living person, Mr Emilio Valentino, who had
                        also filed an application for the identical mark in Italy in respect of the
                        same type of goods for which the Respondent was seeking registration in
                        Singapore;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_d"></a>(d)     the
                        failure of the Respondent to explain how the ““V”
                        device” and the positioning of the ““V”
                        device” together with a bold line above the name in the Application
                        Mark was identical to the mark of Mr Emilio Valentino;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_e"></a>(e)     why the word “Italy” was
                        being used in close proximity with the Application Mark in the course of
                        trade and why the statement “Made by top-quality Italian, these
                        shifts are designed by European masters” was being used in the
                        Respondent’s advertising, when the goods bearing the Application Mark
                        were in fact being made in China and there was no evidence of any connection
                        with Italy either in the ownership, design or manufacture of the
                        Respondent's goods bearing the Application Mark;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_f"></a>(f)     that the right to apply and register
                        the Application Mark in Singapore lay with another party, namely one Hor
                        Soon Hong (“Hor”) trading as Impressions (lnt’l) Import
                        &amp; Export (“Impressions”), the Respondent’s former
                        contract manufacturer and distributor, as it was the said Hor who had first
                        used the Application Mark in Singapore, had first applied to register the
                        Application Mark in Singapore (without any objection from the Respondent)
                        and had claimed the goodwill and reputation in the Application Mark in
                        Singapore, which therefore meant Hor could rightfully claim proprietorship
                        to the Application Mark in Singapore in precedence over the Respondent;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_g"></a>(g)     the failure
                        of the court to take into account all of the circumstances in considering
                        whether there was bad faith, and in particular, that there had been no
                        evidence or finding that the Application Mark or the elements therein were
                        common in the marketplace in relation to goods in Class 18 of the Nice
                        Classification such that there could have been a coincidence in the creation
                        of the Application Mark and the identical mark by Mr Emilio
                        Valentino.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As we saw it, this list of objections could in
                    fact be distilled into three contentions. We need only address two of the three
                    contentions, namely the copying and lack of proprietorship issues. The third
                    contention, namely the allegation that the Respondent had hijacked the
                    Appellant’s Valentino Marks because the Application Mark contained the
                    same word “Valentino”, was a <em>non
                        sequitur</em> and had absolutely no merit and we do not think there is
                    any further need to address it. This assertion would amount to saying that the
                    Appellant had a proprietary claim to a common name such as
                    “Valentino”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The applicable principles of law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     At the outset, we noted that the Appellant had
                    correctly accepted that it had the onus to show whether the application to
                    register the Application Mark was made in bad faith.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The crucial question that remained was what
                    was the appropriate test to apply to determine bad faith under s 7(6). The
                    Appellant had submitted that the concept of “bad faith”
                    encompassed conduct which might be morally wrong but not legally wrong. We will
                    now embark on a brief survey of the case law on the issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Numerous English and local cases have
                    addressed the concept of “bad faith” under s 7(6). We will
                    begin with the leading case of <em>Gromax Plasticulture Ltd v Don
                        &amp; Low Nonwovens Ltd</em> [1999] RPC 367 (“<em>Gromax Plasticulture</em>”), which dealt with the
                    Trade Marks Act 1994 (c 26) (UK) and specifically s 3(6) thereof
                    (which is the English equivalent of s 7(6)). In <em>Gromax
                        Plasticulture</em>, Lindsay J observed at 379 that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Plainly [bad faith] includes dishonesty and, as I would hold, [it]
                        includes also some dealings which fall short of the standards of acceptable
                        commercial behaviour observed by reasonable and experienced men in the
                        particular area [of trade] being examined. Parliament has wisely not
                        attempted to explain in detail what is or is not bad faith in this context;
                        how far a dealing must so fall-short in order to amount to bad faith is a
                        matter best left to be adjudged not by some paraphrase by the courts (which
                        leads to the danger of the courts then construing not the Act but the
                        paraphrase) but by reference to the words of the Act and upon a regard to
                        all material surrounding circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The above passage of Lindley J was
                    referred to and accepted in the decision by Geoffrey Hobbs QC in <em>Demon Ale Trade Mark</em> [2000] RPC 345, where the
                    latter stated that (at 356):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… the expression “bad faith” has <em>moral</em> overtones which appear to make it possible for an
                        application for registration to be rendered invalid under section 3(6) by
                        behaviour which otherwise <em>involves no breach of any duty,
                            obligation, prohibition or requirement that is legally binding upon the
                            applicant</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In the later case of <em>Harrison v Teton Valley Trading Co Ltd</em> [2004] 1 WLR 2577, a
                    decision of the English Court of Appeal, Sir William Aldous said (at [24]
                    and [26]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">24    Clearly the court, when considering bad faith,
                            cannot apply a purely subjective test, called by Lord Hutton “the
                            Robin Hood test”. The dishonest person or one with low standards
                            cannot be permitted to obtain trade mark registrations in circumstances
                            where a person abiding by a reasonable standard would not. The
                            registration of a trade mark is designed to enable bona fide proprietors
                            to protect their proprietary rights without having to prove unfair
                            trading. Registration is not provided to help those with low moral
                            standards.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">26    For my part, I would accept the reasoning of Lord
                            Hutton as applying to considerations of bad faith. The words “bad
                            faith” suggest a mental state. Clearly when considering the
                            question of whether an application to register is made in bad faith all
                            the circumstances will be relevant. However the court must decide
                            whether the knowledge of the applicant was such that his decision to
                            apply for registration would be regarded as in bad faith by persons
                            adopting proper standards.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The other two members of the quorum concurred with these views of
                    Sir William Aldous.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Turning to the local case law, in <em>Rothmans</em>, our High Court endorsed Lindsay J’s
                    observations of the concept of bad faith in <em>Gromax
                        Plasticulture</em>. Further, both Lindsay J’s and Geoffrey
                    Hobbs QC’s approaches were again adopted by another High Court judge
                    in <em>Weir Warman Ltd v Research &amp; Development Pty
                        Ltd</em> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 1073 (“<em>Warman</em>”) where the judge stated at [48] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… the term ‘bad faith’ embraces not only actual
                        dishonesty but also dealings which would be considered as commercially
                        unacceptable by reasonable and experienced persons in a particular trade,
                        even though such dealings may otherwise involve “no breach of any
                        duty, obligation, prohibition or requirement that is legally binding”
                        upon the registrant of the trade mark …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     In <em>Wing Joo
                        Loong</em>, this court observed at [105] that “[t]he <em>test</em> for determining the presence of bad faith, in the
                    context of the English Trade Marks Act, was settled by the English Court of
                    Appeal” [emphasis in original]. It would be useful to set out in full the
                    observations of this court at [105]–[106] which are as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">105    The <em>test</em> for determining the presence of bad faith,
                            in the context of the English Trade Marks Act, was settled by the
                            English Court of Appeal in <em>Harrison v Teton Valley
                                Trading Co Ltd</em> [2004] 1WLR 2577, where Sir William
                            Aldous, with whom Arden and Pill LJJ agreed, expressed the test as
                            follows (at [26]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">The words ‘bad faith’ suggest a mental state. Clearly when
                            considering the question of whether an application to register is made
                            in bad faith all the circumstances will be relevant. However the court
                            must decide whether the knowledge of the applicant was such that his
                            decision to apply for registration would be regarded as [being] in bad
                            faith by persons adopting proper standards.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This test, which was referred to by Sir Aldous (<em>id</em> at [25]) as the “combined” test of bad
                        faith, contains both a subjective element (<em>viz</em>, what the particular applicant knows) and an objective
                        element (<em>viz</em>, what ordinary persons adopting
                        proper standards would think).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">106    Recently, this
                            combined test of bad faith was succinctly explained in <em>Ajit Weekly Trade Mark</em> [2006] RPC 25 as
                            follows (at [35] and [41]):</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">35    … Bad faith is to be judged according to
                                the combined test of dishonesty for accessory liability [for] breach

                                with <em>Gromax Plasticulture</em> [([103]

<p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">41    … [T]he upshot of the Privy
                                [Council’s] decision in [<em>Barlow Clowes
                                    International Ltd v Eurotrust International Ltd</em>
                                [2006] 1 WLR 1476] is: (a) to confirm the House of
                                Lords’ test for dishonesty applied in <em>Twinsectra</em>, i.e. the combined test; and (b) to
                                resolve any ambiguity in the majority of their Lordships’
                                statement of that test by making it clear that an enquiry into a
                                defendant’s views as regards normal standards of honesty is
                                not part of the test. The subjective element of the test means that
                                the tribunal must ascertain what the defendant knew about the
                                transaction or other matters in question. It must then be decided
                                whether in the light of that knowledge, the defendant’s
                                conduct is dishonest judged by ordinary standards of honest people,
                                the defendant’s own standards of honesty being irrelevant to
                                the objective element …</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This court in <em>Wing Joo
                        Loong</em> then applied at [107]–[117] the combined test of bad
                    faith which, to reiterate, contains both a subjective element (<em>viz</em>, what the particular applicant knows) and an
                    objective element (<em>viz</em>, what ordinary persons
                    adopting proper standards would think). It is therefore apparent to us that bad
                    faith as a concept is context-dependent. In the final analysis, whether bad
                    faith exists or not hinges on the specific factual matrix of each
                case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Furthermore, it is pertinent to note that an
                    allegation of bad faith is a serious claim to make and it must be sufficiently
                    supported by the evidence (see Nautical Concept Pte Ltd v Jeffery Mark Richard
                    and another [2007] 1 SLR(R) 1071 at [15] which we reproduce below):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">An allegation that a trade mark has been applied for in bad
                        faith is a serious one. In <em>Royal Enfield Trade
                            Marks</em> [2002] RPC 508, it was held (at [31]) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">A plea of fraud should not be lightly made … and if made should
                            be <em>distinctly alleged and distinctly proved. It is not
                                permissible to leave fraud to be inferred from the facts</em>
                            (see <em>Davy v. Garett</em> [1878] 7 Ch.D. 473 at
                            489). In my judgment precisely the same considerations apply to an
                            allegation of … bad faith made under section 3(6) [of the UK
                            Trade Marks Act 1994]. <em>It should not be made unless it can be
                                fully and properly pleaded and should not be upheld unless it is
                                distinctly proved and this will rarely be possible by a process of
                                inference</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[original emphasis omitted; emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This principle of law was alluded to and accepted by a leading local
                    text on Intellectual Property (Ng-Loy Wee Loon, <em>Law of Intellectual
                        Property of Singapore</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell Asia, Rev Ed, 2009) at
                    para 21.4.1):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">An allegation of bad faith is a serious one, and it must be fully and
                        properly pleaded and should not be upheld unless it is distinctly proved and
                        this will <em>rarely be possible by a process of inference</em>.
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The question, therefore, was whether this appeal was such a case where
                    bad faith could be proven especially by way of an <em>inference</em>. We turn now to apply the above principles to the facts of
                    the present appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Application of the law to the facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The Appellant’s case on bad faith
                    revolved around two main contentions. The first was that the Respondent had
                    copied the Application Mark from the trademark of one Mr Emilio Valentino.
                    The second was that the proprietorship of the Application Mark in Singapore did
                    not belong to the Respondent. Applying the combined test of bad faith (alluded
                    to in <a href="#p1_25">[25]</a>–<a href="#p1_29">[29]</a> above), in order for the Appellant to succeed in opposing
                    the registration of the Application Mark, it must show, not only that the
                    conduct of the Respondent in applying for the registration of the Application
                    Mark fell short of the normally accepted standards of commercial behaviour, but
                    also that the Respondent knew of facts which, to an ordinary person, would have
                    made the latter realise that what it was doing would be regarded as breaching
                    those standards.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     On the first contention, what the Appellant
                    had proven was that Mr Emilio Valentino had attempted to register a trade
                    mark (“the EV Mark”) in Italy in 2007 which was identical to the
                    Application Mark<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>. This fact was not disputed. It was also not
                    disputed that there was no connection between Mr Emilio Valentino and the
                    Respondent. Significantly, there was also no evidence before this court that the
                    Respondent, in deriving the Application Mark, had copied the EV Mark. Indeed,
                    the Respondent claimed to have used the Application Mark from around
                        1995,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> well before
                    Mr Emilio Valentino attempted to register the EV Mark in Italy.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     On these facts, the point which the Appellant
                    attempted to make was that since the Application Mark was identical with the EV
                    mark, it would naturally follow that the Respondent had copied the Application
                    Mark from the EV Mark. Accordingly, the Appellant argued that the burden would
                    shift to the Respondent to show how the Application Mark was derived and in turn
                    to explain how did it come about that the Application Mark was identical with
                    the EV Mark. In this regard, the Appellant relied on cases such as <em>Auvi Pte Ltd v Seah Siew Tee and another</em> [1991]
                    2 SLR(R) 786 (“<em>Auvi Pte Ltd</em>”)
                    and <em>In the Matter of Trade Mark Application No 2011973
                        by Team Lotus Ventures Ltd and In the Matter of Opposition Thereto under
                        Opposition No 45584 by Group Lotus Ltd</em>. What was vitally
                    pertinent to note, and this was totally cast aside by the Appellant, was that
                    there was no evidence before the court showing that Mr Emilio Valentino had used
                    the EV Mark before 2007. While it might well be <em>possible</em> (and we put it no higher than that) that Mr Emilio
                    Valentino had used the EV Mark before 2007, nothing was produced before the
                    court which could reasonably enable the court to draw such an inference or make
                    a definite decision. Indeed, as the Judge aptly observed at [71] of the GD,
                    there was no evidence “that Mr Emilio Valentino has been using [the
                    EV Mark] prior to the Respondent”. It was just as possible that the EV
                    Mark was copied by Mr Emilio Valentino from the Application Mark of the
                    Respondent. In these circumstances, there was no <em>prima
                        facie</em> case for the Respondent to rebut. Neither had any
                    evidential burden shifted to the Respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     What was clear was that the facts of the
                    present case were quite different from those in <em>Application
                        by Brown Shoe Company Inc for Rectification of the Register in Respect of
                        Trade Mark No B720,262</em> [1959] RPC 29 which involved two word
                    marks, “Naturalizer” and “Naturlizet”, and where the
                    owner of the former mark successfully had the Register rectified by having the
                    latter mark removed from the Register. There, the mark
                    “Naturalizer” was extensively advertised by its owner in American
                    periodicals before the application to register the mark
                    “Naturlizet” was made. The judge held that there was copying on
                    the part of the party obtaining registration for the “Naturlizet”
                    mark. Similarly, in <em>Auvi Pte Ltd</em>, there was clear
                    evidence that the logo of the plaintiff was in existence well before the
                    defendants’ mark. In view of the close similarity between the logo and the
                    mark and the other evidence presented, the plaintiff satisfied the court that
                    there was copying on the part of the defendants. Accordingly, the court expunged
                    the defendants’ mark from the Register. Ultimately, it is our view that
                    each case would have to be decided in accordance with its own facts, and in
                    particular, the evidence tendered.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     It was true that the EV Mark incorporated the
                    name of Mr Emilio Valentino. That fact could not <em>per
                        se</em> suggest anything and certainly could not suggest that the
                    Respondent had copied the Application Mark from the EV Mark. However, although
                    no evidential burden arose for the Respondent, the latter nevertheless (through
                    one Mr Ng Yeo Tiong) claimed that it was one Ms Diana Taylor
                    (“Ms Taylor”), the President of the Respondent, who created
                    the Application Mark independently.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> This assertion was
                    certainly hearsay and it should have been made by Ms Taylor herself. Thus,
                    it came as no surprise that the Appellant took issue with this assertion. This
                    challenge was not lost on the Judge who observed, at [68] of the GD,
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[T]he Respondent had not called [Ms Taylor] to testify to the originality
                        of her design nor produced further evidence that it did not copy [the EV
                        Mark] or suggested that the identity between the Application Mark and [the
                        EV Mark] is a mere coincidence …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     As a result, the Appellant submitted that an
                    adverse inference should have been drawn against the Respondent pursuant to
                        illustration (<em>g</em>) of s 116 of the
                    Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed). But as we have stated above at
                        <a href="#p1_33">[33]</a>, the Appellant had failed to even
                    make out a <em>prima facie</em> case of bad faith and so
                    the burden of disproving any element of bad faith on the part of the Respondent
                    did not arise. No adverse inference should, in the circumstances, be drawn
                    against the Respondent or, more accurately, we should say that in the light of
                    what was before the court there was nothing for the Respondent to rebut. We
                    noted that the Judge at [70] of the GD remarked that the Respondent had failed
                    to provide any credible evidence regarding the derivation of the Application
                    Mark. We had no quarrel with that remark which was correct. However, the primary
                    burden of showing a <em>prima facie</em> case of bad faith
                    rested with the Appellant. As the Appellant had failed to discharge that burden,
                    the omission on the part of the Respondent to show how it derived the
                    Application Mark was wholly immaterial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Turning to the second contention regarding the
                    proprietorship of the Application Mark in Singapore, the Appellant’s case
                    on this point centred on its averment that it was Hor (the Respondent’s
                    former distributor (see <a href="#p1_22">[22]</a> above)), and
                    not the Respondent, who owned the goodwill and reputation in the Application
                    Mark. Consequently, the Respondent had no right to register the Application
                    Mark. We noted, at this juncture, that the Respondent conceded that it
                        was<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span>:</p>

                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     In this regard, it is useful to refer to the
                    court’s illuminating remarks in <em>Warman</em> at
                    [49]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the present case, it is common ground that the key issue in the
                        determination of bad faith pivots around the fulcrum of proprietorship of
                        the “Warman” mark in Singapore. It appears to me to be an
                        incontrovertible proposition that if a registrant of a trade mark has
                        proprietorship of that trade mark, or at the very least, the <em>right to register</em> that trade mark, then such
                        registration of the trade mark should fall well within the standards of
                        acceptable commercial behaviour observed by reasonable and experienced
                        persons in the particular trade. Conversely, where it can be shown that the
                        applicant knew of an <em>exclusive</em> proprietary
                        right of <em>another</em> in relation to the trade mark
                        it seeks to furtively register, then any such registration would, almost
                        invariably, quite clearly fall short of the relevant standards. As such, it
                        is important to first examine and determine the issue of proprietorship.

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     To substantiate its allegation that the
                    Respondent had no right to register the Application Mark, the Appellant relied
                    solely on an affidavit filed by Hor in Criminal Motion No 6 of 2004 in the
                    High Court to set aside two search warrants issued at the instance of the
                    Appellant. It is necessary that we now set out the background as to how Hor, and
                    his sole proprietorship, Impressions, became involved in the use of the
                    Application Mark in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     By way of a “Letter of

                    1 June 1997, the Respondent authorised one Jack Lee (“Jack”)
                    of Geveni International Co Ltd (“Geveni”) of Taiwan to be its
                    exclusive agent in the Asian markets for a duration of 10 years from 1 June
                    1997 to 31 May 2007. Pursuant to that Letter of Authorization, Geveni was
                    given “the full right to use Emilio Valentino’s original logo,
                    trademark and ability of production supervision in the area of People of

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Jack, in turn, approached Hor with a view to
                    roping Hor into the business of manufacturing the Emilio Valentino range of
                    apparel. To that end, a “Certificate of Authorization”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> stated that
                    Genevi, which was the “exclusive agent for Emilio Valentino of Italy in
                    all of the Asia with legal representation of English and Chinese logos”,
                    granted the right to Impressions “[t]o be the legal representation and
                        <em>distribution</em> and <em>manufacturing</em> agent [in] the above mentioned

                    Authorization specifically stated that “[t]erritories”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> comprised of
                    Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia. The Certificate of Authorization took effect
                    from 1 February 2002 to 31 May 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Hor was the sole proprietor of Impressions
                    which was registered in 2001 and was engaged in the clothing business. It was
                    common ground that Hor was the Respondent’s distributor in Singapore since
                    2002. It was also the Respondent’s evidence that it had used the
                    Application Mark since 1995.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     In Hor’s affidavit, he claimed that he
                    had obtained the right to distribute and manufacture Emilio Valentino products
                    from Geveni. This affidavit was filed by Hor after a complaint was made by the
                    Appellant’s representative in Singapore that Impressions had committed
                    offences under s 49 of the TMA. Hence, the Respondent argued (rightly in
                    our view) that:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… Hor’s claim of ownership of the goodwill and reputation of
                        the Application Mark in Singapore was made in the context of a distribution
                        and manufacturing agreement and in the context of denying that he had
                        employed a false trade description.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The sole purpose of Hor’s affidavit was to defend the
                    allegations that he had, <em>inter alia</em>, employed a
                    false trade description. In any event, Hor’s claim of ownership of the
                    goodwill and reputation of the Application Mark in Singapore was made in the
                    context of the Certificate of Authorization which, as noted above, provided that
                    Impressions had the right to manufacture and distribute the Respondent’s
                    goods bearing the Application Mark.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     In the light of the foregoing arrangements
                    between the respondent and Genevi and in turn between Genevi and Hor, we noted
                    that while Hor was the first person to seek to register in Singapore a mark
                    which was identical with the Application Mark on 3 June 2003, it did not,
                    however, thereby follow that the Respondent’s registration of the
                    Application Mark was done in bad faith. Indeed, the Respondent, in any event,
                    had at least the <em>right to register</em> the Application
                    Mark (see <em>Warman</em> at [49], quoted at <a href="#p1_38">[38]</a> above). We would further add that Hor
                    eventually abandoned his application to register the mark.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     We now turn to address the Appellant’s
                    assertion that there was <em>no</em> trade mark
                    licensor-licensee relationship between the Respondent and Hor. It was our view
                    that this assertion was a bare assertion which was contrary to documentary
                    evidence. As noted by the High Court in <em>Warman</em> at
                    [63], “[o]ne instance of a right to sell under a trade mark being
                    divorced from a right to protect that mark by way of trade mark registration is
                    in the case of a trade mark licensee.” Further, the High Court there
                    observed at [64]–[68] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">64    The test for the
                            validity of a trade mark licence was set out in <em>Rainforest Coffee Products Pte Ltd v Rainforest Cafe,

                            (at [33]), in delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal, endorsed
                            the English decision in <em>BOSTITCH Trade
                                Mark</em> [1963] RPC 183 at 567:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">The key to the validity of a trade mark licence was whether or not the
                            licence arrangement had destroyed the trade connection between the
                            proprietor of the trade mark and the goods …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Therefore, for there to be a valid trade mark licence between parties,
                        there must be a trade connection between the purported proprietor of the
                        trade mark (allegedly the plaintiff, in this case) and the goods ultimately
                        sold under the mark by the licensee (the defendant’s goods, in this
                        case).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">65    In the commentary of
                            the TMA by Mr M Ravindran in <em>Butterworths’ Singapore Statutes</em> –
                            <em>Intellectual Property</em> (Butterworths, 2002)
                            (“the <em>Butterworths’
                            Statutes</em>”), it is stated that whether the proprietor
                            has any trade connection with the goods or services in question is
                            ultimately a question of fact. Mr Ravindran, coincidentally the
                            counsel for the plaintiff in the present case, explains in the
                            commentary at p 126:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">if the proprietor does not in fact exercise control or supervise the

                            him to do so), there is no trade connection between him and the goods or
                            services for which the mark has been registered.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It appears to be trite law that to establish the requisite trade
                        connection for a valid trade mark licence, there must be at least <em>some</em> control or supervision of the use of the trade
                        mark by the purported licensee.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">66    The same view has been adopted in <em>Tan Tee Jim</em> ([48] <em>supra</em>) at p 216 in relation to the licensing of
                            unregistered trade marks. The learned author is of the view that such
                            licence is valid only if there is a quality control relationship between
                            the licensor and the goods or services in question.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">67    The leading treatise of Wilkof and Burkitt,

                            the United States of America with respect to implied licences emphasises
                            that evidence of control is necessary for an implied trade mark licence.
                            The authors cite the American case of <em>Villanova
                                University v Villanova Alumni Educational Foundation, Inc</em>
                            123 F Supp 2d 293, for the proposition that the existence of
                            an implied trade mark licence requires evidence that permission was
                            given to use the mark, coupled with an exercise of reasonable control
                            over such use. This requirement is assessed by the objective conduct of
                            the parties. This seems sensible.</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It was clear that the above clauses reserved unto Geveni the right to
                    exercise control and supervision on the use by Impressions of the Application
                    Mark. The Respondent’s control and supervision over Geveni was in turn
                    provided for in the Letter of Authorisation<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> (see <a href="#p1_40">[40]</a> above). There was nothing to suggest that
                    control and supervision was, in fact, not exercised by the Respondent over
                    Impressions through Genevi. No evidence was adduced by the Appellant to
                    contradict what was set out in the Legal Contract. As noted by the Judge, a bare
                    assertion by the Appellant that “there was no evidence of control or
                    supervision by the Respondent over [Hor]” (the GD at [57]) could not
                    suffice to prove that there was indeed no control exercised by the Respondent
                    over the use of the Application Mark. The legal documents set out the rights and
                    obligations of the parties and it would be reasonable to assume, unless proven
                    otherwise, that the parties would, and had, observed the terms agreed upon. We
                    would reiterate that if the Appellant alleged that there was <em>no</em> such control, the burden of proof must surely be on the
                    Appellant to prove exactly that. The latter had wholly failed to do so. Thus,
                    there was nothing to show bad faith on the part of the Respondent in seeking the
                    registration of the Application Mark. As mentioned in <a href="#p1_30">[30]</a> above, an allegation of bad faith is a serious matter and
                    ought not to be lightly inferred.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Before we conclude this judgment, we would
                    like to make two observations. First, the Appellant vigorously
                        argued<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> that the PAR had failed to
                    consider the provisions of r 14 of the Trade Mark Rules (Cap 322, R 1,
                    2008 Rev Ed) which provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">Persons living or recently dead</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">14. —(1) Where the name or representation of any person
                        appears on a trade mark which is the subject of an application for
                        registration, the Registrar <em>may</em>, before
                        proceeding to register the mark, require the applicant to furnish the
                        Registrar with the consent of the person or, in the case of a person
                        recently dead, of his legal representatives. </p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) Where the consent referred to in paragraph (1) is not
                        furnished within the time specified by the Registrar and the applicant
                        fails to satisfy the Registrar that it is impossible or impracticable
                        in the circumstances of the case to obtain the consent, the Registrar
                        shall refuse to register the mark.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Appellant agreed that the requirement under r 14(1) was
                    entirely discretionary. However, it submitted that:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… in order for the RTM [<em>ie</em>, the
                        Registry of Trade Marks] to decide whether to exercise its discretionary
                        power, it had to have the relevant facts before it. The RTM had to be told
                        the derivation of the Application Mark for it to then decide if consent was
                        necessary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">We, however, were unable to agree with the Appellant. The primary
                    burden of showing a <em>prima facie</em> case of bad faith
                    rested solely with the Appellant. In the present case, the Appellant had clearly
                    failed to discharge this burden. There was, therefore, no room for the Appellant
                    to argue that the Registry of Trade Marks ought to have exercised its discretion
                    under r 14(1) in the present case to require the Respondent to furnish
                    proof of the consent of Mr Emilio Valentino.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Secondly, we found it strange that the
                    Appellant should choose to argue that the Respondent’s application to
                    register the Application Mark was made in bad faith pursuant to s 7(6) when
                    the very persons who should know best, whether there was a case to object on
                    that ground, would be either Mr Emilio Valentino or Hor (or both) and
                    neither of them had raised any such objection. In order to establish a <em>prima facie</em> case, the Appellant should, at the very
                    least, obtain direct evidence from either Mr Emilio Valentino or Hor, or
                    both, to show either there was copying on the part of the Respondent and/or that
                    the goodwill in the Application Mark did not vest in the Respondent (this would
                    be on the assumption that Hor could explain away the position set out in the
                    Legal Contract (see <a href="#p1_46">[46]</a> above)).
                    Presumably, the Appellant could not persuade Mr Emilio Valentino or Hor to do
                    any of these things. As explained above at <a href="#p1_39">[39]</a> and <a href="#p1_43">[43]</a>, the affidavit
                    filed by Hor was for an entirely different purpose. In the premises, the
                    Appellant had no basis whatsoever to bring an action to oppose the registration
                    of the Application Mark on the ground of bad faith.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     In conclusion, it was clear to us that the
                    Appellant had no valid reasons to object to the registration of the Application
                    Mark. What the Appellant sought to acquire, which it was not entitled to, was a
                    monopoly over the use of a common name, “Valentino”. In the
                    result, we dismissed the appeal with costs and the usual consequential
                    orders.</p>
