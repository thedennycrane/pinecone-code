</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> On 9 December 2022, the STB issued a Stop Order against the collective sale of Chuan Park, pursuant to s 84A(6A) of the Land Titles (Strata) Act 1967 (2020 Rev Ed) (“the LTSA”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 This led to authorised representatives of the CSC filing the present Originating Application No 869 of 2022 (“OA 869”) for orders that Chuan Park be sold in accordance with the SPA, as well as other related orders. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 Resisting this application, the Defendants submit various grounds of objection before the General Division of the High Court (the “High Court”). Some of these grounds were not included in the Defendants’ objections to the STB. This raises the preliminary issue of whether such grounds can be considered by the High Court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The collective sale of Chuan Park requires, among other things, satisfaction of s 84A(1) of the LTSA. Whether this provision was satisfied is disputed by the parties. The parties also dispute whether the transaction was made in good faith in relation to the Sale Price and the method of apportionment (“MOA”) adopted by the CSC. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Parties</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The Claimants, Mrs Spykerman Chwee Wah Christina Nee Lim; Yew Wai Kuen; and Ong Han Ping (Wang Hanbin), are authorised representatives of the CSC appointed pursuant to the collective sale agreement (“CSA”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 The Defendants, Yow Jia Wen; Quek Guat Peck; Foo Kai Ming, Jeffrey (Fu Kaiming); Daven Wu Yungren; Ong Seng Oh; and Long Wee Fong, are SPs of Chuan Park who filed objections to the STB, objecting to the Sale. The individual objections to the STB filed by each Defendant will be referred to collectively as the “STB Objections”. The Defendants did not sign the CSA. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Background to the dispute </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 During an EOGM held in October 2020, the majority of SPs representing 95.2% of share value passed a motion to execute the CSA. The CSA was signed by the first SP on 3 October 2020. By around 28 August 2021, SPs representing a total of 364 units had signed the CSA, specifying a reserve price (“RP”) of $938m. These SPs represent 80% of total share value and total strata area. On 6 October 2021, the first public tender exercise was launched with a RP of $938m. No bids were received after the exercise closed on 18 November 2021.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 At a meeting on 17 December 2021, the CSC resolved to seek a fresh mandate for a revised RP of $860m. Under the terms of the CSA, revision of the RP may be done by drawing up a “supplementary joint agreement” (“SJA”) for execution by the SPs. A SJA and the terms contained therein would only be valid and binding if it was executed by SPs representing 80% of total share value and total strata area. A SJA at the RP of $860m (“1st SJA”) was drawn up and first signed by a SP on or about 28 December 2021. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 On 12 March 2022, the CSC sent a circular letter to all owners to inform them that, as at 11 March 2022, the SPs of 268 units had signed the 1st SJA. These SPs represented 59.85% of total share value and 59.05% of total strata area. The letter stated that the RP of $860m would only take effect if at least 80% of all owners by total share value and total strata area have executed the SJA. Until then, the CSC would only have the authority to accept an offer at or above the RP of $938m.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 On 15 March 2022, a second public tender exercise was launched with a RP of $938m. This exercise closed on 26 April 2022, with no bids or expressions of interest received.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 On 17 June 2022, the marketing agent for the CSC, ERA Realty Network Pte Ltd (“ERA”), informed all owners by way of circular letter that the CSC received an expression of interest from the Developer at a sale price of $860m,

</div> which was below the RP of $938m which the CSC had an 80% mandate for. On 24 June 2022, the CSC resolved to seek a fresh mandate at a revised RP of $890m by deeming the SPs who had executed the 1st SJA as having consented to the upward revision of the RP to $890m and drawing up the 2nd SJA for execution by SPs who had not executed the 1st SJA but were agreeable to the revised RP. As of that date, owners constituting 72.20% of the total share value and 71.80% of total strata area had signed the 1st SJA, agreeing to a downward revision of the RP to $860m. No more signatures were added to the 1st SJA. Between 25 June 2022 to 5 July 2022, owners representing 8.73% of the total share value and 8.315% of the total strata area executed the 2nd SJA to revise the RP upward to $890m. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 The SPA for the collective sale of Chuan Park to the Developer at the Sale Price of $890m was signed on 5 July 2022. The Sale Price was arrived at with reliance on a valuation report by one Yick E-Ling (Ms Yick”), whose valuation was based on a gross floor area (“GFA”) of 78,152.76m2 based on a plot ratio of 2.1. In relation to the distribution of the proceeds from the Sale to Chuan Park’s SPs, the Claimants had adopted a MOA based on 90% valuation, 5% strata area and 5% share value. This MOA was based on calculations done by Ms Yick. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 The Claimants called Ms Yick as their valuation expert, while the Defendants called one Stella Seow Lee Meng (“Ms Seow”) as their valuation expert.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The law governing collective sales</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 It would be useful to briefly outline the law governing collective sales, before turning to the objections to the Sale.

</div> that was provided by the Claimants in their 4th Joint Affidavit on 20 April 2023; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the Independent Valuer Ground, the issue of Ms Yick’s independence as a valuer was a matter of statutory compliance and thus could be raised even if it was not in the STB Objection.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Grounds based on previously unknown facts may be raised to the High Court</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 In <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Hun Joo</span>, the court held at [50] that under s 84A(4A) of the LTSA, a person who re-files his objection to the High Court must state the same grounds of objections filed to the STB (the “Same Grounds Rule”). This “prevents the collective sale application process from being complicated or delayed by the raising of new grounds of objection before the High Court which should have first been raised before the Board”: <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Hun Joo </span>at [50]. Notwithstanding, the court also held at [52] that the High Court may consider a ground of objection which had not been raised before the STB if, through no fault of the objector, he could not have known at that time of the facts giving rise to the ground of objection: see also <span class="font-italic">Ngui</span><span class="font-italic"> Gek Lian Philomene and others v Chan Kiat and others (HSR International Realtors Pte Ltd, intervener</span>) [2013] 4 SLR 694 (“<span class="font-italic">Thomson View Condominium</span>”) at [45]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 I agree with the decisions in <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Hun Joo </span>and <span class="font-italic">Thomson View Condominium</span>. The STB Objection was filed in September 2022 while the basis of the GFA Verification Ground (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the email correspondence between URA and ERA) was only revealed on 20 April 2023. In other words, the facts which give rise to this ground of the HC Objection were not known to the Defendants when the STB Objection was filed. Hence, despite this issue being absent from the STB Objection, I will consider the GFA Verification Ground. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Acceptance that an issue may be submitted to the High Court </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Unlike the GFA Verification Ground, the Defendants’ objection on the basis that the PAFS had not been carried out (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the PAFS Ground) was not founded on facts which were unknown to the Defendants when they filed the STB Objection.

First, I note that the PAFS Ground had been put into issue in Mr Foo’s affidavit, which was filed approximately three months prior to the commencement of the trial. Second, the Claimants had recognised the PAFS Ground and listed it within their Scott Schedule as a dispute to be addressed during the hearing. Third, the Claimants had asked their expert, Ms Yick, to provide her opinion on the PAFS Ground and she did so in her expert report. Fourth, the Claimants then referred to Ms Yick’s views in their written submissions and stated that this issue would be elaborated upon after oral testimony.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Claimants’ Written Submissions dated 24 April 2023 at para 56.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> Lastly, the Claimants’ objection to the High Court’s consideration of the PAFS Ground only surfaced during their oral submissions, after the cross-examination of all witnesses had been completed. In these circumstances, I find that the concern highlighted in <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Hun Joo</span> at [50], of complicating or adding delay to the collective sale process, would not be triggered by the High Court’s consideration of the PAFS Ground. The Claimants had conducted themselves in a manner demonstrative of an acceptance of the PAFS Ground as one for the High Court’s consideration, up until their raising of an objection towards the end of the hearing. The Claimants cannot now, at this late stage, take advantage of s 84A(4A) of the LTSA and deny the Defendants from objecting on this ground.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 In view of the above, I will consider the PAFS Ground. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Objections pursuant to statutory requirements</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Before an application may be made to the STB for a collective sale pursuant to s 84A(1) of the LTSA, the requirements set out in the First, Second, and Third Schedules to the LTSA (the “LTSA Schedules”) must be satisfied, <span class="font-italic">per </span>s 84A(3) of the LTSA. As explained by the court in <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Hun Joo</span> at [92], the issue of compliance with the requirements set out in the LTSA Schedules is a <span class="font-italic">prerequisite</span> that goes towards whether the collective sale application is valid and may be made in the first place.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Paragraph 1(<span class="font-italic">e</span>)(vi) of the First Schedule to the LTSA requires that “a report by an <span class="font-italic">independent</span> valuer on the proposed method of distributing the proceeds of the sale due under the sale and purchase agreement” be made available to any and all SPs of the relevant property [emphasis added]. Satisfaction of this statutory requirement necessitates the independence of the valuer who produces the report. The Independent Valuer Ground raised by the Defendants as a ground of objection is an issue that goes to whether the Claimants’ application under s 84A of the LTSA is valid and may be made. Hence, I find that the absence of this ground (which relates to statutory compliance) in the STB Objection would not preclude the court from considering if such statutory compliance has been met. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Further, I note that although the language of s 84A(3) and (7C) of the LTSA appears to suggest that the issue of whether the application for collective sale may be made should be resolved first by the STB, the High Court would still have to take into account such considerations. Indeed, as recognised by the court in <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Hun Joo</span> at [92]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [t]he threshold issue of whether an application may even be made should thus have been settled before the [STB] in the first instance. Thus, the omission to mention the High Court in s 84A(7C) appears deliberate. However,<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">the omission means that the court still has to grapple with the question as to whether a non-compliance with any requirement in the First, Second or Third Schedule would necessarily invalidate an application to the High Court for approval.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 For completeness, this reasoning must necessarily extend to other statutory requirements for a valid application for collective sale, such as the 80% Requirement set out in s 84A(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the LTSA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 I have thus proceeded below to consider the Independent Valuer Ground as one of the Grounds of the HC Objection.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Summary of the law on re-filing objections to the High Court </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 In summary, where person(s) who have filed an objection to a collective sale to the STB under s 84A(4) of the LTSA seek to re-file that objection to the General Division of the High Court under s 84A(4A), the grounds of objection filed to the High Court must be the same as that filed to the STB (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Same Grounds Rule): see <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Hun Joo </span>at [50]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Notwithstanding, this Same Grounds Rule is subject to certain exceptions and the grounds of objection raised need not be identical to that in the objection to STB where:  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the ground of objection filed to the High Court is based on facts which were unknown at the time the objection was filed to the STB: see <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Hun Joo </span>at [52] and <span class="font-italic">Thomson View Condominium</span> at [45]; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the claimants have waived their right to object to different grounds of objection being raised, despite being absent from the objection filed to the STB, by accepting that the issue can be submitted before the High Court; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the ground of objection relates to a statutory prerequisite for approval of an application for collective sale under s 84A(1) of the LTSA. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issues to be determined </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 I now turn to the main issues before me: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) whether the 80% Requirement is satisfied for a collective sale at a RP of $890m; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) whether the Sale Price was derived in good faith; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) whether the MOA was arrived at in good faith. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 1: Whether the 80% Requirement for collective sale at $890m was satisfied</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 As set out above, s 84A(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the LTSA provides that an application for collective sale must satisfy the 80% Requirement. The legislative purpose of s 84A(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the LTSA was explained by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Shunfu</span><span class="font-italic"> Ville</span> at [5]–[6]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">5 … the Land Titles (Strata) (Amendment) Act 1999 (Act 21 of 1999) (“Act 21 of 1999”) … removed the need for unanimous consent and instead it was provided that <span class="font-italic">a collective sale could be carried through as long as the subsidiary proprietors of the lots with not less than 80% or 90% of the share values, depending on the age of the property, had agreed in writing to the sale. The amendments were evidently intended to “make it easier for </span><span class="font-italic">en-bloc sales to take place”, and Parliament thought this “imperative” in land-scarce Singapore in order to realise enhanced plot ratios of developments, “make available more prime land for higher-intensity development to build more quality housing in Singapore”, and to allow older developments to be “rejuvenated through the en-bloc process”</span>: see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report </span>(31 July 1998) vol 69 at col 601 (Assoc Prof Ho Peng Kee, Minister of State for Law).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">6 At the same time, Parliament was aware that the interests of minority owners had to be protected. Apart from procedural safeguards that governed the process of a collective sale, Parliament envisaged that the <span class="font-italic">Strata Titles Board (“the Board”) would play a key role in ensuring that the interests of both the majority and minority owners were taken into account before approving a sale</span>. In the course of the second reading of the Land Titles (Strata) (Amendment) Bill (No 28 of 1998) (“Bill 28 of 1998”), Assoc Prof Ho Peng Kee, Minister of State for Law, noted (at <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report </span>(31 July 1998) vol 69 at col 604) that <span class="font-italic">the Board</span>:</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">… <span class="font-italic">will first satisfy itself that the required consent has been obtained</span> and that prescribed procedures have been complied with. … Essentially its role is to determine that the proposed sale is bona fide and an arm’s length transaction so that the proposed sale can proceed. It will do this by considering the minority’s objections, the interests of all the owners, all the circumstances of the case and the scheme and intent of the en-bloc provisions in the Bill. The Board will look at the sale price, method of distributing the sale proceeds to ensure that the minority owners are treated no less favourably than the majority, and the relationship of the purchaser to the owners, to ensure that there is no collusion. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Several points of note arise from the above. </div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) First, there is a policy imperative in land-scarce Singapore to allow older developments to be rejuvenated through the <span class="font-italic">en</span><span class="font-italic"> bloc</span> sale process. </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) Second, the amendments made to the LTSA (the “Amendments”) were intended to make it easier for the <span class="font-italic">en</span><span class="font-italic"> bloc</span> sale process to take place. </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) Third, the Amendments were to allow the collective sale of property of a certain age to be carried through as long as the requisite 80% had agreed in writing. </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(d) Fourth, the issue of whether the required majority (of 80% or 90%, depending on the age of property) has been achieved, is salient. </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(e) Fifth, what the STB will do, amongst other things, is to satisfy itself that the required consent has been obtained. </div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Before delving into the parties’ submissions, I pause to highlight that s 84A(1) of the LTSA requires that the SPs “<span class="font-italic">agreed in writing </span>to sell all the lots and the common property in the strata title plan” [emphasis added].

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> The effect of this observation is that the Defendants’ submissions as to whether the 1st SJA is valid and binding, which will be canvassed in further detail below, are hence not material to the question of whether the 80% Requirement has been satisfied.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 These observations of s 84A(1) of the LTSA accord with the parliamentary intention of the LTSA (set out above) and the plain language of the provision. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 It is not disputed that the SPs who were signatories of the 1st and 2nd SJA had “agreed in writing” to the collective sale. Accordingly, the remaining issue is whether the 80% Requirement has been satisfied. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The 80% Requirement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The Defendants submits that the 80% Requirement has not been satisfied, contrary to the CSC’s claim, and objects to the Sale on this basis. In particular, the Defendants take issue with the fact that the CSC satisfied the 80% Requirement by relying on <span class="font-italic">both</span> the 1st SJA, which was executed by owners representing 72.20% in total share value and 71.80% in total area, <span class="font-italic">and</span> the 2nd SJA, which was executed by owners representing 8.73% share value and 8.31% share area. The Defendants’ position is that an addition of both set of numbers cannot be done as the 1st SJA was not valid and binding. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 In support of this, the Defendants relied on cl 6.12.1 of the CSA, which states that an SJA requires execution by owners representing 80% of the total share value and total strata area in order to be valid and binding: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Clause 6.12.1. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, and in the event that the RESERVE PRICE or any of the SALE TERMS herein cannot <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">be attained, the SALE COMMITTEE may in its absolute discretion direct the SOLICITORS to draw up a supplemental agreement to this Agreement (hereinafter called the “SJA”) whereby each of the CONSENTING OWNERS shall be at liberty to agree [by way of entering into the SJA] with any one or more of the CONSENTING OWNERS and as well as with any one or more of the OWNERS who have not executed this Agreement, to sell ALL UNITS and common property in the DEVELOPMENT by way of COLLECTIVE SALE at a price less than the RESERVE PRICE, and/or upon terms which do not comply with the SALE TERMS, and the signing of the SJA by any of the CONSENTING OWNERS will not constitute a breach of this Agreement. </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Provided Always that</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">the</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span>SJA shall only be valid and binding if it is drawn up by the SOLICITORS with the SALE COMMITTEE’S approval and OWNERS with not less than eighty per cent (80%) of the TOTAL SHARE VALUE and not less than eighty per cent (80%) of the TOTAL STRATA AREA in the DEVELOPMENT must have executed the SJA (hereinafter called “NEW CONSENTING OWNERS”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In addition, the Defendants also relied on cl 3 of the 1st SJA, which mirrors cl 6.12.1 and requires execution by owners representing 80% of the total share value and total strata area for the reduction of the RP to $860m to take effect: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Clause 3. For avoidance of doubt and pursuant to clause 6.12.2 of the CSA, the reduction of the RESERVE PRICE herein to Eight Hundred and Sixty Million ($860 million) shall only take effect upon the execution of this supplemental agreement by OWNERS having at least eighty per cent (80%) of both the total share value and total strata area in the DEVELOPMENT. … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Since owners representing only 72.20% in total share value and 71.80% in total strata area have signed the 1st SJA, the Defendants submit that that SJA is not valid and binding. Consequently, there is no valid reduction of the RP from $938m to $860m. As the RP remained at $938m, the latter part of cl 3 of the 1st SJA does not assist the Claimants because it only operates to allow owners who signed the 1st SJA to be deemed to have agreed to an increase in RP from $860m. The relevant portion of cl 3 of the 1st SJA states: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… In such event of attaining the said eighty per cent (80%), the CONSENTING OWNERS to the CSA who have not signed this supplemental agreement will forthwith be discharged from all their obligations under the CSA and be released from the CSA. For further avoidance of doubt, in the event that the SALES COMMITTEE subsequently resolves to make any increase to the RESERVE PRICE, the OWNERS who have already signed this supplemental agreement shall be deemed to have agreed to such increased RESERVE PRICE without having to sign any further document.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Disagreeing with the Defendants contractual interpretation, the Claimants submit that cl 3 of the 1st SJA expressly states that owners who signed the 1st SJA shall be deemed to have agreed to an increase in the RP without having to sign any further document. This clause mirrors cl 6.4(a) of the CSA:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Clause 6.4(a). … the SALE COMMITTEE may, in its absolute discretion and having duly considered any input from the PROPERTY CONSULTANTS, be entitled to increase the RESERVE PRICE (the “NEW RESERVE PRICE”) as set out in this clause whether prior to, on or after the MAJORITY DATE, and in such event, the CONSENTING OWNERS who have executed this Agreement shall be deemed to have agreed to the NEW RESERVE PRICE without having to enter into any fresh agreement in supplement to this Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The Defendants have not taken issue with the operation of cl 6.4(a). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The Claimants submit that the effect of these clauses is that owners who executed the 1st SJA are carried into all and any subsequent SJAs with a higher RP, such as the 2nd SJA which revises the RP to $890m. This effect is, notably, codified in cl 3 of the 2nd SJA: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Clause 3. Those OWNERS who had executed the SJA consenting to lower the Reserve Price to $860 million are deemed to have agreed to the revised Reserve Price of $890 million and are not required to sign this document.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Additionally, the Claimants submit that the CSA, the 1st SJA, and the 2nd SJA should be read together for the purpose of determining their legal effect:  </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Sunny Metal &amp; Engineering Pte Ltd v Ng </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Khim Ming Eric </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">[2007] 3 SLR(R) 782 (“</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Sunny Metal</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">”)</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> at [30]. In support of this submission, the Claimants highlight that: (a)</span> <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">the CSA and the SJAs refer to each other therein; (b) each document takes effect by specific reference to the earlier document; and (c) the language in cl 3 of both the 1</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">st and 2nd SJAs militate against treating them as two unconnected agreements. Instead, </span>the three documents represent a single transaction, which ought to be construed together.<span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The Claimants submit that, by virtue of cl 3 of the 1st SJA, the signatories to that SJA have agreed that they be deemed to have agreed to a RP higher than $860m, without having to sign any further document. Hence, by virtue of what they agreed to in writing in the 1st SJA, they are deemed to have agreed to sell at the RP of $890m. The signatories of the 2nd SJA also clearly “have agreed in writing to sell” Chuan Park at the RP of $890m. Taken together, owners constituting the requisite 80% threshold “have agreed in writing to sell” Chuan Park at the RP of $890m, through the 1st and 2nd SJAs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 A key issue that arises from the parties’ submissions, is whether the 1st and 2nd SJA are to be treated as the same document such that the percentage of total share value and total strata area represented by the owners who executed the 1st and 2nd SJA may be added together to satisfy the 80% Requirement. Specifically, the Defendants’ submission is premised on the 1st and 2nd SJA being two separate agreements. I hence examine whether such an interpretation is sustainable.

It should be borne in mind that the abbreviations of “1st SJA” and “2nd SJA” were so framed by the Defendants. They do not connote that the two are legally distinct documents. Moreover, there is nothing in the headers of the SJAs that labels them as the 1st and 2nd SJA. The Defendants also accepted at the hearing, that the two SJAs are supplemental to the CSA and they form part of the CSA.

</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 While there is nothing in each SJA that expressly states that they are part of the same SJA, there is similarly nothing that states that they are to be regarded as separate supplemental agreements. Further, there is nothing in the language of the SJAs that indicates that the SJAs are to be treated as separate agreements. On the other hand, there is language in the SJAs that suggests that the 1st and 2nd SJA are part of the same agreement. For example, cl 3 of the 1st SJA states that owners who have signed this supplemental agreement are deemed to have agreed to an increased RP without having to sign “any further document” (distinct from having to sign another “SJA”): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… For further avoidance of doubt, in the event the SALE COMMITTEE subsequently resolves to make any increase to the RESERVE PRICE, the OWNERS who have already signed this supplemental agreement shall be deemed to have agreed to such increased RESERVE PRICE without having to sign any further document. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 More importantly, the key scenario where this part of cl 3 of the 1st SJA would be needed, would be where 80% consent has not been obtained for the RP of $860m. It is important to bear in mind the clear, obvious, and undisputed context – that what the owners of Chuan Park need in order to bring an application for collective sale is 80% consent and that the CSC was, in the process leading up to the SJAs, looking to find a RP for which there was 80% consent. If as the Defendants submit, the 1st SJA only becomes valid and binding when 80% have consented to the RP of $860m, this part of cl 3 would be effectively otiose. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 While the Defendants submit that this part of cl 3 could still be used by the CSC to arrive at a higher RP, so that there would be less or no objectors, this is not likely to be what this part of cl 3 was envisioned for. Having a higher percentage of consent does not prevent objections from being filed, since an objection could still be filed by a single owner. Hence, this aspect is not materially beneficial and unlikely to be the purpose. The Defendants also submitted that this part of cl 3 could be used to achieve 100% consent, which would then remove the need for an application under s 84A(1) of the LTSA for collective sale. Given the difficulties the parties had in achieving 80% consent, not to mention the difficulties of achieving 100% consent, and the timeline that the CSC had to meet, it is also not likely that in the context, this is what the parties had regarded this part of cl 3 as for.  I hence find that cl 3 of the 1st SJA at $860m contemplates that those who subsequently agree to a higher RP, could be treated as part of the same SJA for the purposes of cl 6.12.1 of the CSA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The text of cl 3 of the 2nd SJA also reinforces the view that both documents are to be treated as part of the same SJA. Clause 3 of the 2nd SJA states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Those OWNERS who had executed the SJA consenting to lower the Reserve Price to $860 million are deemed to have agreed to the revised Reserve Price of $890 million and are not required to sign this document.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Notably, cl 3 of the 2nd SJA refers to owners who executed the “SJA consenting to lower” the RP from the $938m as stated in the CSA down to $860m, as opposed to referring to owners who executed the 1st SJA or a separate SJA. It states that they are not required to sign “this document” as they are deemed to have agreed to the increased price, rather than they are not required to sign “this SJA”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">It is trite law that documents forming part of the same transaction may be read together for the purpose of determining their legal effect: </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Sunny Metal</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">at [30]</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">.</span> The Defendants submitted that the present case is distinguishable from <span class="font-italic">Sunny Metal</span> as the two SJAs were not contemporaneously created. Instead, they were created about six months apart while the documents in <span class="font-italic">Sunny Metal</span> were created about two days apart. In addition, the parties to the documents in <span class="font-italic">Sunny Metal</span> were the same while here the parties in the two SJAs are different. In my view, while contemporaneity and similarity of parties would be strong factors in considering whether documents form part of the same transaction, the facts that there was a time lag of about six months and that the parties to the respective SJAs were different does not rule out the possibility of the SJAs being treated as part of the same transaction. This is particularly so when there is contractual intention in the SJAs to treat them as such, as explained above. Following from this, I find that the requirement in cl 6.12.1 of the CSA (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that the SJA drawn up pursuant to that clause shall only be valid and binding if owners with not less than 80% of the total share value and total strata area have executed the SJA) refers to the 1st and 2nd SJAs collectively, and not the SJAs individually.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The decision in <span class="font-italic">Shunfu</span><span class="font-italic"> Ville </span>is also instructive. There, owners of Shunfu Ville representing 80% of the total share value and total strata area had initially agreed to a RP of $688m. A first supplemental agreement was prepared for the SPs to agree to a reduced RP of $628m. This did not obtain the requisite 80% consent. A second supplemental agreement was then prepared for the SPs to agree to an increased RP of $638m. In relation to this revised RP, the court found that the 80% Requirement was satisfied by adding up the total percentages representing the SPs who signed the collective sale agreement by taking into account other SPs who executed either the 1st or 2nd supplemental agreement but not the original collective sale agreement: <span class="font-italic">Shunfu</span> <span class="font-italic">Ville</span> at [81]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 While the same submissions canvassed by the Defendants here about the validity of the 1st SJA were not raised to the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Shunfu</span><span class="font-italic"> Ville</span>, it is useful to note the Court of Appeal’s response at [85] to the submission made there that it was not acceptable to approve what was in effect a different collective sale agreement with different parties than the one which had been consented in the first place. The Court of Appeal referred to cll 6.12.1 and 6.12.2 of the collective sale agreement. The wording of these clauses is found in the High Court’s decision in relation to the collective sale of Shunfu Ville, in <span class="font-italic">Woo Hon Wai and others v Ramachandran Jayakumar and others </span>[2017] SGHC 17 at [5]–[6]. Clauses 6.12.1 and 6.12.2 of the collective sale agreement in <span class="font-italic">Shunfu</span><span class="font-italic"> Ville</span> are materially the same as cll 6.12.1 and 6.12.2 of the CSA. The court said at [85]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the original CSA itself contained a contractual provision that was binding on all those who were party to it and which permitted each of these developments to take place. That is provided for in cll 6.12.1 and 6.12.2, which we have summarised at [79] above. As we conveyed to Mr Tan at the hearing, the only point of those provisions in this case was to enable the subsidiary proprietors who had entered into the original CSA to withdraw from it if the price was lowered or if the terms were varied to a level or in a manner that was unacceptable to them, but on terms that new subsidiary proprietors would be permitted to join the CSA by signing a supplemental agreement, if they so wished. Where this very eventuality has been contractually provided for, as it was in this case, we can see no basis for holding that such a contractual arrangement would violate, offend or be otherwise contrary to the scheme envisaged by s 84A(1) and paras 1 and 2 of the First Schedule to the LTSA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 In the present case, cl 3 of the 1st SJA allows the signatories to agree to an upward revision of the RP to $890m without having to sign a further document. Clause 3 of the 2nd SJA also expressly treats those who have executed the 1st SJA as having also agreed to the RP of $890m without having to sign “this document”. The point of these provisions is to allow the parties to agree on an upward revision of RP, such as to $890m, without having to sign the same document. Where this is contractually provided for, I do not see any basis for finding that their agreement in writing to the RP of $890m should be disregarded.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Furthermore, none of the parties who have signed the CSA or the SJAs, have maintained that these agreements were invalid. I do not see how the Defendants, who are not even privy to these contractual agreements, can raise objections that the agreements are contractually invalid. In particular, I do not find any merit in the Defendants’ submission that the 1st SJA at RP of $860m is not binding and invalid.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Ultimately, the question here is whether the requirements of s 84A(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the LTSA has been met, in that the requisite 80% “have agreed in writing” to the collective sale. I find that, as at 5 July 2022, 342 units with a total share value of 1409 shares (80.93%) and total strata area of lots of 46,133m2 (80.11%) had consented to the collective sale of Chuan Park at $890m, through agreements in writing in the form of the 1st and 2nd SJA. The 80% Requirement set out in s 84A(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the LTSA has thus been met for the collective sale of Chuan Park.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The law on the “good faith” requirement in s 84A(9)(</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">a</span><span class="font-weight-bold">)(</span><span class="font-weight-bold">i) of the LTSA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Section 84A(9)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) of the LTSA requires the High Court to be satisfied that the transaction was in good faith before approving an application for collective sale<span class="font-italic"> </span>pursuant to s 84A(1) (the “‘good faith’ requirement”). Specifically, the Sale Price Ground and the Apportionment Ground relate to the factors set out in ss 84A(9)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i)(A) and (B), respectively:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(9) The General Division of the High Court or a Board must not approve an application made under subsection (1) —</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) if the General Division of the High Court or Board (as the case may be) is satisfied that —</div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-justify">(i) the transaction is not in good faith after taking into account only the following factors:</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">(A) the sale price for the lots and the common property in the strata title plan;</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">(B) the method of distributing the proceeds of sale; …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The Court of Appeal has considered the “good faith” requirement extensively in the cases of <span class="font-italic">Shunfu</span><span class="font-italic"> Ville </span>and <span class="font-italic">Ng Eng Ghee</span><span class="font-italic"> and others v Mamata Kapildev Dave and others (Horizon Partners Pte Ltd, intervener) and another appeal </span>[2009] 3 SLR(R) 109 (“<span class="font-italic">Horizon Towers</span>”). While the Grounds relate to different factors, the general law on the “good faith” requirement applies to the consideration of both Grounds. Thus, before considering the individual Grounds of the HC Objection, it is useful to set out relevant aspects of the law on the “good faith” requirement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 In <span class="font-italic">Shunfu</span><span class="font-italic"> Ville</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the Court of Appeal reaffirmed at [58] its holding in <span class="font-italic">Horizon Towers </span>at [134] that a collective sale committee is subject to the following five duties: </div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) the duty of loyalty or fidelity; </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) the duty of even-handedness; </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) the duty to avoid any potential conflict of interest; </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(d) the duty to make full disclosure of relevant information; and </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(e) the duty to act with conscientiousness. </div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 The court in <span class="font-italic">Shunfu</span><span class="font-italic"> Ville</span> also emphasised at [59] that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… there is generally little to be gained in slicing up the sequence of events and attempting to argue that any one of them goes towards establishing lack of good faith; rather, <span class="font-italic">it is through a holistic assessment of the entire circumstances of the transaction that the court may determine whether there is in fact an absence of good faith which would bar the sale from proceeding.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 As for the burden of proof, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Kok</span><span class="font-italic"> Yin Chong and others v Lim Hun Joo</span> <span class="font-italic">and others </span>[2019] 2 SLR 46 (“<span class="font-italic">Kok</span><span class="font-italic"> Yin Chong</span>”), referencing the <span class="font-italic">dicta </span>of the Court in <span class="font-italic">Low Kwang Tong v Karen Teo Mei Ling </span>[2018] SGCA 86 at [2], held at [71] that it is “for the [objectors] to point out by credible evidence that the transaction was not in good faith”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 With these general propositions in mind, I turn to consider the remaining Grounds of the HC Objection. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 2: Whether the Sale Price was arrived at in good faith  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 The Defendants objected to the collective sale at the Sale Price of $890m on the basis that this price was not arrived at in good faith, as the CSC: </div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) did not ensure that a PAFS was carried out; </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) relied on a valuation report based on an incorrect GFA; and </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) did not take steps to verify the actual GFA of Chuan Park. </div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 It would be useful to keep in mind the law on the “good faith” requirement as it pertains to the sale price of a strata title property.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> Ms Seow agreed, testifying that the URA had by this letter granted outline permission without the PAFS, and that the URA will accept the PAFS at a point after the CSC finalises the sale. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 In light of the above evidence, I find that the CSC’s failure to obtain a PAFS was not a breach of its duty to act with conscientiousness. I elaborate on my reasons below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 First, there is nothing in the wording of the Circular which suggests that the Circular was intended to be a directive from the URA for the CSC to conduct a PAFS prior to the completion of a collective sale. The only deadline imposed by the Circular is at para 8, which states that the PAFS should be submitted “before making the applications to URA”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Moreover, some of the specific items that para 4 of the Circular requires to be incorporated in the PAFS, such as the "traffic demand management and/or feasible transport improvement plans to be carried out and implemented by the developers", may be difficult for the CSC to propose as the CSC would not be the ones developing or implementing these plans. Both Ms Yick and Ms Seow were of the view that the information required by para 4 of the Circular was not the sort that a collective sale committee can typically provide. While the Defendants submit that para 4 provides that parties shall engage an experienced traffic consultant to assess the transport impact, that does not change the fact that the items required by the Circular to be incorporated into the PAFS requires a developer’s inputs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 Second, the URA 2022 Letter is consistent with the above reading of the Circular. In that letter, the URA granted the Developer outline permission, without the Developer having done a PAFS. From para 5 of the Letter, it is clear that the LTA had already provided preliminary comments and had not required the PAFS to be done before URA granted outline permission. This being the case, it could hardly be said then, that the CSC was required by the URA to conduct the PAFS prior to its conclusion of the collective sale.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 Third, both parties’ expert witnesses were also of the view that while the PAFS would be required at some stage, it was not a requirement imposed on the valuer before providing valuation of the development site for collective sale or on the CSC before it concluded the collective sale.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 As there is no basis for claiming that the Circular was a directive directing the CSC to conduct a PAFS, and there being no requirement to conduct a PAFS at this stage of the collective sale application, the omission to conduct a PAFS cannot be said to constitute a failure by the CSC to act in the best interests of all the SPs. Thus, I find that the omission to conduct a PAFS does not constitute a breach of the CSC’s duty to act with conscientiousness. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Duty to obtain the best price reasonably obtainable </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 As explained by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Horizon Towers </span>at [154]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The duty to obtain the best price arises out of the [collective sale committee’s] duty to act conscientiously as well as to act even-handedly in the collective interest of all the subsidiary proprietors. The duty to obtain the best sale price is particularly crucial for the objecting subsidiary proprietors. As alluded to at [114] above, such subsidiary proprietors may be compelled by virtue of an STB order to sell their units either at a price which they were not prepared to accept or where they were in fact not prepared to sell their units at any price for personal reasons. In such circumstances, their only consolation or compensation for losing their units is the sale price they will receive. The [collective sale committee] must therefore strive to achieve the best premium available for the subsidiary proprietors by obtaining the best price for the development as a whole. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 The Defendants submit that the CSC’s failure to conduct the PAFS resulted in the Sale Price not being the best price reasonably obtainable in the prevailing circumstances. The Defendants’ view was that doing a PAFS would immediately increase the interest in and marketability of Chuan Park. Despite knowing this, the CSC did not carry out a PAFS. In support of this submission, the Defendants relied on a slide presented by ERA at the owners’ meeting, on possible reasons why there were no bids in the first public tender exercise. One of the bullet points in the slide was that a PAFS on traffic impact “is required for redeveloping Chuan Park Site” and had not been carried out.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 Relying on Ms Yick’s Report, the Claimants’ position is that carrying out the PAFS may lead to a lower land value, contrary to what the Defendants seek. As stated at para 14.4 of Ms Yick’s expert report: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Should a PAFS be conducted and the <span class="font-italic">proposed development is found to have a significant traffic impact on the locality in question, it would lead to a reduced number of dwelling units to be allowed and the effect is likely a lower land value</span> would result which would be counter-intuitive to the desire of the objectors.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 I accept Ms Yick’s evidence. Her explanation is supported by para 6 of the URA 2022 Letter, which states that the maximum number of dwelling units is subject to PAFS clearance by the LTA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 In light of this, I find that it is not clear that doing a PAFS would have immediately increased the marketability of Chuan Park, contrary to what the Defendants submit. With regard to the slide which the Defendants relied on, the lack of a PAFS was only one of several bullet points stating possible reasons why there were no bids in the first public tender exercise. However, this simply meant that the need for PAFS was one of the considerations of potential developers, along with the other factors listed in that slide such as “LTA/URA Regulations &amp; Policies”, “High Insurances Premium”, “Material &amp; Construction Cost” and “ABSD Penalty (25% payable) – must sell all the Units within 5 Years”. It is not the Defendants’ case that the CSC is under some duty to also resolve these other issues for a potential developer.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 I hence find that the Defendants have not shown that the sale price of $890m was not the best price reasonably obtainable in the circumstances because the CSC did not ensure that a PAFS was carried out.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Incorrect GFA Ground </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 The Defendants also initially objected to the Sale on the ground that the price of $890m was not arrived at in good faith as the CSC relied on a valuation report from Ms Yick, whose valuation was based on a GFA of 78,152.76m2 based on a plot ratio of 2.1 and not the GFA of 89,824m2 based on the development baseline plot ratio of 2.41.

</div> However, the defendants did not pursue this at the oral submissions at the end of the hearing, after the two valuation experts gave their evidence. Instead, the Defendants narrowed down their submission in relation to the incorrect GFA to this: the Sale Price had not been arrived at in good faith because the CSC recklessly agreed to one Clause 6E.1.2(E) in the SPA. For completeness, I have addressed both submissions below. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Valuation based on GFA of 78,152.76m2</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 Ms Yick testified that her valuation was based on the information available at the time of the valuation – that the development is based on the Master Plan with a plot ratio of 2.1 and had a GFA of 78,152.76m2. Ms Yick did not make any assumptions as to whether a developer could subsequently obtain approval from URA to increase the plot ratio to the higher development baseline plot ratio of 2.41.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 The Defendants relied on the opinion of Ms Seow that the market value of Chuan Park was $930m. She testified in court that she arrived at this figure by taking the average of the valuation using the residual method (which Ms Yick used) and the direct comparison method. It is not necessary for the purposes of this analysis to go into the differences between the two methods. What is material is that Ms Seow accepted that the entire premise of her valuation rests on the assumption that the verified GFA of Chuan Park was 89,824m2 (with a plot ratio of 2.41).

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> when the URA-ERA Emails 2021 showed that there was no basis for the guarantee made here. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 According to the Defendants, this Clause guarantees that there would be a minimum floor area of 89,824m2 for development baseline as reflected in the URA Letter 2017. However, the URA had, through their email correspondence in 2021, informed ERA that the URA was prepared to only commit to saying that no development charge would be payable for a plot ratio “up to” 2.1 plus GFA bonus. As the CSC had no basis to make this guarantee in the face of URA’s reply, it was reckless to do so. This recklessness demonstrates a lack of good faith in arriving at the Sale Price. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 In response, the Claimants submitted that the URA had repeatedly stated that the governing factor is the Master Plan plot ratio of 2.1 and the CSC was conscientious and acted in good faith in accepting that. What was put into the terms and conditions with the Developer was entirely what URA communicated. The URA Letter 2017 is exhibited in the terms and conditions themselves, as Clause 6E.1.2(E) refers to “a copy of which is set out in Schedule 1A”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 The relevant parts of Clause 6E.1.2 state:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">6E.1 The sale and purchase herein is subject to the Purchaser obtaining:</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">6E.1.2. outline planning permission (“OPP”) from the competent authority appointed under the provisions of the Planning Act 1998 (“Competent Authority”) for developing the Land into residential development(s):</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">(A) of not less than <span class="font-underline">919 dwelling units;</span></div><div class="txt-body text-justify">…</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">(C) with gross plot ratio of <span class="font-underline">not less than 2.1</span>;</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">(D) with gross floor area (not inclusive of bonus gross floor area) of <span class="font-underline">not less than 78,152.76 square metres</span>;</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">(E) with a <span class="font-underline">minimum floor area of 89,824 square metres for development baseline as reflected in the reply dated 30 August 2017 from the Urban Redevelopment Authority, a copy of which is set out in Schedule 1A</span>;</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112  It can be seen from the above that Clause 6E.1.2 does not contain any guarantee from the CSC to the Developer. It simply sets out that the sale and purchase is subject to the Developer obtaining outline planning permission from the URA, as the “Competent Authority”, for a residential development which contains the elements listed above. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 Similarly, the CSC was not making any guarantee in Clause 6E.1.2(E) to the Developer about a minimum floor area of 89,824m2 for development baseline. Rather, the clause is simply stating that one of the conditions for the sale is that the URA approves the development baseline of 89,824m2, which is the figure the URA indicated in the URA Letter 2017. As Clause 6E.1.2(E) states that a copy of the URA Letter 2017 was set out in Schedule 1A of the SPA, the Developers would have had sight of this letter. Thus, they would have had knowledge that the figure therein of 89,824m2 was, as stated at para 4 of the URA Letter 2017, “conveyed … for purpose of computing development charge and does not indicate the allowable development potential on the site.” </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 I find that, contrary to the Defendants’ submission, there are no guarantees made by the CSC in Clause 6E.1.2(E). There is hence no merit to the Defendants’ submission that the CSC did not arrive at the Sale Price in good faith by being reckless in agreeing to Clause 6E.1.2(E) to the Developer.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The GFA Verification Ground</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 The Defendants also submitted that the sale price of $890m was not arrived at in good faith as the CSC did not verify the GFA of Chuan Park. The Defendants made two points in relation to this. First, the Defendants submitted that the CSC allowed ERA, the marketing consultant, to exclude from its scope of services the verification of the GFA of the development and the development baseline. These are important factors when arriving at the eventual sale price. As such, no conscientious owner would allow the marketing consultant to exclude from its services such verification applications, which cost just thousands of dollars.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 The Defendants also submitted that even after ERA wrote to the URA to enquire on the GFA and the development baseline, the reply from URA stated that the GFA of Chuan Park was unverified. Despite knowing this, the CSC did not take steps to verify the GFA. Paragraph 6.4(ii) of the Planning Act Master Plan Written Statement states that where a development is approved for “an intensity higher than the prescribed maximum permissible intensity, such approved intensity shall … be deemed to be the prescribed maximum intensity of the land.”

It is undisputed that the ERA did verify the development baseline with the URA.

The URA in its reply in the URA-ERA Emails 2021, expressly stated that “the proposed development will be guided by the parameters in the prevailing Master Plan at GPR 2.1 for Residential Use”. While the correspondence that the Defendants relied on, was adduced through the Claimants’ 4th Joint Affidavit that was filed on 20 April 2023, not long before the start of the hearings, the Defendants nevertheless did not take any steps at all, to show that the verification of the as-built GFA may have resulted in a higher plot ratio than 2.1. All that was relied on was an unsupported assertion by Ms Seow. Further, the Defendants did not provide any calculations that might hint at the plot ratio being higher than 2.1. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 Moreover, Chuan Park has not been redeveloped since it was first built in 1989, on a plot ratio of 1.55. This was set out in a piece of paper that is pasted on one of the pages of the sales brochure of Chuan Park that the Claimants adduced at Exhibit C3. While Mrs Spkyerman could not confirm who pasted this paper, she testified that “Far East” was marketing Chuan Park at that time and they could have done this. This was not challenged by the Defendants, nor was the accuracy of the information contained on that paper, in particular the plot ratio of 1.55.

This MOA was based on the recommendation of the previous sales agent, Cushman &amp; Wakefield, in 2017. Applying the MOA of 65% strata area and 35% share value would result in a premium variance of 22.66%.

Ms Yick explained that she examined the variances of collective sale premiums based on a wide spectrum of combinations amongst share value, strata area and valuation ranging from, 100% share value; 100% strata area; 50% share value and 50% strata area; and various other percentage combinations of share value and strata area, according to a combination method that involves various permutations of share value, strata area, and valuation.

For the Sale Price of $890m, the MOA returns similar results. This MOA achieved the smallest difference (2.86%) between the unit type with the highest premium (56.74%) and the unit type with the lowest premium (53.88%), compared to apportionments of a different combination. For the premium test analysis which she used, the method that shows the lowest variance in the collective sale proceeds premiums amongst all typical residential/commercial units is deemed to be the fairest and the most equitable manner of distributing the sale proceeds amongst all owners.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 In other words, as the difference was small, any gain enjoyed or loss suffered by individual households compared to others was marginal.

The court in <span class="font-italic">Realty Centre</span> found at [50] that, comparing the two, even if the second MOA “was not the perfect apportionment method, it was <span class="font-italic">overall </span>more even-handed and equitable to <span class="font-italic">all </span>the SPs, and supported the plaintiffs’ case that the adoption of MOA2 was not tainted by bad faith”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 Here, the MOA that the CSC relied on resulted in a premium variance of 2.86% while the method that Mr Foo advocated for (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, a MOA based on 65% strata area and 35% share value) resulted in a premium variance of 22.66%.
