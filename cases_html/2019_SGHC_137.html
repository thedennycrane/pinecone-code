</div> According to the report of Dr Audrey Yeo, prepared on 24 August 2017, shortly after the Deceased’s death, the Deceased’s “[i]schaemic heart disease can give rise to heart failure or potentially fatal cardiac arrhythmias, the latter manifesting as sudden unexpected death, be it at rest, or with physical exertion. Accordingly, it would not be possible to predict if any specific activity at work contributed to his death.”

This issue turned on whether Meera had authority to engage the services of the deceased. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 The Commissioner held that Meera had no such authority, and that the deceased was therefore never in the respondent’s employment. Further, even if the deceased was an employee of the respondent, his death did not arise “out of and in the course” of that employment as he had gone on a frolic of his own in using the forklift which he was not authorised to handle. The Commissioner thus concluded that the respondent was not liable to pay compensation to the claimants.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 On appeal, Choo J held that questions of law had been raised as the Commissioner had erroneously applied agency principles and failed to consider the presumption in s 3(4) WICA. The Commissioner’s misapplication of the law led to the erroneous findings of fact that Meera had no authority to engage the deceased, and caused him to fail to find, pursuant to the unrebutted s 3(4) WICA presumption, that the accident had arisen in the course of the deceased’s employment.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 One important question is what is an “accident” under s 3(1) WICA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 In <span class="font-italic">NTUC Income </span>at [24], Menon JC observed that an accident “would include an <span class="font-italic">internal medical condition that caused an unexpected injury </span>while the worker was carrying out his work” [emphasis added]. Two observations can be made about this passage. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, “in assessing whether an event is an accident within the meaning of the Act, it is material to consider this from the <span class="font-italic">point of view of the workman </span>and not from the point of view of one with actual knowledge of the circumstances including any pre-existing medical conditions” [emphasis added] (<span class="font-italic">NTUC Income </span>at [30]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Secondly, while Menon JC’s observation included the phrase “while the worker was carrying out his work”, I do not think this is an additional requirement for an incident to constitute an accident for the purposes of s 3(1) WICA. As Menon JC noted in the same decision, even “rupturing an aneurism when tightening a nut with a spanner may be regarded as an accident” (<span class="font-italic">Clover </span><span class="font-italic">Clayton &amp; Co, Limited v Hughes </span>[1910] AC 242 at 245–246, per Lord Loreburn LC; cited with approval in <span class="font-italic">NTUC Income </span>at [23]). Similarly, in <span class="font-italic">Pang Chew </span><span class="font-italic">Kim</span>, where it was shown that the workman’s death (<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> the injury) was, on a balance of probabilities, caused by cardiac arrest (<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> the accident that stemmed from an internal medical condition), Tay Yong Kwang J (as he then was) had no hesitation in finding that the workman’s death was caused by an accident within the meaning of s 3(1) WICA (see <span class="font-italic">Pang Chew Kim </span>at [25]). Hence, that “the worker was carrying out his work” is <span class="font-italic">not </span>an essential element for an incident to constitute an accident (see the second requirement). Instead, whether the worker was carrying out his work at the time of his accident falls properly to be considered at the third stage, where the query turns to whether the accident arose <span class="font-italic">out of </span>and <span class="font-italic">in the course </span>of the workman’s employment (see the third requirement).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">This reading is consistent with the ordinary meaning of “accident”. The Oxford English Dictionary defines an accident as an unfortunate incident that happens unexpectedly and unintentionally, typically resulting in damage or injury. An accident is basically an unexpected mishap that happens by chance and is unintentional in nature. It is irrelevant in this regard whether the person was carrying out any work at the time when the incident occurred.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 In this case, the Deceased suffered from “severe coronary heart disease” (the “internal medical condition”), which meant that “even low level exertion” could trigger a heart attack.

</div> In <span class="font-italic">Zhao </span><span class="font-italic">Xiaojuan</span>, the workman was employed in construction sites. On the material day, at about 5.00pm, his colleagues found him lying motionless on the ground. He was subsequently transmitted to National University Hospital and diagnosed as having an intracerebral haemorrhage.

The employer objected to the compensation, but the Assistant Commissioner of Labour dismissed their objections.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 On appeal, Choo J noted that in the case, there was only evidence of the workman’s stroke, and “no evidence that it was brought about by an exertion” (<span class="font-italic">Zhao </span><span class="font-italic">Xiaojuan </span>at [16]). As the evidence before the court only went to showing that the workman’s injury was caused by his internal medical condition, the employer’s appeal was allowed, and the workman was not entitled to a claim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 The present case is not one with a complete dearth of evidence; in fact, the evidence from the trio when read in its proper context was that the Deceased had been observed by the trio at certain intermittent points of time (albeit not continuously) to have been carrying out the work of removing the wheels of the fourth bin <span class="font-italic">prior</span> to his collapse (see [51]–[53] above).

If so, the employer would have succeeded in rebutting the presumption and the employer would have proved on a balance of probabilities that, notwithstanding the Deceased’s act of removing the wheels of the bin, the Deceased’s heart condition was the sole cause of the accident and the accident did not therefore arise out of his employment. Without such testimony on the doctors’ part, it is mere speculation that the Deceased’s death was caused <span class="font-italic">solely </span>by his heart condition.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 In the circumstances, the s 3(6) WICA presumption is unrebutted, and I find that the Deceased’s death which was caused by the accident in the form of a heart attack arose “out of … the employment” of the Deceased.
