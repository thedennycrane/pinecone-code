Second, AAG had failed to respond to the concerns that she had raised through her counsel’s letters. AAG had purportedly failed to analyse the Husband’s credit card expenditures and the nature of the expenses, and omitted to trace all of the Husband’s earnings. Third, the Wife also claimed that there were various errors and gaps in AAG’s approach to its task. Hence, she submitted that the report should be “given little weight, if at all”.

The questions of whether any of the grounds for drawing an adverse inference or returning assets to the pool of matrimonial assets have been made out in this case are for the court to answer. In the present case, I rely on the AAG report only insofar as it communicated figures and facts extracted from the bank and financial statements provided by the parties to AAG. Neither party has raised concerns about the accuracy of these figures, let alone showed that these figures were wrong.

</div> As I see no reason to apply the classification methodology, I will adopt the global assessment methodology accordingly.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Dissipations and non-disclosure</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 A number of the arguments in this case relate to alleged dissipations, unreasonably incurred expenses, and adverse inferences drawn on the basis of non-disclosure. As these issues touch on a number of steps in the division exercise and also concern a number of different assets, it is convenient for me to deal with these concepts at the outset. The Court of Appeal has given guidance on these issues in the recent decision of <span class="font-italic">UZN v UZM</span> [2020] SGCA 109 (“<span class="font-italic">UZN</span>”) which was handed down on 30 October 2020. I summarise the Court’s guidance as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The court’s duty is “to ensure that the matrimonial pool reflects the full extent of the material gains of the marital partnership”: <span class="font-italic">UZN</span> at [59]. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) One means of doing so is to draw adverse inferences against a party who has failed to make full and frank disclosure of assets. The drawing of an adverse inference is based on the notion that “there is concealment of matrimonial assets which should be included for a fair division under s 112 of the Women’s Charter”: <span class="font-italic">UZN</span> at [61].</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Another conceptually different means of ensuring that the matrimonial pool reflects the material gains of the marriage is to add the values of certain assets into the pool on the basis that a party has expended substantial sums when divorce proceedings are imminent: <span class="font-italic">UZN</span> at [62]. This is based on the <span class="font-italic">dicta</span> in <span class="font-italic">TNL v TNK and another appeal </span><span class="font-italic">and another matter</span> [2017] 1 SLR 609 (“<span class="font-italic">TNL</span>”) at [24] (which the Court of Appeal referred to as the “<span class="font-italic">TNL dicta</span>”). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Further distinct from either of these two approaches is the wrongful dissipation provision in s 132(1) WC. It is distinct from the <span class="font-italic">TNL dicta</span> as the latter does not require “culpability” – the expenditure may be for entirely innocent reasons: <span class="font-italic">UZN</span> at [65]. It is distinct from adverse inference for non-disclosure because the latter is concerned with disclosure, whereas wrongful dissipation is concerned with the act of dissipation itself. The Court of Appeal recognised the possibility of drawing adverse inferences based on concealment of assets or wrongful dissipation, based on conduct even prior to when divorce proceedings are imminent: <span class="font-italic">UZN</span> at [66]. However, this would generally be difficult to justify – “it is difficult to believe that the parties would have intended to withdraw assets for the purpose of concealing or putting them out of reach of the other spouse during a time when their marital relationship was still functioning”: <span class="font-italic">UZN</span> at [66]. Since this is a matter of proof,  the possibility remains open nevertheless, but the facts must justify such an approach. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) These categories may overlap – one party may expend money in such a manner as to satisfy the requirements of the <span class="font-italic">TNL</span> <span class="font-italic">dicta</span> and also amount to wrongful dissipation, while also failing to disclose the movement of these assets, thereby justifying an adverse inference. These categories are, however, also conceptually distinct: see <span class="font-italic">UZN</span> at [68].</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) In general, therefore, the position in relation to expenditure of assets by one party can be summarised as follows (<span class="font-italic">UZN</span> at [70]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The court is not concerned with the justifiability of expenses stretching indefinitely into the past, but rather with what assets there were at the relevant time (usually, at the IJ date). As we explained at [22]–[24] above, in respect of accounting for how a spouse’s income has been expended, their expenses shed light on whether the earnings have in fact been used up, or have instead been concealed. Restrictions on the parties’ disposal of large quantities of matrimonial assets, meanwhile, generally only come to the fore after divorce proceedings are imminent, as explained in the <span class="font-italic">TNL dicta</span> (see [62]–[65] above). On the other hand, if a party appears to be spending significant sums of money which the other spouse does not support (say, on gambling activities) <span class="font-italic">before</span> divorce proceedings are imminent, the argument is instead one of financial irresponsibility, which will impact the question of the parties’ direct and indirect contributions to the marriage in applying the <span class="font-italic">ANJ </span>structured approach (see [67] above). This argument would have no impact on the identification or quantification of the matrimonial assets themselves. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 With this guidance from the Court of Appeal, it is necessary to consider the specific bases for each party’s contentions. As the parties did not have the benefit of this guidance during the AM hearings or submissions, it may be necessary to attempt a reconstruction of their cases according to the Court of Appeal’s descriptions of these different ways of ensuring that the pool of matrimonial assets accurately reflects what was earned and obtained during the marriage. I deal with these issues as and when they arise in the following discussion.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Identification and valuation of the matrimonial assets</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Operative dates for identification and valuation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 The operative date for the identification of the matrimonial assets was a matter of some dispute between the parties.

</div>
</div> which I will refer to as the “purported date of separation”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 Both parties acknowledged that the starting position is that the IJ date is the starting point: <span class="font-italic">ARY v ARX and another appeal</span> [2016] 2 SLR 686 (“<span class="font-italic">ARY</span>”) at [31]. In that case, the Court of Appeal held at [31]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In our judgment, while the court retains the discretion to select the appropriate operative date to determine the pool of matrimonial assets, there is much to be said that,<span class="font-weight-bold"> unless the particular circumstances or justice of the case warrant it</span>, the <span class="font-italic">starting point</span> or <span class="font-italic">default position</span> should be the date that interim judgment is granted. [emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 The Court of Appeal gave essentially three justifications for this starting point. First, the IJ is what puts a substantial end to the marriage contract such that the parties are taken no longer to intend to jointly accumulate matrimonial assets: <span class="font-italic">ARY</span> at [32], citing <span class="font-italic">AJR v AJS</span> [2010] 4 SLR 617 at [4]. In other words, the IJ “put[s] an end to the whole content of the marriage contract, leaving only the shell, that is, the technical bond” (<span class="font-italic">Fender v St John-</span><span class="font-italic">Mildmay</span> [1936] 1 KB 111 at 115–117, cited in <span class="font-italic">ARY</span> at [32]). Second, division could well occur at the same time as the IJ if all the relevant material is before the court at the time: <span class="font-italic">ARY</span> at [33]. Third, adopting a starting point of the IJ date allows the parties to arrange their financial affairs and to know when they are treated as “having moved into a different phase in their lives”: <span class="font-italic">ARY</span> at [34]. Relatedly, it would enable counsel to better advise their clients. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 In the Court of Appeal’s reasoning, the IJ date is not simply a starting point from which the court should readily depart. The justifications stated above suggest that the IJ date should <span class="font-italic">generally</span> be used as the operative date, and the discretion to depart from that date is there to “ensure that justice is done in every case”: <span class="font-italic">ARY</span> at [35]. The Court of Appeal emphasised that the court should depart from the starting point only in “deserving cases”, where there are “cogent reasons” to do so, and that the court should “exercise care when it decides to depart from the starting point” and should provide reasons when doing so: <span class="font-italic">ARY</span> at [34]–[36].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 The authorities have also provided the following further guidance as to how the court should assess an argument that the starting point of the IJ date should be departed from: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the court should pay attention to the relationship between the parties after the purported date of separation. Continued involvement and provision would suggest the existence of a “<span class="font-italic">continuous (albeit clearly </span><span class="font-italic">attenuated) relationship</span>” [emphasis in original] between the parties: <span class="font-italic">Oh Choo</span><span class="font-italic">n v Lee Siew Lin</span> [2014] 1 SLR 629 (“<span class="font-italic">Oh Choon</span>”) at [14], cited by <span class="font-italic">ARY</span> at [39]. This relationship would then only be brought to an end with the IJ, and there would be no reason to depart from the IJ date as a starting point. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, the court should distinguish between exceptional features that would warrant a departure from the starting point and “the ordinary factual concomitants of a failed marriage”: <span class="font-italic">ARY</span> at [40]. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, the court should be mindful of the fact that using the IJ date would enable the court to better account for any continuing contributions (direct or indirect) made by the parties to the marriage: <span class="font-italic">TEG v TEH</span><span class="font-italic"> and another matter </span> [2015] SGHCF 8 (“<span class="font-italic">TEG</span>”) at [24]. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Finally, underlying many of these factors is a recognition that marriage continues to be a legal union even if the relationship has disintegrated: <span class="font-italic">ARY</span> at [40]; <span class="font-italic">TQU v TQT </span>[2020] SGCA 8 (“<span class="font-italic">TQU</span>”) at [38]. In this regard, the use of the IJ date as the starting point is already a concession to the fact that, in reality, at the time of the IJ only the “technical bond” of marriage remains (see [17] above), while the actual bond of marriage is severed only upon final judgment. It is therefore not appropriate to push the operative date back even further than the IJ date simply on the basis that the relationship has fallen apart while the legal union remains. Some other exceptional circumstance must exist to justify using the date of separation as the operative date for identification of the matrimonial assets.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Having identified these factors, I turn to the Husband’s argument in this case. The Husband emphasised that he had moved out of the matrimonial home on 8 July 2012. By January 2013, he had moved into his own leased apartment. In September 2013, the parties came to an agreement that they would be able to date other people, and agreed in writing that they would wait for six months before introducing new partners to the Child.

The Husband also spent a few days a week with the Child and some weekends. However, they disagreed about the significance of these acts. In addition, they also disagreed over the facts concerning whether they continued to have conjugal relations and their attitude towards each party seeing other people romantically. Nevertheless, even if I assume these facts in favour of the Husband (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that they did not continue to have conjugal relations and they had agreed that they would be able to date other people), I do not find that it is necessary to depart from the starting point in the interests of justice. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25  First, the Husband clearly continued to support the Wife and Child even after the purported date of separation: see <span class="font-italic">Oh Choon</span> ([19(a)] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [12]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Second, the Husband was involved in their lives and continued to be a presence. They spent time together as a family during special occasions, and the Husband took care of the Child for a few days a week.

It was a marriage, even if it was a marriage between two people who had grown distant and who contemplated that they might become romantically or sexually involved with other people. Taken together with the facts that the Husband continued to provide and was present for some of their family life, I find that there was an ongoing, if attenuated, relationship: see <span class="font-italic">Oh Choon</span> at [12]. Indeed, even in a case as extreme as <span class="font-italic">TQU </span>([19(d)] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) where the marriage had broken down in 2001, and the Wife had already applied without success for divorce twice in 2001 and 2010 before the IJ was finally granted pursuant to a third application in 2016, the Court of Appeal did not consider it appropriate to depart from the starting point: see <span class="font-italic">TQU</span> at [4] and [38]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Although it was suggested to me that <span class="font-italic">TQU </span>could be distinguished,

</div> even if true, must be weighed against the fact that no steps were taken to end the legal union and that they did continue to maintain some form of a family life, no matter how limited, disjointed, and unhappy. There, as here, the parties remained in a “legal albeit unhappy union” that was grounded in some reality: see <span class="font-italic">TQU</span> at [38]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 I clarify here that I do not understand the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">TQU</span> at [38] to mean that as long as the legal union is subsisting, there is no possibility of departing from the starting point, and that it is irrelevant to consider the factual union (in distinction to the legal union). There is nothing in the Court of Appeal’s reasoning that suggests this absolute position, which would also be contradictory to the position taken in <span class="font-italic">ARY</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([16] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>). First, there are factors other than the breakdown of the factual union that may render it appropriate to depart from the starting point. One such situation is where one party “incurs a large amount of expenditure from having ‘indulged in certain vices’ such that the matrimonial assets have been ‘unfairly or unjustly depleted by the unacceptable actions of that party’”: <span class="font-italic">ARY</span> at [35]. The fact that the legal union subsists would not prevent the court from departing from the starting point where the facts justify it. Second, there may be instances where the extent of the breakdown of the factual union justifies a departure from the starting point. There are differing degrees of breakdown to which the court must remain sensitive. There may be cases where the relationship between parties has absolutely come to an end before the IJ, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, where one party disappears completely, such that anything done by the parties cannot be attributed to the existence of a familial or matrimonial relationship. However – and this is related to the point below – where the relationship has broken down but there still remains a connection between the parties and some semblance of family life, the existence of the legal union would suggest that the marriage <span class="font-italic">does</span> subsist and the appropriate date for identification would remain the IJ date, when that legal union is brought to a (tentative) end. While the court retains the “flexibility to ensure that justice is done in every case”: <span class="font-italic">ARY</span> at [35], what <span class="font-italic">TQU</span> does suggest is that the court should not readily depart from the starting point. To do so would undermine the three justifications identified by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">ARY </span>(summarised at [17] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Fourth, the various facts emphasised by the Husband appear to me to be the “ordinary factual concomitants of a failed marriage”: see <span class="font-italic">ARY</span> at [40]. That one party moved out, grew distant, participated in family life in a limited way, and began seeing other people romantically appears, unfortunately, to be a reality in many relationships that have broken down. There is nothing so exceptional in this case that would warrant a departure from the usual starting point. Even the allegations that the Wife was smearing the Husband’s reputation do not, in my view, constitute exceptional circumstances, since bad blood and even enmity can certainly exist between parties in a marriage. Finally, as the Wife continued to take care of the Child, I find that it is more appropriate to take the operative date as the IJ date to better account holistically for the contributions of the parties to the marriage: <span class="font-italic">TEG</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([19(c)] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [24]. Therefore, having considered all of these factors, I conclude that there is no reason to depart from the starting point, and find that the operative date of identification should be the IJ date, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 23 February 2018.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Given what I have heard of the parties’ arguments, I find it necessary to remind parties that the selection of the operative date of identification is not intended, in most cases, to either reward or punish one or the other of the parties to the marriage. The concern, rather, is to achieve fairness between the parties. Further, the complexity of interpersonal relationships means that the court should be slow to assume that certain decisions would or would not have the effect of incentivising good conduct or disincentivising bad conduct. Finally, I observe that it is realistic for the court to acknowledge that relationships can both improve and disintegrate over time. The court should be cautious of dividing the relationship with an artificially clear line where one does not exist. Remaining with the IJ date as the operative date of identification serves to avoid this risk as it centres the exercise on a clearly identified juridical act that demarcates a break in the parties’ relationship.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 I turn then to consider the operative date for valuing the matrimonial assets. The Husband argued that the “latest available date” should be used for valuation,

</div> The Wife submitted that the court should value the assets as at the date of the AM hearing, unless the parties have otherwise agreed in relation to particular assets. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 The default position is that the matrimonial assets should be valued at the date of the first AM hearing, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> 15 January 2020: <span class="font-italic">TDT v TDS and another appeal and another matter</span> [2016] 4 SLR 145 (“<span class="font-italic">TDT</span>”) at [50]. I see no reason in principle to depart from this starting point. Where the parties have arrived at agreed valuations at the earlier IJ date, however, or proposed a choice between the purported date of separation and the IJ date, I choose not to disturb their agreement and will use the agreed valuations at the IJ date. I also note that because of how the parties have been content to run their cases, the evidence of valuations was largely focused on valuation <span class="font-italic">as of the IJ </span><span class="font-italic">date</span> rather than as of the AM date. As such, given the state of evidence and how the parties have chosen to advance their claims, it is necessary to use the IJ date for many of the assets in this case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Further, I observe that the date of valuation for assets like bank and Central Provident Fund (“CPF”) accounts should be the IJ date. As the High Court Family Division held, “the [matrimonial assets] are the moneys and not the bank and CPF accounts themselves”: <span class="font-italic">BUX v BUY</span> [2019] SGHCF 4 at [4]. It follows that the value of these accounts is in fact identical to the amount of money identified to be present at the IJ date. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Exchange rates</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 The parties have agreed to utilise the exchange rate of US$1.00 = S$1.13 for the purposes of these AM proceedings, for the assets denominated in US dollars. For assets denominated in Australian dollars, the exchange rate used is A$1.00 = S$0.96.

The Husband argued that he had to take out a loan (“the SCB Personal Loan”) of S$95,000.00 in order to make a contribution to the [X] LLP Capital Account, and the outstanding loan amount should be deducted from the gross value. Given that this is a standalone loan rather than a loan secured on the Capital Account, and it is disputed whether the Wife should share in the liability, I prefer to deal with this below under the Husband’s disputed assets and liabilities (see [98] below).

The Wife claimed that she needed to surrender the policy because the Husband had restricted her access to funds. First, she alleged, the Husband had transferred S$705,350.00 from the parties’ joint account to his CitiGold Account ending in 1015 (for which, see below at [84]). Second, in early 2016, the Husband imposed a S$10,000.00 monthly credit limit on the Wife’s Citibank supplementary Visa credit card (“the Citibank Supplementary Card”). She had raised concerns about her expenses to the Husband at around that time, for example, by way of an email dated 7 March 2016.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 In my judgment, this is an appropriate case in which to return the surrender penalty to the pool of matrimonial assets. In this case, the writ of divorce was already filed in <span class="font-italic">January</span> 2017. The surrender of the FPI policy was in October 2017, after the filing of the writ. In this regard, the Court of Appeal held in <span class="font-italic">TNL</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([13(c)] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [24]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [T]he issue is how the court should deal with substantial sums expended by one spouse during the period: (a) in which divorce proceedings are imminent; or (b) after interim judgment but before the ancillaries are concluded. We are of the view that if, during these periods, and whether by way of gift or otherwise, one spouse expends a substantial sum, this sum must be returned to the asset pool if the other spouse is considered to have at least a putative interest in it and has not agreed, either expressly or impliedly, to the expenditure either before it was incurred or at any subsequent time. Furthermore, this remains the case regardless of whether: (a) the expenditure was a deliberate attempt to dissipate matrimonial assets; or (b) the expenditure was for the benefit of the children or other relatives. The spouse who makes such a payment must be prepared to bear it personally and in full. In the absence of consent, he or she cannot expect the other spouse to share in it. What constitutes a substantial sum is, of course, a question of fact and we do not propose to lay down a hard and fast rule in this regard, except to emphasise that it is not intended to include daily, run-of-the-mill expenses. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Although the FPI policy was in the Wife’s name, both the Husband and the Wife were the lives assured under the policy. I also agree with the Husband that there were other options available to the Wife, and that her unilateral decision to surrender the FPI policy at that time resulted in a reduction of the pool of matrimonial assets available for division. While I recognise that the Wife may have felt that she needed to surrender the policy at that time, I also note that the correspondence with the Husband concerning her expenses which the Wife referred to was earlier in 2016. The Wife has not pointed to any contemporaneous correspondence around the time of the surrender of the FPI policy in which the issue of expenses was discussed. Further, as the Husband has highlighted, even though the credit limit was reduced from S$40,000.00 to S$10,000.00 in early 2016, the credit card statements show that the Wife did not regularly reach beyond S$10,000.00.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Husband’s 2nd Affidavit of Asset and Means dated 21 October 2019 (“HAAM2”) at p 280. </div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> Her business decisions in 2016 were therefore unilateral, and expended resources that the Husband could claim a putative interest in. Given that Company [Y] is now dormant, I prefer to treat the money as expended rather than being the subject of a loan (which would be treated as an existing asset held by the Wife against Company [Y]). This, in my view, is the only realistic option.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 However, I do not see a basis in principle for returning money expended <span class="font-italic">before</span> 2016 into the pool of matrimonial assets. Although the parties were separated, divorce proceedings were not yet imminent. That there was on-going disagreement between the Husband and the Wife over Company [Y] is not, in and of itself, sufficient to suggest that the funds put into the company should be returned. Losses incurred by one party to the marriage are generally to be borne by the couple. This follows from the fact that marriage is “in part an economic union in which each spouse’s financial well-being is entwined with the other”: <span class="font-italic">ATT v ATS</span> [2012] 2 SLR 859 (“<span class="font-italic">ATT</span>”) at [11]. There, the Court of Appeal held at [11]–[12]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">11 … Just as gains are shared, so should the losses. It cannot be the case that appreciating assets fall to be divided as part of the common pool whilst depreciating assets or liabilities incurred in seeking to enhance the wealth of the family are attributed entirely to the investing spouse. Adopting such a stance would unfairly penalise the breadwinning party for every financial loss incurred. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">12 … The passive spouse must take the good as well as the bad, unless that spouse can show that the losses were not incurred <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> or for some other good reasons should not be treated as a loss of the family. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 This must be considered together with the recent pronouncement of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">UZN </span>([13] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [70]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Restrictions on the parties’ disposal of large quantities of matrimonial assets, meanwhile, generally only come to the fore after divorce proceedings are imminent, as explained in the <span class="font-italic">TNL dicta</span> (see [62]–[65] above). On the other hand, if a party appears to be spending significant sums of money which the other spouse does not support (say, on gambling activities) <span class="font-italic">before</span> divorce proceedings are imminent, the argument is instead one of financial irresponsibility, which will impact the question of the parties’ direct and indirect contributions to the marriage in applying the <span class="font-italic">ANJ </span>structured approach (see [67] above). <span class="font-weight-bold">This argument would have no impact on the identification or quantification of the matrimonial assets themselves</span>. [emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 In other words, losses incurred by one spouse should generally be borne by both parties to the marriage. Losses, however, can take different forms in different cases, and what form the loss takes in a particular case may affect how it is treated. In the present case, the dispute is over sums expended in a loss-making enterprise, which the Husband wants to be returned to the pool of matrimonial assets. This is not a case where there is a debt and the question is who should bear it and in what proportions. Where the issue is whether sums of money should be <span class="font-italic">returned</span> to the pool of matrimonial assets, the court is guided by the authorities at two levels: (a) whether there is a reason to depart from the usual principle that the family should bear the loss together: see <span class="font-italic">ATT</span>; and (b) if so, whether the sum of money should be returned to the pool of matrimonial assets: see <span class="font-italic">UZN</span>. According to <span class="font-italic">UZN</span>, it is only if the divorce proceedings are imminent that sums of money should be returned to the pool of matrimonial assets. Otherwise, if (a) is answered in the affirmative but divorce proceedings are not imminent, the court deals with the issue in terms of contributions rather than identification of assets.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Hence, in this case, given my finding that the divorce proceedings were imminent in 2016, I choose only to return the sum injected into Company [Y]’s business by the Wife in 2016, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, S$22,000.00, to the pool of matrimonial assets. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(C) Credit card debts</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The Wife urged the court to deduct liabilities that she had incurred from the pool of matrimonial assets. These were a credit card debt for her HSBC Credit Card No ending in 3723 (“HSBC Card 3723”) and a personal loan in SCB CreditOne Account No ending in 4318 (“SCB Account 4318”), with debts of S$27,894.16 and S$34,365.08 as of the IJ date respectively. The Husband argued that the Wife should be made to bear these liabilities herself. In substance, his argument was that the Wife should not have incurred these liabilities, and, as such, these liabilities should not be deducted from the pool of matrimonial assets.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 In my view, the principles to apply to such an argument are the same as those found in <span class="font-italic">TNL</span> ([13(c)] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [24]. A decision not to allow liabilities to be deducted from the matrimonial assets is, in substance, the same as a decision to return sums expended into the pool of matrimonial assets. The only difference is whether the expenses were paid for up-front with cash, or whether credit was used for the purchases. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 In relation to HSBC Card 3723, the transactions worth more than S$1,000.00 were helpfully extracted in the report by AAG.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> In my view, there was nothing so exceptional in any of these transactions such that the amounts should be borne by the Wife herself. Although there was expenditure for luxury goods and apparel, as well as travel, around 2016 and 2017, I do not find that any of these are “substantial” in the manner referred to in the <span class="font-italic">TNL dicta</span>, especially given the lifestyle to which the Husband and Wife were accustomed to. I therefore find that it is appropriate to include this liability in the pool of matrimonial assets, as this sum would otherwise have had to been paid by cash. In relation to SCB Account 4318, I take the same approach as the Husband’s arguments in relation to this account were largely the same. I also include this liability in the pool of matrimonial assets. Therefore, I account for these two liabilities in arriving at the value of the pool of matrimonial assets.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(D) Loan from family</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The Wife’s parents had provided money to her by way of various bank transfers through the years. The Wife argued that these were loans that she had to repay, and asked for these sums to be deducted from the pool of matrimonial assets.

The dispute, therefore, was whether the wife <span class="font-italic">still owed money</span> to the husband’s mother, which was an issue primarily to be determined between the wife and the husband’s mother, not between the wife and the husband. The High Court Family Division was therefore the view that the alleged loan should not be dealt with in the matrimonial proceedings, and declined to deduct the loan amount from the pool of matrimonial assets: <span class="font-italic">UTL</span> at [53].  It bears noting that in <span class="font-italic">UTL</span>, the argument does not appear to have been that the loans were to be considered as matrimonial liabilities, but that the outstanding sums should be deducted from the pool as some kind of set-off. Such an argument clearly could not be sustained if the alleged creditor was not a party to the proceedings. In my view, <span class="font-italic">UTL</span> can be distinguished given the particular nature of the argument run by the husband in that case. In the present instance, the Wife argued instead that the loans from her parents were in the nature of debts incurred for her expenses, and that the debts should be borne by both parties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 I take reference from the jurisprudence surrounding non-party claims to interests in matrimonial properties, usually by way of a resulting trust: see <span class="font-italic">UDA v UDB</span><span class="font-italic"> and another</span> [2018] 1 SLR 1015 (“<span class="font-italic">UDA</span>”). In those cases, where the property is in the name of one of the parties and no order is sought by or against the non-party, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, where the non-party is a “‘shadowy’ figure in the wings”, the position is that the court is entitled to make an order under s 112 WC in relation to that property because that order would only bind the parties to the matrimonial proceedings: <span class="font-italic">UDA</span> at [58]. The difference between those category of cases and the present dispute is that the interests in the former are proprietary interests, whereas in the present dispute, I am concerned with a personal obligation allegedly owed by the Wife. However, in the final analysis, the principles to be applied are similar, since the key question is whether the court in hearing matrimonial proceedings should make any orders that may affect a non-party’s interests (whether proprietary or personal). It follows that the court continues to be able to make findings in relation to assets or obligations involved in the matrimonial proceedings even if it might touch on a non-party’s interests, but with the concomitant risk that one or the other party may be prejudiced if the non-party subsequently disputes the conclusion: <span class="font-italic">UDA</span> at [57]–[58]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 I therefore proceed to consider if the transfers should be treated as gifts or as loans, rather than to disregard the issue entirely. In my judgment, there is insufficient evidence to show that the transfers were intended as loans. The Wife has referred to two letters from the Wife’s mother, one dated 15 May 2019

</div> In my view, the evidence was not sufficiently clear to show that all of the sums transferred were intended as loans. First, the only relatively contemporaneous evidence was dated 6 February 2017. However, the message in that instance did not discuss any details of the loan arrangement, and in the context, it is possible that the word “lending” was used loosely. In any event, that message only pertained to one out of 11 transfers. Even if it is accepted that this sum was a loan, this did not indicate that the rest of the transfers were also loans. Second, the other evidence concerning the <span class="font-italic">details</span> of the loan arrangement are not contemporaneous and can only be found in the letters in May and November 2019. It is also worth noting that the 15 May 2019 letter did not contain any details as to the loan arrangement, which details are suddenly present in the 19 November 2019 letter. This did not inspire confidence that there was a loan arrangement from the outset.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Therefore, I do not deduct the alleged loan amount from the pool of matrimonial assets.

</div> Both parties appeared to proceed on the assumption that Airline Miles amounted to assets that could be divided.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Assuming for present purposes that Airline Miles can be divided as matrimonial assets under s 112 WC, I am of the view that it is not appropriate to do so in this case.  Neither party has presented any satisfactory way to value the Airline Miles, given that these are, effectively, concessions given by the airline company to reward loyalty. The parties have not provided the contracts between the Husband and the airline company to show how these Airline Miles operate. While <span class="font-italic">in specie</span> division was also mooted by the parties, no evidence has been put before me about whether such Airline Miles can be transferred or assigned to give effect to an order for <span class="font-italic">in specie</span> division. As neither party has provided sufficient basis for valuation or division, and there is no indication that their value would be significant in the context of the entire pool of matrimonial assets, I decline to include the Airline Miles into the pool of matrimonial assets. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 I note here that I leave open the question whether Airline Miles can be treated as matrimonial assets until it can be considered with full arguments from counsel. I observe that the power of the court in these proceedings is governed by s 112 WC. Under s 112(1) WC, this is the power to “order the division between the parties of any matrimonial asset” or the sale of such asset and division of the proceeds of sale. As a preliminary point, it must be shown that what the parties intend for the court to divide is an <span class="font-italic">asset</span> within the meaning of s 112(1) WC. The only decision which appears to have dealt with the question of Airline Miles is <span class="font-italic">TLY v TLZ</span> [2016] SGFC 35, a decision of the Family Court, to which the Wife referred. At [14], the learned District Judge considered Airline Miles as matrimonial assets to be divided. I note though that no reasons were provided for why they were included.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 The Court of Appeal has observed in <span class="font-italic">Chan Teck Hock David v Leong Mei </span><span class="font-italic">Chuan</span> [2002] 1 SLR(R) 76 (“<span class="font-italic">Chan Teck Hock</span>”) at [17] that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [T]he term “matrimonial asset” has been given a very wide meaning by the legislature to include any asset of any nature, subject only to the specific exception [<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>in s 112(10)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) WC, concerning gifts and inheritance]. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">While the term is broad, it still must refer to an “asset”. It is not entirely clear to me that points in a loyalty programme, even though governed by contract, which secure concessions and discounts towards purchases when used, can be treated as assets. There is also the question of how the term “assets”, as it is used in s 112(10) WC, relates to “property”.  A decision on this point may have implications for whether other things (to use a neutral term) like points in a loyalty programme or virtual objects like items in video games (which may have a real-world monetary value) may or may not fall within the scope of matrimonial assets. However, as this is not necessary in this case given my conclusion above, I do not come to a decision on this question.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(B)  [X] LLP Current Account</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 As noted above, the Husband, as a partner of [X] LLP, maintained two accounts with [X] LLP, a Capital Account and a Current Account. The dispute in relation to the [X] LLP Current Account is whether the sum recorded in the Current Account as the Husband’s profit share is a matrimonial asset to be divided. The Wife’s argument was that the balance of the Current Account represents the undisbursed amounts to which the Husband remains entitled, and is therefore a matrimonial asset that can be divided.

</div> The Husband disagreed and claimed that the Current Account was a merely notional account (in his words, “a mere statement”) and that it did not represent any assets. When the Current Account was in credit, these amounts would have been paid to the Husband as earnings or drawings, and when the Current Account was in debit, that sum represents over-drawings by the Husband which would have to be repaid or set-off.

First, at the end of each FY, the balance is carried over as the opening balance of the next FY. Second, the drawings from the current account are taken out of that opening balance, but always <span class="font-italic">exceed</span> that opening balance, leading to a debit in the balance prior to the addition of the profit for that FY. Third, the profit share for that FY (after various adjustments, for example, for tax) is added to that balance, resulting in the closing balance for the FY, and the cycle continues again to the following FY. In effect, what happens in each FY is that the profit share for that FY is “split” between making up for the deficit after the drawings in that FY and then being drawn down in the following FY, before being depleted and then running the Current Account into a deficit again.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Taking FY 2018 for illustration, the opening balance was S$588,192.00. The drawings from the Current Account for 1 July 2017 to 30 June 2018 totalled S$1,121,149.00, leaving a deficit of S$532,957.00. When the profit share for FY 2018 was added (and other adjustments made), that brought the Current Account into credit again, and the balance as of 30 June 2018 (including profit share and adjustments) was S$711,895.00. Based on the practice shown in the statements, that sum would then be drawn down from 1 July 2018 onwards. The total profit share for FY 2018 (after adjustments) was therefore split between (a) paying down the deficit of S$532,957.00; and (b) a balance of S$711,895.00 which is drawn down from 1 July 2018 onwards.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 Furthermore, the profit share stated is the profit share for <span class="font-italic">that</span> FY, meaning that it is the share of profits generated from 1 July of the prior calendar year to 30 June of the present calendar year. In other words, it was a profit <span class="font-italic">already</span> <span class="font-italic">earned</span> in that FY which was then disbursed in the following year after making up for any deficit in the Current Account. This is in contrast to a “salary”, strictly speaking – the Husband as a partner appears, on the evidence, to share in the partnership’s profit, which can only be determined retrospectively <span class="font-italic">after</span> the profit has been earned. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Second, this is consistent with the letter from [X] LLP tendered by the Husband. The fact that it is a “notional” account does not mean that there is no real entitlement to the money. “Notional” merely means that there is no direct correspondence to any particular money in any given bank account. It is an account kept independently of any particular asset, but which records a real entitlement to money. The letter also states that it records the allocation of net profits – these profits have already been earned in that FY and are then shared among the partners. The balance is then drawn down monthly in the following FY (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the prevailing practice), and the profits cannot be accessed in any way other than through this prevailing practice. In other words, the net profit is to be drawn down by the partner in the following FY. This is consistent with my description of the Current Account above. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 It follows that the balance as of 30 June 2018 represents the Husband’s entitlement to the profits of the partnership as of that date. In other words, this is money that he had <span class="font-italic">already earned</span> because it was generated in that FY. It is not a prospective prediction of future profits, or simply an expression of future income. I therefore do not accept the Husband’s claim that these sums are simply “income” to be earned in the future.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 I turn then to the second step in this analysis, which is to consider what part of the Current Account should be treated as matrimonial assets. I draw an analogy to the treatment of stock options by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Chan Teck Hock</span> ([66] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>). In that case, the Court held that unvested stock options, <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>“a contract to grant an option upon fulfilment of a condition”, were choses in action that could be treated as matrimonial assets under s 112(10) WC. In the present case, the entitlement to the profit share is even more clearly an <span class="font-italic">asset</span>, as it exists as a right that the Husband has to that share as a partner. In <span class="font-italic">Chan Teck Hock</span>, while one category of stock options had already vested as of the date of the decree <span class="font-italic">nisi</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>the IJ date), there were some that had not yet vested in the husband as of that date. Similarly, in the present case, the profit share for FY 2018 had not yet “vested” in the Husband as it was only included in the Current Account at the <span class="font-italic">end</span> of FY 2018, whereas the IJ date was in February 2018. The question in both <span class="font-italic">Chan Teck Hock</span> and the present case is how to deal with the “unvested” entitlement. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Chan Teck Hock</span> took the following approach (at [37]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">We would hasten to add that even as between the second and third categories of stock options, there is a need to differentiate between them. Whereas, in respect of the second category stock options, they were already vested (<span class="font-italic">ie</span> already earned), the same is not so in respect of the third category stock options. The husband had to continue rendering services to Dell beyond the date of the decree <span class="font-italic">nisi</span> to acquire the options. So in respect of these third category stock options, they were given not just for services rendered prior to the decree <span class="font-italic">nisi</span> but also for services to be rendered post the decree. Otherwise there would have been no necessity to postdate the vesting of options. In this regard, we would adopt the “time rule” advocated in <span class="font-italic">Hug</span> ([19] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) by the Court of Appeal of California. <span class="font-italic">The effect of that rule is to treat only that portion of the stock options as matrimonial assets as is obtained by multiplying the stock options in question by the fraction obtained between the period in months between the commencement of the husband’s employment with Dell and the date of the decree nisi as the numerator and the period in months between his commencement of the employment with Dell and the date when the stock option was exercisable by him as the denominator.</span> <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Only that portion of the third category stock options as so computed would be reckoned as matrimonial assets</span>. [emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 In my view, a similar approach can be taken to the Husband’s share in the FY 2018 profit. It would be inappropriate for the whole of that share to be treated as matrimonial assets as what the Husband earned for his work after February 2018 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>the month of the IJ date) would not be correctly identified as matrimonial assets based on the operative date of identification. At the same time, it is not possible to identify, on the evidence, how exactly the profit share was earned that year. Therefore, I choose to make a broad estimation in terms of months – assuming a constant earning of the profit share throughout the year, I identify only that part of the profit share that can be attributed to work done before February 2018 as matrimonial assets. Further, as there were various adjustments made to the profit share before it was added to the Current Account, I use the sum of S$1,244,852.00, being the <span class="font-italic">net</span> profit share indicated in the relevant statement which already incorporates those adjustments, .

The portion of the FY 2018 profit share that can be attributed to work done prior to the IJ date would be <img alt="Math Equation" class="img-fluid" src="data:image/Png;base64, iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAA0AAAAbCAYAAACnZAX6AAAAAXNSR0IArs4c6QAAAARnQU1BAACxjwv8YQUAAAAJcEhZcwAADsMAAA7DAcdvqGQAAABXSURBVDhP7dDrCgAQDIDRvf9LTxNaG1tbIuUrP1xOBDDRSwgA1Jhl3hRGK0DtQxagLiIPUP6JSTlEzwmPhkN91Kqof6WMfzNvzNSGMV8i2Rkk91yk1xELI2L8PMbN8LAAAAAASUVORK5CYII="/>, as seven months of work was done before the IJ date.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 There are a few clarifications that must first be made before I address the substance of the issue. First, as the Court of Appeal stated in <span class="font-italic">UZN</span> ([13] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), the court is not concerned with assessing the reasonableness or otherwise of expenses throughout the marriage. It is generally only when divorce proceedings are imminent that “[r]estrictions on the parties’ disposal of large quantities of matrimonial assets … come to the fore”: <span class="font-italic">UZN</span> at [70]. In this case, the Husband’s complaints about the Wife’s expenses from 2012 onwards would mostly fall before the period when divorce proceedings were imminent. However, here, there was the added factor that the parties had separated in 2012, and even if divorce proceedings were not imminent, the facts may justify the inference that there was wrongful dissipation (as opposed to dissipation that could be returned pursuant to the <span class="font-italic">TNL dicta</span>). Further, there were allusions to non-disclosure as well as dissipation in the Husband’s submissions. Since the submissions were not made with the benefit of the Court of Appeal’s guidance in <span class="font-italic">UZN</span>, I consider it fair to consider the contentions from the perspectives of all the categories articulated by the Court of Appeal. Hence, in the following, I consider <span class="font-italic">wrongful</span> dissipation, non-disclosure for the majority of the alleged withdrawals, and also the <span class="font-italic">TNL dicta</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 I begin with wrongful dissipation. Although divorce proceedings were not imminent between 2012 and 2015, as negotiations for the divorce began only in 2016 and the writ was filed on 13 January 2017, this was also not a case where the alleged dissipation occurred when the marriage was fully functioning. The parties had already separated in 2012 after the Husband’s adultery, and they were living a large part of their lives separately. While it may be hard to believe that sums of money withdrawn by one party early in the marriage was for the purpose of concealment or putting the assets out of the reach of the other party (<span class="font-italic">UZN</span> at [67]), this is less so in the present case given the state of the relationship. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 However, despite these circumstances, I am not convinced that there was wrongful dissipation of the sum of S$234,995.92. First, in relation to the cheques, the Husband’s claim was that the Wife had sole possession of the cheque book and it was the Wife withdrawing the sums in question. I do not find that this has been sufficiently established on the evidence.  The Wife has shown an example of a cheque signed by the <span class="font-italic">Husband</span> as well.

</div>
</div>
</div> Second, also in relation to the cheques, I note that this was a joint account – the Husband would have had access to these statements, but he did not follow up with the Wife at the time. This suggests that either the Husband would also have known about the purpose of the cheque withdrawals, or that he accepted these payments without confronting the Wife, or that these claims were afterthoughts. Third, the Husband’s general arguments on these withdrawals were essentially that the Wife had failed to explain why these withdrawals were made. However, the Wife had given explanations for most of them – the issue was only that the Husband refused to accept these explanations in the absence of documentary evidence. The problem with this was that many of the explanations given by the Wife were that the monies were used for general expenses. It would be unreasonable to expect the Wife to have kept receipts and documentary records of such expenditure over a six-year period from 2012 to 2018. Finally, I do not see any basis to suggest that the Wife was concealing these assets or putting them beyond the Husband’s reach. There was little reason for the Wife to have needed money from her parents (see [58] above) or incurred debts (see [54] above) if she had already siphoned significant sums of money out of these accounts. Unless that was an elaborate scheme to hide the fact that she was doing so (of which there is again no evidence), this suggests that she was spending rather than siphoning money. I do not find that there was any wrongful dissipation in the sense of transfers to conceal or put assets beyond the Husband’s reach. I also am unable to see how the evidence shows that she intended to deplete the pool of matrimonial assets. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 I turn then to the issue of adverse inferences. In this regard, there is a link between wrongful dissipation and adverse inferences, where the assets allegedly hidden and not disclosed are also allegedly the proceeds of wrongful dissipation. In order to draw an adverse inference, a necessary condition is that there is a “substratum of evidence that establishes a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case against the person against whom the inference is to be drawn”: <span class="font-italic">UZN</span> at [18], citing <span class="font-italic">BPC v BPB and another appeal</span> [2019] 1 SLR 608 (“<span class="font-italic">BPC</span>”) at [60]. Specifically, there must be a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case of <span class="font-italic">concealment</span>: <span class="font-italic">AZZ v BAA</span> [2016] SGHC 44 at [107]. Where the assets purportedly concealed are the proceeds of dissipation by withdrawals from other assets, a logical first step must be that there must have been such dissipation. Where there is no evidence of that dissipation (as opposed to mere expenditure), it becomes harder to show that there was non-disclosure of those assets, as there is a question even as to whether those assets exist. This is a different situation from where there are clearly assets that <span class="font-italic">should</span> be present, but are not, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, where the income of one party is substantially higher than the assets present at the time of the AM hearing. In this case, given that there is no evidence of such dissipation, I am not able to find that there is a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case that the Wife has concealed such assets. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 I turn finally to the <span class="font-italic">TNL dicta</span>. In this case, there were withdrawals from 2015 onwards, which would be when divorce proceedings were imminent. In order for the <span class="font-italic">TNL dicta</span> to apply, however, it must be shown that the sums expended were substantial. Considering the sums highlighted by the Husband, and taking only those sums expended after the second half of 2015 (as a rough cut-off date for when the divorce proceedings could be considered to be imminent, given that negotiations surrounding the divorce occurred in 2016) but before the IJ date (as the balance of the accounts as of the IJ date would already account for these sums), the withdrawal sums range from S$2,400.00 (on 15 December 2017 from DBS 7629) to S$21,000.00 (on  19 February 2018 from DBS 6978). The largest sum of S$21,000.00 appears, however, to be a composite sum in that it was used for the repayment of credit card loans, which would have been expenses incurred in discrete parts – it would be more appropriate to look at the individual expenses charged to the credit card rather than the use of cash to repay part of the debt. In view of the parties’ lifestyle, I do not think that any of these sums can be considered substantial for the purposes of the <span class="font-italic">TNL dicta</span>. Further, while they may be substantial if <span class="font-italic">taken together</span>, there is no indication that these withdrawals were done pursuant to any overarching plan and that they can be treated as being one withdrawal. In the absence of such evidence, they should be taken as separate withdrawals, each of which are not substantial enough for the purposes of the <span class="font-italic">TNL dicta</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 Therefore, for these reasons, I do not accept the Husband’s arguments and choose not to add back in any of the S$234,995.92 to the pool of matrimonial assets, whether on the basis of wrongful dissipation, adverse inferences drawn for non-disclosure, or the <span class="font-italic">TNL dicta</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Sums spent on the Husband’s extra-marital relationships</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 I turn to the Wife’s argument that sums allegedly expended by the Husband on his extra-marital relationships should be returned to the pool of matrimonial assets. In advancing this argument, the Wife alluded to wrongful dissipation, the <span class="font-italic">TNL dicta</span>, and adverse inferences based on non-disclosure. The substance of the Wife’s argument, however, is that these were monies <span class="font-italic">expended</span> by the Husband when they should not have been, and that this reduced the pool of matrimonial assets available for division. There was no argument that there were, in reality, assets that the Husband had failed to disclose or which he had put out of the Wife’s reach. I therefore focus on wrongful dissipation and the <span class="font-italic">TNL dicta</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 I begin with the facts. It is not disputed that the Husband had a number of extra-marital relationships. It cannot also be seriously disputed that the Husband had spent money on those relationships. As the Husband admitted in his affidavit, for example, he shared in expenses for meals and drinks, as well as travel expenses, with one of his partners.

</div> However, the extent of that expenditure is not entirely clear. The Wife pointed to at least S$88,961.25 spent on hotel and air travel between 2014 and 2018 (part of which, she claimed, would have been used for the Husband’s relationships) and also argued that the absence of any other quantified expenses was due to the Husband’s failure to disclose all those expenses. At the hearing before me, counsel for the Wife clarified that the claim was for half of that sum to be returned to the pool of matrimonial assets.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 With respect to wrongful dissipation, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">UZN</span> ([13] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [68] identified the principle that the wrongful dissipation had to be “carried out with the intention of depleting the matrimonial pool”. The mere fact that the Husband had used these assets during the subsistence of the marriage for his extra-marital relationships does not, in and of itself, suggest any intention to deplete the matrimonial pool. Based on the evidence, I am unable to conclude that the Husband had intended to deplete the matrimonial assets by this expenditure.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 With respect to the <span class="font-italic">TNL dicta</span>, the issue that the Wife faced was that the sums expended were not quantified. The Wife has not shown that the sums expended were “substantial”. It is not every expense, even if made without consent, that would qualify to be returned to the pool of matrimonial assets. The burden lies with the Wife to point to any particular expenditure or transaction which she claims ought to be returned to the pool of matrimonial assets. It is also not clear that the Husband had spent anything more than he would otherwise have spent on himself, since he apparently <span class="font-italic">shared</span> in the expenses with his partners rather than just paid for his partners’ expenses as well. In my view, the <span class="font-italic">TNL dicta</span> cannot be relied upon in this case to return unquantified expenditure over a number of years into the pool of matrimonial assets.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 I acknowledge that it <span class="font-italic">seems</span> unfair, on the face of things, that the Husband should not be made to bear the expenses that he had made for his romantic partners on his own. However, on closer inspection, this is not so. The court is not ultimately concerned with examining each expenditure made by the parties and determining if the expense is justified. Neither is it ultimately concerned with punishing one or the other party for their actions during the marriage. What the court is concerned with is ensuring that its division of the matrimonial assets is just and equitable, which requires that it identifies the matrimonial assets with as much accuracy as possible as of the operative date of identification. Assets that have been hidden can be dealt with by way of adverse inferences and wrongful dissipation. Assets that should be a part of the pool of matrimonial assets but were taken out when divorce proceedings were imminent can also be added back in, but the court will only do so for substantial sums that can be identified. As these sums would have been <span class="font-italic">spent</span>, returning them to the pool has a negative impact on the party against whom that finding is made. Even in such an emotive context, it is important that <span class="font-italic">both</span> parties are treated fairly. Further, allowing such claims for small sums spent on numerous occasions would risk turning AM proceedings into “an acrimonious excavation of the past”: <span class="font-italic">UZN</span> at [73]. There is also no indication that these sums would have a significant impact on the final division of matrimonial assets. However, in the appropriate case, money spent on extra-marital relationships may be returned to the pool of matrimonial assets. This is, in the end, an extremely fact-sensitive question and requires close attention to the extent and nature of the purported dissipation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 For these reasons, I do not return any of the sums allegedly spent by the Husband on his extra-marital relationships to the pool of matrimonial assets.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(4) Adverse inference against the Husband</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 The Wife’s second argument concerns material non-disclosure of savings that were missing from the Husband’s disclosure of assets (“the Missing Savings”). She claimed that the Husband had hidden these assets and failed to provide full and frank disclosure in these proceedings. I first consider whether the conditions for drawing an adverse inference have been satisfied in this case. If so, I then consider how the adverse inference should be given effect to in this case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 In order to draw an adverse inference against the Husband, there must be a substratum of evidence that establishes a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case of concealment against the Husband, and that person must have had particular access to the information he is said to be hiding: <span class="font-italic">BPC</span> ([108] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [60]. The central issue here is whether such a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case can be made out. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 The Wife’s argument can be summarised as follows. The Husband had responded to an interrogatory asking him to “confirm that [he] has saved the balance amounts of his income for the period of 1 Jan 2012 to 23 Feb 2018 after deducting tax and his monthly expenses”. The Husband replied that he had saved that balance amount. On that basis, the Wife claimed that the Husband had S$1,449,621.68 in Missing Savings. First, she identified the total income generated as S$4,954,101.00 between 1 July 2012 and 30 June 2017 as set out in [X] LLP’s letter dated 8 October 2018.

Instead of relying on the Husband’s declaration of his expenses, this calculation focused on the expenses that were evidenced by various documents provided during the discovery process. Here, the calculated expenses from January 2012 to February 2018 were found to be S$3,195,393.02.

First, while the methodology proposed by the Wife was sound as “a matter of logic”, it sets a dangerous precedent as it suggests that litigants would have to account for every expenditure over the course of the marriage.

</div> Second, the Wife’s calculations were incorrect as it omitted certain purchases. On a related point, the calculations also omitted to include big-ticket purchases. Once these are accounted for, there are no longer any “missing” savings and, hence, no <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case has been made out against the Husband that would justify an adverse inference for non-disclosure. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 As between the Wife’s Primary and Alternative Calculation, I find it difficult to accept them as “alternative” submissions as counsel for the Wife suggested.
                   <sup><button class="btn btn-link superscript-btn" data-target="#fn-bc620cb8-55ad-40af-9d3c-9fc96fe55da2" data-toggle="modal" type="button">120</button></sup>

</div> Rather, it appears to me that the Alternative Calculation were simply more <span class="font-italic">precise</span> and more <span class="font-italic">accurate</span> in that they were based on actual expenditure rather than the broad estimate of monthly expenses found in the Husband’s affidavit evidence. Such estimates, even if grounded on evidence and a history of expenditure, are not intended to provide a basis for calculating the actual expenses incurred during any given period. Further, such estimates may not account for one-off, occasional or irregular purchases. Neither would the estimate appear to account for the <span class="font-italic">Wife’s </span>expenses which were paid out of the same accounts. Hence, where there is more specific and precise evidence of expenditure, that should be followed. Further, there is no indication that the expenses included in the Alternative Calculation led to concealed assets as compared to the Primary Calculation – in other words, the Wife appeared to accept that the difference between the Primary and Alternative Calculation was due to real expenditure rather than concealment. Since the Wife herself has put forward the Alternative Calculation as being justified by the evidence, I assess the Wife’s contention against the Husband on the basis of the Alternative Calculation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 Having considered the parties’ submissions, I do not find that the Wife has shown that there is a substratum of evidence that gives rise to a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case of concealment against the Husband. In principle, the approach taken by the Wife appears to be logically sound. As the Court of Appeal observed in <span class="font-italic">UZN</span> ([13] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [24], where the parties approached the issue in a similar manner:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In general, using a broad-brush approach, a party’s income over the years of marriage is usually reflected in the value of her assets in the pool (whether immovable property, shares or cash balances in bank accounts), after living expenses are taken into account. Most cases thus do not take on the approach that the present case did – totalling the income in question and examining if the use of the income has been accounted for. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The present case concerns a spouse who earned a substantial income during the marriage over a good number of years and yet has negligible assets at the time of divorce.</span> <span class="font-italic">In such a situation, there ought to be some explanation for this discrepancy.</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Was it because the family had a disproportionately high standard of living and the spouse was not a prudent saver or investor? Was it due to a major financial crisis that caused great losses? Was the spouse in a habit of giving massive donations to various causes?</span> [emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 The Court of Appeal then made an observation that addresses the concern raised by counsel for the Husband that such an approach would needlessly complicate the approach of the courts to the division of matrimonial assets (<span class="font-italic">UZN</span> at [25]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">We would caution that such a detailed analysis of the parties’ earnings and expenditure for the purposes of determining the extent of the matrimonial assets should not be taken as a matter of course. This would not be in keeping with the principles we have reiterated at [20]–[21] above. <span class="font-italic">Instead, such an approach may be used in cases where there is already good reason to suspect, upon a preliminary overview, that there is a mismatch between a party’s assets and their means.</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The present case is a similar one, where the disclosed cash balance in the Husband’s own account and the joint accounts was minimal compared to the Husband’s income of over S$4m from 2012 to 2018. This gives a good reason to inquire further into the parties’ expenses. However, in this case, the evidence does not support the Wife’s contention that the discrepancy should be attributed to the existence of assets which have not been disclosed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 I note that the Alternative Calculation does not appear to be complete. There were a number of expenses that were not accounted for in the Alternative Calculation. For example, counsel for the Husband contended that the Husband had paid S$131,908.44 for the Jaguar Car using a credit card. However, that sum was not reflected in the Alternative Calculation, as counsel for the Wife accepted.

Including this sum into the Wife’s calculations, the difference between the income and expenditure is only S$46,354.57 (being S$845,028.36 − S$798,673.79).

As such, I find that the requirements for drawing an adverse inference have not been met in this case. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion on

The parties agreed that the structured approach described in <span class="font-italic">ANJ v ANK </span>[2015] 3 SLR 1043 (“<span class="font-italic">ANJ</span>”) would apply. Under this approach, the court first arrives at “a ratio that represents each party’s direct contributions relative to that of the other party, having regard to the amount of financial contribution each party has made towards the acquisition or improvement of the matrimonial assets”: <span class="font-italic">ANJ</span> at [22]. Next, the court considers the parties’ indirect contributions and ascribes a second ratio which represents the contributions of each party to the family’s well-being relative to the other. The court then derives an average percentage contribution for each party, at which point further adjustments may be made to account for other considerations: see <span class="font-italic">ANJ</span> at [27].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Direct contributions</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Parties’ incomes</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 Given the state of the evidence and the fact that both parties were earning money at some point during the marriage, their respective incomes take on a very important role in the determination of their direct contributions.

His contract stated that his base salary plus bonus was to be A$101,852.00 per annum, before tax.

</div>
</div> This seems to be correct, since the S$190,000.00 and S$150,000.00 from the ING Account and the Wife’s bonus were more than adequate to cover the cash portion of the purchase price, given that the loan amount was S$1,530,000.00. I therefore do not count the renovations as a separate item.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 In my view, the first three items should be apportioned between the parties in the ratio of their respective incomes up to but not including 2007. However, as the Husband conceded, they did not have substantial savings after their time in Japan. He acknowledged that it would only be realistic to calculate their contributions based on their income after they had moved to Singapore. I accept this concession by the Husband. This would provide a broad-brush estimate of their direct financial contribution in the form of these three items. Based on the figures above at [133], the total income of the parties from March 2004 to 2006 was S$890,640.10, with the Husband earning S$296,783.74 and the Wife earning S$593,856.36. Hence, I find that 33.32% of the value of the first three items should be attributed to the Husband, and 66.68% should be attributed to the Wife. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 As for the payment from the ING Account, I accept the Husband’s contention that the whole of the S$190,000.00 is to be attributed to him. The ING Account was in his sole name, and he was paid partly in Australian dollars. The Wife has not provided any evidence that her income in Japan was also transferred to Australia. Further, her employment in Japan was unrelated to Australia, so there was no reason to assume that the income would have been deposited in or transferred to an Australian bank account. In the absence of evidence from the Wife, I am not prepared to find that she had contributed to the S$190,000.00 used towards the purchase of the Bukit Timah Property. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 As for the loan repayments, the Husband divided the repayments into two periods, one when the Wife was still working, and the second when the Wife had stopped earning an income. I accept that this division makes sense. For the second period, it is clear that all the direct contributions came from the Husband. For the first period, the Husband proposed a ratio of 32:68 in favour of the Wife. Having regard to my findings on the parties’ respective incomes at [133] above, and using the total income from the beginning of the marriage to 2008 (when the Wife stopped working) as the basis, I find that the ratio should be 36.9:63.1 instead. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 I summarise the direct financial contributions to the Bukit Timah Property as follows:</div><table

But as the Court of Appeal cautioned in <span class="font-italic">TNL</span> ([13(c)] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [47], the court should not assign a ratio for the indirect financial contributions as a separate element from the non-financial contributions.

</div> The decision to move to Tokyo in 2002 was for the Husband’s benefit – she had to give up a position in a top-tier law firm in Australia to do so. When the Husband began facing difficulties at work, she then looked for and obtained a job in Japan. She would support the Husband’s interests in triathlons using her free time. When the opportunity came to move to Singapore, the Husband felt that he would be in a better position there to make partner at [X] LLP. Despite her preference to remain in Japan, she decided to follow the Husband to Singapore, which required her to find a new job. When she began working in Singapore in 2004, she continued to bear the brunt of managing the household, while the Husband pursued his own interests in triathlons.

The Husband had moved to Japan and then to Singapore with jobs in view, while the Wife looked for work after each move. Although this did not conclusively prove either way that the Wife was just following the Husband or that these were mutual decisions to move, I took into account that the transitions would have been harder for the Wife as she had to take the risk of not finding work and had to re-acclimatise herself to new workplaces regularly. By contrast, the Husband was working within the umbrella of [X] firms, allowing his career to progress smoothly between transitions.

Even if there was a full-time helper and the Child was sent to childcare, she was clearly the Child’s primary caregiver.

More generally, mere misconduct is not sufficient to warrant an adjustment of the division.

As this court observed in <span class="font-italic">NK v NL</span> (at [12]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In light of our current ‘no fault’ basis of divorce law, <span class="font-italic">it would serve no purpose to dwell on the question of who </span><span class="font-italic">did what, save where there might be a direct impact on the legal issues proper</span> … The salutary objectives sought to be achieved by the ancillary orders of division of matrimonial assets … remain paramount in guiding our review of the Judge’s ancillary orders. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">This court further observed thus (at [28]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… <span class="font-italic">[I]t is essential that the courts resist the temptation to lapse into a minute scrutiny of the conduct and efforts of </span><span class="font-italic">both spouses</span> … It would be counterproductive to try and particularise each party’s respective contribution … [emphasis added]. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">24 The question of when a spouse’s misconduct could be taken into consideration came before this court in <span class="font-italic">AQS v AQR</span> [2012] SGCA 3 …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">25 The aforementioned cases emphasise and reiterate the point that the hearing of the ancillaries is <span class="font-italic">not</span> intended to be another forum for parties to dredge up accusations and allegations relating to each other’s conduct. The court is not equipped to scrutinise the conduct of the parties to assign blame, nor should it be so in light of the no-fault basis of divorce embodied within the Act.

As none of the allegations, in my view, deal with extreme and undisputed misconduct, I do not deal with them further. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(5) Conclusion on indirect contributions</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">160 The Wife cited the cases of <span class="font-italic">Twiss</span><span class="font-italic">, Christopher James Hans v Twiss, Yvonne Prendergast</span> [2015] SGCA 52 (“<span class="font-italic">Twiss</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">ARY </span>([16] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) to support her submissions of a ratio of 80:20 in her favour. In <span class="font-italic">Twiss</span>, the Court of Appeal found (at [20]) that the husband’s and wife’s contributions were roughly equal in the first decade of marriage, but that in the second decade, the wife contributed significantly more than the husband, who was absent from the family for substantial lengths of time. The court therefore found that the ratio was 75:25 in the wife’s favour. In <span class="font-italic">ARY</span>, the court emphasised (at [61]–[62]) that the wife had given up her career for the children and the husband, the wife moved to Asia with the husband, and the wife was an active participant in the children’s activities, finding that the ratio was 70:30 in the wife’s favour. While comparisons with cases are sometimes difficult given the fact-specific nature of the inquiry, these are helpful guides in the exercise of the court’s discretion.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">161 The Husband’s submission that the ratio should be 70:30 in <span class="font-italic">his</span> favour was not justifiable. That would suggest that he was not just the financial provider for the family, but also took on a greater role with the Child than the Wife did (see <span class="font-italic">BUX v BUY</span> [2019] SGHCF 4 which the Husband cited). Neither of the two other High Court authorities cited by the Husband (<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, THL v THM </span>[2015] SGHCF 11 and <span class="font-italic">UGG v UGH (M.W.) </span>[2017] SGHCF 25) justified shifting the ratio of indirect contributions in the Husband’s favour in this case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">162 In my judgment, taking a broad-brush approach, a ratio of 60:40 in favour of the Wife is appropriate. In contrast to <span class="font-italic">Twiss</span>, the Husband here continued to be a physical presence in the Child’s life even after separation. The present case was similar to <span class="font-italic">AR</span><span class="font-italic">Y</span>, but I also give credit for the Husband’s significant involvement in the Child’s life even after the separation.  This was a marriage of 16 years (from 2002 to 2018). However, in reality, for six of those years from 2012 to 2018, the parties were living separately even though the marriage was subsisting. The Husband had earned a significant sum of money throughout the marriage, although the Wife earned more than the Husband in the first six years or so. The parties had moved multiple times, with the Husband remaining with [X] LLP throughout, while the Wife had to seek out different jobs. The Husband had a significant interest outside of work as well, which the Wife also shared in the costs of. The Wife chose to give up her work so that she could conceive. She suffered through a complicated pregnancy and, after the Child was born, was the primary caregiver for the Child. In these circumstances, a ratio of 60:40 in favour of the Wife is fair. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Average percentage contributions and adjustments</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">163 I summarise the ratios identified above as follows: </div><table class="table table-sm table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td style="background-color: rgb(217,217,217)"><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Contributions</span></div></td><td style="background-color: rgb(217,217,217)"><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Husband (%)</span></div></td><td style="background-color: rgb(217,217,217)"><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Wife (%)</span></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Direct</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-right">84.06</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-right">15.94</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Indirect</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-right">40.00</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-right">60.00</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Average (unadjusted)</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-right">62.03</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-right">37.97</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">164 The Husband argued that a further adjustment was needed to account for the money that the Wife had received during the course of the marriage, and to account for the lump sum of S$1.05m that she would receive as maintenance. He pointed to s 112(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and (<span class="font-italic">g</span>) WC, which read:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">112.</span>—…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) It shall be the duty of the court in deciding whether to exercise its powers under subsection (1) and, if so, in what manner, to have regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the following matters:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) any debt owing or obligation incurred or undertaken by either party for their joint benefit or for the benefit of any child of the marriage; </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">g</span>) the giving of assistance or support by one party to the other party (whether or not of a material kind), including the giving of assistance or support which aids the other party in the carrying on of his or her occupation or business …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">165 The Husband referred to <span class="font-italic">ANX v ANY </span>[2015] 1 SLR 728 (“<span class="font-italic">ANX</span>”) at [74]–[76] where the High Court had considered the sums received by the wife from the husband as well as the assets she would receive under a Deed of Separation to reject the Wife’s submission that she should be awarded 50% of the assets that remained to be divided. The High Court then awarded the wife 8% of the remaining assets, which it found was just in light of the amount obtained from the sale of a property that was granted to her under the Deed of Separation and the financial benefit she received during the marriage. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">166 In my view, there are no grounds for modifying the division of assets based on what the Wife had received <span class="font-italic">during</span> the marriage. The mere fact that the Wife did not work from 2008 onwards is not sufficient, in and of itself, to require an adjustment – her lack of contribution of income from 2008 onwards would be accounted for in terms of direct and indirect contributions. The fact that the Husband had supported Company [Y] financially is also not ultimately persuasive – that should be treated as an investment, for which the Husband would naturally have sought a share of the gains if the company had been profitable. This is a loss that both parties bear. As for the subsequent withdrawals from the joint accounts, that was part and parcel of married life, and I do not see any basis for suggesting that the expenditure was grossly excessive when considered against their lifestyle and standard of living. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">167 As for the maintenance of S$1.05m, I do not think that it is ultimately appropriate to take this into account. This case is different from the usual run of cases where division of assets and maintenance are both in issue and awaiting the court’s determination. In the usual case, the court first considers division and then <span class="font-italic">supplements</span> that with a maintenance order if necessary: <span class="font-italic">TNL</span> ([13(c)] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [63]. In the present case, the parties have agreed on a maintenance sum as well as a mode of payment and registered this in a consent order. The question is whether the agreed maintenance sum should be accounted for when arriving at a just and equitable division of matrimonial assets. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">168 I first distinguish the present case from <span class="font-italic">ANX</span>. In that case, the High Court was faced with a deed of separation that already divided some of the matrimonial assets, but which did not touch on the remaining assets. There was no issue of taking into account the maintenance sum in the division exercise. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">169 Next, I consider this from first principles. The guiding principle behind the grant of maintenance is that of financial preservation: <span class="font-italic">Foo Ah Yan v </span><span class="font-italic">Chiam Heng Chow </span>[2012] 2 SLR 506 (“<span class="font-italic">Foo Ah Yan</span>”) at [12]. In that sense, it is forward-looking – it “requires the wife to be maintained at a standard which is, to a reasonable extent, commensurate with the standard of living she had enjoyed during the marriage”: <span class="font-italic">Foo Ah Yan</span> at [13]. The division of matrimonial assets, however, is a backward-looking exercise, in the sense that it seeks to divide what <span class="font-italic">has</span> been accumulated in the marriage, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, “the material gains of the marital partnership” (<span class="font-italic">UZN</span> ([13] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [59]. There is some amount of interaction between the two matters: the backward-looking decision on division may affect the forward-looking decision on maintenance where the court decides that what is given to the wife as part of division is sufficient for her financial preservation going forward. That makes sense, since if the goal is financial preservation, the court should consider what needs to be done to ensure that goal is met, and if financial preservation is met by the result of the division, there is no need for a further order to be made. This logic, however, does not apply the other way. The fact that the parties have agreed on a sum for financial preservation does not affect the determination of what share of the fruits of the marriage the wife should be entitled to. The sum received as part of an agreed maintenance does not satisfy the requirement that the matrimonial assets that <span class="font-italic">have</span> been accumulated should be divided in a just and equitable manner. Money received in division may be relevant to maintenance because the latter is concerned only with the financial position of the wife after the divorce, but money received in maintenance is not the same as a divided pool of matrimonial assets since the emphasis in the division exercise is a determination of a just and equitable share of what has been gained through the economic union of marriage. This is so even though a lump sum maintenance payment may be agreed between parties, because that payment is, in principle, a question of financial preservation going forward. Further, the agreed maintenance was to be paid <span class="font-italic">after </span>the IJ date, that is, after the point at which the pool of matrimonial assets was to be determined. Therefore, I choose not to account for the agreed sum of S$1.05m payable as maintenance to the Wife in this division of matrimonial assets.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">170  I do not see any reason to adjust the relative weight between the direct and indirect contributions in this case. Neither party submitted for such an adjustment either.

</div> Even including the period of separation, this was a marriage of around 16 years, which is of moderate length. It cannot be said that the Wife has raised the Child to adulthood.

Of these, the Husband and Wife are entitled to S$1,020,274.00 and S$625,329.22 respectively (being 62% and 38% respectively of the value of the remaining assets). I deduct the sums that are treated as advances from the Wife’s and Husband’s shares. Those sums are S$18,984.60 (see [46] above), S$22,000.00 (see [53] above), and S$125,988.85 (see [103] above) for the Wife, and S$75,995.35 (see [103] above) for the Husband. This leaves the Husband’s and Wife’s entitlements as S$944,278.65 (being S$1,020,274.00 − S$75,995.35) and S$458,355.77 (being S$625,329.22 − S$18,984.60 − S$22,000.00 − S$125,988.85) respectively. I also deduct those sums from their respective assets to gain an accurate picture of what assets are available for apportionment.
