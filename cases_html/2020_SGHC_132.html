The Property was owned solely by Devi d/o N Gurusamy (the “deceased”) until her unfortunate and sudden death on 17 October 2017. The deceased is survived by six children (the “Siblings”), including the plaintiff and the defendant. The deceased had passed away intestate as she did not have a will. The assets belonging to the deceased’s estate were distributed in equal shares to her beneficiaries, save for the Property that is in dispute. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The plaintiff seeks for the Property to be transferred to her sole name or, in the alternative, for the value of the Property as the deceased had represented to her that the plaintiff was to inherit the Property upon her demise (the “representation”). The defendant, on the other hand, argues that the Property should be sold and the proceeds of sale be distributed equally to the beneficiaries of the deceased’s estate, including the plaintiff, as that was what the deceased had wanted. The defendant further asserts that there is no will and, thus, the Property has to be distributed in accordance with the Intestate Succession Act (Cap 146, 2013 Rev Ed) (the “ISA”). The defendant was granted letters of administration and she is the administrator of the deceased’s estate. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">My decision</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The issues</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 These are the issues for my consideration:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Has the plaintiff pleaded proprietary estoppel?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Can proprietary estoppel override the ISA?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Can the representation, assuming it is true, constitute a valid representation under the principle of proprietary estoppel? </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Did the deceased make the representation to the plaintiff?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Can the court accept the testimonies of the plaintiff’s three witnesses? </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) Did the plaintiff rely on the representation and act to her detriment?</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Has the plaintiff pleaded proprietary estoppel?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 I note at the outset that the defendant raises an objection that the plaintiff “did not plead the remedy of estoppel in her Statement of Claim or Reply”,

In <span class="font-italic">Chng</span><span class="font-italic"> Bee Kheng v Chng Eng Chye </span>[2013] 2 SLR 715, Chan Seng Onn J said at [94] as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Even though Mr Yeo did not object to this defect in pleading and proceeded to submit on the basis that the Defendant’s case was founded on estoppel by representation, promissory estoppel, proprietary estoppel and estoppel by convention, I am of the view that the Defendant has to plead his case accurately. The different types of estoppel may have similar undertones, but, as will be seen below, their constituent elements are dissimilar, and the facts relevant to the elements would accordingly differ and must be pleaded specifically. For instance, while Mr Bull argued that there was promissory estoppel, he described the alleged ‘promises’ as ‘representations’. There is a distinction between the two as a representation refers to a representation of fact and is not promissory in nature.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">44 Accordingly, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">proprietary estoppel should be pleaded expressly and the facts relevant to each element should be pleaded specifically</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> However, she has failed to expressly plead estoppel in her SOC, much less proprietary estoppel. It is unsatisfactory that in the course of the proceedings the plaintiff’s counsel was alerted that the SOC did not expressly plead proprietary estoppel and yet, he chose not to amend the SOC as he submitted that the SOC had pleaded proprietary estoppel. The defendant’s Defence (Amendment No 2) rebutted the SOC on a factual basis and did not address the proprietary estoppel as it was not apparent to the defendant that the plaintiff was pursuing her claim based on proprietary estoppel. With respect, I disagree with the plaintiff’s counsel as the SOC did not expressly state that the plaintiff was pursuing her claim based on proprietary estoppel and not an oral will. Thus, the defendant was prejudiced. Therefore, the plaintiff should not be allowed to pursue her claim based on proprietary estoppel. As proprietary estoppel is the central and only plank of the plaintiff’s claim and an oral will is unenforceable, this Suit is dismissed on this ground alone. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 Nevertheless, on the assumption that the SOC discloses proprietary estoppel, I shall deal with the relevant issues. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Can proprietary estoppel override the ISA? </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8  It is not disputed that the deceased left no will and, therefore, the deceased’s estate, including the Property, will have to be distributed in accordance with the ISA. Section 7 Rule 3 of the ISA reads:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Subject to the rights of the surviving spouse, if any, the estate (both as to the undistributed portion and the reversionary interest) of an intestate who leaves issue shall be distributed by equal portions per stirpes to and amongst the children of the person dying intestate and such persons as legally represent those children, in case any of those children be then dead.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 Hence, the Property will have to be distributed equally amongst the beneficiaries of the deceased, including the plaintiff and the defendant, and for those two children who had died their shares will be given to their respective estates.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 The plaintiff claims that the deceased told her orally that she would give her the Property upon her demise. This may suggest that an oral will was made. However, the Wills Act (Cap 352, 1996 Rev Ed) (the “Wills Act”) clearly sets out the formalities required for a will to be valid. Generally, reference can be had to s 6 of the Wills Act, which provides:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">6.</span>—(1) No will shall be valid unless it is in writing and executed in the manner mentioned in subsection (2).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2)  Every will shall be signed at the foot or end thereof by the testator, or by some other person in his presence and by his direction, and the signature shall be made or acknowledged by the testator as the signature to his will or codicil in the presence of two or more witnesses present at the same time, and those witnesses shall subscribe the will in the presence of the testator, but no form of attestation shall be necessary.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 Thus, the oral will is invalid and not recognised under the law. In the present circumstances, the absence of a will would result in the Property being distributed in accordance with the ISA. As stated by Lee Seiu Kin J in <span class="font-italic">Tan </span><span class="font-italic">Pwee Eng v Tan Pwee Hwa </span>[2011] 1 SLR 113 at [15]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The formalities required of a valid will are clearly set out in the Wills Act. If those formalities are not met, and unless the testator falls within any statutory exception, the will is not valid. … There may well be circumstances in which the requirements of the Wills Act prevent the disposal of the estate of a deceased person in accordance with his or her last wishes. However the problem lies in ascertaining what exactly are those last wishes and the legislature has taken the position that obtains in the Wills Act. This policy has been in force for a very long time, the primary objective of which is to guard against fraud. In so far as this may be said to operate harshly at times, I would state that any such possibility may, to some extent, be ameliorated by the Intestate Succession Act (Cap 146, 1985 Rev Ed) which provides for distribution to the children or other relatives of a person who dies intestate as a result of the invalidity of his will.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 This is the legal position and would have been the end of the matter. Cognizant of this, the plaintiff seeks to circumvent the application of the ISA by creatively arguing that she is entitled to the Property, or its value, based on proprietary estoppel. In this respect, the starting point is that the ISA does not expressly or impliedly state it is subject to proprietary estoppel. As such, proprietary estoppel cannot override the ISA, for as stated by Tan Lee Meng J in <span class="font-italic">Joshua Steven v Joshua Deborah Steven and others </span>[2004] 4 SLR(R) 403 at [15]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…  it is trite that a party cannot rely on estoppel in defiance of a statute. In <span class="font-italic">Kok</span><span class="font-italic"> Hoong v Leong Cheong Kweng Mines, Ltd </span>[1964] 1 All ER 300 at 305, Viscount Radcliffe explained that there are:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… rules that preclude a court from allowing an estoppel, if to do so would be to act in the face of a statute and to give recognition through the admission of one of the parties to a state of affairs which the law has positively declared not to subsist.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 In the circumstances, the proprietary estoppel, which is a common law equitable remedy, cannot override the ISA, which is the applicable law in Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 However, a claim founded on proprietary estoppel can be a legitimate course of action against the estate of the deceased independent of the ISA provided the facts can support it and it is not inconsistent with the ISA. For instance, if the claimant’s equitable interest pursuant to the proprietary estoppel is crystallised into a judgment debt against the deceased’s estate (see <span class="font-italic">Low Heng Leon Andy v Low Kian Beng Lawrence (administrator of the estate of Tan Ah </span><span class="font-italic">Kng, deceased) </span>[2013] 3 SLR 710 at [40]–[44]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Can the representation, assuming it is true, constitute a valid representation under the principle of proprietary estoppel?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 The plaintiff alleges that the deceased told her that the Property was to be given to her upon her demise. However, in this case, the representation that the deceased would want the plaintiff to inherit her Property was not intended to be acted upon, as the facts, even if proven, disclose a representation akin to an oral will that did not require the plaintiff to act on it to her detriment, as opposed to a representation to be acted upon to the detriment of the representee under proprietary estoppel. In my view, this oral will cannot be a representation envisaged under the principle of proprietary estoppel. The facts of this case, therefore, are distinguishable from the cases cited by the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 In <span class="font-italic">Thorner</span><span class="font-italic"> v Major and others</span> [2009] 1 WLR 776, the House of Lords (the “HL”) found that the appellant, David Thorner (“David”), did substantial work on the farm of his father’s cousin, Peter Thorner (“Peter”). Peter assured David that he would inherit the farm and David acted in reliance on this assurance. Peter died intestate. The HL found that there was proprietary estoppel and allowed David to keep the farm. In <span class="font-italic">Habberfield v Habberfield</span> [2018] EWHC 317 (Ch), the English High Court found that the constituents of proprietary estoppel had been proven. Thus, the court overrode the will of the father who bequeathed the family farm to his wife. Similarly, in <span class="font-italic">Culliford</span><span class="font-italic"> v Thorpe</span> [2018] EWHC 426 (Ch), the English High Court also found that proprietary estoppel was made out and granted the property to the cohabiter when the representor died intestate. In all these English cases, the representations or promises were intended to be acted upon and the respective recipients in these cases did act on the representations to their detriment, which attracted the intervention of equity for a fair and just outcome.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 On the ground that the representation as alleged by the plaintiff, if proven, is not a representation to be acted upon under proprietary estoppel, the plaintiff’s claim must be dismissed. Nevertheless, I turn to analyse whether the facts disclose proprietary estoppel. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The law on proprietary estoppel</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 In order to establish a claim based on proprietary estoppel, three elements must be fulfilled, namely: (a) a representation or an assurance was made that a claimant would have an interest in the property; (b) the claimant relied on the representation; and (c) as a result, the claimant suffered a detriment (see <span class="font-italic">Geok</span><span class="font-italic"> Hong Co Pte Ltd v Koh Ai Gek and others </span>[2019] 1 SLR 908 at [94]). This has been well summarised in the following observations of Sundaresh Menon JC (as he then was) in <span class="font-italic">Hong Leong Singapore Finance Ltd v United Overseas Bank Ltd </span>[2007] 1 SLR(R) 292 at [170]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Proprietary estoppel – the law</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">170 It is settled law that to successfully found an estoppel, three elements must be shown. These are a representation on the part of the party against whom the estoppel is sought to be raised, and reliance and detriment on the part of the party seeking to raise the estoppel. In relation to an estoppel concerning land, Prof Tan Sook Yee in <span class="font-italic">Principles of Singapore Land Law </span>(Butterworths Asia, 2nd Ed, 2001) … succinctly summarises the position thus at pp 97–98.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The principle of proprietary estoppel may be summed up as follows: where an owner of land permits the claimant to have, or encourages him in his belief that he has, some right or interest in the land, and the claimant acts on this belief to his detriment then the owner of the land cannot insist on his strict legal rights if that would be inconsistent with the claimant’s belief. The claimant may have an equity based on estoppel. The connection with constructive trusts imposed to prevent fraud or unconscionable dealings is evident, as both doctrines deal with unconscionable behaviour. But although the source is unconscionable behaviour and the requirements seem almost the same, there are differences. For a start, the constructive trust in this context is based either on an intention to create a trust, but the formalities are not complied with, or on a common intention that the other party is to have an interest in the property, which is acted upon to the detriment of the alleged beneficiary. In either case there is an intention that the other party is to have an equitable interest in the land. In proprietary estoppel, the main emphasis is that the landowner has to have acted in an unconscionable manner taking the entire set of circumstances into account. There is no clear intention that the other party is to have an equitable interest in the land. The other important difference lies in the remedies. In a constructive trust the beneficiary claims, and if his claim is successful, he has an equitable interest in the property. While in a case where proprietary estoppel has been successful the relief is at the discretion of the court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 I shall deal with each of these elements in turn.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Did the deceased make the representation to the plaintiff?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 The plaintiff asserts that, over the years, the deceased had frequently “represented to and assured” her that the Property would pass to the plaintiff upon the deceased’s death.

</div> According to her, the deceased had made such representations to assure the plaintiff that she could live in the Property. This was because the plaintiff had to sell her own flat (the “Tampines flat”) in 2006 to pay for her late husband’s medical treatment as he was suffering from cancer and had to undergo bone marrow transplant. Further, the deceased had also objected to the plaintiff’s family renting a separate flat because she “always intended to leave the Property to the [plaintiff] and her family.”

Kalaichelvi testified that in June, July and August 2017, the deceased had told her that the Property would be passed to the plaintiff. This was because the plaintiff was the only sibling without her own house.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Lastly, Saangeetha Martin Rubin (“Saangeetha”), the deceased’s granddaughter and the defendant’s daughter. Saangeetha testified that the deceased had told her in October 2017 that the Property had already been “written under” the plaintiff. In Saangeetha’s view, this was to be understood as an indication that the Property would pass to the plaintiff upon the deceased’s death.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 In contrast, the defendant argues that the deceased had made clear that the Property was to be shared equally amongst the Siblings. According to her, she had previously suggested to the deceased that the Property should be given to the plaintiff. The deceased, however, disagreed as she wanted the Property to be shared equally amongst the Siblings and for the plaintiff to purchase her own flat.

The only person who can verify the truth is the deceased herself. Unfortunately, this is not possible. Nevertheless, the court has a duty to decide who is telling the truth. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 The burden is on the plaintiff to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that the deceased told her that the Property will be given to her upon the deceased’s demise. Thus, for this <span class="font-italic">ex tempor</span><span class="font-italic">e</span> judgment I shall focus on the plaintiff’s evidence. The plaintiff’s case is purely based on oral evidence as there is no documentary evidence to substantiate her claim. Before I comment on the plaintiff’s three witnesses who testified to support her claim that the deceased told them that she wanted to give the Property to the plaintiff, I shall first examine the independent and objective circumstantial evidence that will reveal where the truth lies. I find that the circumstantial evidence, which is significantly cogent, rebuts the plaintiff’s case and corroborates the defendant’s claim that the deceased wanted the Property to be shared equally amongst all her children for a number of reasons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Firstly, it is undisputed that on or about 3 April 2013, approximately one month after the demise of the plaintiff’s husband, the deceased had gone to the HDB Bedok Branch Office (the “HDB Office”) to include the plaintiff as an occupier of the Property. The status of the plaintiff as a mere occupier remained unchanged, up until the deceased’s death. This piece of evidence is vital and discredits the plaintiff’s claim that the deceased wanted to give her the Property. It is highly significant that the deceased had added the plaintiff only as an <span class="font-italic">occupier</span> and not a <span class="font-italic">co-owner</span>. If the deceased had intended all along for the plaintiff to inherit the Property she would not have informed the HDB that the plaintiff was an occupier. Instead she would have stated that the plaintiff was a co-owner. But this was not the case here.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The plaintiff asserts that the deceased had “mistakenly believed that she had added the [plaintiff] as co-owner of the Property, and that this was her true intention in visiting the [HDB Office].”

</div> The plaintiff, however, produced no iota of evidence to support this bare assertion which remains speculative and a conjecture and, therefore, is inadmissible and should not be given any weight. She could not provide personal evidence as she was not present during the deceased’s visit to the HDB Office. She also failed to call as witness any HDB officer who attended to the deceased during this visit. I have to accept the evidence at face value that the HDB recorded the deceased’s intention correctly, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the plaintiff was an occupier in the eyes of the deceased and not a co-owner. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Secondly, the plaintiff testified that she intends to purchase the Property at a reasonable price five years after the deceased’s death, as she needs the time to raise funds, and by then her teenage sons would have grown up. She said that the proceeds of the sale could then be distributed equally amongst the Siblings. She maintains this position till today in court. This is wholly inconsistent with her claim in this Suit. If she, indeed, believes that she inherited the Property solely from the deceased, there is no need for her to share the proceeds of the sale of the Property equally amongst her siblings unless she believes that her claim that the deceased wanted her to have the Property is not true. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Thirdly, prior to the commencement of this Suit, the plaintiff had approached the Community Justice Centre on 4 January 2018 to apply for a Primary Justice Project (“PJP”) lawyer to advise her in relation to the Property. Mr Jeyaraj Indra Raj of Harold Seet &amp; Indra Raj was assigned to act for her. In the case notes of the PJP Registration Form, it was stated that: “[siblings] want [Property] to be sold 1 to 2 yrs’ [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] time but [plaintiff] wants to sell now as, if sister is administrator she has right to order [plaintiff] to pay rent.”

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 This indicates that her concern at that time was that she could be forced to pay rent if the Property was not sold immediately. However, this is fundamentally at odds with her claim in this Suit, for if she was solely entitled to the Property there would be no reason for her to even have to pay rent. Moreover, it is worth noting that even though her position on 4 January 2018 is starkly different from her position in court, as stated at [28] above, what is consistent is her insistence on purchasing or selling the Property with no mention that it belongs to her. In court, the plaintiff tried to explain her inconsistency by claiming that she did not read what was written in the PJP Registration Form and was not aware of the inaccuracy. If she truly inherited the Property as she claimed that the deceased wanted her to have it, then the Property is hers and she can decide when to sell it or whether to stay in the Property and she need not have to share the sale proceeds with her siblings unless she so chooses.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Lastly, the plaintiff’s instructions to her various lawyers as expressed in her letters demonstrate that she did not believe that she had inherited the Property solely. Following the deceased’s death, the following events occurred:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The plaintiff instructed Mr Jeyaraj Indra Raj to send a letter dated 31 January 2018 (the “HSIR letter”) to the defendant’s lawyers indicating that she too intended to be one of the administrators of the estate. At that date, the defendant had filed an application for the grant of letters of administration, for the sole purpose of selling the Property and to distribute the proceeds to the beneficiaries of the estate.

The implication is that the plaintiff did not mention to her previous solicitors that she inherited the Property as claimed. Instead, the PJP process, the HSIR letter, the Carson Law letter and the August Law letter reveal that she only wanted to become an administrator of the estate, so that she could control the process and prevent the defendant from ordering her to pay rent. If she has indeed the sole inheritance of the Property she could decide what she wanted to do with the Property freely and would have instructed her solicitors to stake her claim to the Property.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 For the above reasons, the plaintiff’s assertions that the deceased had told her that the Property would be given to her upon the deceased’s demise cannot be believed. Furthermore, the plaintiff also relied on hearsay evidence to substantiate her claim.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> Padmalatchi was not called as a witness. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 I shall now explain why I was not convinced by the oral testimonies of the plaintiff’s three witnesses, namely, Selvarajoo, Kalaichelvi and Saangeetha, who claimed that the deceased told them separately that the Property would be given to the plaintiff upon her demise.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Can the court accept the testimonies of the plaintiff’s three witnesses? </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 The plaintiff’s and the defendant’s witnesses made bare assertions without any supporting or documentary evidence to advance the claims of the respective parties. Coincidentally, when the deceased purportedly told them separately that she wanted the Property to be given to the plaintiff after her demise, no person witnessed it. Furthermore, they did not inform the plaintiff immediately or soon after. These revelations only came about around or after the time of the demise of the deceased. Therefore, the court has to exercise caution when reviewing their testimonies. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Selvarajoo did not want the Property to be sold as he believed in keeping it in remembrance of his parents’ legacy. For that he was prepared to forgo his share of the Property to the plaintiff who seemed to want to retain it. He was also grateful to the plaintiff who allowed him and his family to stay at her Tampines flat before it was sold.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 I notice that all the three witnesses were the plaintiff’s sympathisers as they realised that the plaintiff was the only sibling who did not have her own flat, and so they were prepared to support the plaintiff’s claim. However, from the evidential perspective I have explained why the plaintiff’s claim cannot be believed. It is, therefore, unwise to accept the testimonies of the plaintiff’s witnesses, who are not close to the deceased, without independent corroborative evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Selvarajoo lives in Batam and does not come to Singapore often. Hence, he admitted that he did not visit the deceased often when she was alive. Thus, he was not close to the deceased yet he claimed that the deceased told him in 2015 that she wanted to give the Property to the plaintiff upon her demise. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Selvarajoo’s wife, Kalaichelvi, may have claimed that she visited the deceased more often than Selvarajoo but there is no corroborative evidence that she was close to the deceased, her mother-in-law. Kalaichelvi alleged that in June, July and August 2017, the year the deceased died, the deceased told her that she wanted to give the Property to the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Saangeetha, the granddaughter of the deceased, who was not on good terms with her mother, the defendant, made a vague claim that the deceased told her that if she was to pass away the Property had already been “written under” to the plaintiff. This cannot be true as I have explained above that the deceased informed the HDB that the plaintiff was an occupier and not a co-owner of the Property. Furthermore, Saangeetha claimed that the deceased coincidentally told her this on 15 October 2017, two days before she died.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 It appears strange that the three witnesses, who alleged that the deceased told them separately that she wanted the plaintiff to have the Property, did not inform the plaintiff of this earlier. Selvarajoo only informed the plaintiff when the deceased was admitted to the hospital in 2017, a short time before the deceased’s demise. Kalaichelvi and Saangeetha came forward only when the plaintiff sought a claim on the Property after the demise of the deceased. Hence, the plaintiff could not have acted on what the deceased had told these witnesses before her demise.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 It seems that the deceased was closest to the defendant. The defendant had even at one time suggested to the deceased that the Property should be given to the plaintiff as she did not have a flat of her own, but the deceased insisted that the Property be shared equally amongst the Siblings. I am more inclined to accept the defendant’s version of the events. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43  Accordingly, I find that the plaintiff fails, on a balance of probabilities, to establish that there was a representation made by the deceased. Even if there was such a representation, the representation is akin to an oral will that does not require the plaintiff to act on it to her detriment (see [17] above). Therefore, her claim based on proprietary estoppel fails.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Did the plaintiff rely on the representation and act to her detriment?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 In any event, even if there was a valid representation made by the deceased, I find that the plaintiff is unable to satisfy the other requirements for proprietary estoppel.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The plaintiff had not placed any reliance on the alleged representation. According to the plaintiff, she had consistently provided the deceased with a monthly sum of $200.00 to $600.00, which the deceased used for her household expenses. There is, however, no evidence to support such a claim. In my view, the deceased was self-sufficient as she had a steady income working as a cleaner, she received contributions from her children, she had Central Provident Fund monies and her own savings. In any case, even if the plaintiff had contributed, she was fulfilling her role as a filial daughter in taking care of the deceased.

</div>
</div>
</div> It should be noted that the Siblings had all collectively contributed to taking care of the deceased as her filial children. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The plaintiff also further claims that she had given the deceased a cash gift of $10,000.00 from the sale proceeds of her Tampines flat, as well as a sum of $20,000.00 at the same time. In relation to the $10,000.00, there is no documentary evidence to support the plaintiff’s claim. Indeed, beyond the plaintiff’s bare assertions, there is nothing to show that such a gift had been made. In relation to the $20,000.00, the plaintiff adduced the deceased’s bank book, which contained an entry that the deceased had, indeed, received $20,000.00 on 13 June 2006. However, there are no bank records, or any other evidence to show that this sum of $20,000.00 was received from the plaintiff. Even if these two sums were given to the deceased, the plaintiff gave to the deceased because the latter was her mother and the monies were given out of love and affection and not because the deceased promised to give her the Property upon her demise. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Moreover, the plaintiff and her family had also been staying in the Property from 1998 to 2006 even though they had their own flat, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Tampines flat, which was rented out from time to time.

</div> The plaintiff continued staying in the Property after her Tampines flat was sold to pay for her late husband’s medical expenses. The plaintiff received about $166,000.00 from the sale of her Tampines flat. She used the proceeds to pay for her late husband’s medical expenses, credit card bills, <span class="font-italic">etc</span>. She admitted that with the balance of the sale proceeds she could not afford to buy another flat. She continued to stay with the deceased who also helped her to look after her two young children when she went out to work as a private tutor. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The plaintiff had also suffered no detriment as a result of any alleged representation made by the deceased. She cannot argue that she had suffered as a result of paying for household appliances (such as the refrigerator and the rented air purifier), minor improvement works (such as the changing of the louvre windows and front grille gate) and contributions to household expenses. These had all been as much for the plaintiff and her family as they were for the deceased. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Further, the plaintiff and her family had lived rent-free in the Property.

</div>
</div> This also allowed her to rent out the Tampines flat that she co-owned with her late husband from 1998 to 2006. The savings therein combined with the additional income earned would have significantly outweighed any expenses that she had incurred.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Summary of findings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 In summary, the plaintiff has failed to expressly plead proprietary estoppel in her SOC and this has prejudiced the defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The deceased had passed away intestate as she did not have a will. Thus, the ISA governs the distribution of the assets belonging to the deceased’s estate. The proprietary estoppel, which is a common law equitable remedy, cannot override the ISA, as it is the law of the land. The cases cited by the plaintiff do not apply here. This is because the representation in this case is akin to an oral will as it did not require the plaintiff to act on it. Hence, the representation in this instant case does not meet the requirement of proprietary estoppel in which the representation or promise, if proven, requires the representee, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the recipient of the representation or promise, to act and rely on it to her detriment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 In any case, none of the elements of proprietary estoppel are established. Firstly, on the evidence I am not satisfied that the plaintiff had proven her case, on a balance or probabilities, that there was a representation by the deceased that the Property would pass to her upon the deceased’s demise. The independent and circumstantial evidence stands cogently and substantially against the existence of such a representation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 The deceased had specifically listed the plaintiff as an occupier and not a co-owner of the Property to the HDB. The plaintiff had never mentioned that she was entitled to the Property before and soon after the demise of the deceased. She also did not inform her lawyers to claim the Property as an inheritance from the deceased until the commencement of this Suit. The plaintiff maintains that she intends to purchase the Property in five years’ time and attempts to avoid paying rent for living in the Property. These are not actions consistent with one who believes she has a right over the Property. Furthermore, I find the evidence of the plaintiff’s three witnesses unreliable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Secondly, assuming there was a representation as alleged, the plaintiff had never relied on it. The purported giving of monies to the deceased after the sale of her Tampines flat was not done in reliance of the representation. Even if she had made contributions to the deceased, these were done to fulfil her filial duties to the deceased. In fact, the plaintiff should be grateful to the deceased for allowing her and her family to reside in the Property rent-free and for helping to look after her family especially after the death of the plaintiff’s husband in 2013. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Lastly, the plaintiff did not suffer any detriment. The purchases that she made for the household were as much for her and her family’s own use as they were for the deceased. She had in fact benefitted from living rent-free in the Property for a very long period.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 This is an unfortunate family squabble that should have been resolved amicably. The Siblings could have saved substantial legal costs instead of taking the dispute to court over an asset that is less than $300,000 in value. It appears that the plaintiff wanted to buy over the Property but she does not have the financial means to do so now. She believes that a period of five years after the demise of the deceased she would be able to purchase it at a reasonable price and her sons would have started working. The defendant and the other siblings are not confident that she is able to keep to her promise because of her financial situation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 I have found that her allegations that the deceased wanted to give the Property to her after her demise cannot be established. Thus, it appears that this Suit was commenced to buy time for the plaintiff and to frustrate the defendant’s role as the administrator of the deceased’s estate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58  For the above reasons, I dismiss the plaintiff’s case. I find that, on a balance of probabilities, the plaintiff has not established her case. If there is a need, I shall supplement my grounds of decision. I order costs against the plaintiff, to be agreed or taxed.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Tan Siong Thye<br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Tan Wen Cheng Adrian and Low Zhi Yu Janus (August Law Corporation) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">K Mathialahan (Guna &amp; Associates) for the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
