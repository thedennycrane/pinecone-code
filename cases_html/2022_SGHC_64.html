In response, counsel for MMI argued that there was no legal basis for that submission because item 4 of the Letter of Intent (see [8] above), which dealt with the Proposed Investment and provided for the amounts owing by IEL to be set off against any investment sum paid, had been expressly described as not legally binding.  Further, it was Mr Ghai (rather than IEL) that had been a party to the Letter of Intent.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 At the conclusion of the 14 Jul Hearing, I considered that IEL had not satisfied the court that there had been even a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>dispute over its liability for the Outstanding Sum.  In connection with the first dispute over the amount repayable, counsel for IEL accepted that IEL’s affidavit offered no particulars of the alleged cross-claim and whether it exceeded the Outstanding Sum.  As for the second dispute over the enforceability of the Loan Facility, counsel for IEL also could not articulate the legal basis for challenging the enforceability of the Loan Facility.  As for the third dispute over whether consideration had been provided by MMI in respect of US$750,000 under the Loan Facility, I did not consider that to be any dispute at all.  Clause 2 of the Loan Facility made it clear that the sum of US$750,000 was deemed repaid to MMT and reborrowed by IEL from MMI under the Loan Facility.  MMI would have provided consideration by its extension of a further sum of US$860,000 to IEL.  Thus, I considered that there were no grounds for dismissing and/or staying CWU 81 in favour of arbitration. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 Given IEL’s failure to make any payment, or secure or compound the Outstanding Sum under the SD within three weeks of its service, it was deemed unable to pay its debts within the meaning of s 125(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) of the IRDA pursuant to the presumption of insolvency in s 125(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>).

</div>  Second, MMI argued that IEL had expressed its willingness to make repayment under the Loan Facility on two occasions before 9 May 2021.  As such, it was claimed that IEL had recognised amounts due under the Loan Facility as being repayable even before the expiry of the Exclusivity Period; IEL’s argument about the implied agreement or implied term had been contrived to delay the repayment of a clear and admitted debt.

This far exceeded the statutorily-prescribed minimum, and in respect of which IEL had made no repayment to date.  IEL was therefore making no more than a technical objection concerning the timing of the SD, and this did not constitute a dispute that would justify a dismissal or stay of CWU 81.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issues </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 There were essentially two broad issues for my determination: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, whether SUM 3994, which sought an extension of time for IEL’s request for new further arguments, should be allowed?  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, whether the further arguments made by IEL disclosed any basis for the court to stay or dismiss CWU 81? </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 1: SUM 3994 </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 I allowed SUM 3994 and granted IEL an extension of time to make its new further arguments.  In preparing these grounds, I noted that the Court of Appeal has dismissed MMI’s application in CA/OS 28/2021 for leave to appeal against my decision on SUM 3994.  As such, I will only briefly explain my reasons for allowing SUM 3994. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 First, I did not accept MMI’s submission that IEL had acted in abuse of process by attempting to make further arguments which were not the same as those that had been set out in the 19 Jul Letter.  The concept of abuse of process is one where the court addresses proceedings which constitute an “improper use of its machinery” and if the proceedings are such, the court in the exercise of its inherent jurisdiction will disallow their continuance without hesitation (see <span class="font-italic">JTrust</span><span class="font-italic"> Asia Pte Ltd v Group Lease Holdings Pte Ltd and others </span>[2018] 2 SLR 159 at [99]).  To make good its argument on abuse of process, MMI must show that IEL had sought the extension of time for a purpose other than to advance legitimate arguments as to why the winding-up order should not have been made, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, if the extension of time had been sought by IEL solely for the purpose of allowing IEL to transfer away some assets to hinder the winding-up process.  However, there was no evidence that this was the reason IEL had sought the extension of time.  The fact that IEL had changed its position by seeking to make new further arguments which are not the same as those outlined in the 19 Jul Letter was not <span class="font-italic">per se </span>evidence of an abuse of process.  IEL has explained that the change in position was because of the change of solicitors and different legal advice being obtained.  This was not challenged by MMI as being untrue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Second, I considered that there was nothing wrong in principle for IEL to seek to make new further arguments which were not consistent with those outlined in the 19 Jul Letter.  There is nothing in s 29B(2) of the SCJA which constrains the scope of the further arguments that can be made to those which had been outlined in the initial request for further arguments.  As a matter of principle, there should also be no limitation on the types of further arguments which an applicant may make, provided that they are relevant and may have a bearing on the court’s decision.  The process of hearing further arguments is meant to give the court an opportunity to review its decision whenever it is open to the possibility of changing its mind (see <span class="font-italic">ARW v Comptroller of Income Tax and another and another appeal </span>[2019] 1 SLR 499 (“<span class="font-italic">ARW</span>”) at [59]; <span class="font-italic">Aberdeen Asset Management</span><span class="font-italic"> Asia Ltd and another v Fraser &amp; Neave Ltd and others </span>[2001] 3 SLR(R) 355 at [23]).  Imposing any limitation on the further arguments which the applicant may make is inconsistent with the rationale underlying the process for further arguments.  Instead, <span class="font-italic">any </span>argument that has a bearing on the judge’s decision should in principle be something which can be considered by the judge.  Ultimately, it is for the court to decide on the merits of those further arguments, and it should not matter that they are presented in the alternative, or even appear contradictory or inconsistent with other arguments raised.  If there are no merits to the arguments, they will be dismissed after due consideration. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Third, I considered that IEL should be permitted to adduce further evidence in support of its new further arguments.  In <span class="font-italic">ARW</span>, the Court of Appeal held that further evidence may be allowed in support of new<span class="font-italic"> </span>arguments, but should not be allowed where the evidence is sought to support or strengthen previously raised arguments (at [87]).  The court explained that the concern in the latter situation is that allowing new evidence in further arguments would permit litigants, after learning of the judge’s grounds of decision, to plug the gaps in the evidence that were identified by the judge, and that would constitute an abuse of process (at [87]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 I accepted that the new further arguments which IEL wanted to advance had been peripherally raised at the 14 Jul Hearing.  So, strictly speaking, they were not entirely new arguments.  In respect of the first argument about the implied agreement and/or implied term, IEL’s then-solicitors had, at the 14 Jul Hearing, merely stated that there were “negotiations” at the time the SD was served and there was an agreement that MMI would “hold on” from recalling the Loan Facility (see [16] above).  As for the second argument about the cross-claim, that had been raised by IEL as a ground for disputing the amount repayable under the Loan Facility, but without any details at all (see [15(a)] above).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 At the 14 Jul Hearing, I found both of these arguments to be entirely unsubstantiated and amounted to nothing more than bare assertions by IEL.  As such, they were not considered at any length by the court for the purposes of the 14 Jul Hearing.  In the further arguments which IEL wanted to make, IEL and its new counsel put far more thought, substance and details into what IEL had intended to convey by those points.  In these circumstances, I did not think that allowing further evidence on both of these arguments would have the effect of allowing IEL to plug earlier gaps in evidence that were identified by the court.  This was because there had simply been no<span class="font-italic"> </span>evidence put before the court about those arguments in the first place, and the court had also not given any grounds for dismissing those arguments.  I thus found that the rationale underlying the rule disallowing the admission of further evidence to support previously raised arguments was not engaged.  I therefore rejected MMI’s submission that IEL be disallowed to adduce fresh evidence in support of its new further arguments. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Finally, I also rejected MMI’s argument that an extension of time would operate to the prejudice of MMI and other creditors as it would allow IEL and/or Mr Ghai to use the time to dissipate IEL’s assets and sell fuel owned by KML.  This assertion was entirely unsubstantiated and there was no evidence of any attempt to dissipate assets by IEL.  Further, there was no evidence in these proceedings that IEL had any other creditors besides MMI.  An extension of time being granted to IEL to make its further arguments therefore only affected the position as between MMI and IEL <span class="font-italic">inter se</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 2: Whether the further arguments made by IEL disclosed any basis to stay or dismiss CWU 81?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 A debtor-company which seeks to obtain a stay or dismissal of a winding-up application need only raise triable issues (<span class="font-italic">AnAn</span><span class="font-italic"> Group (Singapore) Pte Ltd v VTB Bank (Public Joint Stock Co)</span> [2020] 1 SLR 1158 (“<span class="font-italic">AnAn</span><span class="font-italic"> Group</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [25]; <span class="font-italic">Pacific Recreation Pte Ltd v S Y Technology Inc and another appeal </span>[2008] 2 SLR(R) 491 (“<span class="font-italic">Pacific Recreation</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [23]).  To do so, the debtor must show that there exists a substantial and <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> dispute, whether in relation to a dispute over the debt claimed, or where the debt is undisputed, in relation to a cross-claim for an amount equal to or exceeding the undisputed debt (<span class="font-italic">AnAn</span><span class="font-italic"> Group </span>at [25]; <span class="font-italic">Pacific Recreation </span>at [25]).  A substantial and <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>dispute is one where the debtor’s reasons for not paying the debt are honestly believed to exist and based on reasonable grounds, which are not frivolous; there must be so much doubt and question about the liability to pay the claimed debt that the court sees that there is a question to be decided (<span class="font-italic">LKM Investment Holdings Pte Ltd v Cathay Theatres Pte Ltd </span>[2000] 1 SLR(R) 135 (“<span class="font-italic">LKM Investment</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [20]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 On the other hand, where there is an arbitration agreement between the parties, it suffices for the debtor to show a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>dispute or cross-claim which falls within the scope of that agreement.  However, if the court finds that the dispute is being raised by the debtor in abuse of process, it will nevertheless refuse to stay or dismiss the winding-up application (see <span class="font-italic">AnAn</span><span class="font-italic"> Group </span>at [94]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 The key distinction between the triable issue standard and the <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>standard of review is whether the court looks into the genuineness or merits of the defences put forth by the debtor-company.  Where the triable issue standard applies, the court must thoroughly examine the evidence and critically consider the merits of those defences to determine if they are frivolous (see <span class="font-italic">AnAn</span><span class="font-italic"> Group </span>at [76]-[77]).  On the other hand, where the <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>standard of review applies, the debtor need only assert a defence which gives rise to a dispute falling within the scope of the parties’ arbitration agreement and the court does not inquire into the merits of that defence (see <span class="font-italic">Tjong</span><span class="font-italic"> Very Sumito and others v Antig Investments Pte Ltd </span>[2009] 4 SLR(R) 732 (“<span class="font-italic">Tjong</span><span class="font-italic"> Very Sumito</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [46] and [49]).  As the Court of Appeal explained in <span class="font-italic">AnAn</span><span class="font-italic"> Group</span>, this distinction is justified because the parties have agreed for arbitration as the means of determining their disputes, and a court which examines the merits of the debtor’s defences would in effect take the place of the arbitral tribunal and that would undercut the parties’ pre-dispute bargain (at [77] and [82]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 With the foregoing principles in mind, I considered each of IEL’s further arguments. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Ground 1: that the Loan Facility was not repayable at the date when the SD was issued</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Before turning to IEL’s first argument proper, the preliminary issue which I had to consider was the standard to which IEL must establish that the Loan Facility was not repayable at the date when the SD was issued.  This was dependent on whether the dispute fell within the scope of the arbitration agreement in cl 19 of the Loan Facility.  The parties appeared to have been on common ground that it did, and this was plainly correct.  The phrase “arising out of or in connection with”, which appears in cl 19, is given a generous interpretation in the context of arbitration agreements and it extends to all manner of issues that have a relationship with the contract in which the arbitration clause is found (see <span class="font-italic">Tjong</span><span class="font-italic"> Very Sumito </span>at [50]).  In this case, a dispute as to whether the Loan Facility had been repayable as at 14 April 2021 was one which affected MMI’s rights to strictly insist upon repayment of the Loan Sum in accordance with cl 6 of the Loan Facility, and in turn, IEL’s obligations to make repayment of that amount.  Such a dispute obviously fell within the scope of cl 19.  Therefore, IEL only needed to establish that a dispute had arisen on a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>standard. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 As mentioned earlier, there were two alternative cases advanced by IEL in support of its first further argument (see [42] above).  First, that there had been an implied agreement between the parties that MMI would not recall the Loan Facility during the Exclusivity Period.  Second, that there had been an implied term in the Letter of Intent that MMI would not call on the Loan Facility during the Exclusivity Period. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Leaving aside the question of the implied agreement, I was satisfied that there was a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> dispute over whether there was an implied term in the Letter of Intent that MMI would not call for repayment of the Loan Facility during the Exclusivity Period.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 The basis for the implication of terms is to give effect to the presumed intentions of the contracting parties; the object is to fill gaps in the contract and give it such efficacy as the parties must have intended that the contract should have (see <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp Marine Ltd v PPL Holdings Pte Ltd and another and another appeal </span>[2013] 4 SLR 193 at [93]-[95]).  It was therefore important to begin with the context in which the Letter of Intent had been executed by MMI and Mr Ghai.  The Letter of Intent followed the three prior loan agreements which had been entered into between the parties (namely, the convertible loan agreement, the January Loan and the Loan Facility: see [5]-[6] above).  According to Mr Ghai, these loan agreements were to provide IEL with cash so it could begin work on the Retail Project while parties were still in discussions about the Proposed Investment and before its terms were finalised.  The parties had expected those discussions to conclude by 1 August 2020, which I noted was also the repayment date of the Loan Facility (see [33] above).  However, that did not happen, and so Mr Ghai and MMI entered into the Letter of Intent to extend the period in which those discussions could take place, and this was later further extended by the Supplemental Letter until 9 May 2021.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 The period in which those discussions were to take place is represented by the term of the Letter of Intent.  That period, I noted, is also coincident with the Exclusivity Period.  Item 20 of the Letter of Intent (later amended by the Supplemental Letter) defines the Exclusivity Period as commencing on the date of the Letter of Intent and ending <span class="font-italic">on the later of</span> 9 May 2021 or the date on which the Loan Facility has been repaid in full.  This certainly makes it clear that the Exclusivity Period may well end <span class="font-italic">after </span>9 May 2021 if the Loan Facility was only repaid after that date.  However, item 26 of the Letter of Intent (as amended by the Supplemental Letter), which sets out the term of the Letter of Intent, states that the letter will terminate upon 9 May 2021.

</div>  It also did not specify item 20 as one of those terms that would continue to have force and effect after that date.  In other words, notwithstanding the manner in which the Exclusivity Period was defined (a point of significance which I will return to later in these grounds: see [70] below), it was for all intents and purposes coincident with the term of the Letter of Intent.  Any reference to the Exclusivity Period is therefore similarly a reference to the term of the Letter of Intent, and <span class="font-italic">vice versa</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 According to Mr Ghai, the understanding between the parties was that, while those discussions were underway and before the parties finalised the Proposed Investment, none of the loans extended by MMI would be repayable (see [32] above).  Indeed, MMI did not strictly insist on its rights under any of the loan agreements which it had made with IEL until 6 April 2021, when it issued the Letter of Demand pursuant to the Loan Facility.  The successive loan agreements between MMI and IEL consolidated only the principal from the respective prior agreement, even though interest would have already accrued in accordance with the terms of that agreement.  For instance, only the principal of the convertible loan agreement (US$250,000) was consolidated under the January Loan, even though by the time the January Loan was entered into (17 January 2020), both accrued interest and default interest (the repayment date under the convertible loan agreement was 31 December 2019) would have been payable.

</div>  During that period, Mr Ghai was also bound to work exclusively with MMI towards finalising the Proposed Investment, and was not permitted to solicit offers from other investors that were similar to or in competition with the Proposed Investment.  The Letter of Intent was, however, silent on the shared understanding about MMI not enforcing its rights under the loan agreements which it had made with IEL.  Unlike on previous occasions, where the outstanding sum under the prior loan agreement was consolidated into a successive agreement which effectively extended the repayment period for that sum, there was no further loan agreement entered into between MMI and IEL after 1 August 2020.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 If Mr Ghai and MMI had entered into the Letter of Intent to extend the period of time in which they could continue their discussions about the Proposed Investment, it could well have been within their contemplation that the <span class="font-italic">status quo</span> be preserved for the entirety of the duration in which they were obliged to carry on those discussions, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, during the Exclusivity Period that lasted until 9 May 2021.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The manner in which the Exclusivity Period is defined (as ending on 9 May 2021 even if the Loan Facility was repaid in full before that date) was also significant.  It meant that Mr Ghai remained bound to continue the discussions on the Proposed Investment until 9 May 2021, even if IEL had been able to repay the Loan Facility before that date.  This had the effect of ensuring that the parties’ discussions about the Proposed Investment would not be stymied by any extrinsic developments, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, if IEL for some reason no longer required cash from MMI to work on the Retail Project before the Proposed Investment was finalised.  This, taken together with the terms of the Letter of Intent (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, item 3: see [68] above), shows that its objective was to delineate a definite period of time in which both MMI and Mr Ghai were obliged to use all reasonable endeavours to negotiate and finalise the Proposed Investment.  If MMI recalled the Loan Facility before 9 May 2021, it is possible that this would have jeopardised those discussions; in that event, Mr Ghai would presumably no longer want to continue the discussions with MMI and it would have been in his interests to turn to other potential investors.  It would also have defeated the very object which the Letter of Intent sought to achieve.  As such, I accepted that there was a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> dispute as to whether there existed an implied term in the Letter of Intent which limited MMI’s right to call on the Loan Facility until 9 May 2021.  IEL contended that such an implied term would give effect to Mr Ghai’s and MMI’s presumed intentions that MMI would not strictly enforce its rights under the Loan Facility until that date, and that this was necessary to render business efficacy to the agreement constituted by the Letter of Intent.  I therefore found that IEL’s contentions and submissions raised a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> dispute as to whether the Loan Facility was indeed repayable as at 14 April 2021.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 While MMI claimed that Mr Ghai had decided not to discuss the Proposed Investment any further, this assertion was disputed by Mr Ghai.  The 8 Apr E-mail (see [11] above), in which IEL responded to the Letter of Demand, stated that Mr Ghai was still willing to collaborate with MMI on the Retail Project.  There was thus a dispute of fact over whether MMI and Mr Ghai had brought the Letter of Intent to a premature end and terminated the Exclusivity Period early.  That in turn had an impact on whether MMI could call on the Loan Facility before the end of the Exclusivity Period (as amended by the Supplemental Letter), <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 9 May 2021.  For reasons similar to those which I have set out earlier (see [62] above), this dispute was also one which fell within the scope of the arbitration agreement in cl 19 of the Loan Facility. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 MMI also made several other arguments as to why IEL had not even shown on a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>standard that the Exclusivity Period should alter the repayment period under the Loan Facility.  However, these arguments (see [41] above) deal with the <span class="font-italic">merits </span>of IEL’s arguments about the implied term.  Given that the dispute in question is one which falls within the scope of an arbitration agreement (see [62] above), the court is not a proper forum to deal with such arguments and I disregarded them.  For present purposes, it suffices for me to briefly mention two points. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 First, the fact that IEL was not a party to the Letter of Intent was immaterial.  What mattered was that MMI was a party to the Letter of Intent, and that the alleged implied term in the Letter of Intent, the dispute over which I was satisfied existed on a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>standard, was intended to affect MMI’s rights under the Loan Facility as against IEL.  The latter issue, which is quite independent of whether IEL was a party to the Letter of Intent, was relevant to the question of whether the Loan Facility was repayable as at the time when the SD was served on 14 April 2021.  There was, to my mind, a real dispute as to whether IEL could rely on this alleged implied term in the Letter of Intent to contest its liability to make any repayment under the Loan Facility as at 14 April 2021.  Second, one argument made at the 14 Jul Hearing, and reiterated at the hearing before me on 29 October 2021, was that item 4 of the Letter of Intent was not expressed to be legally binding (see [8] above).  Item 4, however, only dealt with the conversion of the sums advanced under the Loan Facility into MMI’s equity in IEL upon the finalisation and completion of the Proposed Investment.  It did not appear to me to deal with the issue of whether the Exclusivity Period could have an effect on the repayment period under the Loan Facility.  Leaving aside item 4 and the other terms in the Letter of Intent which were expressed to be not legally binding, the Letter of Intent nevertheless constituted a legally binding agreement imposing obligations on both MMI and Mr Ghai as to how discussions about the Proposed Investment were to be conducted, including any limitations on rights which MMI had against IEL, such as were necessary to facilitate those discussions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 MMI also argued that the dispute over whether the Loan Facility was repayable as at 14 April 2021 was raised by IEL in abuse of process given that IEL had previously expressed willingness to make repayment under the Loan Facility on two occasions prior to 9 May 2021 (see [46] above).  The two occasions which MMI pointed to were: (a) first, in the 8 Apr E-mail, when IEL informed MMI that it was not its (IEL’s) intention to withhold payment in accordance with the terms of the Loan Facility (see [11] above); and (b) second, in an e-mail sent on 20 April 2021 by IEL to MMI, when IEL made mention of “the remittance of funds based on the loan agreement” and set out calculations on the accrued interest and applicable default interest from the date the SD was issued.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  PWS at para 58(b) and Mr Ghai’s 4th Affidavit at p 154. </div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>  According to the terms of that e-mail, it appeared to have been sent <span class="font-italic">after </span>the 20 Apr Letter (see [13] above), in which IEL disputed its liability for the sum claimed in the SD and alleged that it had a cross-claim against MMI. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 In <span class="font-italic">AnAn</span><span class="font-italic"> Group </span>([58] above), the Court of Appeal emphasised that the threshold for abusive conduct, which when met would result in the court refusing a stay or dismissal of the winding-up application even if the debtor has shown a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>dispute falling within the scope of an arbitration agreement, is very high (at [99]).  One example of abusive conduct is where the debt is admitted by the debtor as regards <span class="font-italic">both </span>liability and quantum (see <span class="font-italic">AnAn</span><span class="font-italic"> Group </span>at [99]).  In my view, the two instances of IEL’s communications which MMI relied on as evidence of IEL acting in abuse of process fell short of that.  They only showed IEL’s acknowledgment that the relevant sums had been borrowed under the Loan Facility, and at most, its willingness to settle the dispute with MMI in respect of sums outstanding under the Loan Facility.  A willingness to settle is not inconsistent with a non-admission of liability.  More importantly, it is significant that the e-mail of 20 April 2021 in which IEL mentioned remitting funds to MMI pursuant to the Loan Facility had followed the 20 Apr Letter in which IEL had vigorously disputed its liability for the Outstanding Sum claimed in the SD (see [13] above). In those circumstances, I was of the view that that there was at least a dispute, on a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> standard, as to whether IEL’s expressions of willingness to settle the sums outstanding under the Loan Facility  gave rise to an admission of the debt on its part. That dispute, as well as the main dispute over whether the Loan Facility was repayable as at 14 April 2021, should both be referred to arbitration. As the Court of Appeal explained in <span class="font-italic">Tjong</span><span class="font-italic"> Very Sumito </span>([60] above)<span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [62]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… where the defendant prevaricates; first making an admission and then later purporting to deny the claim on the ground that the admission was mistaken, or fraudulently obtained, or was never made … there might well be a dispute before the court, both over the substantive claim as well as over whether the defendant can challenge the alleged earlier admission, and the matter should ordinarily be referred to arbitration. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 For the foregoing reasons, I was satisfied that IEL had shown a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>dispute over whether the Loan Facility was repayable as at the date when the SD was served on 14 April 2021, which fell within the scope of the arbitration agreement in cl 19 of the Loan Facility.  The appropriate order in this case would be a dismissal of CWU 81 (see <span class="font-italic">AnAn</span><span class="font-italic"> Group </span>at [110]-[111]) and thus I ordered so accordingly.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 For completeness, I should also mention that I rejected MMI’s argument that, even if the implied term as contended for by IEL existed, there would have been an undisputed debt of at least US$1.61m that would nevertheless have become due <span class="font-italic">from 9 May 2021</span>, which far exceeded the statutorily-prescribed minimum of S$15,000 under s 125(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the IRDA, and so IEL’s argument on this point was nothing more than a technical objection to the timing of the SD and did not disclose any basis to resist the winding-up application.  In my judgment, this reasoning was flawed.  Given that I had been satisfied that there is a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>dispute over whether the Loan Facility was repayable as at 14 April 2021, IEL could not be said to be “indebted” (<span class="font-italic">per </span>s 125(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the IRDA) to MMI for any part of the sum claimed in the SD as at that date.  As such, MMI could no longer rely on the unsatisfied SD as proof of IEL’s inability to pay its debts within s 125(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) of the IRDA.  Given that MMI had not put forward any other evidence of IEL’s insolvency in its supporting affidavit for CWU 81,

</div>
</div>
</div> the entire basis on which MMI was seeking the winding-up of IEL had therefore fallen away.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 I also rejected MMI’s submission that IEL’s failure to make any repayment after 9 May 2021 as at the time of the 14 Jul Hearing would constitute ample evidence of its insolvency.  It must be borne in mind that IEL had also taken the position that it had a valid cross-claim against MMI which exceeded the amount due under the Loan Facility.  That issue of the cross-claim is dealt with later in these grounds (see [87]-[98] below).  IEL’s failure to make any repayment therefore cannot be taken as an indication of its inability to repay debts and did not give rise to any evidence of its insolvency.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 I also rejected MMI’s argument that the defect associated with the SD - namely, the timing at which it was served - was one that could be cured by the court pursuant to s 264 of the IRDA.  While counsel for MMI did not state so expressly, it was quite apparent that the only subsection in s 264 which could be relevant in this case was s 264(2). It states that winding-up proceedings under the IRDA are not: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… invalidated by reason of any procedural irregularity unless the Court is of the opinion that the irregularity has caused or may cause substantial injustice that cannot be remedied by any order of the Court and by order declares the proceeding to be invalid.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 Section 264(1) provides a non-exhaustive list of what can constitute a “procedural irregularity”.  It states: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In this section, … a reference to a procedural irregularity includes a reference to —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) the absence of a quorum at a meeting of a corporation, at a meeting of directors or creditors of a corporation or at a joint meeting of creditors and members of a corporation; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)  a defect, irregularity or deficiency of notice or time. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 The wording of s 264 of the IRDA substantially replicates that found in s 392 of the Companies Act 1967 (2020 Rev Ed) (“the Companies Act”), which similarly deals with the treatment of procedural irregularities, albeit in the context of proceedings under the Companies Act.  In <span class="font-italic">Thio</span><span class="font-italic"> Keng Poon v Thio Syn Pyn and others and another appeal </span>[2010] 3 SLR 143 (“<span class="font-italic">Thio</span><span class="font-italic"> Keng Poon</span>”), which concerned s 392(2) of the Companies Act, the Court of Appeal stated that the threshold burden of showing that the irregularity in question is of a procedural nature rests on the party seeking to uphold the proceeding (at [54]).  The court also held that, to determine whether the non-compliance in question is of a procedural or substantive nature, it must assiduously examine the aim or object of the requirement which was not complied with (<span class="font-italic">Thio</span><span class="font-italic"> Keng Poon</span> at [69]).   It also cited with approval the following proposition formulated by Palmer J in <span class="font-italic">Cordiant Communications (Australia) Pty Ltd v The Communications Group Holdings Pty Ltd </span>[2005] NSWSC 1005 on the distinction between procedural and substantive irregularities (see <span class="font-italic">Thio</span><span class="font-italic"> Keng Poon </span>at [66]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… what is a ‘procedural irregularity’ will be ascertained by first determining what is ‘the thing to be done’ which the procedure is to regulate; </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… if there is an irregularity which changes the substance of ‘the thing to be done’, the irregularity will be substantive; </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… if the irregularity merely departs from the prescribed manner in which the thing is to be done without changing the substance of the thing, the irregularity is procedural. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The application of such a proposition in any particular case will depend upon … defining ‘the thing to be done’. … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 As the foregoing would suggest, an irregularity arises as a result of non-compliance with procedure or the requirements which govern how something is to be done.  However, there are no requirements as to <span class="font-italic">when </span>a statutory demand must be served if it is to be relied on as the ground for a winding-up application pursuant to s 125(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the IRDA.  Of course, the statutory demand must be made in respect of a debt which has accrued, but that is an issue affecting the validity of the statutory demand (see <span class="font-italic">LKM Investment</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([58] above)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [15]) rather than a matter of compliance with procedure.  A premature statutory demand made in respect of a debt that has not fallen due for payment is substantively invalid.  I was not satisfied that the defect associated with the SD could be described as an <span class="font-italic">irregularity </span>to begin with.  This was also not a case where the statutory demand had not complied with the procedural requirements in s 125(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the IRDA as to form or wording (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Dayang Construction and Engineering Pte Ltd </span>[2002] 2 SLR(R) 197 at [14]-[15]; <span class="font-italic">BNP Paribas v Jurong Shipyard Pte Ltd </span>[2009] 2 SLR(R) 949 at [14]).

</div>
</div> that question was dependent on whether any dispute arising from this cross-claim fell within cl 19 of the Loan Facility. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 However widely the phrase “any dispute” in an arbitration clause is construed, it would not cover a dispute that is unrelated to the transaction covered by the contract in which the arbitration clause is found, and which arises in respect of a contract that is separate and distinct from the subject contract (see <span class="font-italic">Dalian </span><span class="font-italic">Hualiang Enterprise Group Co Ltd and another v Louis Dreyfus Asia Pte Ltd </span>[2005] 4 SLR(R) 646 (“<span class="font-italic">Dalian </span><span class="font-italic">Hualiang</span>”) at [28]-[29]).  In <span class="font-italic">Dalian </span><span class="font-italic">Hualiang</span>, the plaintiff made two claims against the defendant under a contract and commenced a suit against the defendant pursuant to those claims.  The contract contained an arbitration clause.  The defendant applied for a stay of the suit on the ground that there was a dispute between the parties which was to be resolved by arbitration.  One such dispute which the defendant alleged was a right of set-off which it said it enjoyed as against, not the plaintiff, but a related entity of the plaintiff, under a separate contract between itself and that entity.  One issue before the court was whether the set-off issue fell within the scope of the arbitration agreement.  Woo Bih Li J (as he then was) held that it did not, because any dispute arising under the separate contract would be distinct from disputes arising under the contract between the plaintiff and the defendant (at [30]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 Returning to the present case, IEL’s alleged cross-claim arose from an alleged <span class="font-italic">separate </span>agreement between MMI and IEL under which the latter was to be compensated in respect of work done for the Wholesale Business. That agreement was distinct from and independent of the Loan Facility.  Accordingly, any cross-claim arising from that agreement did not constitute a dispute that would fall within the scope of cl 19 of the Loan Facility.  If IEL wished to take the benefit of the arbitration agreement in the Loan Facility for the purposes of the cross-claim, the onus was on it to show, either that the alleged agreement with MMI was related to the Loan Facility for the purposes of the arbitration clause, or that the agreement had incorporated cl 19 of the Loan Facility.  That, however, was not the position which IEL had taken in these proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 Accordingly, the applicable standard in respect of IEL’s alleged cross-claim was the triable issue standard.  IEL had to establish that it enjoyed a genuine and substantial cross claim that exceeded the Outstanding Sum claimed in the SD, on account of MMI having agreed to compensate it for work done in respect of the Wholesale Business, which raised at least triable issues.  For the reasons that follow, I was satisfied that IEL had done so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 MMI did not make substantive submissions as to whether the quantum of the asserted cross-claim (US$9,452,071.68) was justifiable and whether there was a basis for IEL to take the position that the cross-claim exceeded the amount due under the Loan Facility.  Instead, MMI contended that there was no evidence of any alleged agreement under which MMI was to compensate <span class="font-italic">IEL</span> for work done in respect of the Wholesale Business.  It was correct that the 29 Mar E-mails (see [36] above),

The “unpaid receivables outstanding” referred to a series of outstanding invoices due from IEL to “Kilocal” (which appeared to be a reference to KL) for fuel stock which IEL had obtained from KL for use in the Retail Project.

Mr Hamid also suggested three parameters by which that figure could be quantified: cost of license and setup; time cost of employees prior to handover; and a percentage service fee.  Mr Hamid also described the quantification process as a “simple exercise” as Mr Ghai “has always maintained he does this as a consultant for companies”.

First, it did appear that IEL had undertaken some work in respect of the Wholesale Business.  As is evident from the e-mails that I have set out earlier, Mr Hamid never refuted Ms Mitpaibul’s assertions that IEL had undertaken such work.  If IEL had indeed never undertaken <span class="font-italic">any</span> work in respect of the Wholesale Business, a position which MMI maintained in these proceedings,

</div>
</div>
</div> then it was surprising that Mr Hamid never disagreed with Ms Mitpaibul’s claim at the earliest opportunity possible.  Not only that, Mr Hamid even agreed that the cost of such work could be offset against the outstanding invoices due from IEL.  That would mean that he accepted that amounts were indeed owing to IEL in respect of the parties’ collaboration on the Wholesale Business.  Notably, in his e-mail of 22 March 2021 (see [91] above), Mr Hamid said: “[o]ther than the setup Iceberg [IEL] added no cash or value to the wholesale business”.  This, in my view, appeared to be an implicit acceptance that IEL had indeed performed the work and setup which Ms Mitpaibul had mentioned in the earlier e-mails, but that IEL did no more than that.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 Second, the work which Mr Ghai is said to have performed for the Wholesale Business, and for which he was to be compensated as <span class="font-italic">per</span> the terms of the 29 Mar E-mails, appeared to be the same work which Ms Mitpaibul said IEL had undertaken in the e-mails exchanged <span class="font-italic">before </span>the 29 Mar E-mails.  Up until the 29 Mar E-mails, the reference had been to the work done <span class="font-italic">by IEL</span> and it was only in the first of the 29 Mar E-mails that Ms Mitpaibul talked about the contributions that Mr Ghai had put into the Wholesale Business (see [92] above).  Despite the specific reference to Mr Ghai’s contributions, there was nothing to suggest that Ms Mitpaibul had something else in mind other than what the parties had been discussing earlier.  Further, the parameters which Mr Hamid suggested Mr Ghai’s compensation could be quantified (which he sent to Ms Mitpaibul in the second of the 29 Mar E-mails: see [87] above), namely the cost of license and setup, time cost of employees and percentage service fee, corresponded closely with the nature of the services which Ms Mitpaibul said IEL had provided in her earlier e-mails.  It therefore appeared that the work which IEL had undertaken for the Wholesale Business was regarded as being synonymous with that undertaken by Mr Ghai.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 Third, notwithstanding the specific references to Mr Ghai’s compensation in the 29 Mar E-mails, it appeared that IEL had been regarded as the party entitled to be paid for all such services which Mr Ghai had rendered (as already mentioned, it appeared that those services were synonymous with the work which IEL had undertaken for the Wholesale Business).  That was why Mr Hamid had suggested that the cost of those services rendered could be offset against the outstanding invoices, which were sums due from IEL (see [89] and [92] above).  Ms Mitpaibul never disagreed (which she presumably would have if any compensation for those services was to be paid to Mr Ghai <span class="font-italic">personally</span>) but only responded to say that the value of any such services rendered was far in excess of the amounts represented by the outstanding invoices (see [92] above).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 All this context took on some significance when viewed against the fact that MMI never objected to the 30 Apr Invoice being issued by IEL instead of by Mr Ghai in his personal capacity.  MMI also did not raise any issue with the fact that the 30 Apr Invoice required payment to be made to IEL’s bank account, even though it purportedly concerned remuneration to which Mr Ghai himself was entitled.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 Although MMI did not appear to have been directly involved in the Wholesale Business, which had been carried out through MPS’s Myanmar-incorporated subsidiaries such as KML and KL, it did appear to be a distinct possibility that MMI had been regarded by the parties as the entity against which any claim for compensation arising out of the conduct of the Wholesale Business, such as the cross-claim, might be maintained.  This is because MMI had been the relevant point of contact in respect of all matters relating to the Wholesale Business.  For instance, the agreement for Mr Ghai to be entitled to 20% of profits of the Wholesale Business was made with <span class="font-italic">MMI</span>.  It was also Mr Hamid, MMI’s managing director, that had been engaging in discussions with Mr Ghai about the Wholesale Business, and served as the point of contact in respect of Mr Ghai’s queries about the profit and loss status of the Wholesale Business.

There ought to be a trial to determine: (a) whether IEL had indeed undertaken work in respect of the Wholesale Business for which it was to be compensated; (b) whether the correct party to assert any such claim for compensation was Mr Ghai or IEL; and (c) whether MMI or some other entity within the MM Group was liable in respect of this claim.  As already explained, the evidence before the court did suggest that it might well be IEL that was entitled to assert the claim against MMI.
