<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       Civil Appeal No 90 of 2012
                    (“CA 90”) and Civil Appeal No 91 of 2012
                    (“CA 91”) were appeals against the decision by the judge
                    (“the Judge”) in <em>Virsagi Management (S) Pte Ltd
                        v Welltech Construction Pte Ltd</em> [2012] SGHC 207 (“the
                    GD”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       We dismissed the appeals and now give the
                    detailed grounds for our decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The facts</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Background to the dispute</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       In 2006, the Building and Construction Authority
                    of Singapore (“BCA”) invited companies to set up authorised
                    overseas training centres (“OTCs”) in India and Bangladesh. These
                    OTCs trained, tested and certified workers for employment in the construction
                    industry in Singapore. The companies which ran these OTCs had to meet certain
                    criteria determined by the BCA. Welltech Construction Pte Ltd
                    (“Welltech”) met these criteria but Virsagi Management (S) Pte Ltd
                    (“Virsagi”) did not, even though it had the necessary expertise in
                    operating OTCs. Accordingly, Mr Lee Siong Kee (“Victor”), the
                    director and shareholder of Virsagi, approached Welltech with the following
                    proposition: Welltech was to apply for the BCA licence pursuant to which
                    Victor/Virsagi would run an OTC in Dhaka.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Welltech was successfully shortlisted in an
                    initial ballot exercise conducted by the BCA in October 2006. Under the terms
                    and conditions set out by the BCA for the setting-up and operation of OTCs,
                    Welltech was required to set up a company in Bangladesh to manage the OTC as
                    well as retain at least a 30% shareholding in that company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Virsagi introduced a Bangladesh-registered
                    company, Rupsha Overseas Ltd (“Rupsha”), to Welltech as their
                    local partner for the joint venture. Welltech, Virsagi and Rupsha entered into
                    an undated agreement (“the Rupsha Agreement”) under which the
                    parties agreed to set up a joint venture company, Welltech Test Pvt Ltd
                    (“WTPL”), for the purpose of operating the OTC.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> The Rupsha Agreement was
                    submitted to the BCA by Welltech by way of a letter dated 24 November 2006.
                    We will return to the main narrative momentarily but we pause here to mention
                    that the Rupsha Agreement was never carried out, as Rupsha was replaced by
                    another Bangladesh incorporated company, GN International (“GNI”).
                    GNI was eventually replaced by Mr Ferdous Ahmed Badel (who claims it should
                    be spelt “Fardous Ahamad Badel”) trading as Gazipur Air Express
                    International (“Badel” or “Gazipur”, as the case may
                    be) in 2009 (see further at [9] below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       On 25 November 2006, the joint venture
                    company, WTPL, was incorporated with 100 shares issued. Victor held
                    40 shares as a representative of Virsagi, Mr Woon Wee Phong
                    (“Woon”), a director of Welltech, held 30 shares and
                    Badel/Gazipur held or came to hold 30 shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       On 6 December 2006, the BCA granted
                    Welltech in-principle approval to set up an OTC in Dhaka, Bangladesh. This
                    approval was valid for a period of three years with effect from
                    6 December 2006, and would be reviewed yearly thereafter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       In early 2007, Virsagi and Welltech entered into
                    a written agreement (“the Principal Agreement”) under which they
                    set out their respective roles in the establishment and operation of the OTC in
                    Dhaka. Welltech was to obtain the BCA licence and also agreed to employ workers
                    trained by the OTC for its own construction business in Singapore. Virsagi was
                    to do everything else that was necessary for the running of the OTC including
                    the operations in Bangladesh. This included the incorporation of a joint venture
                    company in Bangladesh named WTPL. It is not disputed that the Principal
                    Agreement was terminated on 31 December 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Virsagi then entered into an agreement dated
                    26 April 2007 with GNI, to establish the OTC (“the GNI
                    Agreement”). GNI was controlled by Mr Aminul Hossain Sarker
                    (“Sarker”) and Badel. Subsequently, Badel and Sarker fell out, and
                    this led to Virsagi entering into a fresh agreement with Gazipur, which was
                    controlled by Badel, on 26 April 2009 (“the Gazipur
                    Agreement”). Under the Gazipur Agreement, Gazipur was to obtain the
                    necessary licences to set up and run the OTC in Bangladesh, while Virsagi was to
                    handle the BCA testing of the workers and to mobilise them to work in Singapore
                    as well as to obtain approval from the Ministry of Manpower for their employment
                    in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Events leading up to the dispute</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     According to Victor, Woon and Badel met in
                    Singapore in 2010. At that meeting, they agreed to operate the OTC to the
                    exclusion of Virsagi. It appears that Victor found out about that. He told the
                    parties that he intended in any case to retire from the OTC business and invited
                    them to buy him out instead.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The parties worked out a scheme pursuant to
                    which Virsagi would provide the requisite training to Welltech to take over the
                    business, and Victor would also sell his 40% share in WTPL to Badel. This
                    arrangement was later abandoned, because Victor took issue with Gazipur working
                    together with a person named Mr Taneem Hasan in the OTC business in Dhaka.
                    While the buyout negotiations continued, the parties agreed to extend the
                    Principal Agreement, which was due to expire on 31 December 2010, by
                    another year, to 31 December 2011. It was not extended further
                    thereafter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     In the event, the buyout negotiations failed.
                    Virsagi wrote to Welltech on 14 December 2011 threatening legal action if
                    it continued to be excluded from the OTC business.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Bangladesh proceedings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Victor (since the shareholder in WTPL is
                    Victor and not Virsagi) commenced legal action in Company Matter No 8 of
                    2012 (“CM 8/2012”) on 5 January 2012 in the Supreme
                    Court of Bangladesh, High Court Division (Statutory Original Jurisdiction) in
                    Dhaka (“Dhaka High Court”) seeking orders concerning WTPL. Victor
                    claimed that the other majority shareholders were carrying out the business of
                    an OTC and mobilising workers with other parties without the participation of
                    WTPL and Victor/Virsagi. Victor made an application under s 233 of the
                    Companies Act (Bangladesh) 1994 (Act No 18 of 1994) (“Bangladesh
                    Companies Act”) and sought from the Dhaka High Court:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_a"></a>(a)     a direction that the other
                        shareholders of WTPL are “to continue their business as an [OTC] in
                        Bangladesh through [WTPL] with the active participation of the
                        petitioner”; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_b"></a>(b)     pending the disposal of CM 8/2012, an ad-interim
                        order restraining Woon and Badel “from doing [OTC] business in
                        Bangladesh for export of manpower to Singapore by themselves, or through any
                        company in which they are an officer or a shareholder, except through the
                        [OTC] operated by [WTPL] and with the active participation of the
                            petitioner”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     On 9 January 2012, Victor obtained the
                    ad-interim order (see above at [13(b)]) from the Dhaka High Court restraining
                    Welltech and Gazipur from conducting the OTC business in Bangladesh for export
                    of manpower to Singapore by themselves or through any company except WTPL, and
                    with the active participation of Victor (“the Dhaka Order”). The
                    Dhaka Order was then stayed on 15 January 2012 pursuant to an application
                    made by Badel in Bangladesh.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     CM 8/2012 was heard by the Dhaka High
                    Court on 15 and 16 April 2012, and a written judgment was delivered on
                    21 June 2012 dismissing Victor’s application. Victor appealed against
                    the Dhaka High Court’s decision and that appeal was still pending at the
                    time we heard the present appeals.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The proceedings in Singapore</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     On 26 January 2012, after the Dhaka Order
                    was stayed but before CM 8/2012 was heard by the Dhaka High Court, Virsagi
                    commenced Suit No 63 of 2012 (“Suit 63”) and Suit
                    No 64 of 2012 (“Suit 64”) in the Singapore
                    courts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Suit 63 was an action by Virsagi against
                    Welltech for inducing Badel to breach the Gazipur Agreement and for unlawful
                    interference with the Gazipur Agreement. Virsagi sought, <em>inter alia</em>, an injunction to restrain Welltech from further
                    interference with the Gazipur Agreement, an order that Virsagi be allowed to
                    resume its scope of work under the Gazipur Agreement, damages, and an account of
                    profits.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Suit 64 was an action by Virsagi against
                    Badel for breach of contract seeking, <em>inter alia</em>,
                    an injunction to restrain Badel from terminating the Gazipur Agreement, an order
                    that Virsagi be allowed to resume its scope of work under the Gazipur Agreement,
                    damages, and an account of profits.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision in the court below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The Judge stayed both Suit 63 and
                    Suit 64 on the grounds of both <em>lis alibi
                        pendens</em> (however, see below at [41] on the correct terminology to
                    be used) as well as <em>forum non
                conveniens</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The Judge found that although the causes of
                    action of the various proceedings were different, the reliefs claimed against
                    Welltech and Gazipur by Virsagi in both jurisdictions were substantially the
                    same. In particular, Virsagi wanted to ensure that Welltech and Badel could only
                    carry on the OTC business in Bangladesh with Virsagi’s involvement. On
                    this basis, the Judge found that the proceedings in both jurisdictions concerned
                    the same issues. The Judge also held that the issues arose from the same factual
                    matrix. In addition, the Judge said (see the GD at [27]) that the common issues
                    before both the Singapore and Dhaka courts, were as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether Virsagi was “entitled
                        to insist that Badel/Gazipur continue with the Gazipur Agreement when the
                        Principal Agreement has been validly terminated”;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_b"></a>(b)     “in
                        these circumstances, whether Welltech and Badel/Gazipur could carry on OTC
                        business in Dhaka without involving Virsagi”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The Judge added that even if the issue of
                        <em>lis alibi pendens</em> had been the only issue
                    before him, he would have been prepared to grant a stay of Suit 63 and
                    Suit 64 on the facts as they appeared at that stage of the
                    proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     For completeness, the Judge also found that
                    Bangladesh was clearly the more appropriate forum to determine the disputes
                    after considering the principles of <em>forum non
                        conveniens</em> set out in the leading House of Lords decision of
                        <em>Spiliada Maritime Corporation v Cansulex Ltd</em>
                    [1987] AC 460 (“the <em>Spiliada</em>
                    principles”) (see the GD at [28]–[38]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The issues before this Court were:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_a"></a>(a)     Whether the proceedings in
                        Suit 63 and Suit 64 should be stayed based on the doctrine of
                            <em>lis alibi pendens</em> (however, see below at
                        [41] on the correct terminology to be used)
                        (“Issue 1”).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_b"></a>(b)     Whether the proceedings in Suit 63 and Suit 64
                        should be stayed on the ground of <em>forum non
                            conveniens</em>
                (“Issue 2”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     We should state at the outset that, whilst we
                    agree wholly with the decision of the Judge with regard to Issue 2, we
                    respectfully differ from him with regard to Issue 1. Indeed, as we shall
                    explain in a moment, Issue 1 ought not to have been canvassed in the manner
                    it was in the court below. Further, we are of the view that, in any event, the
                    Judge’s holding on this particular issue in relation to the facts is
                    (again, with respect) erroneous. In the circumstances, these grounds of decision
                    are confined to only these two (related) matters in respect of Issue 1.
                    Given, however, our decision with regard to Issue 2, we dismissed the
                    appeals.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Our decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Staying of proceedings on the ground of lis alibi pendens</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     It will be recalled that the Judge considered
                    the issue of <em>lis alibi pendens</em> as a distinct issue
                    in its own right to <em>stay the proceedings</em> in
                    Suit 63 and Suit 64.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     A <em>lis alibi
                        pendens</em>, translated literally, means an action or suit pending
                    elsewhere. Strictly speaking, one would utilise the concept of a <em>lis alibi pendens</em> only in relation to
                    “simultaneous actions pending in [the local court, in this case
                    Singapore] and in a foreign country between the same parties and involving the
                    same or similar issues” (see <em>Dicey, Morris and Collins
                        on the Conflict of Laws</em> vol 1
                    (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 15th Ed, 2012) at para 12-042). The
                    more pertinent question in the context of the present judgment is how the
                    presence of a <em>lis alibi pendens</em> affects the
                    decision of the court in respect of its exercise of jurisdiction over
                    proceedings seised in Singapore. Some clarification of the various effects of a
                        <em>lis alibi pendens</em> in this regard is
                    necessary.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The effect of a lis alibi pendens on the issue of jurisdiction before
                the court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     As a starting point, a <em>lis
                        alibi pendens</em> may arise in two types of factual situations; as
                    observed by M Karthigesu JA, delivering the judgment of this court in
                        <em>Yusen Air &amp; Sea Service (S) Ptd Ltd v KLM
                        Royal Dutch Airlines</em> [1999] 2 SLR(R) 955 (“<em>Yusen Air</em>”) (at [16]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This appeal requires the consideration of the applicable principles
                        governing a situation where a plaintiff commences two sets of proceedings,
                        one the local forum and another in a foreign jurisdiction against the
                        defendant in respect of the same issues arising from the same underlying
                        factual matrix. Such <em>lis alibi pendens</em> can
                        come about in <em>two ways: first, where the same plaintiff
                            sues the same defendant in Singapore and abroad; and second, where the
                            plaintiff sues the defendant in Singapore and the defendant sues the
                            plaintiff abroad, or</em> vice versa. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">For ease of reference as well as analysis, we will term the first way
                    “common plaintiff” situations, and the second way “reversed
                    parties” situations (see the taxonomy used in J D McClean,
                    “Jurisdiction and Judicial Discretion” (1969) 18 ICLQ 931 at
                    934).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     This distinction was held to have a
                    substantive significance; as further observed by Karthigesu JA (also at [16] in
                        <em>Yusen Air</em>):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is settled law that, in the [reversed parties] situation, the existence
                        of concurrent proceedings in another jurisdiction is only an additional
                        factor to be considered under the test laid down by the House of Lords in
                            <em>Spiliada Maritime Corp v Cansulex Ltd</em>
                        [1987] AC 460 (“<em>Spiliada</em>”) in
                        deciding whether to stay the local proceedings (<em>De
                            Dampierre v De Dampierre</em> [1988] AC 92; <em>The
                            Hooghly Mills Co Ltd v Seltron Pte Ltd</em> [1994] 3 SLR(R)
                        757). However, in the [common plaintiff] situation, the English courts have
                        taken the view that, except in very unusual circumstances, such a plaintiff
                        would be put to an election and he would have to decide which jurisdiction
                        he wishes to pursue his claim. The leading authority on this point is the
                        judgment of Sir Browne-Wilkinson VC (as he then was) in the case of
                            <em>Australian Commercial Research</em> [<em>Australian Commercial Research and Development Ltd v ANZ
                            McCaughan Merchant Bank Ltd</em> [1989] 3 All ER 65].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     A <em>lis alibi
                        pendens</em> therefore operates as a <em>fact</em> to which our rules on private international law accord
                        <em>legal significance</em> by reference to two (and
                    only two) separate legal doctrines. The first is what we shall term “the
                    doctrine of forum election”, whilst the second is the more familiar
                    doctrine of <em>forum non conveniens</em>. It is clear from
                        <em>Yusen Air</em> that whether the doctrine of forum
                    election applies, however, is dependent on how the <em>lis alibi
                        pendens</em> comes about (<em>ie</em>, whether it
                    is a common plaintiff or reversed parties type situation). We will elaborate, in
                    turn, on how each doctrine operates and their legal significance on how the
                    court will decide a question of jurisdiction when faced with a <em>lis alibi pendens</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   The doctrine of forum election</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     An application made by the defendant to put
                    the plaintiff to an election is the first way in which a <em>lis
                        alibi pendens</em> may affect the jurisdiction of the court under
                    private international law. This will apply <em>only</em> in
                    a <em>common plaintiff</em> situation. The court in
                        <em>Yusen Air</em> further elaborated (at [27]) on the
                    approach to be taken in such cases:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In our judgment, when a plaintiff sues the same defendant in two or more
                        different jurisdictions over the same subject matter, the defendant can take
                        up an application to compel the plaintiff to make an election as to which
                        set of proceedings he wishes to pursue. <em>For the purposes
                            of an election, the considerations of</em> forum conveniens
                            <em>do not come into play. However, the defendant would
                            need to demonstrate a duplicity of actions in the different
                            jurisdictions. Once this is established, the burden of proof then shifts
                            to the plaintiff to justify the continuance of the concurrent
                            proceedings by showing “very unusual circumstances”. If
                            the plaintiff fails to demonstrate such unusual circumstances, he would
                            have to make an election.</em> [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It is important to note that the court in <em>Yusen
                        Air</em> made clear that when the plaintiff is electing which forum to
                    proceed in, any questions regarding which forum is the more appropriate, or
                    natural, forum for the dispute to be tried are irrelevant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     How then does this process of election operate
                    within the framework of our private international law rules on jurisdiction? As
                    Prof Yeo Tiong Min clearly observes (see <em>Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore – Conflict of Laws</em>
                    vol 6(2) (LexisNexis, Singapore, 2009) (“<em>Yeo</em>”) at para 75.094):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [<em>Lis alibi pendens</em>] <em>raises factors either within the test in</em> The
                        Spiliada, <em>or within the issue of forum management
                            generally</em>. Within the framework of <em>The
                            Spiliada, lis alibi pendens</em> raises issues of duplication of
                        resources, as well as the risk of conflicting judgments. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The learned author then proceeds to provide the following commentary
                    on how the doctrine of forum election operates in the context of forum or (as
                    the learned author terms it) case management (see <em>Yeo</em> at para 75.108):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where a plaintiff is proceeding against the same defendant in two
                        jurisdictions in relation to the same subject matter, <em>the
                            court will compel the plaintiff to elect one jurisdiction to pursue the
                            claim, because the pursuit of such concurrent proceedings will be
                            regarded as vexatious unless there are very unusual circumstances to
                            justify it</em>. Once the defendant establishes duplicity of
                        proceedings, the burden is shifted to the plaintiff to justify continuation
                        of concurrent proceedings by showing the existence of very unusual
                        circumstances. One possible justification may be that the parties had
                        contractually provided for that possibility. If the plaintiff fails to
                        provide justification, then he would be put to an election. <em>Natural forum considerations are not relevant to the question
                            of election. Instead, issues of case management are raised</em>.
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     We agree with Prof Yeo’s approach.
                    In a common plaintiff <em>lis alibi pendens</em> situation,
                    the court, when asking the plaintiff to elect which forum he wishes to proceed
                    in, is <em>not</em> deciding on the appropriateness of the
                    court in exercising its jurisdiction over the dispute – unlike in the
                    situation relating to a stay of proceedings where the doctrine of <em>forum non conveniens</em> is applied. That is the reason why
                    the question of whether Singapore is the natural forum to hear the dispute is
                    not relevant when the plaintiff is asked to make an election. The court is
                    merely managing its own process. The reason why a plaintiff should be compelled
                    to elect in a common plaintiff situation was stated by this court in <em>Koh Kay Yew v Inno-Pacific Holdings Ltd</em> [1997]
                    2 SLR(R) 148 (“<em>Koh Kay Yew</em>”) as
                    follows (at [22]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the latter situations [in which a party had commenced actions
                        concurrently in two jurisdictions], it is understandable that any court
                        should feel uncomfortable about allowing both actions to go on. Not only
                        would the <em>same issue be litigated twice but there would
                            also be the risk of having two different results</em>, each
                        conflicting with the other. And these problems would have arisen simply
                        because one party decided to sue in one place too many. In such
                        circumstances, courts, including those in Singapore, should <em>prevent the inherent abuse of the different judicial systems in
                            different jurisdictions</em> by compelling that party to choose
                        the jurisdiction that he wants to litigate in. The underlying need to
                        prevent a multiplicity of similar proceedings justifies the courts being
                        more prepared to grant an injunction. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Karthigesu JA in <em>Yusen
                        Air</em> was also at pains to point out that the doctrine of <em>forum non conveniens</em> is not superseded by the doctrine
                    of forum election in common plaintiff cases (at [34]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is also our considered view that the plaintiff’s election is not
                        the only way to resolve this issue. Apart from compelling the plaintiff to
                        elect, it remains open to the defendant to take up an application for a stay
                        of local proceedings or a restraint of foreign proceedings if the defendant
                        wishes to have the action tried in one of the jurisdictions where the
                        plaintiff has commenced an action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Indeed, it seems to us that the doctrine of
                    forum election in common plaintiff situations of <em>lis alibi
                        pendens</em> and the doctrine of <em>forum non
                        conveniens</em> do <em>not</em> overlap in any
                    way on a <em>conceptual</em> level. The two principles can
                    – and do – operate alongside each other, although, practically
                    speaking, it is perhaps inevitable that the two doctrines will interface with
                    one another given that they both concern questions of jurisdiction in private
                    international law. To that end, we highlight certain scenarios of such
                    interaction between these doctrines.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     When the plaintiff is put to an election, and
                    he then elects to continue his claim in Singapore, the court will enjoin the
                    plaintiff to stop all other foreign proceedings by way of an injunction. At this
                    juncture, the defendant may be happy for the dispute to be heard in Singapore,
                    and nothing more needs to be done. However, where the defendant does not want
                    proceedings to continue in Singapore, it is open to it to rely on the doctrine
                    of <em>forum non conveniens</em> to argue that the overseas
                    forum is clearly or distinctly the more appropriate forum for the dispute to be
                    heard, and therefore to have the Singapore proceedings stayed. This is clear
                    from the observations of Karthigesu JA in <em>Yusen
                        Air</em> (see above at [33]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     On the other hand, if the plaintiff elects to
                    pursue its claim in the overseas forum (instead of in Singapore) but the
                    defendant wants the proceedings to continue in Singapore, the latter may seek an
                    anti-suit injunction from the Singapore courts to prevent the plaintiff from
                    carrying on with the foreign proceedings. The plaintiff’s election does
                    not, <em>ipso facto</em>, preclude the granting of such an
                    injunction. Where, however, the defendant is happy to have the dispute heard
                    abroad, it would have (in substance) obtained the same outcome pursuant to an
                    application to stay proceedings under the doctrine of <em>forum
                        non conveniens</em>. It has been said that in such a situation the
                    court will <em>discontinue</em> the local proceedings
                    (rather than just grant a stay): see the English High Court decision of
                        <em>Australian Commercial Research and Development Ltd v ANZ
                        McCaughan Merchant Bank Ltd</em> [1989] 3 All ER 65
                        (“<em>Australian Commercial
                    Research</em>”) at [70] as well as <em>Yusen
                        Air</em> at [32] (citing Smart, “<em>Lis Alibi
                        Pendens</em>: Staying or Discontinuing English Proceedings”
                    [1990] LMCLQ 326 at 329)). However, we take the view that the court is not
                    restricted to discontinuing the local proceedings, and may, in the <em>appropriate circumstances</em>, grant a stay of proceedings
                    instead. This might be the case where the foreign court’s jurisdiction is
                    being challenged (see, for example, the English High Court decision of <em>AG v Arthur Andersen &amp; Co</em> The Independent
                    (31 March 1988) and <em>Yusen Air</em> at [32]), or
                    where the action in Singapore is brought to obtain security by way of a
                        <em>Mareva</em> injunction or attachment of assets
                    (see, for example, the Singapore High Court decision of <em>Multi-Code Electronics Industries (M) Bhd and another v Toh Chun Toh Gordon
                        and others</em> [2009] 1 SLR(R) 1000 (“<em>Multi-Code Electronics</em>”)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     It should therefore be clear that the doctrine
                    of forum election, as a mechanism of case management, is never finally
                    dispositive of where the dispute will be heard unless the defendant has no
                    objections to the plaintiff’s election.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   
        <em>Lis alibi pendens</em> as part of
                the doctrine of <em>forum non conveniens</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The second effect a <em>lis
                        alibi pendens</em> will have on a question of jurisdiction is under
                    the rubric of the doctrine of <em>forum non conveniens</em>
                    (pursuant to the <em>Spiliada</em> principles). This will
                    apply regardless of how the <em>lis alibi pendens</em>
                    arises (<em>ie</em>, whether as a result of a common
                    plaintiff or reversed parties case). In a reversed parties situation, this is
                    the only way a <em>lis alibi pendens</em> can have any
                    legal significance for the purposes of jurisdiction. The doctrine of forum
                    election <em>does not</em> apply. In a common plaintiff
                        <em>lis alibi pendens</em> situation, where the
                    defendant wishes to stay proceedings under the doctrine of <em>forum non conveniens</em>, the <em>lis alibi
                        pendens</em> will (just as in a reversed parties situation) feature as
                    one of the factors in deciding whether it is appropriate for the Singapore court
                    to hear the dispute. It should be noted at this juncture, however, that there
                    could be situations which relate to <em>parallel
                        proceedings</em> which might not necessarily fall within the narrower
                    compass of a <em>lis alibi pendens</em> (see above at [26]
                    and later below at [46]–[47]). Such proceedings would equally constitute
                    one of the factors in the application of the <em>Spiliada</em> principles (see, for example, the decisions of this
                    court in <em>CIMB Bank Bhd v Dresdner Kleinwort Ltd</em>
                    [2008] 4 SLR(R) 543 at [70] and <em>Rickshaw
                        Investments Ltd and another v Nicolai Baron von Uexkull</em>
                    [2007] 1 SLR(R) 377 at [90]; as well as <em>Yeo</em> at para 75.094 (see below at [39])).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Accordingly, when a <em>lis
                        alibi pendens</em> operates within the doctrine of <em>forum non conveniens</em>, it must be considered in light of the
                    general principles applicable to the <em>forum non
                        conveniens</em> analysis (<em>viz</em>, the
                        <em>Spiliada</em> principles). In this regard,
                    Prof Yeo provides helpful guidance on the weight to be given to parallel
                    proceedings generally (including situations of <em>lis alibi
                        pendens</em>) (see <em>Yeo</em> at
                    para 75.094):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The weight to be given to the fact of existence of parallel proceedings
                        will depend on the circumstances. The degree to which the respective
                        proceedings have advanced is an important consideration; although the
                        advanced stage of proceedings may be disregarded if proceedings had been
                        deliberately advanced at the insistence of the party seeking to rely on this
                        as a factor.<sup></sup>The degree of overlap of issues and parties is another
                        consideration. However, little or <em>no</em> weight
                        will be given to fact that there are foreign proceedings if they are
                        commenced for strategic reasons to bolster the case of a clearly more
                        appropriate forum elsewhere.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where there has been or is litigation involving very complex facts which
                        call for highly specialised expert evidence, and such expertise has been
                        built up in a particular jurisdiction, that could be a very important
                        indication of the prima facie natural forum. This factor, discussed in
                            <em>The Spiliada</em>, came to be known as the
                            <em>Cambridgeshire</em> factor (named after the
                        vessel involved in the prior proceedings where the expertise had been
                        developed), is recognised as a highly exceptional factor and has rarely been
                        applied since then.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The risk of conflicting judgments arising from concurrent proceedings is
                        another factor to consider, but it is not decisive and will need to be
                        weighed with other factors. If it is a straight competition between
                        proceedings in the forum and proceedings elsewhere, this factor should carry
                        no weight, because the only question before the court is whether it should
                        exercise its own jurisdiction and it has no control over foreign
                        proceedings. Of course, ideally the trial should be held at only one of the
                        competing fora, but trial in either forum alone will obviate the risk.
                        However, the problem usually arises in the context of complex litigation
                        involving multiple issues and/or multiple litigants.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     It bears emphasis that, for the purposes of
                    the doctrine of <em>forum non conveniens</em>, it is
                    sufficient for there to be related (or parallel) proceedings (as compared to a
                    strict <em>lis alibi pendens</em> (see above at [26] as
                    well as below at [46]–[47])) in order for the foreign proceedings to weigh
                    into the analysis of appropriateness. This is a sensible approach to take, given
                    that the existence of parallel proceedings is never wholly dispositive of the
                    issue of the natural forum as a matter of course, but is only a factor to be
                    considered in the application of the <em>Spiliada</em>
                    principles.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(3)   Summary and further considerations</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     We reiterate that a <em>lis
                        alibi pendens</em> will affect how the court would deal with an issue
                    of jurisdiction to hear proceedings seised in Singapore in two ways: the first,
                    pursuant to common plaintiff <em>lis alibi pendens</em>
                    situations, where the doctrine of forum election will be applicable; and,
                    second, as part of the application of the doctrine of <em>forum
                        non conveniens</em> (pursuant to the <em>Spiliada</em> principles), regardless of whether it is a common
                    plaintiff or reversed parties situation. We note that in some prior cases, and
                    indeed in the present case at first instance, the first way has been referred to
                    as “the doctrine of <em>lis alibi
                    pendens</em>” (see, for example, the Singapore High Court decisions
                    of <em>Ang Ming Chuang v Singapore Airlines Ltd (Civil
                        Aeronautics Administration, Third Party)</em> [2005] 1 SLR(R)
                    409; <em>Tan Kah Hock and Another v Chou Li Chen and
                        Others</em> [2008] SGHC 82 and <em>Multi-Code
                        Electronics</em>). It should be clear by now that such an approach is
                    terminologically confusing, and might (unfortunately) lead to confusion (as well
                    as conflation) of substantive legal principles. We are therefore of the view
                    that it is best for common plaintiff <em>lis alibi
                        pendens</em> situations which raise the issue of forum election (as it
                    has been in these grounds of decision) to be referred to as the doctrine of
                    forum election instead.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The doctrine of forum election operates by
                    putting the plaintiff to an election once the defendant has established that
                    there is a <em>lis alibi pendens</em>, unless the plaintiff
                    can demonstrate why the multiple proceedings are justified. This is to ensure
                    that the defendant is not vexed or oppressed by the plaintiff’s abuse of
                    the court process. As demonstrated above, it is clear that this is a separate
                    analytical framework from that of <em>forum non
                        conveniens</em>, and the two do not elide on a conceptual
                    level.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     However, some aspects of the doctrine of forum
                    election and its relationship to the principles in relation to <em>forum non conveniens</em> as well as anti-suit injunctions do
                    raise some issues of concern. Does a common plaintiff situation where the
                    plaintiff is unable to show unusual circumstances mean that there is, <em>prima facie</em>, vexation and oppression to the defendant?
                    Should this have an effect on how vexation and oppression operate in the context
                    of anti-suit injunctions (see, for example, <em>Koh Kay
                        Yew</em> as well as the Singapore High Court decision of <em>Beckkett Pte Ltd v Deutsche Bank AG and another</em> [2011]
                    1 SLR 524)? Why does <em>forum election</em> result,
                    by default, in a discontinuance of proceedings if the plaintiff elects to
                    proceed overseas, rather than, say, a stay of proceedings? We need not address
                    these (problematic) questions in the context of the present appeal, given our
                    decision on <em>the facts of the present appeal</em>
                        (<em>ie</em>, that the doctrine of forum election could
                    not have resulted in a stay of proceedings, and that there was no <em>lis alibi pendens</em> on the facts of the present case
                    although the doctrine of <em>forum non conveniens</em>
                    nevertheless applied in favour of the Respondents). These questions can be dealt
                    with when they next arise directly for decision by the court. It is, instead, to
                    our findings on the facts in relation to the present appeal which our attention
                    must now turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The doctrine of forum election applied to the facts of the present
                case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     In the present case, Welltech and Gazipur both
                    sought to <em>stay proceedings</em> on the ground of
                        <em>lis alibi pendens</em>, relying on the principles
                    set out in <em>Yusen Air</em>. The Judge referred to
                        <em>Yusen Air</em> in his decision, but did not raise
                    the issue of the plaintiff making an election as such. In fairness, this was
                    probably appropriate, given that Welltech and Gazipur only sought to have the
                    proceedings in Singapore stayed. Furthermore, the proceedings in Bangladesh were
                    decided against Victor, and it would be practically certain that Virsagi, if put
                    to an election, would have chosen to continue proceedings in Singapore. If that
                    was the case, however, the Judge must, with respect, be mistaken in observing
                    that he would have <em>stayed the proceedings</em> on the
                    ground of the doctrine of forum election had it been the only issue before him.
                    The only way that the proceedings in Singapore could have been stayed if Virsagi
                    had elected to proceed with its claim in Singapore would be by Welltech and
                    Badel demonstrating that there was a clearly more appropriate forum elsewhere
                    pursuant to the doctrine of <em>forum non
                    conveniens</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">No lis alibi pendens on the facts of the present case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     As also indicated earlier, it is, <em>in any event</em>, clear that there was no <em>lis alibi pendens</em> on the facts of the present case. In this
                    regard, it is important to be clear what precisely constitutes a <em>lis alibi pendens</em>, especially since the case law does
                    not evidence a uniform manner of assessment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     In <em>Yusen Air</em>,
                    the Court of Appeal appeared to focus on three things: the identity of the
                    parties, the issues arising from both sets of proceedings, and the underlying
                    factual matrix giving rise to these issues. In most cases, these three factors
                    will be considered. However, some decisions have considered the causes of action
                    and reliefs sought by parties in the various proceedings in order to determine
                    whether or not there was a <em>lis alibi pendens</em> (see,
                    for example, the Singapore High Court decisions of <em>Transtech
                        Electronics Pte Ltd v Choe Jerry and others</em> [1998]
                    1 SLR(R) 1014 at [12] and <em>Lanna Resources Public Co
                        Ltd v Tan Beng Phiau Dick and another</em> [2011] 1 SLR 543
                        (“<em>Lanna Resources</em>”) at [16]).
                    Indeed that was the approach taken by the Judge in the court below; in
                    particular, he considered the similar reliefs sought by the parties important in
                    his finding that there was a <em>lis alibi
                    pendens</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     We are of the view that in deciding whether
                    there is a <em>lis alibi pendens</em>, the first legal port
                    of call ought to be the identity of the parties and the causes of action
                    concerned. This will enable to court to identify whether there are same or
                    similar issues arising from the same factual matrix which are before both the
                    local and foreign court(s), and, if so, the extent of these similarities. The
                    nature of the reliefs sought will be relevant to the analysis, given that in
                    most cases the reliefs sought and the causes of action concerned will be
                    inextricably linked with each other. However, the court ought not to hold,
                    without more, that the local and foreign court(s) are faced with the same or
                    similar issues by focusing merely on the reliefs sought – for example,
                    whether the claimant is entitled to the same quantum of damages as a remedy. As
                    for the degree of similarity necessary, the party seeking to demonstrate that
                    there is a <em>lis alibi pendens</em> need not show a total
                    correspondence of issues, but the court will be more likely to find a <em>lis alibi pendens</em> where the issues are of a greater
                    degree of similarity.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The identity of the parties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Turning to the facts of the present appeal, it
                    is clear that the parties in the Singapore and Bangladesh proceedings were
                        <em>not</em> the same. In Singapore, the plaintiff was
                    Virsagi while the defendants were Welltech and Badel/Gazipur. In Bangladesh, the
                    plaintiff was Victor while the defendants were WTPL, Woon and Badel. Arguments
                    were made by Welltech and Badel, initially, at first instance, that the parties
                    are effectively the same, but this was not taken any further by the Judge since
                    counsel for Virsagi conceded this point subsequently.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The causes of action and issues raised</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     It will be recalled that in Suit 63,
                    Virsagi claimed that Welltech was liable for the tort of inducing breach of
                    contract, or alternatively, for the tort of unlawful interference with the
                    Gazipur Agreement. Some of the issues which need to be addressed in order to
                    establish the validity of the claim in Suit 63 would include the
                    following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_49-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether the Gazipur Agreement is
                        valid;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_49-p2_b"></a>(b)     whether
                        the Gazipur Agreement is not illegal or in restraint of trade or is capable
                        of being rescinded;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_49-p2_c"></a>(c)     whether Welltech had knowledge of the existence of the Gazipur
                        Agreement;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_49-p2_d"></a>(d)     whether Welltech intended to interfere with Gazipur’s performance of
                        the Gazipur Agreement;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_49-p2_e"></a>(e)     whether Gazipur breached the Gazipur Agreement (which is
                        the issue to be decided in Suit 64);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_49-p2_f"></a>(f)     whether Welltech has committed an unlawful act
                        affecting Gazipur;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_49-p2_g"></a>(g)     whether Welltech did so intending to injure Virsagi;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_49-p2_h"></a>(h)     whether Virsagi
                        suffered any loss.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     In Suit 64, Virsagi claimed that Gazipur
                    had breached the Gazipur Agreement, and the main issues related to the
                    construction of certain clauses in the contract, as well as whether there were
                    breaches of those clauses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     On the other hand, CM 8/2012 was
                    commenced by Victor in Dhaka pursuant to s 233 of the Bangladesh Companies
                    Act, which provides for the protection of minority shareholder interests. The
                    main issue was whether Victor, as the petitioner in the action, was
                    “entitled to get any relief under the Provisions of Section 233 of
                    the Companies Act 1994”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>
                    The only issue for the Dhaka High Court to decide in CM 8/2012 was whether
                    relief in the form of a direction to the other shareholders of WTPL “...
                    to continue their business as an [OTC] in Bangladesh through [WTPL] with the
                    active participation of the petitioner” should be granted.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> The subsidiary issues
                    arising from this main issue were identified by Abdur Rahman J in his
                    written judgment (at pp 21–22) where it was found that WTPL was a
                    non-functioning company. The OTC setup in Bangladesh was not established under
                    WTPL and was instead owned and run by Victor and Badel under the terms of the
                    Gazipur Agreement. Finally, the lending of the BCA licence by Welltech
                    (represented by Woon) to establish and run the OTC business in Dhaka had nothing
                    to do with WTPL.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Therefore, it is clear, in our view, that the
                    causes of action in Suit 63, Suit 64, and CM 8/2012 were entirely
                    different, and did not give rise to the same issues. The Singapore court in
                    deciding Suit 63 and Suit 64 would not have to traverse much of the
                    grounds considered in CM 8/2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The reliefs sought by the parties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     We agree with the Judge that the injunctive
                    relief sought in both sets of proceedings were similar in substance.
                    Victor/Virsagi was seeking not to be excluded from the OTC business now
                    conducted by Gazipur and Welltech, whether by way of specific performance of the
                    Gazipur Agreement or through relief for the action of minority shareholder
                    oppression.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Considering all the factors, we found that
                    there was insufficient similarity between the Singapore and the Bangladesh
                    proceedings and that there was therefore no <em>lis alibi
                        pendens</em> in the context of the present proceedings
                    (notwithstanding our agreement with the Judge’s decision regarding the
                    similarity of reliefs sought). Welltech and Badel were not subject to vexation
                    or oppression by Virsagi bringing Suit 63 and Suit 64, respectively,
                    in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     We should note, however, that even if there
                    was no <em>lis alibi pendens</em> on the facts of the
                    present case, this did not mean that there were no parallel or related
                    proceedings. There were, undoubtedly, parallel or related proceedings in both
                    Bangladesh as well as Singapore. These proceedings would be (and, in fact were)
                    considered as a factor to be applied in relation to the doctrine of <em>forum non conveniens</em>, which constituted Issue 2 in
                    the present case and which we have decided in both Welltech’s and
                    Gazipur’s favour, in agreement with the Judge.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     For the reasons set out above, we held that
                    the Judge, with respect, was mistaken with regards to Issue 1, and should
                    not have stayed proceedings on the ground of <em>lis alibi
                        pendens</em> (or rather, the doctrine of forum
                election).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Notwithstanding our decision on Issue 1,
                    as already noted above, given our decision on Issue 2, we dismissed the
                    appeals. However, in light of our decision on Issue 1, the costs awarded in
                    the court below of $4,000 to Welltech and $8,000 to Badel/Gazipur were each
                    reduced by fifty per cent. As for the costs of CA 90 and CA 91, we
                    respectively awarded Welltech and Badel/Gazipur the costs of these appeals fixed
                    at $7,500 (including disbursements) each. The usual consequential orders
                    applied.</p>
