<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This action, <em>ie</em>, Suit No 283 of 2010 (“the
                    Second Action”) arises from an earlier decision of
                    mine in Suit No 287 of 2007 (“the First
                    Action”) between the same two sisters, Chan Gek Yong
                    (“the plaintiff”) and Chan Gek Lan
                    (“the defendant”). In the First Action, I
                    dismissed various claims made by the plaintiff against the
                    defendant and the defendant’s counterclaim against the
                    plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       In the Second Action, the
                    plaintiff sought to set aside my judgment in the First
                    Action dated 2 October 2008 (see <em>Chan Gek Yong v Chan Gek </em><em>Lan</em> [2008] SGHC 167) (“my earlier
                    judgment”) and to make the same claims against the
                    defendant as she had already made in the First Action. On
                    the first day of trial in the Second Action, the
                    defendant’s counsel submitted as a preliminary issue
                    that the Second Action should be dismissed. After hearing
                    arguments by both parties, I dismissed the Second Action.
                    This time round, the plaintiff has filed an appeal to the
                    Court of Appeal which she did not do in respect of my
                    earlier judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The defendant is the eldest
                    child in the family while the plaintiff is the second
                    eldest. They have six other surviving siblings. Their
                    parents are deceased.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The plaintiff is a diploma
                    holder. She obtained her diploma from the Singapore
                    Polytechnic in 1971. She was a teacher in St Francis Girls
                    Secondary School in or about 1974. From 1975, she was a
                    Parts Executive of Inchcape Group for about 11 years. From
                    about 1987 to 1992, she was a manager of Asia Motors Pte
                    Ltd.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The defendant’s
                    highest level of education is secondary two and the last
                    school she attended was Chong Hua Girls High School at
                    Bartley Road.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       In the First Action, the
                    plaintiff made four claims against the defendant. These were
                    summarised in para 84 of her closing submissions there
                    and I set them out below:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">84    ...</p>

                                for the period April 1990 to December
                                1996.</span></p>

                                pursuant to 3 cheques, issued by the clinic for
                                her salary.</span></p>

                                use.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       I should mention that the
                    reference in the first claim to a Serangoon property was to
                    Blk 253, Serangoon Central Drive, #01-233, Singapore 550253.
                    The plaintiff and the defendant were co-owners of that
                    property at the time of my earlier judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       As can be seen, the first
                    claim of the plaintiff in the First Action was for 73% share
                    of the rent paid by a tenant for the Serangoon property for
                    a certain period, <em>ie</em>, April
                    1990 to December 1996. From 1 April 1990 to
                    30 June 1992, that property was leased to a younger
                    brother of the parties who was practising as a dentist under
                    the name and style of “Chan Dental Clinic &amp;
                    Surgery” (“the Clinic”). On or about
                    1 July 1992, the plaintiff and her younger sister Chan
                    Gek Keow formed a partnership to operate the Clinic which in
                    turn employed that brother as a dentist. The Clinic was then
                    paying rent from 1 July 1992 to sometime in August 1999
                    (see [4] of my
                    earlier judgment).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       I decided in the First
                    Action that the plaintiff was entitled to 50% of the rent
                    and not 73%. However, I dismissed the first claim of the
                    plaintiff in the First Action because she had not
                    established that the defendant had made use of her share of
                    the rent. As mentioned above, I also dismissed the other
                    three claims of the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     In the Second Action, the
                    plaintiff claimed that the defendant had falsely asserted
                    that the first 27 months’ rent (from 1 April 1990
                    to June 1992) were paid either in cash or by two cheques of
                    $2,000 to each of the parties (making a total rent of $4,000
                    per month). The plaintiff claimed that as a result of bank
                    statements which the defendant was ordered to produce during
                    the trial of the First Action, she managed to discover later
                    that the rent for the 27 months was paid entirely by cheque
                    and not partly in cash or partly by cheque. Also, the
                    cheques for the rent were not for $2,000 to each of the
                    parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The plaintiff also
                    asserted that she had discovered that for the period between
                    July 1992 and December 1996 (54 months), 48 months’
                    rent had in fact been paid into a joint account which the
                    defendant held with their mother, <em>ie</em>, OCBC Savings Account No [xxx]. The
                    plaintiff said that another six months’ rent had been
                    deposited into the defendant’s personal savings
                    account no [xxx].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The plaintiff said she
                    discovered the information stated in <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a> and <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a> above after the trial
                    because she did not have time to go through the documents
                    that the defendant had produced during the trial. However,
                    she did not at that time ask for more time to go through the
                    documents. The plaintiff also seemed to accept that some of
                    the information she was relying on came from other documents
                    which were available even before the trial commenced.
                    However, she did not identify clearly which information was
                    already available before the trial commenced.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     In any event, based on her
                    alleged discovery, the plaintiff claimed that she was
                    entitled to set aside my earlier judgment in respect of all
                    her four claims including my finding that she would have
                    been entitled to only 50% of the rent and not 73% as she had
                    claimed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     As can be seen, even if
                    the plaintiff was correct in her factual assertions as
                    stated in <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a> and
                        <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a> above, such
                    assertions had nothing to do with her second, third and
                    fourth claims. Furthermore, such assertions had no bearing
                    on my decision that she would have been entitled to only 50%
                    of the rent under her first claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     As regards the rest of her
                    first claim, I had already observed in [28] to [31] of my
                    earlier judgment that the defendant’s evidence as to
                    how the rent was paid and into whose bank account it was
                    credited was unreliable. However, this was not because the
                    defendant was duplicitous but because:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_a"></a>(a)     she (the
                        defendant) has a simple mind and was not able to grapple
                        with the details of the transactions which happened many
                        years ago; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_b"></a>(b)     she had been executing their
                        mother’s instructions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">I would
                    add that their mother passed away in September 1996 and the
                    plaintiff did not commence the First Action until 2007. Her
                    position was that she had trusted the defendant until the
                    defendant had commenced legal action against her first in
                    2005 to buy the plaintiff’s share in the Serangoon
                    property or to have the property sold.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The point was whether the
                    defendant had made use of the plaintiff’s share of the
                    rent. I had concluded that the plaintiff had failed to
                    establish this (see [32] and [33] of my earlier
                    judgment).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Accordingly, even if the
                    plaintiff was allowed to adduce the additional information
                    which she said she had uncovered, it still did not assist
                    her.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The plaintiff also sought
                    to rely on fresh evidence about an account which the
                    defendant allegedly had with a stockbroker. However, the
                    existence of such an account did not in itself advance any
                    of the plaintiff’s claims any further.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     As mentioned above, the
                    plaintiff did not appeal against my earlier judgment.
                    Apparently, about ten months after that judgment (dated
                    2 October 2008), she filed Originating Summons No 882
                    of 2009 on 6 August 2009 to seek an order for a new
                    trial of the First Action or, alternatively, for leave to
                    file a Notice of Appeal to the Court of Appeal out of
                    time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     On 24 February 2010,
                    Steven Chong JC decided that he had no jurisdiction to grant
                    the plaintiff an extension of time to appeal to the Court of
                    Appeal. The plaintiff ought to have filed her application
                    for an extension of time to the Court of Appeal and not to
                    the High Court. Instead of filing a fresh application to the
                    Court of Appeal for an extension of time after
                    Chong JC’s decision, the plaintiff filed the
                    Second Action on 24 April 2010 which I dismissed on
                    20 March 2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     I was aware that the
                    plaintiff was acting in person but that alone did not
                    entitle her to the reliefs she sought in the Second
                    Action.</p>
