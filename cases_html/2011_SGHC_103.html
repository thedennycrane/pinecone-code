<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       In late 2007, the plaintiff, Goldzone (Asia
                    Pacific) Ltd (“Goldzone”) entered into three agreements for the
                    rental of a number of units in the Creative Resource Building (“the
                    Building”) owned by the defendant, Creative Technology Centre Pte Ltd
                    (“Creative”). Goldzone met with representatives from Creative on
                    1, 2 and 10 August 2007 to determine the suitability of the Building for their
                    venture. Goldzone alleged that a number of representations were made by
                    Creative’s Chan Ming Tat during the course of negotiations, which included
                    site visits and subsequent e-mail exchanges. Goldzone claimed that these
                    representations induced them into signing three tenancy agreements with
                    Creative.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Goldzone took possession of only two out of the
                    three tenancies signed with Creative, resulting in the premature termination of
                    the third tenancy in March 2008. On 31 July 2008, Goldzone vacated the
                    Building and soon thereafter filed a suit against Creative alleging various
                    breaches of the agreements on the basis of actionable misrepresentations and/or
                    an alleged oral collateral contract. In response, Creative filed a separate suit
                    (hereinafter referred to as “the counterclaim”) on the basis of
                    Goldzone’s breach of the agreements such as failure to pay rental,
                    security deposits and service charges and other sums that fell due. An order for
                    consolidation was made in December 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Goldzone’s claims in these proceedings
                    were for rescission of the agreements, return of security deposits, rent and
                    service charges totalling $833,436.60, costs and damages. Creative sought
                    dismissal of Goldzone’s claim, judgment for $381,734.35, interests
                    thereto, costs, as well as damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The agreements</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The three agreements (“the
                    Agreements”) for the lease of units were as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_a"></a>(a)     Letter of offer from Creative dated
                            <em>9 October 2007</em> in respect of units
                        #01-04 and #01-05 for a period of one year, accepted by Goldzone on
                            <em>12 October 2007</em>
                        (“LO1”). Goldzone took possession of both units on <em>1 November 2007</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_b"></a>(b)     Letter of offer from Creative dated <em>31 October 2007</em> in respect of units #05-04 and
                        #05-05 for a period of three years (with an option to renew for three
                        years), accepted by Goldzone on <em>1 November
                            2007</em> (“LO2”). Goldzone took possession of unit
                        #05-05 on <em>5 November 2007</em> and of unit
                        #05-04 on <em>3 December
                    2007</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_c"></a>(c)     Letter of offer from Creative dated <em>22 November
                            2007</em> in respect of units #01-06/07/08 and #02-06 for a period
                        of five years (with an option to renew for three years), accepted by
                        Goldzone on 22 November 2007 (“LO3”). Goldzone did not
                        take possession of these units.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       While Goldzone did not execute the draft tenancy
                    agreements, the terms of the draft tenancy agreements were incorporated into all
                    three Agreements by operation of cl 1.7. It is worth noting that cl 1
                    of all three Agreements contained express terms for the payment of rent,
                    utilities, security deposits and parking charges.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The following material witnesses appeared for
                    Goldzone and Creative respectively:</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Goldzone’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Goldzone’s pleaded case was built on the
                    foundational premise that Creative’s Mr Chan represented himself to
                    possess sufficient authority to commit Creative to plans in relation to the
                    Agreements. Goldzone also argued that Creative and Mr Chan, in particular,
                    were well aware of Goldzone’s requirement that the Building was compatible
                    with Goldzone’s vision of running a one-of-a-kind world class leadership
                    centre. Goldzone argued that Creative was an “aligned landlord”,
                    collaborating in Goldzone’s venture by, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, undertaking wide-ranging financial commitments to upgrade
                    the Building to Goldzone’s satisfaction. As the representations allegedly
                    made by Mr Chan were presented by Goldzone within this context, I
                    considered the merits, if any, of these submissions prior to my analysis of the
                    individual representations identified.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Mr Chan’s authority</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Firstly, Creative did not dispute that
                    Mr Chan was in charge of the “special project” of the
                    Building tenancies. However, Creative disagreed with Goldzone’s allegation
                    that Mr Chan possessed the necessary authority to commit Creative to the
                    representations alleged by Goldzone. Analysis of the evidence indicated that
                    Goldzone did not hold this belief either. Goldzone’s witnesses admitted
                    under cross-examination that they did not think that Mr Chan had <em>absolute</em> authority to deliver promises without higher
                    authorisation. For example, when asked about Mr Chan’s authority,
                    Ms Colley remarked that she was not calling him the sole decision maker.
                    Similarly, in many e-mails between Ms Lim and Mr Chan, Ms Lim
                    sought clarification of the right person to seek approvals from, implicitly
                    recognising a limit to Mr Chan’s authority. I was satisfied that
                    Mr Chan clearly did not possess the unbridled authority alleged by Goldzone
                    and that in any event Goldzone was not labouring under this assumption
                    either.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Creative’s knowledge and awareness of Goldzone’s
                requirements</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Secondly, Goldzone submitted that Creative,
                    through its representatives Mr Chan and Mr Yeo, had knowledge that,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, the building type, estimated space
                    requirements, high quality and top class facilities were integral to the success
                    of the unique concept of the Goldzone Leadership Centre and its ten-year plan
                    for regional expansion. Goldzone’s submission that Creative possessed
                    knowledge of its expectations was undermined by the following factors:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_a"></a>(a)     Goldzone’s awareness of the
                        nature and quality of Creative’s facilities;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_b"></a>(b)     Goldzone’s evolving plans;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_c"></a>(c)     the nature
                        and scope of Goldzone’s relationship with
                Creative.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Awareness of the nature and quality of Creative’s
                facilities</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Goldzone was relocating its offices from
                    Suntec City in the Central Business District area to the Building which was
                    located at 31 International Business Park, Singapore 609921, a business
                    park in an industrial area in Jurong. Furthermore, Goldzone could not have been
                    unaware that the Building had a tenant mix, including companies engaged in
                    manufacturing, logistics and warehouse businesses. Goldzone could not reasonably
                    compare the Suntec City premises with the Building in an industrial park, as, to
                    begin with, it was seeking a much larger space for a quarter to a third the cost
                    in rent per square foot. On the issue of cost alone, the comparison was
                    illogical. In any event, from an e-mail from Ms Lim to Andrew John Harrison
                    (“Mr Harrison”), chief executive officer of Goldzone, it was
                    clear that Goldzone was aware that the frontage was not “<em>great</em>” but, despite this awareness, proceeded to
                    enter into the multiple Agreements to lease large spaces from
                Creative.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     After accepting tenancies for units #01-04 and
                    #01-05; and #05-04 and #05-05; and entering into possession thereof, Goldzone
                    was still looking for more space and signed the tenancy for units #01-06/07/08
                    and #02-06. Goldzone was well aware of the general condition and state of the
                    Building when each of the Agreements was signed. In fact, contemporaneous
                    documents do not evidence any protest, dissatisfaction or disappointment on
                    Goldzone’s part in relation to the lack of progress of the renovation
                    works for the general premises and the common areas until early 2008, by which
                    time all three Agreements had been entered into.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Goldzone was in a position to gauge the
                    progress of the renovation works from August 2007 until the end of November 2007
                    when the third Agreement for units #01-06/07/08 and #02-06 was signed (the
                    largest space leased), but it chose to enter into the Agreements without any
                    protest or sign of progress in relation to the renovation works. The reasonable
                    conclusion to be drawn from Goldzone’s behaviour was that it was aware of
                    the general conditions and surroundings of the Building but chose to enter into
                    one tenancy after another despite the <em>apparent</em>
                    significant deviation from its own “requirements”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Goldzone’s evolving plans</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Goldzone argued that “<em>its requirements for the kind of building, estimated space
                        requirements and surroundings were all made known to
                    Creative</em>”. In support of this contention, Goldzone made much
                    of the fact that its development plan was made available to and read by
                    Creative’s representatives. However, the specifications set out in the
                    development plan were significantly different from Goldzone’s expressed
                    needs in the course of negotiations. In contrast to the requirements in the
                    development plan of 15,000 to 25,000 sq ft for a monthly rental of
                    $50,000 to $150,000 in a central location, Goldzone was actually seeking
                    50,000 sq ft in an industrial park in Jurong. Documentary evidence
                    indicated that Goldzone’s plans, not least in relation to space
                    requirements, were clearly in flux both prior to and after leasing units in the
                    Building. Creative could not have had an “<em>abundantly
                        clear</em>” picture of Goldzone’s needs as they underwent
                    considerable change in the course of negotiations.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Nature and scope of Goldzone’s relationship with
                Creative</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Goldzone’s counsel in his opening
                    statement cautioned the court that “<em>the very essence
                        of the Plaintiffs</em> [<em>sic</em>] <em>case would be lost if one was just to approach this case as a
                        straight forward Landlord Tenant relationship and
                    dispute</em>”. Goldzone argued that it was looking for
                        “<em>a landlord partner</em>” or an
                        “<em>aligned landlord</em>” to enter into
                    a successful collaboration to create a leadership centre which was not just for
                    everyone but for the very high end of business leaders. Commercial reality,
                    inconsistency between Goldzone’s witnesses and contemporaneous evidence
                    stood against this proposition. Creative had not agreed to any partnership much
                    less made any financial commitment thereto. Ms Lim’s expectation of a
                    $15m to $50m expenditure by Creative on upgrading the Building without any
                    agreement, solely on the basis of the notion of collaboration, stood starkly
                    against commercial norms. No evidence was adduced by Goldzone to satisfy me of
                    the existence of any such “collaboration”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Alleged misrepresentations</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Goldzone maintained that eight
                    misrepresentations were made by Mr Chan at the introductory meeting held on
                    10 August 2007. Goldzone claimed that those alleged misrepresentations
                    induced them to enter into the Agreements. Alternatively, Goldzone also claimed
                    that those misrepresentations collectively formed the terms of an alleged oral
                    collateral contract. I considered the representations identified by Goldzone
                    within the context of the tort of deceit prior to my analysis of the existence
                    of an oral collateral contract.</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Tort of deceit</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Goldzone sought rescission of the Agreements
                    and damages for misrepresentation under the tort of deceit. The elements
                    necessary to ground an action in deceit were set out in <em>Panatron Pte Ltd v Lee Cheow Lee</em> [2001] 2 SLR(R) 435
                        (“<em>Panatron</em>”) at [14]. Each representation alleged by Goldzone
                    was tested against the following elements:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_a"></a>(a)     The representation had to be one of
                        fact made by words or conduct.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_b"></a>(b)     The representation must have been made with the intention
                        that it was acted upon by Goldzone or by a class of persons which included
                        Goldzone.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_c"></a>(c)     Goldzone must have acted upon the false statement.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_d"></a>(d)     Goldzone must have suffered damage by
                        doing so; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_e"></a>(e)     The representation must have been made with knowledge that it was false,
                        either made wilfully or in the absence of any genuine belief that it was
                        true.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     It is trite law that to constitute a
                    representation at law a statement must relate to a matter of fact, present or
                    past as distinct from a statement of opinion, or of intention or law. Goldzone
                    could only have characterised the alleged representations as being statements of
                    fact rather than a statement of opinion or of intention if evidence was adduced
                    to show that Mr Chan did not honestly have the intention/opinions he
                    conveyed to Goldzone.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Goldzone’s witnesses, under cross
                    examination and in their affidavits of evidence-in-chief, never called
                    Mr Chan a fraudster. In fact, when presented with the opportunity,
                    Ms Lim remarked (under cross-examination on 4 October 2010):</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">With the benefit of hindsight, Ms Lim, are you
                            now saying that Mr Chan was dishonest to you on the
                                10<sup>th</sup><sup> </sup>of
                            August 2007?</span></p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     In the absence of the crucial ingredient of
                    fraud or dishonesty, the alleged representations relating to upgrading, the
                    hotel accommodation, the loading bay and the restaurant were not representations
                    of fact. As such, they were <em>not</em> actionable for
                    failing to satisfy the first element set out in <em>Panatron</em>. In any event, I examined each representation against
                    the evidence adduced by both parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Upgrading representation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     In Mr Chan’s affidavit of
                    evidence-in-chief as well as under cross-examination, he conceded that general
                    plans to upgrade and renovate the Building were discussed as a possibility but
                        “<em>no specifics were mentioned</em>”.
                    While upgrading plans including koi ponds, rooftop gardens and greenery were
                    discussed as possibilities, no conclusive representation was made and no
                    agreement was concluded. Ms Lim herself was unable to say what plans she
                    understood Creative to have had and she conceded to having “<em>no clue</em>” of what they would cost. No evidence was
                    adduced of any effort made by either party to contractually incorporate those
                    discussions. Secondly, in an e-mail from Ms Lim to Goldzone’s
                    Mr Harrison and Ms Anjou MacPherson, a consultant of Goldzone,
                    Ms Lim clearly indicated: “<em>renovation is just a
                        discussion</em>”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     In addition to the fact that upgrading plans
                    were merely being <em>discussed</em> by the parties, the
                    non-actionability of the statement is bolstered by the simple fact that the
                    actual content/terms of the “upgrading” plans were uncertain.
                    Goldzone was inconsistent with regard to its expectations of the nature and
                    scope of the upgrading plans. Ms Colley’s expectation was limited to
                    the usual repairs by a landlord and that did not tally with Ms Lim’s
                    and Dr Linsell’s grand expectations. Expectations for upgrading
                    varied significantly from Ms Colley’s disappointment with the
                        “<em>chipped tiles, broken bathroom doors and leaking
                        pipes</em>” to Ms Lim and Dr Linsell’s belief
                    that Creative would do “<em>whatever it takes</em>
                    ”, irrespective of the cost, to make Goldzone’s vision for a luxury
                    leadership centre a reality.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Earlier, I found against Goldzone’s
                    submission that Creative was an “aligned landlord”. As such, in
                    light of the inconsistent evidence from Goldzone’s witnesses, the
                    likelihood of Mr Chan making a representation to undertake to spend up to
                    $50m to upgrade the venue on Goldzone’s first official site visit on
                    10 August 2007 prior to any formal negotiations taking place, defies
                    commercial logic and is remote, to say the very least. I accepted
                    Creative’s submission that Goldzone elevated discussions of mere
                    possibilities to positive representations.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Restaurant representation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Goldzone asserted that Creative was interested
                    in collaborating to manage a restaurant. Mr Chan did not deny that
                    discussions were ongoing on a possible joint collaboration for a restaurant on
                    Level 1 of the Building. Creative raised the possibility of collaboration
                    with a maximum contribution of 20% of the costs. Similar to the upgrading
                    representation, plans for collaboration between Goldzone and Creative in
                    relation to the restaurant remained as discussions or mere possibilities. In an
                    e-mail from Goldzone to Creative, Ms Lim stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... let’s talk seriously about Creative’s involvement and
                        collaboration for the restaurant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... it will be important to confirm if Creative will JV with us on this
                        project. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Please let me know what you need from me to ... <em>confirm
                            Creative’s collaboration ... with us on this project</em>.
                        ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Goldzone was unable to adduce any evidence indicating Creative’s
                        <em>confirmation or agreement</em> to collaborate on
                    the restaurant project.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In any event, as established by <em>Panatron</em> (<a href="#p1_17">[17]</a> <em>supra</em>), to constitute actionable misrepresentation
                    the representee must have acted upon the false statement of the representor.
                    Goldzone was not induced by this representation, even if it was made, as
                    Ms Lim herself indicated, “As time moved on, we didn’t hear
                    back about the joint participation on the project <em>so [we]
                        just went ahead negotiating a straight lease for #01-05 for the
                        restaurant</em>.” [emphasis added]. Goldzone clearly did not
                    rely on this “representation” as it was prepared to enter into the
                    Agreements irrespective of the outcome of the ongoing discussions on the
                    restaurant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Loading bay representation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Goldzone claimed that Mr Chan promised
                    that Creative was planning to convert the loading bay area into a recreational
                    area for its staff and that it could be made available as an extension of the
                    wellness/medi-spa facilities which Goldzone had planned. This claim was
                    unsustainable in the light of Ms Lim’s unequivocal admission in court
                    on 4 October 2010 that Mr Chan did not promise this. Discussions
                    between the parties remained discussions and Creative, where possible, assisted
                    Goldzone in relation to the necessary approvals required for the medi-spa
                    activities planned.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Goldzone concluded negotiations in relation to
                    LO3, units #01-06/07/08 and #02-06 without reaching an agreement on the use of
                    the loading bay. The loading bay was never leased by Goldzone. Goldzone cannot
                    logically argue that the alleged loading bay representation induced them to
                    enter into the third Agreement as it was actually because of the lack of any
                    agreement on the details of the loading bay that Goldzone left it out of LO3,
                    subject to further negotiations. The evidence adduced clarified that Goldzone
                    clearly recognised that the plans for the loading bay remained in the discussion
                    phase.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     From the evidence adduced, the first mention
                    of the medi-spa was in an e-mail dated 18 October 2007 rather than on
                    10 August 2007 as Goldzone had alleged. By this time, the first Agreement
                    had already been entered into. Goldzone also erroneously stated that it was not
                    clearly informed of the planning approvals required to operate a medi-spa. In an
                    e-mail dated 19 October 2007, Creative promptly responded to Goldzone
                    stating that <em>“On the medi-spa for Area C, [units
                        #01-06/07/08] it has to be approved by JTC. ... JTC may requires</em>
                        [<em>sic</em>] <em>Goldzone to justify
                        the Leadership Training with medi-spa activities</em>.”
                    [emphasis added]. Goldzone was informed of the obstacles ahead and sought
                    Creative’s assistance where possible. No evidence has been adduced
                    documenting Goldzone’s application to convert the loading bay into a
                    medi-spa. Neither did Goldzone’s application to JTC Corporation
                    (“JTC”) in respect of units #01-06/07/08 and #02-06 contain any
                    express mention of a medi-spa. Goldzone’s failure to carry out this plan
                    could not be blamed on Creative.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Hotel representation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The possibility of Goldzone converting
                    Level 7 of the Building into a hotel was discussed between the parties but
                    the Agreements executed by Goldzone did not relate to any space on Level 7.
                    Creative informed Goldzone of the planning approvals required from the Urban
                    Redevelopment Authority (“the URA”). Both parties must have
                    appreciated that it was unlikely that the URA would grant planning permission to
                    build a hotel in an industrial park. In any event, applications for planning
                    approval from the URA were never pursued or submitted and no lease for
                    Level 7 was negotiated. I was not satisfied that any reliance on this
                    representation induced Goldzone to enter into the Agreements.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Windows representation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Creative constructed windows on Levels 1
                    and 2 for units #01-06/07/08 and #02-06. As this fact was undisputed, there was
                    no misrepresentation. Goldzone’s claim was that the completion of this
                    construction gave rise to the expectation that the other alleged representations
                    would be honoured as well. However, Creative had begun to obtain quotations and
                    the necessary permits to construct the said windows, <em>prior
                        to</em> Goldzone’s acceptance of the tenancy for units
                    #01-06/07/08 and #02-06. In fact, at the time Creative began planning to build
                    the windows, Goldzone was only considering renting the units on Level 1.
                    Contemporaneous evidence indicated that the completion of the windows was simply
                    a matter of Creative putting into action its intention to have the windows built
                    and was unrelated to any of the other alleged representations.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Glass panels representation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The completion of glass panelling for
                    Levels 1 and 2 was within the contemplation of both parties but it was
                    common ground that the approval of the relevant authorities was required.
                    Creative was unsuccessful in its application to the Fire Safety Board
                    (“the FSB”) for the glass panelling on Goldzone’s side of
                    the Building. Creative received the FSB rejection letter on 8 October 2007
                    and Goldzone’s Ms Lim confirmed receipt of this letter in an e-mail
                    to Mr Yeo on 15 October 2007. While Creative was aware of the FSB
                    rejection prior to the first Agreement being signed on 12 October 2007, the
                    precise date that Ms Lim received the rejection letter was unclear.
                    Goldzone’s argument that they would not have entered into the first
                    Agreement had they known about the FSB rejection did not seem likely, as
                    knowledge of the rejection of the application for glass panelling did not deter
                    Goldzone from entering into the second and third Agreements. In any event, the
                    first Agreement was for temporary space and the glass panelling would not have
                    been built at either unit #01-04 or #01-05 (the units leased under the first
                    Agreement).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Goldzone also argued that Creative dishonestly
                    quoted a significantly smaller cost of $100,000 for the glass panelling despite
                    knowing that the actual cost was much higher, having received quotations for
                    about $400,000. Examination of the contemporaneous documents indicated that
                    Mr Chan did not say that the panelling would cost $100,000. Ms Lim
                    indicated in more than one e-mail that she was aware that the $100,000 quote was
                    merely Creative’s budget and she remarked, “<em>Whether the $100k covers it or not I’m not sure. We’ll have to
                        get their plans and negotiate if its</em> [<em>sic</em>] <em>not enough for the glass
                        panelling</em>.” [emphasis added]. Thus even if one could argue
                    that Creative sought to mislead Goldzone with the proposal of $100,000,
                    Ms Lim clearly did not rely on this sum but rather considered it, as it
                    was, Creative’s budget for the project.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In any event, I accepted Creative’s
                    clarification that the quotation in the region of $400,000 was inaccurate as it
                    was for fire-rated glass of the wrong dimensions and the quotations were not
                    subject to competitive bids. Cost aside, as agreed, Goldzone was supposed to
                    make the necessary applications for the glass panelling and no evidence was
                    adduced of any attempt to gain the requisite approvals. In any event, by
                    15 October 2007, Goldzone was aware of the rejection of the application for
                    glass panelling but nevertheless not only entered into the third tenancy for
                    units #01-06/07/08 and #02-06 but, even after its termination, continued
                    negotiating for more space despite knowledge of the cost and FSB’s
                    rejection of the application for glass panelling.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In its statement of claim, Goldzone stated
                    that the representation made in relation to glass panelling was in essence that,
                    “for a higher rental rate” Creative would install the said glass
                    panelling. However, in a nutshell, Goldzone’s case at trial was that in
                    regard to the glass panelling Creative was <em>dishonest</em> about the FSB rejection letter, the grounds of
                    rejection and the cost rather than about the alleged higher rental rates
                    negotiated. Owing to this deviation, no evidence was adduced to show that higher
                    rental rates were negotiated in reliance on the provision of glass panelling.
                    Creative and Goldzone did <em>discuss</em> glass panelling
                    but based on the evidence before me, I was not satisfied that fraudulent
                    misrepresentation was made out in relation to the FSB rejection letter, the
                    grounds of rejection or the cost of the venture.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Unenforceable Agreements representation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     It was only after the second amendment of its
                    statement of claim that Goldzone alleged that the representations made by
                    Mr Chan constituted an oral collateral contract between the parties and
                    that the actual Agreements entered into were merely Creative’s internal
                    documents. Goldzone’s submission was that Mr Chan gave them the
                    impression that the Agreements were internal documents only executed to ensure
                    that Goldzone did not lose the units they were interested in.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     In the process of negotiating the letters of
                    offer, contractual terms such as “<em>accept
                        offer</em>”, “<em>terms of the
                        agreement</em>”, “<em>terms and
                        conditions</em>” were frequently used by both parties; this was
                    consistent with the Agreements being legally binding. In an e-mail dated
                    13 September 2007, Goldzone’s Ms Lim stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As I mentioned to you, we [Goldzone] are committed to taking the entire
                        2nd floor at Creative, amounting to 4,875 sqm (plus additional
                        space on the 1st floor). However, we are unable to sign the letter of offer
                        provided by you without going through legal ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We are committing to a tenancy which involves over $12.0M to Creative over
                        the next 6 years and it is important for us [Goldzone] to make sure that our
                        lawyers have an overview of the terms and conditions of [the] lease.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Goldzone must have considered the Agreements to have had legal effect
                    as it paid rent and security deposits in accordance with the terms of the
                    Agreements. Goldzone also proposed significant amendments to the letters of
                    offer which would only have been worthwhile if Goldzone had considered the
                    Agreements to be legally binding.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Goldzone’s claim that it believed that
                    the Agreements had no legal effect stood in direct contrast to the
                    contemporaneous evidence and Goldzone’s own recourse to legal advice. Even
                    if, as Goldzone alleged, Creative represented that the Agreements were
                    “internal documents”, of which no evidence was adduced, Goldzone
                    clearly did not rely on this representation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Alignment of leases representation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Finally, Goldzone claimed that
                    Mr Chan’s representation that the leases could be aligned into one
                    document, induced Goldzone into signing the Agreements. The evidence adduced
                    indicated that after all three Agreements had been signed, Goldzone’s own
                    Ms Lim had requested for the leases to be aligned in January 2008. Firstly,
                    the fact that Ms Lim enquired into the possibility of the alignment of the
                    leases in January 2008 casts doubt on the proposition that Mr Chan had
                    already made such an offer at an earlier date. Secondly, in the absence of any
                    evidence indicating that Mr Chan had made this representation, I found that
                    it did not exist as a pre-contractual representation and was therefore incapable
                    of inducing Goldzone to enter into the Agreements. Furthermore, Creative’s
                    response to Goldzone’s suggestion promptly clarified that alignment of the
                    starting dates of the leases might not be possible due to JTC having approved
                    the existing dates. Contemporaneous evidence indicated that Ms Lim knew
                    that the alignment of leases remained the subject of negotiations.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Goldzone’s act of affirmation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Leaving aside the facts of this dispute, in
                    theory, if fraudulent misrepresentation had been made out, Goldzone would have
                    had the right to decide whether to rescind the Agreements or to affirm the same
                    and sue for damages. The right to rescind is lost by affirmation when the party
                    entitled to rescind unequivocally manifests an intention to affirm. However, no
                    election can be said to have been made unless the misled party is broadly aware
                    of the true facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     On 10 April 2008, Creative received four
                    months’ overdue rental for units #01-04 and #01-05, and a second cheque
                    for fitting out works and debris removal fees from Goldzone. As at 10 April
                    2008 when the overdue payment was made, Goldzone was aware that most of what the
                    alleged representations promised had not been and were not being carried out.
                    Goldzone was notified by e-mail correspondence (on the following listed dates)
                    that plans for upgrading and constructing a hotel facility had not progressed,
                    the glass panelling was not approved (15 October 2007), the loading bay
                    could not be used as a pool/medi-spa (4 March 2008) and unit #01-05 could
                    not be used as a restaurant (20 March 2008).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Even if all the representations alleged
                    constituted actionable misrepresentations, which they did not, Goldzone’s
                    act of payment of overdue rent was arguably an affirmation of the Agreements. A
                    person who is induced by a misrepresentation to take a lease cannot rescind the
                    lease if after discovering the truth he <em>continues to occupy
                        the premises and pays rent</em>. Goldzone had knowledge of the
                    “true facts” in relation to all the alleged representations and,
                    rather than choosing to rescind the Agreements, Goldzone elected to affirm the
                    Agreements by making payment of overdue rent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Crucially, the payment of rent was initially
                    being actively withheld by Goldzone to force Creative into performing its
                    “obligations”; as perceived by Goldzone. Despite discovery of the
                    alleged misrepresentations, Goldzone’s change of heart to resume rent
                    payment, to my mind indicated affirmation of the contract with, in
                    Goldzone’s words, “<em>the intention of moving
                        forward in the longer term</em>”. Accordingly, under these
                    circumstances, the remedy of rescission was unavailable to
                Goldzone.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Did the alleged representations constitute an oral collateral
                contract?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The common law parole evidence rule is
                    codified in ss 93 and 94 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev
                    Ed) stating that evidence cannot be admitted or used to add to, vary or
                    contradict a written instrument. However, s 94(<em>b</em>) allows extrinsic evidence to be adduced of a separate oral
                    agreement as to which the written agreement is silent and which is not
                    inconsistent with its terms.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The terms of the oral collateral contract (the
                    alleged representations), were inconsistent with the express terms of the
                    Agreement. Clause 1.1 expressly stated that Goldzone “<em>shall take over the Demised Premises in ‘as is where
                        is’ condition and be responsible for the maintenance and repair of the
                        Demised Premises</em>”. This clause was plainly inconsistent
                    with any representation alleged by Goldzone in relation to the upgrading of the
                    premises. Furthermore, by way of cl 1.7, terms of the draft tenancy
                    agreement bound Goldzone and, cll 3(5), 3(11), 3(13), 3(25) and 8(1)
                    therein clearly contradicted the slew of representations alleged by
                    Goldzone.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Furthermore, an oral collateral contract,
                    distinct from the principal contract, must satisfy all the usual legal
                    requirements of a contract, including the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_a"></a>(a)     The statement must be promissory in
                        nature or effect rather than representational (<em>Lemon
                            Grass v Peranakan Place Complex Pte Ltd</em> [2002] 2 SLR(R)
                        50 (“<em>Lemon grass</em>”) at
                        [116]–[117]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_b"></a>(b)     Certainty of terms.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_c"></a>(c)     Separate consideration.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_d"></a>(d)     Existence of <em>animus
                            contrahendi</em>, <em>ie</em>, that a
                        statement must be intended to be legally binding (<em>Inntrepreneur Pub Co (GL) v East Crown Ltd</em> [2000]
                        2 Lloyd’s Rep 611 at [614]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Goldzone bore the burden of establishing that
                    both parties intended to create a legally binding contract (<em>Kleinwort Benson Ltd v Malaysia Mining Corp Bhd</em> [1989]
                    1 All ER 785 at [796], applied in the <em>Lemon
                        Grass</em> case at [118]). In its submissions, Goldzone did not
                    establish the requisite elements to constitute an oral contract distinct from
                    the written Agreements entered into. For example, in order to persuade the court
                    that the eight alleged representations were terms capable of constituting an
                    oral collateral contract, Goldzone could have made systematic submissions,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, in regard to the existence of
                        <em>animus contrahendi</em>, the certainty of terms
                    and, <em>crucially</em>, the apparent inconsistency of the
                    “oral contract” with the written Agreements. On the evidence
                    before me, I found that the alleged representations were glaringly inconsistent
                    with the terms of the written Agreements and could not be construed as promises
                    under an oral collateral contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Creative’s counterclaim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Apart from its claim, Goldzone did not raise
                    an independent defence to Creative’s counterclaim which was based on
                    Goldzone’s breach of express contractual provisions in the Agreements.
                    Since Goldzone failed to establish any actionable misrepresentation or the
                    existence of an oral collateral contract, Creative’s counterclaim (which
                    had been made out) therefore succeeded.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     In the result, Goldzone’s claim was
                    dismissed and I gave judgment for Creative in the counterclaim and allowed the
                    liquidated sum of $381,734.35 together with interest thereon at 5.33% per annum
                    from the time the components of that sum became due and payable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     I ordered that damages were to be assessed by
                    the Registrar.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     I also ordered costs against Goldzone in the
                    action, the counterclaim, Summons No 598 of 2010 and Summons No 678 of
                    2010, such costs to be taxed on an indemnity basis as stipulated in
                    cl 3(55)(ii) of the Agreements.</p>
