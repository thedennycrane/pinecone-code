</div> But he was not focused on comparing the wife’s expenses today with her expenses in 2014 on which the maintenance order was based.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 The distinction which the husband sought to draw between the wife’s business and personal expenses was not relevant to the issue of varying the maintenance order. Whether an item of expense was regarded as “business” or “personal”, it would still have to be met by the wife from the resources available to her.

By seeking to exclude all of these as the wife’s “business expenses”, the husband contended that the wife’s expenses were only $297.40 + $112.50 + $637.50 + $647.35 (totalling $1,694.75); moreover, that excluded various items of the children’s expenses that he asked to be dealt with on a cost-sharing basis.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 By incorrectly excluding various expense items, the husband asserted that the wife’s expenses had not increased since 2014.

He turned 55 in March 2022 but did not say what his CPF balance was or how much of it he could withdraw.

</div> But he did not say how much he had already saved.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Accommodation expenses</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The husband argued that as the wife was no longer paying rental (because she had purchased her home), he should no longer be required to pay her maintenance. The husband’s argument was that maintenance could be used towards <span class="font-italic">rental</span> of accommodation, but maintenance could not be used towards the <span class="font-italic">purchase</span> of accommodation (whether directly towards the purchase price, or towards mortgage loan payments).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 That argument was rejected by Debbie Ong J in <span class="font-italic">UEB v UEC</span> [2018] SGHCF 5 at [5]–[10]. Ong J upheld the first instance decision which factored the wife’s monthly housing instalments into the reasonable expenses for determining maintenance. I respectfully agree with Ong J’s reasoning, which I would summarise as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the law on maintenance does not contain any absolute prohibition against the use of maintenance funds to acquire assets (at [6]);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b)  if lump sum maintenance were ordered for a wife which included her need for shelter, food, clothing and other reasonable needs, the wife could use the lump sum maintenance to purchase a flat; the court focuses on what is reasonable and fair (at [6]);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) both money that goes towards rent and money that goes towards a mortgage loan ensure that a wife and child have a roof over their heads; it would not be appropriate for maintenance purposes to make distinctions merely by the way in which property is being held, such as whether a wife lives as a tenant, or owns a property subject to a mortgage: both are accommodation expenses which can be taken into consideration for maintenance purposes (at [7]);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) if, however, a wife has purchased a property (rather than renting one), the court may consider the fact that the wife owns the property and thus has some financial resources in the form of an asset (at [7]);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) it is not inappropriate for the court to consider a wife’s mortgage loan payments, for this reflects her overall financial burdens (at [9]); and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) if the monthly mortgage instalment were higher than the monthly market rental for a particular property, a reasonable sum (which may be lower than the actual mortgage instalment) may be considered as the reasonable accommodation expenses (at [9]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 It would be illogical if monthly maintenance can be used for rental, but not towards the purchase of accommodation, when there is no such restriction on the use of lump sum maintenance. There is nothing preventing the court from regarding mortgage payments as accommodation expenses for the purpose of determining maintenance. Indeed, for the court to do so would be consonant with the principles regarding maintenance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 In assessing maintenance to be paid by a man to his wife or former wife, the court must have regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the financial needs, obligations, and responsibilities which each of the parties to the marriage has or is likely to have in the foreseeable future: section 114 of the Women’s Charter. That would include a wife’s need to pay for accommodation, whether that payment is in the form of rental or mortgage payment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The rationale behind the law imposing a duty on a man to maintain his former wife is to even out any financial inequalities between the spouses, taking into account any economic prejudice suffered by the wife during marriage: <span class="font-italic">Tan Sue-Ann Melissa v Lim Siang Bok Dennis</span> [2004] 3 SLR(R) 376 at [27]. The overarching principle is that of financial preservation: to maintain the wife at a standard that is, to a reasonable extent, commensurate with the standard of living she had enjoyed during the marriage: <span class="font-italic">ATE v ATD and another appeal</span> [2016] SGCA 2 (“<span class="font-italic">ATE</span>”) at [31], citing <span class="font-italic">Foo Ah Yan v Chiam Heng Chow</span> [2012] 2 SLR 506 at [22] and [26].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 If a former wife has ceased to pay rental but instead is making mortgage payments, and there has been no material improvement in her overall financial position merely by her becoming a homeowner, it would run counter to the above objectives to exclude her mortgage payments in reckoning her reasonable expenses: that would place her in a worse position than she had been whilst paying rent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Further, former wives are encouraged to strive towards self-sufficiency. An order for maintenance is not intended to create life-long dependency of the former wife on the former husband (<span class="font-italic">ATE</span> at [31]); it was observed in <span class="font-italic">Quek Lee Tiam v Ho Kim Swee (alias Ho Kian Guan) </span>[1995] SGHC 23 at [22] that the ex-wife in that case:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">is free to live her own life and her time is at her disposal. She has to exert herself, secure a gainful employment, and earn as much as reasonably possible. She should, if able, contribute to preserve her pre-breakdown lifestyle and standard of living and her reasonable contribution will reduce pro tanto the obligations of the husband.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 It would be consistent with the policy of the law to encourage former wives to transition from renting accommodation to owning their own home. When the mortgage loan has been fully paid up, that component of accommodation expenses will fall away. Over time, the former wife’s equity in her home would increase, and consequently her financial position will improve; there is also the prospect of capital appreciation improving her financial position further. At some point, the improvement in the wife’s financial position may justify the court revisiting its earlier order for maintenance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 In the present case, however, the husband did not point to any improvement in the wife’s financial position because of her purchasing her own accommodation. Instead, he was fixated on her <span class="font-italic">income</span> having increased.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The wife used to pay $1,350 a month in rental (which the court considered when it ordered maintenance in 2014). She now pays a slightly lesser sum of $1,240 a month in mortgage payments. The fact that she is paying less per month for her accommodation expenses is to be lauded. The husband did not contend that the difference of $110 a month is a material change justifying rescinding his maintenance towards her; instead, he sought to exclude the $1,240 altogether as a business expense with an element of capital repayment.

</div>
</div> That is a clear misreading of the case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 In <span class="font-italic">BZD</span>, the original maintenance order required the husband to pay the wife (among other things):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) a sum of $6,400 per month comprising $3,500 for her personal expenses, $2,500 for rent, and $400 for maid expenses; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) a sum of $600 per month being maintenance contribution for the children for the period they were with her (at [3]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The wife subsequently purchased two properties. She stayed in one of them and rented out the other (at [4], [16]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 At first instance, the judge allowed in part the husband’s application for the maintenance order to be varied. The judge noted that the wife was no longer paying for rental and a maid, and ordered the rental component of $2,500 per month and the maid component of $400 per month to cease with effect from 1 August 2019. The judge further ordered that the husband’s payment of $3,500 per month for the wife’s personal expenses, and $600 per month as maintenance contribution in relation to the children, would continue up to 1 February 2020 only (at [6]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 The wife <span class="font-italic">did not appeal</span> against the decision as regards rental and maid expenses (at [8]). It is plainly incorrect to say that the Court of Appeal had <span class="font-italic">upheld</span> the High Court’s removal of the rental component when that was not appealed against. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The wife did appeal against the variation of the maintenance order in relation to her personal expenses and the maintenance contribution for the children (at [8]). The Court of Appeal allowed her appeal (at [23]). In so doing, the Court of Appeal found that there was no material change such as to justify the removal of those payments (at [11]–[20]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The Court of Appeal noted that in 2010, the wife had received $935,742 as her share of the division of assets; she had subsequently purchased two properties, but they were heavily mortgaged and the sum of their net values, should they be liquidated, did not constitute a significant increase from the share of assets she had received (at [16]–[17]). The net values of the properties totalled some $1,162,739.24 (without factoring in transaction costs should they be liquidated), which was some $226,997.24 more than the $935,742 she had received. While this was an increase of some 24%, it would have materialised only after nearly ten years.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Far from upholding the first instance decision removing the rental and maid components of maintenance, the Court of Appeal’s conclusion – that there was no material change in circumstances such as to justify the removal of the other two components of maintenance – casts doubt on the first instance decision removing the rental and maid components.

At first instance, the court was satisfied that substantive maintenance was appropriate, in the sum of $300 per month. That was increased on appeal by the High Court to $600 per month. If, as the husband contended, a <span class="font-italic">reduction</span> in maintenance were justified given the increase in the wife’s income (or, more broadly, a material change in circumstances), it does not follow that maintenance should be <span class="font-italic">rescinded</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Importantly, the material change in circumstances alleged in this case related to the wife’s income.

At first instance in 2014, the wife had sought as an <span class="font-italic">alternative</span> to monthly maintenance of $1,000 a lump sum of $84,000 (equivalent to seven years’ worth of monthly payments of $1,000). The court ordered periodic maintenance of $300 per month at first instance (which was increased to $600 per month on appeal). The husband submitted that the wife’s alternative submission of $84,000 a month should be used as the basis to convert periodic maintenance to lump sum maintenance: deducting from $84,000 the cumulative sum of $56,100 he had paid since 2014, the balance of $27,900 would be the appropriate lump sum to replace monthly payments henceforth.

The wife arrived at this sum using a multiplier of 27.55, based on the average of (i) the average life expectancy of a woman in Singapore (86.1 years) and (ii) the usual retirement age of a Singapore worker (63 years), less the wife’s present age of 47 years.

Moreover, applying the formula there resulted in maintenance equivalent to a further 17 years on a straightline basis, whereas here it would be 27.55 years (on top of the husband having already paid maintenance for 8 years since 2014). The same formula was used in <span class="font-italic">Wan Lai Cheng v Quek Seow Kee and another appeal and another matter</span> [2012] 4 SLR 405 at [89]–[91], but that too involved a long marriage (36 years), and applying the formula resulted only in a multiplier of 9 years.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 The <span class="font-italic">Ong Chen Leng</span> formula should not indiscriminately be applied to marriages of any length whatsoever or parties of any financial circumstance whatsoever. The court did not set out a general approach for all future cases; it simply said that “[i]n the circumstances of this case [the approach] seems proper and we make no comment on it.” In <span class="font-italic">VLO v VLP</span><span class="font-italic"> and another appeal</span> [2021] SGHCF 34, the marriage broke down in less than three years (at [1]); an award of maintenance of $700 per month, for a period of only 24 months, was upheld by the High Court (at [5]). Moreover, in appropriate cases the court will only order <span class="font-italic">nominal</span> maintenance, or even <span class="font-italic">no</span> maintenance at all: see <span class="font-italic">ATE</span> (at [35]–[38]). In <span class="font-italic">ATE</span> itself, the Court of Appeal rescinded the order of nominal maintenance that was granted at first instance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Given that the parties here had been involved in recent litigation for over a year (after a break of some seven years since maintenance was ordered in 2014), helping them achieve a clean break appeared attractive. In <span class="font-italic">Lee Puey Hwa v Tay Cheow Seng</span> [1991] 2 SLR(R) 196, the Court of Appeal noted at [9] that “[i]n so far as maintenance of a spouse is concerned, the court’s power to order a lump sum payment, as an alternative to periodical payments, makes it possible for a husband, who has the means to make a lump sum payment, to achieve a clean break, and is clearly a method which should be taken advantage of whenever this is feasible.” </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The court however recognised in the same paragraph that a lump sum payment should not be ordered “if the husband does not have adequate cash or other capital assets which can be readily disposed of, or if the lump sum payment or the disposal of assets will effectively cripple his earning power”. I had no information from which I could decide whether a lump sum payment in the sum suggested by the wife could sensibly be met by the husband.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 I was moreover not persuaded that, in the present case, a multiplier of 27.55 as suggested by the wife was appropriate. Neither was I persuaded that the husband’s figure of $27,900 (representing a multiplier of 3.875) was appropriate. On a straightline basis, that would represent maintenance till the wife was just 51, and the children, 20 and 18.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 The issue of converting periodic maintenance to a lump sum was not raised in the husband’s variation application; it arose in the context of the wife wanting to set off the cost orders I made against maintenance. The husband did not contend that periodic maintenance should be varied to a lump sum because of some material change in circumstances. Given the parties’ positions, converting periodic maintenance to a lump sum might not facilitate a clean break either; instead, it might be a further point of contention. In the circumstances, I simply affirmed the decisions I had made earlier.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66  There was no material change in circumstances since maintenance was ordered in 2014 sufficient to justify a variation of the maintenance order. The husband had not shown that it was no longer fair to expect the <span class="font-italic">status quo</span> to remain. In particular, the increase in the wife’s income since 2014, viewed in the context of the parties’ financial positions as a whole, was not sufficient to justify rescinding (or reducing) the maintenance of $600 a month. The $1,240 a month that she was paying in mortgage instalments (in place of $1,350 a month in rental) was an accommodation expense to be considered in evaluating maintenance. I thus dismissed the husband’s application to vary maintenance. I ordered the wife to pay the husband costs of $12,000 plus disbursements of $2,500. These were global figures for both the present variation application (Summons No 3485 of 2021) as well as the wife’s application in Summons No 2238 of 2021.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Andre Maniam<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Ong Mary and Jasmin Yek (DCMO Law Practice LLC) for the appellant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Low Woon Ming (WM Low &amp; Partners) for the respondent.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="HN-CaseName text-center font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
