The facts were the subject matter of litigation, culminating in the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Re BKR</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[2015] 4 SLR 81 (“<span class="font-italic">BKR</span>”). Mr L is the same person that is referred to by the same abbreviation in <span class="font-italic">BKR</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [21]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 In summary, the Court of Appeal found that the applicant’s mother suffered from a mental impairment. It concluded that she did not have the capacity to make two sets of decisions: (a) the establishment of a trust sometime around 26 October 2010; and (b) the requested transfer of her assets from two banks to a third bank with which the trust was created (<span class="font-italic">BKR </span>at [17]). Both of these sets of decisions were found to have been tainted by the undue influence of some of the applicant’s mother’s relatives. Mr L had advised the applicant’s mother on the establishment of the trust (<span class="font-italic">BKR </span>at [22]–[23]), and had also spoken on behalf of the applicant’s mother in meetings that took place in November 2010 and December 2010 with the banks from which her assets were to be transferred (<span class="font-italic">BKR </span>at [26]–[36]). Mr L also did work for the applicant’s mother in relation to the MCA proceedings in <span class="font-italic">BKR</span>, which were commenced on 18 February 2011, up until 21 November 2014.

The act complained of involved the commencement of disciplinary proceedings against a barrister. The United Kingdom Supreme Court (“UKSC”) concluded as it did in the context of the specific scheme under which the disciplinary proceedings were brought against the barrister, which included a right of appeal; it would have been difficult for a claimant to bring a claim within one year of the commencement of disciplinary proceedings being brought without knowing the outcome.

The mere fact that the Minister’s speech during the second reading of the Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill (Bill No 16 of 2008) mentioned that its purpose was to bring the LPA disciplinary process in line with the general rules on limitation does not mean that all the specifications, powers and requirements under the LA are brought in. The various phrases used by the Minister, such as “bringing into line” could just as easily refer to a general and broad alignment, meaning the application of a six-year time bar, similar to that which applies to most types of civil claims.  Loading, as the applicant does, other matters onto the words of the Minister goes too far, and brings in a whole regime into the LPA for which no reference is made in the express language of the statute. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 The applicant argues that the respondent had failed to point to any authority in support of the proposition that the LA was not in fact incorporated into the limitation provisions of the LPA.

</div> If anything, it is the applicant who needs to substantiate his construction of the provision. The starting point of any exercise in legislative interpretation is always the actual words used. The statutory provisions in the LPA do not at all refer to the LA in any form.  In the absence of such language, the remarks made by the Minister cannot be taken, even at their widest, as importing the LA regime in any way.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 In any event, even if the applicant’s case were taken at its highest, s 24 of the LA would still not apply in the present case. Section 24 of the LA only applies to extend the limitation period if “the person to whom [the right of action] accrued was under a disability”. As pointed out by the respondent, even though the complaint was made by the applicant in respect of Mr L’s conduct while representing his mother, he is not bringing an action on her behalf. The present complaint is brought on the basis of the applicant’s personal right to make a complaint against an errant solicitor (see [33] above). Since the applicant was not under a disability at any time, there is no basis for s 24 of the LA to apply.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Conduct</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The term ‘conduct’ would appear on its own to capture not just a distinct act occurring at a single point in time, but also actions over a span of time. The definition in the <span class="font-italic">New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary</span> (Oxford University Press, 1993) (in sense 7) is:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The action or manner of carrying on a proceeding, business, etc; management, handling …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 That being said, I am not convinced that the term “conduct” should be given an overly broad reading. There should be certainty as far as possible as to where the line should be drawn.

No authority was cited for the proposition that the interpretation given to the term “act” in s 7(5)(a) of the HRA is applicable to the term “conduct” in s 85(4A) of the LPA (see [38] above). More importantly, a closer analysis of the decision in <span class="font-italic">O’Connor</span> shows that it does not stand for the proposition that all of Mr L’s actions done in respect of the trust or MCA proceedings can be construed as a single continuous course of conduct. In <span class="font-italic">O’Connor</span>, the UKSC considered whether disciplinary proceedings instituted against a barrister ought to be construed as a single continuous act, or a series of discrete acts under s 7(5) of the HRA. In adopting the former view, Lord Lloyd-Jones considered that the process of prosecuting disciplinary proceedings “is a single process in which the prosecutor takes many steps” (at [29]). I do not think that any analogy can be drawn between the prosecutorial process considered in <span class="font-italic">O’Connor</span> and the actions allegedly undertaken by Mr L on behalf of the applicant’s mother. A quick perusal of the applicant’s complaint reveals many specific instances of alleged wrongdoing on the part of Mr L.

</div> Seen in this light, the fact that some events occurred after 17 April 2012 does not mean that the six-year time bar is inapplicable in respect of all related incidents.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Here, what must be considered are the specific instances of Mr L’s conduct in relation to the retainer or instructions which he purported to act under and which the complaint takes issue with.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 As mentioned above at [3], the trust was supposedly created on 26 October 2010, though it would seem the documents were only signed sometime in November that year (<span class="font-italic">BKR </span>at [17]).  This was followed by various attempts to transfer the applicant’s mother’s assets to the bank with which the trust was established in November 2010 and December 2010. The relevant conduct as regards the establishment of the trust and the transactions relating to it, would seem to have occurred only in 2010.  The conduct thus falls outside the six-year period specified in s 85(4A) of the LPA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 As for the MCA proceedings, in so far as the dates of such bills or invoices would be a proxy of the conduct of work by Mr L, those bills relating to work done prior to 17 April 2012 would similarly be caught by s 85(4A) of the LPA as well. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 It follows from the above analysis that, in so far as the matters forming the subject of the applicant’s complaint relate to work done by Mr L occurring prior to 17 April 2012 for either the establishment of the trust or the MCA proceedings, leave of court would have had to be sought by the Council under s 85(4C) of the LPA before the complaint could be referred to the Chairman.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left"> (3) Fraud </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Another argument put forward by the applicant was that time had not run out as fraud was involved.

Unconscionable conduct, including the exercise of any undue influence, would seem to be of a different character – while there may indeed be some concealment or surreptitiousness, the gravamen of unconscionability is, unlike fraud, not deceit or deception, but an exploitation of a situation of vulnerability.  While reprehensible, the difference in jurisprudential substance would seem to indicate that a specific reference in statute is required, and that such conduct cannot be squeezed into the term “fraud”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 I am fortified in my conclusion by a case not cited by the parties, <span class="font-italic">Chagos Islanders v </span><span class="font-italic">Attorney General</span> [2003] EWHC 2222 (QB) (“<span class="font-italic">Chagos Islanders</span>”). There, an attempt was made by the claimant to give the term “fraud” as used in the Limitation Act 1980 (c 58) (UK) a broad meaning, covering unconscionable behaviour. As noted in Andrew McGee, Limitation Periods (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 8th Ed, 2018) at para 20.012, this attempt failed:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The court rightly rejected this bold attempt to extend the meaning of fraud in this context, which should be confined to the narrow class of cases where it has already been held to apply.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The applicant’s arguments on this score seem to be of the same nature as in <span class="font-italic">Chagos Islanders</span>, giving an overly broad meaning to the term “fraud”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62   I would also note the possible argument that the term “fraud” in s 85(4A)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the LPA also includes the “fraudulent concealment” exception embodied in s 29(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the LA: see <span class="font-italic">eg</span> <span class="font-italic">Chua Teck Chew Robert v Goh Eng Wah </span>[2009] 4 SLR(R) 716.

The Council was required under s 85(4A) of the LPA to seek leave of court before referring the portions of the complaint relating to matters occurring before 17 April 2012 to the Chairman. To the extent that the Council may have referred matters which were caught by the operation of s 85(4A) of the LPA to the Chairman (and considered subsequently by the RC), the RC did not have the jurisdiction under the LPA to consider them; any decision taken by the RC to direct the dismissal of the complaint or referral back to the Chairman would be <span class="font-italic">ultra vires</span> and void.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Rather, the relevant decision in the present case is that of the Council, which is addressed in the following section.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 I also note that the applicant’s submissions in relation to the RC’s decision appear to take issue with the substantive merits of the decision.

The correspondence sent by the respondent to the applicant was in itself reflective of a decision that had been made.  As pointed out in the further submissions of the respondent, in the letter of 15 May 2018 from the respondent to the applicant, it was conveyed that a referral would be made first to the Council, then by the Council to the Chairman, who would in turn appoint a RC and thereafter, if required, an Inquiry Committee. That letter also noted that information going back beyond six years would be treated as background information. Thereafter, on 23 May 2018, the respondent wrote to the applicant that the decision had been made by the Council to refer the compliant to the Chairman.

First, that the Council did not consider whether leave should be sought under s 85(4C) of the LPA, choosing instead to abide by the RC’s recommendation. Second, that the Council in deciding whether to seek leave failed to take into account relevant considerations.

</div> In my view, only the first line of arguments relate to an instance of illegality. The second line of arguments are more rightly considered as falling under the irrationality claim and are only considered in the following section (see [77]–[86] below).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 The applicant’s arguments hinge primarily on the conclusions of the RC in its 10 July 2018 and the 12 July Letter (see [7] above). I accept that there is ambiguity over whether the Council and the RC had misunderstood the disciplinary framework under the LPA. However, I do not think that they go so far as to show that the Council had not independently considered whether it ought to seek leave under s 85(4C) of the LPA. Indeed, in the letter dated 16 August 2018, the Council provided its reasons for not doing so to the applicant.

</div>
</div> There was no suggestion that the reasons contained therein were false. I therefore find that the applicant’s illegality claim is not made out. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left"> (B) Irrationality</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 I now turn to consider whether the Council’s exercise of its discretion not to seek leave under s 85(4C) of the LPA was irrational.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 The fact that the discretion conferred upon a decision-maker by statute is wide does not mean that it is unlimited. That discretion must be exercised in a way that promotes the policy and objects of the Act under which it is conferred: see <span class="font-italic">Padfield v Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</span> [1968] AC 997 at 1030. A failure to do so may be grounds for courts to intervene in judicial review proceedings on the ground of irrationality, or <span class="font-italic">Wednesbury </span>unreasonableness as it is more commonly known, taking its name from the decision in <span class="font-italic">Associated Provincial Picture Houses Limited v Wednesbury Corporation </span>[1948] 1 KB 223.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 The term <span class="font-italic">Wednesbury </span>unreasonableness encompasses a whole host of conduct. The primary guidance which can be gleaned from the speech of Lord Greene MR (at 229) is that the decision-maker must “exclude from his consideration matters which are irrelevant to what he has to consider”, and must also refrain from “taking into consideration extraneous matters”. The threshold for a finding of <span class="font-italic">Wednesbury </span>unreasonableness is a high one. In<span class="font-italic"> Chng Suan Tze </span>at [119], the Court of Appeal approved Lord Diplock’s formulation of an irrational decision in <span class="font-italic">Council of</span> <span class="font-italic">Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service</span> [1985] AC 374<span class="font-italic"> </span>as one so “outrageous in its defiance of logic or of accepted moral standards that no sensible person who had applied his mind to the question to be decided could have arrived at it.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 The first step in the analysis calls for a consideration of the purpose of disciplinary proceedings under the LPA, and specifically the purpose of s 85(4C), which allows for a complaint to be referred to the Chairman for conduct outside the six-year period. The applicant, citing <span class="font-italic">Deepak Sharma </span>at [63], submits that the purpose for disciplining solicitors is to maintain the high standards and good reputation of the legal profession. This does not appear to be disputed by the respondent, and I agree that this formulation broadly encapsulates the purpose of the disciplinary framework contained in Part VII of the LPA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 Where s 85(4C) of the LPA is concerned (see [40] above), the key observation to be made is that Parliament specifically contemplated a scenario in which a solicitor might, in the appropriate case, be subject to disciplinary proceedings notwithstanding the fact that the conduct complained of took place outside the regular six-year limitation period (assuming the fraud exception does not apply).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 Bearing in mind the general purpose of the disciplinary framework in Part VII of the LPA, and the specific purpose of s 85(4C), the question to be asked is whether the Council, in exercising its discretion not to seek leave, took into account irrelevant considerations or failed to consider relevant considerations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 The Council’s reasons for declining to seek leave under s 85(4C) of the LPA are contained in the 16 August Letter (see [9] above) and can be summarised as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the complaint was made by the applicant in his personal capacity.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, the conduct complained of took place in October 2010, which meant that more than a year was left after the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">BKR </span>for interested persons to make the complaint.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 With respect, I do not think that the fact that the complaint was made by the applicant in his personal capacity is a relevant consideration for the purposes of deciding whether leave should be sought under s 85(4C) of the LPA. As mentioned above at [80], the purpose of the disciplinary framework in Part VII of the LPA is to maintain the high standards and good reputation of the legal profession. The disciplinary process does not serve to vindicate the personal rights of the legal practitioner’s client, which can protected in an ordinary civil proceeding. Seen in this light, the fact that a complaint is filed by a person other than the client of the legal practitioner is an irrelevant consideration as far as the disciplinary process is concerned. If anything, factoring such a consideration into the decision on whether to seek leave would actually detract from the purpose of the disciplinary framework.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 As for the second reason provided by the Council, I am of the view that it fails to take into account other relevant considerations in making its decision. The reasons provided by the Council focus entirely on the applicant’s failure to bring the complaint sooner and appear to have neglected to consider the merits of the complaint entirely. While I agree with the respondent that the length of time which has elapsed since the alleged wrongdoing is a relevant consideration in determining whether leave ought to be sought under s 85(4C) of the LPA, the inquiry cannot end there. To my mind, the purpose of the disciplinary framework requires that the Council take into account all relevant factors in its decision to seek leave, including the seriousness of the alleged wrongdoing and the merits of the complaint. After all, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Law Society of Singapore v Chan Chun Hwee Allan </span>[2018] 4 SLR 859 at [32] recognised that the court would be more inclined to exercise its power to cure a procedural irregularity where the alleged misconduct is serious and/or prolonged. It was therefore incumbent on the Council to factor these other considerations in its decision on whether to seek leave. There was no evidence before the court that the Council did so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 In the circumstances, given the substantial lapses in the Council’s decision-making process on whether leave should be sought under s 85(4C) of the LPA, I am satisfied that its decision can be characterised as unreasonable in the <span class="font-italic">Wednesbury </span>sense. I therefore grant a quashing order against the Council’s decision not to apply for leave to refer the portion of the applicant’s complaint relating to events occurring prior to 17 April 2012 to the Chairman. I also grant a mandatory order directing the Council to perform its duty under the LPA. I note that the applicant sought a mandatory order for the referral of the complaint, but given the ambit of judicial review, which does not usually go into the merits of a decision, the proper course should only be to compel proper consideration of the factors raised at [85] above.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(C) Procedural Impropriety</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 The applicant raised two arguments on the ground of procedural impropriety. The first was that the Council failed to adhere to the statutory procedure in the LPA by submitting to the RC’s direction. This was essentially the same argument made under the head of illegality (see [73]–[76] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 The applicant’s remaining claim in respect of procedural impropriety was based on the Council’s failure to give him an opportunity to be heard in breach of the fundamental rules of natural justice.
