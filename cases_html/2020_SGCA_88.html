The purpose and the guiding philosophy of the Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment Act (Cap 30B, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the Act”) is to facilitate cash flow to downstream players in this industry. The Act achieves this purpose in two principal ways. First, by providing that parties who have done work or supplied goods or services are entitled to payment as of right. Second, by creating an efficient and low cost provisional dispute resolution platform that empowers adjudicators to award adjudication determinations (“ADs” or “AD” in the singular) with temporary finality (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report </span>(16 November 2004) vol 78 at col 1113 (Cedric Foo Chee Keng, then Minister of State for National Development); <span class="font-italic">W Y Steel Construction Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Osko Pte Ltd </span>[2013] 3 SLR 380 (“<span class="font-italic">Osko</span>”) at [18]–[20]; <span class="font-italic">Citiwall Safety Glass Pte Ltd v Mansource Interior Pte Ltd </span>[2015] 1 SLR 797 (“<span class="font-italic">Citiwall</span>”) at [48]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 Against this background and the tight timelines in which payment claims and responses must be filed (see <span class="font-italic">Osko</span> at [24]–[25]), the essence of claims submitted for adjudication would typically lack the comprehensive details as would be expected for claims filed in court or arbitral proceedings given the provisional status of ADs. That being said, the brief nature of payment claims is not a licence to be economical about the truth of the underlying facts. In the haste to proceed with an adjudication to achieve cash flow, a claimant runs the risk that a payment claim and the resultant AD might be infected by fraud if it was filed based on <span class="font-italic">subsequent</span> developments which the claimant is <span class="font-italic">anticipating</span> may happen. Accordingly, if any information contained in the payment claim or any material representation made at the adjudication proceedings in support of the payment claim is not true at the time of its submission, but which the claimant, legitimately or otherwise, anticipates or hopes may develop in the near future, it would not alter the fact that such a payment claim would nonetheless be premised on facts which were untrue at the time of submission.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 We heard and dismissed the appeal on 4 August 2020 with brief oral grounds and stated that we will issue our detailed grounds in due course. This, we do so now. These grounds of decision will examine the applicability of the fraud exception in the context of adjudication proceedings, its breadth and effect on an AD and whether and under what circumstances should a court exercise its discretion to sever the offending parts of an AD infected by fraud.</div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 This was the appellant’s, Facade Solution Pte Ltd, appeal against the decision of the High Court judge (“the Judge”) to set aside an AD made on 15 November 2019 under the Act. The respondent, Mero Asia Pacific Pte Ltd, was the main contractor of a development project (“the Project”). On 3 August 2018, the appellant was engaged by the respondent as a subcontractor to fabricate, deliver and install 864 window panels at the Project site (“the Sub-Contract”).

The Payment Claim was for a total sum of $830,938.73, which substantially comprised payments due to the appellant for the fabrication of 864 window panels and related storage costs. It was not disputed that at the time of the Payment Claim, 489 out of the 864 window panels remained undelivered (“undelivered panels”).

On the Material Fact Requirement, the Judge found three material facts that were discovered after the AD was issued. First, the 169 panels were not in Singapore. Second, the appellant had serious disputes with its supplier regarding the delivery of those panels to Singapore. The disputes caused the appellant to terminate the Fabrication Contract on 13 October 2019. Third, the appellant was encountering significant difficulties negotiating with Rontec for the delivery of those panels to Singapore.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 As regards the Opposite Verdict Requirement, the Judge held that a party was not entitled to payment for fabricated materials if there was a serious dispute with its supplier that rendered the claimant unable to effect delivery if called upon to do so. The Judge observed that the adjudication mechanism should not be abused by contractors who were unable to fulfil their contractual obligations for which they were seeking payment. That, in the Judge’s opinion, amounted to fraud. The Judge held that it was clear that the appellant was in serious disputes with Rontec throughout the course of the adjudication proceedings. The appellant therefore, was in no position to secure delivery of the 169 panels and its fraud was in claiming payment for the panels which it knew it could not deliver.

First, the panels were fabricated and ready to be delivered. Second, it had entered into an agreement with Rontec on 14 November 2019, under which the appellant would pay Rontec RMB1.3m for the delivery of the 169 panels. Third, there were no other buyers for these customised panels and Rontec therefore had no incentive not to deliver them. The appellant claimed that notwithstanding their agreement, Rontec subsequently changed its mind and restarted negotiations on the basis that the settlement sum should cover a dispute that it had with the appellant in relation to another company in China. The appellant further alleged that the respondent had sabotaged its negotiations with Rontec and this prevented the appellant from securing delivery of the 169 panels.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> In the light of the legislative framework under which s 27(6)(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) was introduced into the Act, we first considered whether fraud is an accepted ground under common law for setting aside an AD.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 The Judge held, and we agreed, that fraud is an accepted ground for setting aside an AD under common law. As succinctly enunciated by Denning LJ in <span class="font-italic">Lazarus Estates Ltd v Beasley</span> [1956] 1 QB 702 at 712, no court would allow or assist a person to retain any advantage obtained by fraud since fraud unravels everything:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… No court in this land will allow a person to keep an advantage which he has obtained by fraud. No judgment of a court, no order of a Minister, can be allowed to stand if it has been obtained by fraud. Fraud unravels everything…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 It was also common ground between the parties that fraud is a valid ground for setting aside ADs. In <span class="font-italic">Mansource Interior Pte Ltd v Citiwall Safety Glass Pte Ltd</span> [2014] 3 SLR 264, the appellant applied to set aside the AD on, among others, the ground that the respondent had misrepresented the value of its claim in its adjudication application and therefore, its claim was made fraudulently or in bad faith (at [30]). Tan Siong Thye JC (as he then was) held that the court should not be prevented from intervening if it was later discovered that an AD was made as a result of fraudulent misrepresentations (at [31]). In that case, the appellant failed to establish that the respondent had made fraudulent misrepresentations in its adjudication application (at [32]). On appeal, this court in <span class="font-italic">Citiwall </span>confirmed and explained that the power to set aside an AD is a common law power that is derived from the High Court’s supervisory jurisdiction “to review the proceedings and decisions of inferior courts and tribunals or other public bodies discharging public functions” (at [41]–[42] and [47]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 In <span class="font-italic">OGSP Engineering Pte Ltd v Comfort Management Pte Ltd</span> [2018] 3 SLR 1031, the issue of setting aside an AD on the ground of fraud was again before Tan Siong Thye J. In that case, the respondent applied to set aside the AD on the basis that there was a fraudulent conspiracy involving the appellant which resulted in the appellant presenting inflated invoices for work done. Tan J held that where an AD was obtained by fraud that did not pertain to the adjudicator, it may be set aside as the court would not allow its processes to be used to facilitate fraud (at [36]–[37]) although on the facts in that case, the respondent failed to establish the alleged fraud (at [38]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 In Australia, fraud is also an established ground for setting aside an AD. As Hodgson JA enunciated in <span class="font-italic">Brodyn Pty Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> (trading as Time Cost and Quality) v Davenport and another </span>[2004] NSWCA 394 at [60]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If the determination is induced by fraud of the claimant in which the adjudicator is not involved, then I am inclined to think that the determination is not void but voidable; and it is <span class="font-italic">liable to be set aside by proceedings of the kind appropriate to judgments obtained by fraud</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Emphasis added in italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Hodgson JA’s pronouncement was affirmed by the New South Wales Supreme Court in <span class="font-italic">QC Communications</span> ([11] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>). In <span class="font-italic">QC Communications</span>, the Supreme Court set aside the AD on the ground of fraud, as there was evidence that the respondent had relied on invoices that it knew were fraudulent since the invoices included claims that the respondent had not performed (at [33]). The Supreme Court found the fraud to be sufficiently significant and widespread such that it had a substantial effect on the AD and thus set aside the whole determination (at [36]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 To borrow the words of Kourakis J (as he then was) in the Supreme Court of South Australia’s decision of <span class="font-italic">Clone Pty Ltd v Players Pty Ltd (in liq</span><span class="font-italic">uidation receivers appointed) and others</span> [2012] SASC 12 at [97], “there is little or no public interest in allowing a litigant who has cheated justice to retain the fruits of his or her fraud”. The court’s overriding constitutional remit and objective is to promote, dispense and achieve justice between the parties and uphold public confidence in the administration of justice (see <span class="font-italic">Su Sh-Hsyu v Wee Yue Chew </span>[2007] 3 SLR(R) 673 at [36] and [76]). Accordingly, the court will not allow its processes to be used to facilitate fraud and has the power to set aside an AD that had been procured by fraud. Having considered the relevant case law on this issue, we have refined the following two-step test to be applied in setting aside an AD on the ground of fraud.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The two-step test in setting aside an AD on the ground of fraud</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Step 1: The AD must be based on facts which the party seeking the claim knew or ought reasonably to have known were untrue</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The hallmark of fraud is dishonesty (see <span class="font-italic">United Overseas Bank Ltd v Bebe bte Mohammad </span>[2006] 4 SLR(R) 884 at [34]). The classic exposition of fraud was enunciated by Lord Herschell in <span class="font-italic">Derry v Peek </span>(1889) 14 App Cas 337 at 371:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[F]raud is proved when it is shewn that a false representation has been made (1) knowingly, or (2) without belief in its truth, or (3) recklessly, careless whether it be true or false …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 This exposition has been endorsed by the Singapore courts on numerous occasions (see for example,<span class="font-italic"> Panatron Pte Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> and another v Lee Cheow Lee and another </span>[2001] 2 SLR(R) 435 at [13]; <span class="font-italic">Wishing Star Ltd v Jurong Town Corp </span>[2008] 2 SLR(R) 909 at [16] and <span class="font-italic">Wee Chiaw Sek Anna v Ng Li-Ann Genevieve </span><span class="font-italic">(sole executrix of the estate of Ng Hock Seng, deceased) and another </span>[2013] 3 SLR 801 at [35]; and <span class="font-italic">Ser Kim Koi v GTMS Construction Pte Ltd </span>[2016] 3 SLR 51 at [38]–[40]). This fraud exception unravels the temporal finality of ADs by allowing the court to set them aside. A party seeking to set aside an AD (“the innocent party”) must first establish that it was based on facts which the party seeking the claim (“the claimant”) knew or ought reasonably to have known were untrue. This objective test of knowledge would encompass constructive knowledge and would apply to every stage of the adjudication proceedings. Although the distinction between actual and constructive knowledge may in theory and practice be difficult to draw, it is important to recognise that constructive knowledge is not directed at what the claimant actually knew, but whether a reasonable person in the claimant’s position would have known of the facts alleged to be false (see <span class="font-italic">Quoine Pte Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> v B2C2 Ltd </span>[2020] 2 SLR 20<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [105] and [108]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 In seeking to set aside an AD, the innocent party would have to establish:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the facts which were relied on by the adjudicator in arriving at the AD;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) that those facts were false;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) that the claimant either knew or ought reasonably to have known them to be false (see [29] above); and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) that the innocent party did not in fact, <span class="font-italic">subjectively</span> know or have <span class="font-italic">actual</span> knowledge of the true position throughout the adjudication proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Our reason for restricting the requirement at [30(d)] to subjective or actual knowledge is to preclude a claimant, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the fraudulent party, from asserting that the innocent party could have discovered the true position and therefore <span class="font-italic">ought</span> to have known of the facts. In other words, there is no requirement on the innocent party to show that the evidence of fraud could not have been obtained or discovered with reasonable diligence during the adjudication proceedings. The UK Supreme Court in <span class="font-italic">Takhar v Gracefield</span><span class="font-italic"> Developments Ltd and others</span> [2019] 2 WLR 984 (“<span class="font-italic">Takhar v Gracefield</span>”) addressed this issue, albeit in relation to setting aside fraudulently obtained judgments. In that case, the appellant transferred properties to the respondents. The appellant sought to set aside the transfers on grounds of undue influence or unconscionable conduct. This was rejected by the trial judge on the basis of a written profit sharing agreement between the parties, whereby the properties were to be renovated and sold with the profits split between the parties pursuant to an agreed percentage (“the agreement”). After the trial, the appellant obtained expert handwriting evidence which suggested that her signature on the agreement was forged. The appellant then commenced proceedings to set aside the judgment on the ground of fraud. The issue on the appeal was whether there was a requirement for her to show that the expert evidence could not have been obtained with reasonable diligence at the trial. The UK Supreme Court held in the negative, stating that “where it can be shown that a judgment has been obtained by fraud, and where no allegation of fraud had been raised at the trial which led to that judgment, a requirement of reasonable diligence should not be imposed on the party seeking to set aside the judgment” (at [54]). The court caveated that it remains open as to whether the court would exercise its discretion to set aside a judgment obtained by fraud if the innocent party had deliberately decided not to investigate the possibility of fraud in the first trial even if that had been suspected (at [55]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 The issue as to the relevance of whether the fraud could have been discovered by the innocent party with the exercise of reasonable diligence was also squarely answered in the negative by the High Court of Australia in <span class="font-italic">Clone Pty Ltd v Players Pty Ltd (in Liquidation) (Receivers &amp; Managers Appointed) &amp; Ors </span>[2018] HCA 12 in the context of fraudulently obtained judgments. That case<span class="font-italic"> </span>involved a dispute over a lease agreement between the first respondent and the appellant. The trial judge found in favour of the appellant. After the trial, the Legal Practitioners Conduct Board investigated Mr Griffin’s (who represented the first respondent in its negotiations with the appellant) evidence at the trial. In the course of that investigation, further copies of the lease agreement were found and it was discovered that the appellant’s lawyers had withheld information concerning the provenance of copies of the lease agreement. The first respondent applied to set aside the judgment, which was allowed at first instance. This was ultimately overturned on appeal as the High Court of Australia held that the conduct of the appellant’s lawyers did not amount to fraud (at [52]–[62]). An issue on appeal was whether there was a condition requiring an innocent party to establish that reasonable diligence was exercised prior to the judgment to discover the fraud. The High Court of Australia held that “[r]easonable diligence was never a requirement of an original action based upon fraud to set aside a judgment” (at [64]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Where it is established that an AD is infected by fraud, it is neither material nor relevant to inquire as to whether the innocent party could have discovered the truth by the exercise of reasonable diligence. A fraudulent party cannot be allowed to claim that he could have been caught had reasonable diligence been exercised, but because he was not caught, he should be allowed to get away with it. Such a view would bring the administration of justice into disrepute and it would be unprincipled to hold in effect that there is no sanction on the fraudulent party because he could have been found out earlier. Parties dealing with the court, and in the same vein, with the adjudicator in the adjudication of their disputes under the Act are expected to act with utmost probity.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Step 2: Whether the facts in question were material to the issuance of the AD</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Second, the innocent party has to establish that the facts in question were material to the issuance of the AD. We found force in the English Court of Appeal’s pronouncement of materiality in relation to setting aside judgments on the ground of fraud in <span class="font-italic">Royal Bank of Scotland plc v Highland Financial Partners </span><span class="font-italic">LP and others </span>[2013] 1 CLC 596 at 630 (“<span class="font-italic">RBS v Highland</span>”) (re-affirmed in <span class="font-italic">Takhar v Gracefield </span>at [56]–[57]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">‘Material’ means that the fresh evidence that is adduced after the first judgment has been given is such that it demonstrates that the previous relevant evidence, action, statement or concealment <span class="font-italic">was an operative cause of the court’s decision to give judgment in the way it did</span>. Put another way, it must be shown that the fresh evidence would have entirely changed the way in which the first court approached and came to its decision. Thus the relevant conscious and deliberate dishonesty must be <span class="font-italic">causative</span> of the impugned judgment being obtained in the terms it was … [T]he question of materiality of fresh evidence <span class="font-italic">is to be assessed by reference to its impact on the evidence supporting the original decision</span>, not by reference to its impact on what decision might be made if the claim were to be retried on honest evidence.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Emphasis added in italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 We were persuaded that the above pronouncement equally applies to setting aside ADs on the ground of fraud. Materiality is established if there is a real prospect that had the adjudicator known the truth, the outcome of the determination <span class="font-italic">might</span> have been different. In other words, the facts must have been an <span class="font-italic">operative cause</span> in the issuance of the AD. It matters not what the claimant did or did not think was material at the relevant time. What matters is that the court is satisfied that the false facts were <span class="font-italic">material </span>to the making of the original order based on the reasoning and arguments at the time the order in question was made. The objective of the Act is to facilitate cash flow in the building and construction industry, by among other methods, creating an intervening process of adjudication, which, although provisional in nature, is final and binding on the parties until their differences are ultimately and conclusively determined (see s 21 of the Act; <span class="font-italic">Osko </span>at [18] and <span class="font-italic">Citiwa</span><span class="font-italic">ll </span>at [48]). The requirement of materiality provides the right balance in promoting the objective of achieving temporal finality in ADs by prescribing the circumstances under which they may be set aside on the ground of fraud. This would ensure that ADs will not be set aside based on mere allegations of fraud. There must be compelling evidence of fraud before the court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 In our judgment, we prefer the materiality requirement established in <span class="font-italic">RBS v Highland</span> over the Opposite Verdict Requirement pronounced in <span class="font-italic">QC Communications</span> (see [11]–[12] above). This is because the latter test would in effect require the supervisory court to consider the merits of the AD and conclude that a different outcome would have ensued. In our view, this would place an unnecessarily high burden on the supervisory court in circumstances where there is no particular interest in upholding orders that were impacted by fraud. As we had previously established in <span class="font-italic">Lee Wee Lick Terence </span><span class="font-italic">(alias Li Weili Terence) v Chua Say Eng (formerly trading as Weng Fatt Construction Engineering) and another appeal </span>[2013] 1 SLR 401, in an action to set aside an AD, the court <span class="font-italic">does not</span> review the merits of the adjudicator’s determination (at [66]). That is not within the supervisory jurisdiction of the court. Rather, the setting aside must be premised on issues relating to jurisdiction, breach of natural justice, non-compliance with the provisions of the Act (including those as stated under s 27(6) of the Act) or in this case, fraud.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 This is consistent with the position that we had taken in<span class="font-italic"> L W Infrastructure Pte Ltd v Lim Chin San Contractors Pte Ltd and another appeal </span>[2013] 1 SLR 125 in relation to setting aside arbitral awards on the ground of breach of natural justice where we held that the test for materiality should be whether it “could reasonably” rather than “would necessarily” have led to a difference in the arbitrator’s deliberations (at [54]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">To say that the court must be satisfied that a different result would definitely ensue before prejudice can be said to have been demonstrated would be incorrect in principle because it would require the court to put itself in the position of the arbitrator and to consider the merits of the issue with the benefit of materials that had not in the event been placed before the arbitrator. Seen in this light, it becomes evident that the real inquiry is whether the breach of natural justice was merely technical and inconsequential or whether as a result of the breach, the arbitrator was denied the benefit of arguments or evidence that had a real as opposed to a fanciful chance of making a difference to his deliberations. Put another way, the issue is whether the material <span class="font-italic">could reasonably</span> have made a difference to the arbitrator; rather than whether it <span class="font-italic">would necessarily</span> have done so. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 In conclusion, the burden of establishing all the components necessary to set aside an AD falls on the innocent party. An AD obtained by fraud should be <span class="font-italic">voidable</span> at the instance of the innocent party. It is after all, for the innocent party to decide whether or not it wishes to abide by the AD even if it was procured by fraud. Applying this test to the facts of the case, we affirmed the Judge’s decision to set aside the AD on the ground of fraud as explained below.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the Judge erred in setting aside the AD on the ground of fraud</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Step 1: Whether the AD was based on facts which the appellant knew or ought to have known were untrue</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 We found that the appellant had fraudulently represented that it had control over <span class="font-italic">al</span><span class="font-italic">l</span> the undelivered panels.

Notably, in the appellant’s AD Submissions, it claimed that it “has completed all the supply works” and that some materials were “stored at [its] warehouse and some [were] stored at the [respondent’s] warehouse” (see [7] above). There was no mention that some of the undelivered panels were being stored at Rontec’s warehouse in China. The appellant’s AD Submissions at [29] stated as follows:

The fact that some of the undelivered panels were stored in China did not necessarily mean that the appellant had no control over these panels.

Even after the AD, the appellant kept up its appearance that it had control and could deliver all the undelivered panels. Since 19 November 2019, the respondent had been attempting to pay the Adjudicated Sum in exchange for the undelivered panels. The appellant however, not only ignored the respondent’s proposal, but also made no mention of its inability to secure the delivery of the 169 panels from Rontec, and instead proceeded to suspend works on the Project. We now know the reason for the appellant’s failure to respond to the respondent’s eminently fair proposal to pay the Adjudicated Sum in exchange for all the undelivered panels. It was simply because the appellant knew that it could not do so as it did not have possession or control over the 169 panels. The appellant then claimed for storage costs for the undelivered panels in its “Singapore warehouse” at $15,000 per month under the November Storage Claim when it <span class="font-italic">knew</span> for a fact that the 169 panels were still in Rontec’s possession in China (see [8] above).

The evidence clearly suggested otherwise. First, the appellant claimed that it had an agreement with Rontec on 14 November 2019, after amicable negotiations, for the delivery of the 169 panels. In support of its submission, the appellant referred to WeChat records and transcript of telephone conversations of negotiations with Rontec, produced earlier drafts of the alleged agreement, and photos of persons signing indecipherable papers, but <span class="font-italic">not the actual signed agreement</span>.

</div> Be that as it may, the indisputable fact remained that Rontec had, in its dispute with the appellant, withheld delivery of the 169 panels. Further, the nature of the dispute between Rontec and the appellant was not merely commercial in nature, but involved serious allegations of bribery against the appellant. A representative of Rontec alleged that the appellant’s sole director and shareholder had offered bribes to the top management personnel of Rontec, and was being investigated by the public authorities in China.

In our view, it did not matter whether the appellant genuinely believed that it would eventually secure delivery of the panels. Neither was it relevant to examine the nature of the dispute with Rontec to determine whose fault led to the non-delivery. These inquiries ultimately could not alter the undeniable fact that the appellant’s Payment Claim was filed on the false representation that it was able to deliver <span class="font-italic">all</span> the undelivered panels despite knowing that it was not in control of 169 of them.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The respondent was unaware that the appellant had no control over the 169 panels</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 We next considered whether the respondent had actual knowledge of the true position, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that the appellant had no control over the 169 panels during the adjudication proceedings.

This was contrary to parliament’s intention and was the precise problem that the Act sought to address (at [31]–[32]).

Parliament’s intention to facilitate cash flow for downstream players in the construction industry was not meant to allow subcontractors to be paid for materials so long as they are fabricated and in existence, regardless of whether actual delivery can take place. This would ironically place the main contractor at the mercy of the subcontractors. The appellant’s fraud in deliberately omitting to disclose that it had no control over the 169 panels was an <span class="font-italic">operative cause</span> of the impugned AD, as the adjudicator had allowed the appellant’s claim on the assumption that it was able to deliver <span class="font-italic">all </span>the undelivered panels.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Appellant’s Subs at [6.2]–[6.3]</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> In <span class="font-italic">Rong Shun</span>, the parties had a dispute in relation to the payment for work done under a subcontract. The applicant commenced adjudication proceedings and in the course of the adjudication, invited the adjudicator to adjudicate upon its claim to recover the retention sum, even though this was not included in the applicant’s payment claim. The adjudicator found for the applicant including its claim for the retention sum. The issue that arose before the High Court was whether the adjudicator had acted in excess of his jurisdiction in allowing the applicant to recover the retention sum. The High Court held that the adjudicator had no jurisdiction to adjudicate upon the retention sum as the applicant had expressly excluded the retention sum from its payment claim (at [103] and [105]–[106]). Consequently, the High Court severed the adjudicator’s determination on the retention sum as it was: (a) textually severable, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, disregarding the adjudicator’s reasons for allowing the claim for the retention sum left the other reasons “grammatical and coherent”; and (b) substantially severable, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the adjudicator’s decision on the retention sum involved separate considerations of fact and law, and the remainder of applicant’s claim could be identified easily and with certainty on both liability and quantum (at [155], [158]–[163]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 In our view, <span class="font-italic">Rong Shun</span> was of no assistance to the appellant’s case. The AD in <span class="font-italic">Rong Shun</span> was set aside for want of jurisdiction which involved considerations that are distinct from those governing the setting aside of ADs on the ground of fraud. This was acknowledged in <span class="font-italic">Rong Shun</span> when the court emphasised that the legal principles enunciated were restricted to setting aside an AD for want of jurisdiction (at [156]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">I have accommodated in these principles only a challenge which succeeds for jurisdictional error.</span> I have not attempted to accommodate a challenge which succeeds on natural justice grounds. There is no doubt that, in a suitable case, a severable part of a determination which is tainted by a breach of natural justice may be set aside without disturbing the remainder. But identifying when that can occur is unnecessary for my decision and is best done when the issue actually arises for decision.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Emphasis added in italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 It was not disputed that the court has the power under the common law to sever an AD in part (see <span class="font-italic">Rong Shun</span> at [157]). This is also recognised under the newly enacted s 27(8)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Act. In situations where an AD was invalidly obtained for want of jurisdiction, the court may well be inclined to sever the impugned portions of the AD if it was textually and substantially severable (see [58] above). This is because the “error” purely relates to the adjudicator acting in excess of the jurisdiction conferred upon him or her. Where the impact of the relief to avoid the consequence of a jurisdictional error may be quantified, the court may exercise its discretion to sever the AD in part so as not to deprive the claimant of the benefit of the entirety of the adjudicator’s decision. This would be consistent with the objective of the Act to facilitate cash flow to downstream players in the building and construction industry.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 In circumstances where an AD was obtained by fraud however, different considerations come into play. The court in exercising its discretion to sever an AD in part has to additionally, take into account the policy consideration of upholding public confidence in the administration of justice and to balance this against the need to facilitate cash flow under the Act. The court will generally not be sympathetic to a claimant who has obtained an AD by fraud, as such a claimant would have engaged in deliberate and dishonest conduct to acquire benefits that it was not entitled to. In that light, fraud unravels all and the starting point is that an AD that was corrupted by fraudulent conduct would be tainted in its entirety, and the whole must fail (see <span class="font-italic">Hip Foong Hong v H Neotia and Company </span>[1918] AC 888 at 894 in relation to judgments obtained by fraud). This serves to discourage claimants from committing fraud in the hope that they would not be caught, and even if caught, that the impugned portion of the AD could simply be severed. In our view, an AD obtained by fraud should only be severed in <span class="font-italic">exceptional </span>circumstances. The factors that the court would take into account would include, the <span class="font-italic">nature</span> of the fraud, the <span class="font-italic">quantum</span> of the claim affected by the fraud and the requirements of textual and substantial severability as enunciated by the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Rong Shun</span> at [155]. Given the court’s disapprobation towards allowing its processes to be used to facilitate fraud, save for extremely limited situations where the fraud was <span class="font-italic">de minimis</span> both in terms of nature and quantum, the court would generally not exercise its discretion to sever the impugned portion of an AD to permit the claimant to retain the balance adjudicated sum. It would only be in exceptional circumstances will the policy consideration of facilitating cash flow under the Act outweigh the need to uphold public confidence in the administration of justice. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 We turn to the Queensland Supreme Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Hansen Yuncken Pty Ltd v Ian James Ericson trading as Flea’s Concreting </span>[2011] QSC 327 (“<span class="font-italic">Hansen Yuncken</span>”) to illustrate what <span class="font-italic">de minimis </span>fraud might possibly mean, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, fraud not sufficiently serious in nature to warrant the court’s sanction against the unaffected portions of an AD. In <span class="font-italic">Hansen Yuncken</span>, the applicant engaged the respondent as the subcontractor for concreting works for the redevelopment of Cairns Airport. The respondent, in its adjudication application, fraudulently inflated his actual labour costs incurred by adding a profit margin and overhead of 12% to his labour rates. The Supreme Court held that the fraud related to a discrete component of the claim and the impact of the fraud had been precisely proved (at [146]). Further, while the fraudulent claimant should be deprived of the benefit of his fraud, to deprive him of the benefit of the entirety of the adjudicator’s decision, where most of his claim is unaffected by the fraud, would be to penalise him (at [150]–[151]). Consequently, the Supreme Court severed the impugned portions of the AD and the applicant paid the amount of the claim less the overcharges for the labour costs (at [152]–[153]). The fraud in that case, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, inflation of labour costs, was not sufficiently serious in nature as it impugned the <span class="font-italic">quantum</span> of the applicant’s claim rather than the <span class="font-italic">entitlement </span>to the claim itself. Nevertheless, as the fraud had impacted approximately <span class="font-italic">half</span> of the applicant’s total claim, we express doubt as to whether we would have severed the impugned portions of the AD were we faced with the same circumstances. This is especially so because the claimant would be entitled to file a fresh payment claim without the false inflation. While this would entail additional costs and expenses and cause delay in the adjudication, we would not be sympathetic to such a claimant since the additional costs and delay would have been entirely self-induced.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 In this case, the appellant’s fraud was in filing its Payment Claim on the representation that it had control over all the undelivered panels. The appellant maintained this misrepresentation throughout the adjudication proceedings even though it knew at the relevant time that it did not, and may not, have eventual control over the 169 panels. The nature of the appellant’s fraud was sufficiently serious in nature as it went towards the appellant’s <span class="font-italic">entitlement</span> to payment for the undelivered panels itself. In addition, the appellant deliberately misled the respondent and the adjudicator into thinking that the appellant could, when called upon to do so, deliver all the undelivered panels and fulfil its Sub-Contract when this was certainly not the case. After the AD, the appellant ignored the respondent’s offer to pay the Adjudicated Sum in exchange for the undelivered panels and continued to allow the respondent to operate on the mistaken impression that it had control over the undelivered panels. This was aggravated by the fact that the appellant had purported to claim for storage costs of <span class="font-italic">all</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>the undelivered panels under the November Storage Claim when it did not have physical possession of or control over the 169 panels. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Further, the 169 panels comprised approximately 20% of the appellant’s total claim and in this regard, it could hardly be said that the fraud in terms of quantum was <span class="font-italic">de minimis</span><span class="font-italic">.</span> Finally, we were also not convinced that the appellant’s claim for the 169 panels could be textually and substantially severed. The appellant had claimed for payment in relation to the supply of all 864 panels including storage costs for <span class="font-italic">all </span>the undelivered panels and this entire claim was allowed by the adjudicator. However, the respondent thus far, has only managed to confirm that the appellant has physical possession of 173 of the undelivered panels.

</ul>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Introduction</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">1<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>The appellant, Facade Solution Pte Ltd, appealed against the decision of the High Court judge (“the Judge”) to set aside an adjudication determination (“AD” or “ADs” in the plural) made on 15 November 2019 under the Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment Act (Cap 30B, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the Act”). This decision examined the applicability of the fraud exception in the context of adjudication proceedings, its breadth and effect on an AD and whether and under what circumstances should a court exercise its discretion to sever the offending parts of an AD infected by fraud.</span></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><strong>Background to the appeal</strong></font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">2<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>The respondent, Mero Asia Pacific Pte Ltd, was the main contractor of a development project (“the Project”). The appellant was engaged by the respondent as a subcontractor to fabricate, deliver and install 864 window panels at the Project site (“the Sub-Contract”). The appellant in turn, engaged a Chinese supplier, known as “Rontec”, to fabricate the window panels for the Project.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">3<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>The dispute involved payments which were payable to the appellant under the Sub-Contract.</span> <span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The appellant commenced adjudication proceedings on the basis that no payment response was served in response to its payment claim (“the Payment Claim”). The Payment Claim was for a total sum of $830,938.73, which substantially comprised payments due to the appellant for the fabrication of 864 window panels and related storage costs. It was not disputed that at the time of the Payment Claim, 489 out of the 864 window panels remained undelivered (“undelivered panels”). </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">4<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>An issue that arose during the adjudication proceedings was whether the appellant was entitled to payment for the undelivered panels that had been fabricated but not delivered. The adjudicator found in the affirmative and also allowed the appellant’s claim for storage costs in relation to the undelivered panels. An Adjudication Determination in the sum of $671,081.01 (“the Adjudicated Sum”) was issued on 15 November 2019 in the appellant’s favour. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">5<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>After the issuance of the AD, it transpired that the appellant had, throughout the adjudication proceedings, faced difficulty in securing delivery of 169 of the undelivered panels (“the 169 panels”) from Rontec. The respondent’s request to deliver the undelivered panels in exchange for the Adjudicated Sum went ignored. On 22 November 2019, Rontec emailed the respondent and introduced itself as the supplier of the window panels for the Project. Rontec informed the respondent that it had withheld the 169 panels in the light of ongoing disputes with the appellant. Rontec then offered to sell those panels directly to the respondent for a sum of S$251,791.59 (RMB1.3m). On 9 December 2019, the respondent applied to set aside the AD on the grounds of fraud and breach of natural justice.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">6<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>The High Court Judge (“the Judge”) set aside the AD on the ground of fraud. The Judge found three material facts that were discovered after the AD was issued. First, the 169 panels were not in Singapore. Second, the appellant had serious disputes with Rontec regarding the delivery of those panels to Singapore. Third, the appellant was encountering significant difficulties negotiating with Rontec for the delivery of those panels to Singapore. The Judge held that it was clear that the appellant was in serious disputes with Rontec throughout the course of the adjudication proceedings. The appellant therefore, was in no position to secure delivery of the 169 panels and its fraud was in claiming payment for the panels which it knew it could not deliver.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">7<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>On appeal, the crux of the appellant’s case was that there was no fraud since it genuinely believed that it had secured the delivery of the 169 panels. This, the appellant claimed, was mainly on the basis of an alleged agreement entered with Rontec on 14 November 2019, under which the appellant would pay Rontec RMB1.3m for the delivery of the 169 panels. The appellant submitted that even if it had disclosed all the material facts in relation to its disputes with Rontec, it would not have changed the outcome of the AD. As against this, the respondent’s case on appeal was that none of the Judge’s findings were plainly wrong or against the weight of the evidence, and therefore, they should not be disturbed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The court’s decision</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">8<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>Fraud was an accepted ground for setting aside an AD. The court would not allow its processes to be used to facilitate fraud and had the power to set aside an AD that had been procured by fraud: at <strong>[22]–[23]</strong> and <strong>[27]</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">9<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>A party seeking to set aside an AD (“the innocent party”) must first establish: (a) the facts which were relied on by the adjudicator in arriving at the AD; (b) that those facts were false; (c) that the party seeking the claim either knew or ought reasonably to have known them to be false. This objective test of knowledge would encompass constructive knowledge and would apply to every stage of the adjudication proceedings; and (d) that the innocent party did not in fact, subjectively know or have actual knowledge of the true position throughout the adjudication proceedings: at <strong>[29]</strong>–<strong>[30]</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">10<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>Second, the innocent party must establish that the facts in question were material to the issuance of the AD. Materiality was established if there was a real prospect that had the adjudicator known the truth, the outcome of the determination might have been different. An AD obtained by fraud should be voidable at the instance of the innocent party: at <strong>[34]–[35] </strong>and <strong>[38]</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">11<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>Where it was established that an AD was infected by fraud, it was neither material nor relevant to inquire as to whether the innocent party could have discovered the truth by the exercise of reasonable diligence: at <strong>[31]</strong> and <strong>[33]</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">12<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>The appellant had fraudulently represented that it had control over all the undelivered panels. Throughout the course of the adjudication proceedings, the appellant represented that it had control over all the undelivered panels and neither disclosed that the 169 panels were in Rontec’s warehouse in China nor its dispute with Rontec. The appellant did not genuinely believe that it had secured delivery of the 169 panels as it had at best, only an in-principle agreement with Rontec for the delivery of the 169 panels and there was a serious dispute between the appellant and Rontec which casted serious doubts on the appellant’s ability to secure delivery of the 169 panels at the time of the adjudication proceedings. Even if the appellant held such a genuine belief, it did not change the fact that the appellant’s Payment Claim was filed on the false representation that it was able to deliver all the undelivered panels despite knowing that it was not in control of 169 of them: at <strong>[39]–[40]</strong> and <strong>[43]</strong>–<strong>[47]</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">13<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>The respondent only became aware that the 169 panels were in Rontec’s possession after it had received an email from Rontec offering to sell the 169 panels directly to the respondent. This was consistent with the respondent’s proposal to pay the Adjudicated Sum to the appellant in exchange for the undelivered panels after the AD: at <strong>[48]</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">14<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>The issue before the adjudicator was whether the appellant was entitled to payment notwithstanding that the undelivered panels had been fabricated but not delivered. The adjudicator held in the affirmative. The appellant’s fraud in deliberately omitting to disclose that it had no control over the 169 panels was an operative cause of the impugned AD, as the adjudicator had allowed the appellant’s claim on the assumption that it was able to deliver all the undelivered panels. Had the adjudicator known the truth, the real inquiry would have been whether the appellant was still entitled to payment for all the undelivered panels notwithstanding that it had no control over the 169 panels. In that light, there was a real prospect that the outcome of the determination might have been different: at <strong>[55]</strong>–<strong>[57]</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">15<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>The court had the power under common law to sever an AD in part. The starting point was that an AD that was corrupted by fraudulent conduct would be tainted in its entirety, and the whole must fail. An AD obtained by fraud should only be severed in exceptional circumstances. The factors that the court would take into account would include, the nature of the fraud, the quantum of the claim affected by the fraud and the requirements of textual and substantial severability. Save for extremely limited situations where the fraud was <em>de minimis</em> both in terms of nature and quantum, the court would generally not exercise its discretion to sever the impugned portion of an AD to permit the claimant to retain the balance adjudicated sum: at <strong>[60]–[61]</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">16<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>The nature of the appellant’s fraud was sufficiently serious in nature as it went towards the appellant’s entitlement to payment for the undelivered panels itself. The appellant deliberately misled the respondent and the adjudicator into thinking that the appellant could, when called upon to do so, deliver all the undelivered panels and fulfil its Sub-Contract when this was certainly not the case. The 169 panels comprised approximately 20% of the appellant’s total claim and was not <em>de minimis</em>. The appellant’s claim could not be textually and substantially severed as it had claimed for payment in relation to the supply of all 864 panels including storage costs for all the undelivered panels and this entire claim was allowed by the adjudicator: at <strong>[63]–[64]</strong>.</span></p>
